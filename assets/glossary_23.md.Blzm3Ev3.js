Whether you are currently battling, recovering from, or anticipating your own turbulent romance, Kate will inspire you to laugh at the absurdity of any dating crisis.The author's voice enlivens the entire book, and keeps readers glued to the pages as they crack up reading it in public. Not only does this book engage its reader to an addictive extent, but it also allows for constant reflection on personal romantic experiences. Kate rivals anyone's bizarre dating history with the most eccentric, endearing, and enlightening anecdotes in print.Friend is a Four-Letter Word belongs in everyone's beach bag, bookcase, and carry-on. Don't begin your summer holiday without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun novel for all to enjoy!","review":"Friend is a Four Letter Word is a wonderfully written romantic comedy. We can all relate to the main character, Kate, and her struggles to find herself after a bad relationship. You cheer Kate on as she struggles to make the right decisions, you are upset at her when she makes a bad one, but all is forgotten when Kate makes a good choice for herself. Kate's obsessions, the people you meet in the novel, and the plot keeps the reader entertained page after page. As you follow Kate on her journey through the novel, you can't help but keep reading. I literally read half the book in one night because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Marva Bush has done a superb job writing a novel that is fun, witty, and one that we can all relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! A true family movie!","review":"This a fresh breath of air in the genre of gay cinema. Too often we are left with cliche movies about the gay \\"scene\\" and we don't see films like this reflecting real life experiences of coming out to family and friends. I can't think of anything I hate or even dislike about this movie. The camera work was superb. The setting was amazing. The actors and actress' brought these characters to life which shows their skill and talent. I was convinced that everyone was who they portrayed. Even the \\"eye candy\\" was shown with grace and style and never overpowered the story or scene. The comedy woven into the story was perfect. As a gay man I would proudly show this to anyone I know even the ones who don't necessarily support the gay community. There is nothing overwhelming in it that I should cause any concern for those wanting to show this to a younger or teenage audience. Can't wait to see more films by this talented crew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring scattered mess.","review":"I only watched this movie because of the above review. I must say this movie was a mess. It dealt with the coming out of two gay brothers...and it did so with the stereotypical gay flamer that I'd hope that was passé. This movie tried so hard to be funny..in the end there was nothing funny about it. There are too many characters e.g. Aunt Luciana, the grandmother, the woman at work...in the end all these characters thrown in for comedic effect fell flat.I can not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, definitely not the worst I've read","review":"The premise is not terribly original, but Delinsky does a good job with it, weaving a realistic tale of a woman who finds herself turned out of her own home without her children. It was the realism of the plot that captured and held my attention. Definitely not an action-packed plot...this roller coaster is an emotional one. This is a book about the punches life can throw, about learning to examine one's own frailties, about growth and maturity. All in all, a pretty satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written and appropriate for the late 1990's","review":"I thought that A WOMAN'S PLACE was very well written and timely. One of Delinsky's few books that did not have a \\"happy\\" ending in the sense of all's well that ends well. Its ending of compromise reflects the compromises that most of us have to make today. Things don't always work out the way we want them to and we don't always do things as well as we would like. The book made me think about the changing roles of women within the family dynamic. The setting, especially the introduction of the lighthouse, was excellent and the story was riveting. The smallest details picked up the nuances of everyday family life and the book was very realistic as well as being a great story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully compelling and powerful","review":"This was the first Delinsky book I'd ever read, but I thought it was absolutely wonderful. The characters were very well developed, the story line was smooth and flawless.

Unfortunately, it was the only book I had with me at the time so I tried to read about 4 chapters of it and it was painful. That was the last Delinsky novel I ever picked up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So real, so touching and disturbing.","review":"Delinsky portrays divorce with accurate detail. The discussions, the turmoil, the different stories and the unfairness of what is accepted in court is amazing. These guardians are horrors, resentful and since they are just people, they have biases, likes and dislikes that have nothing to do with the children. Excellent portrayal of the judicial system and its slow ugly treatment of women in divorce. Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"This book is an abridgement of an (I surmize) 19th century translation of the Zohar, none of which is mentioned in the introduction.

As Chris (singer) said recently, it was rushed. That brings us to Free at Last. At first listen, i was not impressed. Everything i was afraid was going to happen, did happen. There is much more melody and less hardcore. But....i've been listening to it all week now, and it's a great album. I'm usually not into this whole emo-core thing (or whatever you want to call it), but Stretch does their own thing and made an amazing record. I'm sure old stretch fans may be hesitant, but give it a while and you will fall in love with it, just like i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vocals are back. more punk.","review":"Thank God...Chris McLane's vocals are back.

This is the sexiest CD around!","review":"Maybe my parent's generation slipped on some Sinatra to set the mood, but Tom Andersen's ''Far Away Places'' CD should come with a condom. It's that hot. Is there anything steamier than his ''Moonglow'' or dreamier than his ''Let It Be Me''? This is make-out music of the first order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite voice and style.","review":"I learned of Tom Andersen from a blurb about him and his voice in Playbill over a year ago. It claimed he had one of the most beautiful voices around today. That is the full truth. Additionally, his delivery, every nuance of every word, comes from the soul. Where did this guy learn so much feeling in his relatively young life? Even his breathing is musical. His choices are so right, and he never, never sings just to hear his own voice. His voice, the music, and the poetry are all one. Andersen is ecstasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Far' and 'Away' the best songwriting","review":"I agree with everyone else who thinks Tom Andersen has an amazing voice, but I want to say that I also love his original songs. I'm not a sappy guy, but ''I Will Wait for You'' could be the most romantic song I know. It's my girlfriend's favorite cut on this CD, and mine, too. But we also love his story song about the girl who wants to sacrifice her life to see her mother in heaven (''I'll Be There With You''). Truly heartbreaking. And then there's ''You Should Know.'' What a happy fun tune. Bravo to Mr. Andersen. It can't be easy to come up with good songs that sit next to classics like ''Moonglow'' and ''Let It Be Me,'' but he has. I hope someday we get a CD with nothing but all his originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MAN WHO THINKS HE'S A WOMAN","review":"This guy sings so sweetly I presume he played with Barbies while growing up.

This book was almost impossible to get through because the writer seemed so self-absorbed. I found myself getting irritated with her mistreatment of people who legitimately cared about her.

If you wish to slow to a place of simple beauty, reflection and questioning...this will take you there. I love it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentangle at the RFH - back in the day","review":"This CD release is a beefed-up offering of Penangle's November 1968 album of the same title, which featured a lot of live-on-stage material from the Royal Festival Hall concert on 29th June, mixed with studio recordings.The sound quality on the RFH material is fresh and surprisingly crisp, especially the acoustic guitars and vocals.Pentangle combined trad folk with blues (particularly evident here on \`Woman like you' and \`Goodbye Pork Pie Hat') and jazz, with Renbourn's classical interests audible throughout the repertoire. It's a rare combination never really replicated by any other band in quite this way, and they pull off the trick with style. Jacqi MacShee proves she can deliver perfect pitch, unaccompanied, in front of a live audience and set your spine a-tingle.This is a nice, fresh-sounding album with some short, delicate numbers to balance out the jazz-rock groove which this band were so consistently good at. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"the absolute best of Pentangle!!! I haven't found an album of theirs that can begin to measure up. If you know of one publish your own review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection Of Classic Mulligan Pieces","review":"I enjoy sax-heavy jazz in general, and Gerry Mulligan in particular. This piece is a collection, I believe originally issued on cassette tape by Sony, then moved to the new-fangled CD technology. These are all what the late Chuck Niles would call straight-ahead jazz. I think it's a decent introduction to Mulligan, albeit of older and more conservative pieces by comparison to later works.My favorites are Lady Is A Tramp, Demanton (AKA Limehouse Blues), and Makin' Whoopee. Mulligan is complemented in several of the tracks by Bob Brookmeier on the infrequently-seen valve trombone.The only issues I could imagine one might have is that the tune selection seems to lean on Dixieland jazz standards. But they are well executed and this is a very pleasant collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was quirky but the music is impeccable!","review":"I have long been a fan of country music and traditional rhythm and blues. However, I have had very mixed feelings about current trends (I think Faith Hill and Shania Twain are good pop singers). When I saw how this soundtrack was outselling every other country album for the longest time, I knew I had to see what the fuss was about. Needless to say I can now see why!! Every song on here is a classic. I never grow tired of hearing \\"You Are My Sunshine,\\" \\"Keep On The Sunny Side,\\" \\"O Death,\\" and \\"Angel Band,\\" to name a few. I am sure that some may think this music is rather simplistic. However, it is straight from the heart, it is basic and genuine, etc. For me this album will be like that old, comfortable sweater we all have - I can wrap myself up in it any time and feel good. As a side note, I was also glad to see that Patty Loveless' latest album is along much the same lines as this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"As a professional dancer I love this soundtrack. There are a number of songs that warrent chroreography. This soundtrack not only makes me dance, but it also makes me sing. I love the female vocals in songs like \\"I'll Fly Away,\\" \\"Come On Down,\\" and \\"Nobody Left but the Baby.\\" One finds a simplistic sweetness in these songs.

I haven't listened to it since and that's about three months ago. Simply put, without the movie to provide a context, the music itself doesn't sell itself. There are four cuts of 'I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow\\", two by the same artists which goes a long way to proving my point. I haven't seen the movie in a few years and I'm sure there's a logical reason for the song being repeated in the soundtrack that many times, but I can't remember what it is. Sometimes I like roots music with clear acoustic instrumental sounds and soulful voices. But as for an introduction to this type of music for a general listener, this is not the CD to get. It's mostly for the already converted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore anyone that says \\"This is dated\\". . .","review":"Like that's a bad thing. A previous review mentioned that this is, in effect, not like today's music at all. Well, no kidding, and, thank Heavens. There's a reason that all through the movie, they call this an \\"old-timey\\" sound. This album is a cornucopia of southern music -- blues, gospel, bluegrass, and the traditional music that gave birth to modern country music -- and it can't be compared to popular genres of today, because it doesn't fit. If you can't listen to the instrumentation and vocal talent on this disc and enjoy it, at least some of it, you're not really much of a \\"music lover\\".

The music of our parents and grandparents gets the tribute it deserves.On the technical side, this CD is crafted with the same care and attention to detail that was given to the movie. The album notes are informative and entertaining. However, the real surprise comes when you put this CD into your computer.

It doesn't fit the pigeonholed categories (or \\"formats\\") whose dominance has ruined music radio, and demonstrates what a terrible shame and a scandal that situation is.Bob Dylan made a great folk/country album last year, and that the \\"O Brother\\" soundtrack is even better tells you all you need to know.

This is a great introduction for those who aren't familiar with the music of Allison Kraus, Emmylou Harris and Gillian Welch. Krauss' vocals on \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" are stunning.

This fine soundtrack is every bit as good as its companion movie. There's not a bad track on the CD and in fact every track is superb.This CD offers not only great music, but it has helped to expose our rich traditional music styles and artists to persons whose previous listening experience was centered on bland, sound-the-same, music-mill commercial recordings. A recording like this one helps to keep good music alive.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys traditional music, and recommended also to anyone who is looking to discover music that is interesting, significant, substantial, and enduring."},{"rating":"2","title":"other stuff to check out","review":"I am a big fan of roots music.

The album went Top 10 on the pop charts. It was the CMA's Album of the Year. It has focused the spotlight on artists like Ralph Stanley. For that alone, Joel and Ethan Coen have earned my eternal gratitude. Several of my friends have told me how much they've loved this album. I've encouraged them to consider artists like the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Dixie Hummingbirds, Robert Johnson or Mississippi John Hurt, among others. But even if they stop with this collection, this is powerful music from veterans like the Fairfield Four and Ralph Stanley along with artists like Norman Blake, Emmylou Harris and Alison Kraus. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a true soundtrack","review":"For the most part, the music on this CD is terrific. However, it isn't a true soundtrack from the film.To mention one example, \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" in the movie featured a Baptist church choir singing the song, and a terrific job they did. The CD has Alison Krauss instead. Her version is ok, but when I purchase a soundtrack, I expect to hear what I heard in the theatre. I preferred the choir version."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"I was really disappointed in this album, because I really liked the music in the movie. The best track was McClintock's original 1928 version of 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', but I would have been much happier buying a Dr. Demento collection with that on it. The 'Nobody But the Baby' track sung by the sirens seemed better mixed in the movie, which made it more evocative, and that may have been the problem with 'Man of Constant Sorrow' too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like this soundtrack, check out Songcatcher!","review":"If you like the O Brother soundtrack, check out the \\"Songcatcher: Music from & inspired by the motion picture\\" CD. This soundtrack is as good as (if not better than) O brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"As soon as I started watching the movie I knew that I had to have the soundtrack.

This masterpiece belongs in every music lover's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kara's review of cd \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\"","review":"....The movie, a modern take on Homer's The Odyssey, has some of the best music that I have heard in awhile. The songs are from a variety of artists that include Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, The Cox Family and The Soggy Bottom Boys and have a country-bluesy-gospel feel. The guitar rythms are toe-tappin', whether slow or fast, and the high-pitched voices from songs like \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" are clean and clear. This is definitely a cd to buy for those of you into the old-time, REAL country music and even for those who like today's country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Music Soundtrack of a Movie","review":"I LOVED this movie, and I LOVE the music with it. I'm not a big fan or bluegrass or older country music, but this soundtrack kicks my own butt. I liked each song differently. If you loved the movie, you will probably like the soundtrack too. If you're into bluegrass or folk music, you might like it, too. If you're not into it, you still might like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh So Surprising!","review":"First off, let's start with this: I've never been into Bluegrass, and couldn't tell you the difference between blue or green grass to boot.But for days after watching this movie, that Soggy Bottom Boys song was stuck in my head - even though I had no idea what most of the words were. Of course, I had two options, continue to annoy those around me with my mismatched tunes, or pick the album up.The result: whatever the style of this stuff, it's great! I was a bit intrepid at first, wondering if this would be one of those \\"one hit wonder\\" soundtracks, but I've gotta admit htat almost every song is great. Like other have noted, the variety is noteworthy. \\"Down by the river\\" is sort of etherial, and one of my favorites (next to, of course, the keynote \\"Man of sorrow\\".A fun album, worth the risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Country Music","review":"Enjoyed this very much.

I have 20+ year oldordinary black vinyl records that are quieter.Maybe I received the clear vinyl equivalent of a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"And to think that this was album of the year","review":"I absolutely could not stand this cd. I hated it. It sounded like something from a distant time and the music had no emotion. The movie was O.K and the music went with the movie but hearing this on a cd is just worse than a migrane headache. I have absolutely no idea how this beat the other albums for album of the year. The only good stuff on the whole cd is stuff from Allison Krauss who sings pretty nice. Another strange thing about this cd is how something this awkward and outdated can make it so big. Listen before you buy don't go buy it just because it was album of the year to me it tanked. Absolutely not todays sound at all. Everyone in this country has a right to their own opinion and how dare anyone (...) tell somebody they are not a good music lover.

Very tacky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Guess I Disagree","review":"I had very high expectations for this CD, and it didn't come close to living up to any of them. In addition to there being almost a complete lack of emotion coming through the songs, the production on this CD is the worst I've heard in a long long time. Vocals are lost on one track, instruments are buried on the next... This may be an attempt to recreate a 1930's sound, but the music sounds like it's coming through an old AM radio. All that's missing are the pops and crackles associated with vinyl. In this day and age, I'm sure the feel could have been recreated without sacrificing the sound quality. Come to think of it, maybe the bad production contributed to the lack of emotion. In a nutshell, I haven't been this disappointed in a purchase in a long time. If you insist on buying it, try to get a listen to it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"AaaKKK!","review":"The movie was such fun. And I really WANTED to like the CD.

If this spurred a new revival of this clasic music then you should hear this CD over and over. In my opinion it's a little dark. I prefer \\"happy music\\" but the bluegrass on this disc is real, and it conveys feeling and emotion which, in this case, is a little mournful and sad. And for those of us with short attention spans the various artists mixed in this ablum is varied enough to keep us interested. It's a great starting point for any new bluegrass enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"O Brother Where Art Thou?

I had seen the movie first and enjoyed it a lot, and hearin this music when understanding its context made me appreciate its simple yet rugged excellence. truly, the simplest things are the hardest things to pull off, but this soundtrack does a wonderful job. The only problem I have with it is that the movie version of \\"i'll fly away,\\" my favorite song when I watched the movie, has been omitted for a slightly weaker version. However the new version is still pretty darn good, so I won't deduct stars for that, especially considering the fact that most movie soundtracks do a terrible job.

I love it! I especially enjoy the song \\"A Man of Constant Sorrow\\".

I never really liked them, but what I didn't know was that my father was causing this music to become a part of become part of my DNA makeup. I didn't realize this until on a whim I bought and listened to \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\". This soundtrack brings back memories for me. If you're history is similar it will do the same thing for you.Of course, there is more to this album than just a reminder of the folk music I was forced to listen to. The new songs are catchy and the old songs are wonderfully done. With their simple messages they dig into our human collective conscience. They remind us of who we are and who we should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"This book is an absolute waste of paper. The writer admits to never having had enough money to get a kitchen with drawers, I guess that's because she advises you to go out and buy something, preferably a spa product, every time you feel fat. So, fat is the same as sad/down/frustrated, and the one meaningful thing to lift your spirits is getting a new nail polish or face mask. Also, domestic staff is always female, no doubt about that, and should speak the same language you do. I am going to go and hit my head against the wall now.If your only aspiration in life is to spend all your time dusting and wiping down open shelves filled with your fat-frustration-bought face masks and hair treatments (yes, the author recommends open shelves for all your face masks, because they look pretty, and when you're down, you should wipe the shelves, because it calms you down), this book might be right for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only worked once","review":"I bought this iron from ebay.

This being siad the author is great at detailing the intricacies of New York politics. A worthwhile read for anyone who didnt experience the Guliani era first hand(in NY).

Sloan remembers, \\"I recall that both sides of Saginaw Street, the main street of Flint, were lined with hitching posts, and on Saturday night the street was crowded with the horses, wagons, and carriages that brought the farmers into town for their weekly shopping and night out (p. 21).\\" Sloan's influence on the total number of cars on the road in the U.S. is intimidating. He charts the growth of GM from the very beginning and only from reading the memoir can one understand how much experience and knowledge Sloan has of the automobile industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was in great condition","review":"The book arived in timely manner and was in the described condition.

I downloaded this on a free kindle offer, and unlike so many of the freebies, this one held my attention, one I couldn't put down. Aside from a few typos and a couple of formatting issues, the writing was fine.This suspense novel has depth in characters and story. A strong but suffering heroine, Ivy Dunlap doesn't shirk from doing what she thinks is right. While at first glance, it seems like a typical serial killer suspense story, Frasier weaves in some philosophy and interesting facts along the way that take it a step above ordinary.The characterization of Max and Ethan along with the father/son relationship brought tears to my eyes at one point.I'd definitely recommend this read to anyone who likes a page-turner and will read more of this author's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hush Awesome book","review":"This was the first Anna Frasier book I have read.

(I believe the latter.) I won't go into a discussion of \\"A Portrait\\" here because if you are looking at this particular Viking Critical edition, you've already committed yourself to reading it. The value of this edition lies in the critical essays and notes at the end. The notes will help the reader along, as they explain some of the terms and/or conditions that are particular to Joyce's Ireland. The essays are, each and every one, valuable tools. Whether it's an examination of Joyce's life, the creation of \\"A Portrait\\", the influences it would have, etc., every essay is a heavy-weight that enchances an understanding of the book. (At least it did for me.) If you're seriously considering reading \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" this is the edition to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a ponderous, ill-tempered harangue","review":"The first two chapters of this book are very good, but Joyce fumbles the ball irretrievably in the third chapter and the dreary effort results in a painful loss. The third chapter is a boring, over-wrought sermon; the fourth chapter brings more pontification, miserable soul searching, and hackneyed attacks on religion; and, the fifth chapter is garrulous and didactic---an excruciatingly dull and inartistic parade of platitudinous ideas, littered with a pretentious display of Latin. The characters are tiresome, the dialog is tedious, the reading is labored, and the rewards are few and minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I was thoroughly dissapointed with this book. The only reason I read it was because it was required for my AP English class. From its sorted beginning, I knew I was in for one confusing time. Yes, I must admit that it did get better, but not nearly as much as some would like to think. The plot was unclear, and his \\"journey\\" through life is easily dubbed a bore. Stephen Dedalus is on a quest of sorts -- he is growing up, discovering who he is. With that comes adventures. But Joyce never elaborates on the ones that are the most dynamic, and continues on to drone about everything in the same monotone style. Mind you, it's all stream of consciousnes, which makes it even harder to digest. I DO NOT reccomend this book to ANYONE. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because I want to give him credit for fooling everyone into thinking this book has any literary merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hm... it's worse them the worst book that I have ever read","review":"Maybe I am a peaky reader, but the main thing that I expect from a book is to have some sense. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce is a big disappointment for me, because it's very very BORING.I know that I should not say that I dislike a book before I have finished it. But this novel is pretty disorganized; I couldn't resist reading more than some pages. I felt that I had wasted my time with this book, where almost nothing happens. I also had the impression that Stephen is an outsider - who remembers the entire conversation at the Christmas meal (for example) - not the main character. Probably I cannot understand the stream of consciousness technique, because I couldn't read Mrs. Dalloway either.There are too many characters that do not seem to be clearly defined and that discussion about religion - on the First Day of Christmas - was too long for my taste.If all Joyce's novels are as this one, then he lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer reading :(","review":"I hated ALMOST EVERY page of this book.

I had high expectations. It was difficult to get a feel for his writing initially, but I finally got into the rythm of it and it started to flow.The book does not have much action; it is introspection and dialogue and remembrances that all run together. It is unique and exhilirating to read, but is not a page turner as many top-rated books of today are. It reads more like a memoir than a novel, and according to accounts I read, it is a story similar to Joyce's own.I was able to relate to the tension between living a secular versus a religious life.I think for serious readers, this book has to be on the must-read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stand the main character.","review":"I was forced to read this for AP English, along with Dubliners. Joyce wrote this book with himself in mind - the main character's life is almost autobiographical. Therefore I don't want to insult Joyce himself, but the main character's attitudes were absolutely repulsive to me. Cynicism and outright pretentiousness can only take a man so far.That being said, the writing is incredible, as can be expected. My issue with the book is the simply bitter aftertaste this person's attitude left in my mouth. Read it if you don't mind a main character who would refuse to take communion for his own dying mother just because he hates religion. This is not heroic indifference to the society of the time.

This is the same character who later appears in \`Ulysses' (1922) as a matured adult.Joyce walks us through the life of Stephen Dedalus in five stages written in a third-person narrative. Anyone interested in Joyce's intellectual, spiritual and physical journey of life should read this great classic which is the prelude to \`Ulysses', one of the best novels ever written in the 20th centaury.As Ezra Pound correctly predicted \`A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' would \\"remain a permanent part of English literature\\" for centuries similar to the place \`Ulysses' has reached in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"We are introduced to the character Stephen as a young boy as he grows to manhood.

Unless this is suppose to be Joyce's story. The first chapter is gibberish to me and I almost didn't go past it. But I did and it got better.

While it was impeccably written and deeply philosophical, the style chosen to write it in was distracting and caused far too many pauses in reading. It did give me some inspirational insights to methods in which I can add elements of philosophy to my own writing, but overall led me to understand methods of writing that serve to distract and confuse readers.

I lost the point Joyce was trying to make not only because I lost interest, but also because the point is buried under multiple layers of philosophy and symbolism. My conclusion, if you are looking for a book that delves into human development in a highly realistic manner, get THE CATCHER IN THE RYE instead. Not only is CATHCER more enjoyable, you will get the point even if you are only an average reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good to say","review":"I don't have the patience.

When at last I cracked the cover of this book, I was sorely disappointed at the unbearable pretention and lack of plot in this novel.Stephen Daedalus is a callow snob, whose concerns are so otherworldly and obscure that they feed directly into the most ridiculously romantic and shallow stereotypes about artists as unusual gods. It is simply a monument to a young's man's egotism and unerring sense of his own destiny. There is little to learn from all the strange things he obsesses about, his experiences rarely ring true, and there is nothing notable about the writing.This novel is probably coveted in undergraduate lit classes because most of the readers are untested adolescents, who feel they can conquer the world so easily.

I thought it was alright at first, but before you realise it, your man Stephen Dedalus is 16 or something, and then he may be older, but you've no idea when it happened.I enjoyed all the guilt he was feeling at visiting pros, and the five page description of hell (or more), and in the end it was a real shame that I had to stop reading it.

Its poorly written and the plot is comedically stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious disappointment. Badly written.","review":"Page after page I waited for the promised brilliant plot to unravel, for the fast packed action to unfold. I hoped it would get better but my hopes soon dissolved in frustration and anger about having wasted the money for this garbage. The plot consists of a rather dumb conspiracy tale featuring the usual big, mysterious and omnipotent secret agencies which till the last page remain just that -with no further enlightening whatsoever. The protagonists are very roughly hewn and thrown into the already bad enough story as if picked out of an assemble-your-own-book-so-that-you-can-call-yourself-author instruction sheet (take 1 or 2 villains, 1 really really good guy, 1 supersecret private agency which comes to the rescue after the amount of pages is about right...). Sometimes you wonder if the many weapons details come straight out of a copy of gun magazine. Brrr, what a disappointment. My advice (earned the hard way): do not touch this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio 1190 independent book review","review":"The Succession is a fantastic fast paced and intensely sensual novel. de Mesterton's masterful use of language kept the reek of determination and acrid gunpowder under my nose as I read this book in one sitting. With keen pen de Mesterton produces scenes with such descriptive detail that they are not so much read as watched with the minds eye. Much of the story is set in Colorado where the plot twists and turns on itself like Rocky Mountain switchbacks. With an ending to rival an Allistar McLean (Ice Station Zebra, The Guns of Navarrone) spy novel and characters of Ian Fleming caliber, The Succession is for those of us with a thirst for daring and a heart for chivalry. de Mesterton delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"a failed attempt to save grace","review":"Only if you are curious of non-essentials about Ayn Rand and her background, read this book for leisure.If you are a critical thinker or looking for information to further advance your knowledge on Ayn Rand's ideas or Objectivism, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK, it will bring you a lot of pain, because the author spent tremendous efforts and lines asserting unsupported psychological evaluations and judgements on Ayn Rand and events, which only damages the credibility of the book.This book is an attempt to save Brandens' grace after they were denounciated by Ayn Rand as cheaters and liars. The book is a revenge to a dead woman, who had a love affair with the author's first husband for over ten years, but with the author's full consent. Based on the author's own account and contrary to the explanation given in this book, one can see clearly that Ayn Rand was not far from truth in her indictment on Brandens."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of Trash","review":"Ayn Rand was not lonely, she was full of joy. This is a ridiculous assault to anyone with the ability to read and reason. Any person can learn about Rand's life through documents, her works of fiction and non-fiction, countless interviews and personal accounts of friends and aquaintences. Anyone that would read up on her life and her philosophy would discount this book as lies. You do not even need to subscribe to her philosophy or agree with her ideas to see this book is written by someone that has no understanding of Rand's ideas and Philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage In, Garbage Out","review":"This book has been thoroughly refuted in its big points and in its little ones, in its biases and in its facts, in its opinions and in its descriptions, by the brilliant essays of James Valliant and David Hayes. It contradicts itself--it contradicts known facts--it contradicts Mr. Branden's memoir (which is no better)--and it contradicts the evidence from Journals and Letters of Ayn Rand. It is also very poorly written. The movie based on it was still more fictionalization on top of fictionalization. Just ghastly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never saw Rand's husband drunk","review":"Barbara Branden admits to never seeing Frank Occoner drunk.!!!The source of the rumor that Ayn's husband was an alcoholic and who spent thousands of hours with Ayn had never seen the alleged alcoholic drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeding on the host","review":"The author questioned Rand's mental faculty stealthily through the negative.For example Miss Rand took diet pills but did not suffer from mental disorders.Branden drew a correlation between mental disorder and diet pills, which she did notprove. Then she denied the existence of the mental disorder that she wanted thereader to retain. The author has a monstrous approach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reliable biography, as recent new books show.","review":"Branden's book remains the only full-length biography of Rand, although new primary material arranged in chronological order has been published as \\"The Journals of Ayn Rand.\\" Referring to the journals, Rand's own notebooks which she never herself published, the arbitrary nature of Branden's work is clear. As an example, Branden draws dubious psychological conclusions from a photo of Rand as a child in Russia, a photo in which Branden is not even sure who is Rand!Branden's book is more novel than biography, a novel in which the writer's conclusions are clearly motivated by something other than a desire for the truth. Readers should not be duped into thinking that Branden was close to Rand; for the last 14 years of Rand's life she had no contact with Branden, and Branden had no access to important primary materials. Avoid this book, and read the Journals instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smear and exploitation of Ayn Rand (read The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics for the whole story)","review":"This book is a smear job against Ayn Rand so that Barbara Branden can clean up her own tarnished reputation while cashing in on Ayn Rand's fame.James S. Valliant, in his book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics: The Case Against the Brandens, thoroughly dissects the claims made by the Brandens against Ayn Rand. He then references Ayn Rand's own personal journals to systematically demonstrate how Barbara and Nathaniel Branden deceived and exploited Ayn Rand for years for their own illegitimate aims. Even after Ayn Rand's death, the Brandens continue to cash in on Ayn Rand's self-made fame and her original philosophy of Objectivism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dusturbing Book About a Very Disturbed Woman","review":"The author of this book is the sister of Ayn Rand's heir and mouthpiece, Leonard Peikoff. He hasn't spoken to her since she wrote this book. It's all about the sordid love affair between Ayn Rand and Barbara Branden's husband, Nathaniel Branden. He's no prize himself, but Ayn Rand was one of the most bizarre characters ever to surround herself with a quasi-religious cult.This book might help steer some youngsters away from \\"Objectivism.\\" (Ayn Rand is still, perhaps surprisingly, popular among college undergraduates.) Of course, the trashy love affair might just make them curious for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book seems to be objective about the Chief Obectivist","review":"I've read Ayn Rand's works over a period of time. Most of the time I spent with ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD along with some of her essays. I agreed with some things she said and disagreed with others. And to be honest, some of her ideas were beginning to sour on me.I found this book to answer a lot of questions, and to be honest, I understood Ayn Rand better after reading it. It showed her strengths and weaknesses and confirmed both things I appreciated and didn't appreciate about Ayn Rand.I think this book set out very well what it intended to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a contrast to Rand's own books!","review":"I read this book two weeks ago, just after I finished Atlas Shrugged. What a contrast! I'd never before read an entire biography of an author, and it help put many things in perspective about Ayn Rand.She had a fascinating life, but not one I'd want for myself! More important, Branden paints Rand as a woman who did not live in the same reality as everyone else; it was almost as if Rand were stuck trying to life the lives of her exalted characters, but just couldn't quite make it. She resisted compromising her ideals, but gave in far more often than, say, Howard Roark or Francisco D'Anconia--often to her regret. How Rand handled--and then reacted negatively to--the stage and movie versions of her books is evidence of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"school","review":"I'm currently using this book for school, and although the material is a bit useful it is not the easiest to actually understand. I am getting reinforcement through my teacher, but without him I wouldn't have much interest in the books flow. I guess not the strongest book to use for teaching a second language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diluted and of limited use","review":"This book is a preachy, watered down, unacknowledged rip-off of the Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin. Although it predates Hale's book, the Sedona Method course goes back several decades with both Hale and Lester Levenson (whom Jim knew), the technique's originator. The author pontificates at length about all the ways we get hung up in life while offering very little in the way of SPECIFIC instruction for doing anything about it.I give it two stars because the information is not irrelevent, just severely limited. There are a few insights that may be of interest to seasoned releasers. Other authors, like Patricia Carrington, have managed to put their own spin on Sedona Method-like techniques and to make a valuable contribution in the process. Britt just avoids the issue almost entirely.I would very much recommend The Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin over this space holder. Can you tell?

Nietzche happens to be my favorite philosopher so any book by him will be higly praised automatically by me.Perhaps the sole warning about this book I would give to a prospective buyer is this: Ecce Homo is not an objective autobiography. If one is looking for objectivite and exactitude in the description of life events, look elsewhere. This book is not for you. It is more of a psychological autobiography. The author explains who he is, why he is how he is and what makes him so special as well as providing glimpses about what he thought his real legacy would be. In a nutshell, if Nietzsche is already your hero,and you would love to know him more and get a glimpse of what made him tick, then, by all means, rush and buy this book. Otherwise, don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting and Interesting","review":"Life after death is a given, and this book convinced me that there are people whom God has blessed (cursed?) with the ability to communicate with an unseen world. There are probably many with this ability, but there are also, regrettably, many charlatans. In regard to the skeptic who challenges for some great piece of knowledge from the medium, I must say that one of the things, which convinced me of Mr. Andersen's ability, was the very lack of \\"great secrets revealed\\". Mediumship has a reason and a purpose, but I don't believe it's to reveal the secrets of history nor the universe nor to give someone the winning lottery number. I am convinced that Anderson is one of the best, and I only wish I could afford to have a reading.

Joel Martin, former skeptic of spirit communication, documents his gradual conversion through communications received from medium George Anderson. If there is a question to be asked, Joel finds it. There is an excellent account of various tests that were devised for Anderson. In Joel's transcripts of radio broadcasts made by the medium, my only criticism was that sometimes Anderson appeared to be asking too many questions of the callers and thus modified his messages from the response. In spite of these flaws, Anderson proved himself able to give accurate names, places and spontaneous comments totally relevant to the inquirer's needs. Joel Martin's WE DON'T DIE is a classic in the history of parapsychology and psychic research. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting \\"death\\" in perspective","review":"I first came across this book right after the passing of my grandfather. Not expecting much at that point in my life, We Don't Die gave me a sense of relief. Joel Martin's ability to use George Anderson's work as a springboard to comfort is done in a remarkably straightforward way. If you were on the fence as to whether or not there is an afterlife, this book will help make you a believer. The stories that are written about allowed me to have more courage in dealing with my own grief at the time. Of course, my own abilties and thoughts since my intial reading of this book has only confirmed what George shares with us.

I have dozens of Jeff Beck concert DVDs. This is an important documentary of a significant period (Jennifer Batten / Who Else Tour), obviously professionally filmed, but the DVD quality is AWFUL. A previous reviewer commented on the out-of-synch problems that don't get resolved until 21 minutes into the concert. In addition, my original bootleg has more complete intro into the first track, has no synch problems, does not have spelling mistakes in the menu, and probably cost less. The producers of this DVD should be banned from selling at Amazon unless they totally re-edit this product and send replacement DVDs to all who have purchased this DVD. My recommendation......wait for a better version to appear.

The good news its a pretty stellar show ( I saw this tour myself in LA), the bad news is that this is obviously a very official looking bootleg...which is why its probably NOT billed as a Jeff Beck item. The video quality is sub par by today's standards and even broadcast in '99 standards and my experience with Japan is that their productions even in '99 are technically the worlds best. Now the worst news is its terribly OUT OF synch...for a bunch of the show...for some reason in the middle of the 5th track the DVD stops...goes black and when it resumes its IN synch...about 21 minutes into the DVD.So....if you have the good taste to be a fan of the great Jeff Beck...enjoy, but be warned to lower your video and audio expectations.

The people who transfered the original to this should be fired. Don't they view the product for quality issues before they distribute it to the public. Clearly its all about making the quick buck and not concerned about the quality. Obviously they'er not fans of Jeff Beck.

I did notice skipping around that it seemed more in sync later in the show but this sort of product is inexcusable these days - especially when I purchased what I can only deem a bootleg copy a few years back that not only looks cleaner as far as video but is completely in sync from first to last. Since it was being officially released I felt I'd purchase it legitimately to get the artwork, working menus, etc. I too saw this same tour and the performances are excellent - too bad about the flawed production.

This suprises me because his first cd was on point and made me want to purchase this one-or maybe it's just the age difference between us that make me look for more. Each and every song was about some form of sex-rough sex, submissive sex, kinky sex, so forth and so on. I don't have a problem with it unless that's all that you have to offer. To be such a talented young man, this offering was pointless and empty.

This dude can sing and rap on the same song...but he'll make it come together just fine. Yes i must admit he does more rappin on this album than on \\"I Gotta Make It\\" but he switched his style up a little and im diggin it.

There are definately some highlights here, notable are tracks like the single \\"Can't Help But Wait\\" along with \\"Missing You\\" and The Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis produced track \\"We Should Be.\\" Unfortunately, most of this cd leans heavily towards fast food music and not the classic sounds that you hear from his debut cd \\"Just Gotta Make It.\\" For an artist who can really sing, this outing doesn't really showcase his talents as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"Ok when Trey put out his first cd I bought it purely b/c I loved his voice and was so happy that the risk paid off. His first release was good and I became a fan. I'm not sure what the heck happened, but this cd is horrible. I'm only being so critical b/c I seriously was anticipating the release and went and bought it. I felt a lil cheated, but I digress...the cd's production is cool but the lyrics are a disappointment and even Trey's voice doesn't make up for that. All in all I'd say I like 4 Songs1. Role Play2. We Should Be3. Wonder Woman4. Can't Help But WaitAnd I must say the song with R.Kelly is wrong on so many levels. Just a bad song. All in all Trey's beautiful voice couldn't compensate for some of the hot mess on this cd. I hope there is a third album to give him a chance at redemption, but now fans like myself will likely be extra cautious about making that purchase.

I like Grub on which R.Kelly wrote for Trey and Trey is a Huge Kellz fan. it's catchy. but alot of the tracks here don't showcase enough of Trey's voice and for my money Trey isn't getting top of the line Songwriting and Production. thus far early on in his career he hasn't the right songwriters and Producers to take his talent to where it should be. aside from a few decent tracks nothing on here is memorable,but this cat can sing and if given the right material he might have a decent run."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've butchered his songs","review":"Garbage, don't buy. They've chopped up songs and spliced pieces together. For example Fooled Around is about 1/2 the length of the original, they cut the openning riff in half, removed an ENTIRE stanza (if you can believe it). I was very dissapointed. Keep shopping, but don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"As mentioned elsewhere Fooled Around and Fell in Love is chopped up, down to the Top 40 radio station version. I bought this just for this song and was very disappointed. I dont know why they would even put that version on a CD. Wish I would have read the reviews first. As far as anything else on here, I think you'd need to be a die hard Alvin Bishop fan to like much of it. I know some of it will grow on me over time, although its not going to get played much since I bought a different CD with the full length version of the song I wanted.

Your earlier works were fantastic!With that I have to say, however, that with \\"Spin\\", things go off the rails pretty much completely! I honestly could not find one song with a hook or catchy refrain anywhere on this release!This album is - I suppose - jazz pop at it's worst (with bands like Carmel, Weekend and Working Week being jazz pop at it's best). I was warned against this by a friend years ago but I didn't want to believe.I don't mean to be so negative to one of the \\"founding godmothers of indiepop\\", but it must be said: It is far too overproduced and frankly, it broke my heart!... and not in a good way...Stick with \\"The Incredible Anthony Adverse\\". It compiles all of the essetial Anthony Adverse in one convenient (if in BAD need of remastering) place!Such a shame, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Perfect.","review":"I bought this with the Apple Leather Conditioner. My 2Unfold grey leather bag from Hard Graft was really getting covered with scratches and dirt, so i wanted to revive it back to its former glory.I followed the instructions - Use with a soft cloth, wipe in circular motion. Repeat with Leather Conditioner after. I did it with half the bag so that i can compare the before/after effect.End result was fantastic - The Cleaner lessened the visibility of the scratches and brought the leather back to its original, darker color. The Conditioner gave it a shine, and a nice, smooth protective feel.It's been a couple of weeks by now, it feels like the bag is more resistant to scratches.Overall, i am just so glad and relieved it works with my leather bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great product! It really cleans your leather goods without ruining them! Totally necessary for those who own designer shoes and handbags!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what it is, and what it isn't","review":"I bought this one as a pleasure read. (Yes, I know...) I was hoping that this would be an examination of the Biblical text and checking against the archaeological record. It's not. It's primarily an examination of the archaeological record, and the Bible is really only mentioned after you get about 300 pages in and is really just an incidental player in the text. It's relevant to Scriptural studies, but not the book for a beginner. However, despite my disappointment, I read the book all the way through. Despite the fact that I have little background in archaeology, I was impressed by how clear the writing was. Mazar does a fantastic job conveying the development of the area, and discussing how the people lived in each era. If you're more interested in the Bible, this isn't your book. If you're more interested in archaeology, this book is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"tastes great, if you have the stomach","review":"I think this is one os Shakespeare's most underrated plays, probably because of all the uncouth characters. Based on Chaucer's rendition of the story, T and C are Trojan lovers, and she is then traded to the Greeks in exchange for captive soldiers. Aside from this, the women of Troy are wanton and lustful, and the men are prowess driven. If you can deal with this, you will really enjoy Shakespeare's ability to wrap this into all kinds of twists and turns. It delivers a mixture of satire, comedy, romance, tragedy, and a semi-historical (in that people at the time probably believed the Trojan War really happened). Interestingly, this mixture of laughs and tragedy is reminiscent of war novels I have read about Vietnam. The romantic dimensions give this play its edge, and somehow WS manages to make it plausible in spite of all the killing and deceit going on at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"authentic and understandable - a rare gem in the sand","review":"spirituality is hard to expose in the physical word, but it is there and Rabbi Steinzaltz has been able to translate his experience and complex knowledge into a language that is within reach. OK some of the material would be out of reach for the beginner but there is something here for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Heart","review":"The unfolding of the heart of Jewish spirituality, like removing petals from a rose, until the stem remains, a nourishing channel from the powers of life's soil, to be discovered in the sefirot of Yahweh (or, the mystical science of the Kabbalah which lies under the surface of Judiasm like a great anchoring mass under the tip of an iceberg).This is a beautifully written look at thirteen tenants of Jewish spirituality, and how those aspects apply not only on a metaphysical level, but in one's daily life. It is recommended reading for anyone who can appreciate the primal elements of any long-standing philosophy, Jewish or otherwise, or for those who can appreciate literary poeticism. In short, perhaps the rose is the heart, and we only need to remove the petals one by one, to know each, and then to let them go, until only the force of life, viz., God, remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explanations galore!","review":"This is an excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to Christians who are searching for some meaning in life. This book explains what Jesus meant when he said, \\"In my Father's house are many mansions.\\" It also explains what Paul meant by \\"seeing through a glass darkly.\\" Since there is no doubt that both Jesus and Paul were Jewish mystics, it makes sense that explanations for their teachings can be found in Kabbalah! Excellent reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight injustice and get rich!","review":"The injustices are real and well-detailed. Particularly, the long Chapter on the Michael Jackson sitaution of the '90s - the whole depressing subject is handled with clarity and care. Also, those involving Club and Restaurant owners, TV Producers who....just don't get it....and get humiliated above the level of the those who felt *they* were humiliated.Yeah, sue the pants off these bad boys.Allred has a great story to tell, an inspirational and informational treatise for all, though her pro-militant feminist bias bleeds through every line. She had a rotten marriage and sought to turn the tables on any dude who even vaguely resembled him.Allred may have an \\"agenda\\" and may get too personally involved in cases(reference Ambrey Frey) but her overall contribution to American law is noteworthy.Very readable, even funny in parts. Nice collection of photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. Expected Much More","review":"I listened to the 1st third of the CD version of this book and thought it was a waste of time. I expected a more interesting and comprehensive work from such an accomplished person. I am familiar with Gloria Allred and was looking forward to gaining insight in her thoughts and legal accomplishments.In my opinion she tried to cover too much. I wish she would have covered fewer cases with far greater depth. Much of the historical background, legal complexities, human factors and contemporary context were left out. Each case that I listened to degenerated into my cause is rightous and anyone who is against me is wrong.I was expecting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"fight back and make me richer\\"","review":"Just a venue for further self-aggrandizement. Gloria Allred has made her self rich by taking on such villians as childrens haircutting salons who charged different rates for boys and girls and fast food restaurants who's employees refuse to hand out discount coupons. In the process she is millionaire sucking money out of her victims forcing them to settle rather than endure long drawn out court proceedings and bad publicity.And in the end her clients get a pittance in settlements and she is a millionaire. I would be curious to see where her clients are today. Way to go Gloria. Your legacy is undeniable. You are everything that gives lawyers a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"When does this marketer ever work?","review":"This woman stands many inches taller on tv than she is in real life. She is a jesse jackson female counterpart and wannabe and wants to insert herself into every dispute. She forces herself into every controversy and conducts herself like ruth westheimer. She makes no sense and is always poised to give a liberal and feminist slant to every controversy and when there is no dispute she is ready to produce one. An agitator and media hound. What a joke! She should write a cookbook and perhaps she could mix up something other than the listeners and readers' brains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re: Well-written memoir","review":"I read Gloria Allred's book FIGHT BACK AND WIN with great interest. I have always admired Gloria because she stands up for those who are traditionally not empowered in society, including women and children, and she's been very involved in fighting for victims' rights. I thought the book was very well written and the part on Gloria's childhood and upbringing in working-class Philadelphia was very interesting. Anyone who is interested in becoming an attorney because they want to make a difference in somone's life will enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Gloria shows her true colors. She's a woman who isn't afraid to fight, to inspire, to lead and to express her opinion on many women's civil issues. I recommend this book to every person. Sometimes the causes that we fight for hurt society but sometimes they help individuals who otherwise would not have advantages to have their day in court. Freedom is such a delicate matter but not approaching issues with fervent gusto is being ignorant. Gloria Allred's best message in this book is don't be ignorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic!","review":"This has been one of my all time favorite albums of all time! It was really great to know I could count on amazon to have this item. I had a hard time otherwise finding it and at a resonable price.

He brings a lot of power and intensity to these terrific songs moulded in classic 80's melodic hard rock. His voice soars and the brightness of it invokes vivid images to go along with the very uplifting music. The stand-out vocal track is the title song where Harnell sings (!) repeated high G sharps (G#5). Awesome is the word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite TNT album.","review":"NOTE: I am not one for long reviews...The first thing I remembered when I heard this record again for the first time in a long time is how SHORT this album is! Barely 35 minutes, I think. This is not a bad thing. Get in, get out, leave 'em wanting more.This album defined TNT's style that they would be recognized for. They moved away from the traditional metal sound of \\"Knights...\\" and got commercial and it worked. Great songs, huge vocals and, of course, AMAZING guitars by Nuno.Highlights? The opener \\"Everyone's a Star\\" is hot as hell. The closer (the title track) is as thrashing as TNT ever got... very fun. But the snipet \\"Sapphire\\" is as amusing as it is amazing.

I would want someone else to read this so that they can understand that detectives do all they can to solve the crime. Tommy is like my sister's boyfriend. He's like a very shy and cautious person. While I was reading this book I could not believe that the mystery's were about divorce cases. Tommy and Tuppence are middle aged people who are married. Another reason I would reccomand this book is because it has a lot of humor and excitement. Its just a great book about a Russian mystery. I learned some things about the book.

Their wants are answers when The Chief visits them, and informs them of a failing detective agency. The Chief asks them to take over the failing detective agency and look for a mastermind criminal whose symbol is the number 16. Tommy and Tuppence agree, and the result is adventure and many humorous experiences.PARTNERS IN CRIME is a great example of Agatha Christie's lighter side. She placed some very funny material in the book, making it very enjoyable. I would recommend it to any Christie fan.PARTNERS IN CRIME is also worth reading just for the last line in the book, delivered by Tuppence.

However, on this latest effort, Biolay appears to have caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, and caught the terrible disease good-looking men must beware of: the romance of the self-reflection. The songs appear to have been breathed into the tracks. Seriously. The idea of sexy music, especially in the French way, has more to do with attitude and non-chalance. In this record, I am aware, as a listener, that Biolay finds himself attractive and that is somehow interesting. No, that is not. The lyrics have the touchy-feely, morose tone of the Rimbaud-wannabe dissafected suburban (French) teenager, dumped by his girlfriend after he misbehaves at her family's bourgeois dinner function. I bought this record, full of expectation, to listen to wanking vocals.

I have a nice lightweight road bike that I don't want to clutter with a fixed rack but I wanted to have the capability to carry some extra gear or run some errands when I felt like it. This rack is PERFECT for that. I am impressed with the high quality material and welds, and the quick release function works great. I just did a 40-mile ride to Costco and stocked up with a rack trunk (fits perfectly on the Delta rack under my saddle) full of vitamins etc. The rack was rock-solid and vibration free. The tag that comes with the rack actually states a carry capacity of 40 lbs vs. the 25 mentioned here but I would be a bit wary of that much load.

Five stars all the way for my purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not for me","review":"Thought this would be handy on my ride but it didn't end up being what I hoped for. It might work for light duty, perhaps a windbreaker or your lunch, but keep the box until you're sure.My wife & I ride around quite frequently and as such, it's a pain in the back to carry the two locks & cables that we need when locking up here in NYC. (For the record, the Kryptonite 18mm New York Fahgettaboudit U-Lock, the Kryptonite Kryptolok Series 2 U-Lock, and the Kryptonite KryptoFlex 7' cable. I'll leave the total weight as an exercise for the reader!)Anyhow, I tried using this to bungee the locks to, in order to avoid rattling and loss and back pain on or extended rides. The clamp seemed solid, but on several occasions the rack swiveled around, becoming off-center and sticking out to the side. Also, the weight of the locks seemed too much for the rack, as it bounced up and down violently as I rode, even over seemingly smooth ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I got this for my road bike on those rare occasions when I want to carry something (usually a U-lock and street shoes when I want to ride to an event and walk around when I get there).At first I was having troubles with it swinging to one side or the other while riding, but then I wrapped an innertube around my seat post to give it a better surface to grip onto and it stayed in the position I wanted it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good investment","review":"I bought this product a few weeks back and I have since had the opportunity to install and use it.

I immediately bought The Who Sell Out, and went backwards to get the first two albums. Of course then came Tommy and Who's Next. I love them both, but Sell Out was my introduction and still favorite. I was already a Beatles and Stones fan, and though many great bands came out of the British rock scene those two plus The Who for me will always be the Triumvirate of the British Invasion.I recently purchased a new copy and was disappointed to find that it wasn't the album I remembered. The remastered versions were great, but the \\"original\\" version of Rael just wasn't the same. I wish they had kept the album version and included the new-found \\"original\\" as a bonus track.

Sadly, the commercial breaks are shortened, and the added songs are not up to the quality of original selection. I have to say that it was a disappointment, and I'm glad I still have a CD of the original to refer to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Who LP. Worst remastering.","review":"I cannot overstate enough what a landmark album this is. Townshend and The Who entered their own with The Who Sell Out. Brash, loud, exciting, intelligent, crazy, profound, imaginative and fun. The Who new how to have fun and be funny while everyone was going to San Francisco.From the ground breaking Pop Art cover to the last refrains of \\"Track Records....Track Records...\\", this album is a tour de force.My only gripe is the remastering. What was John Astley thinking? It sounds totally flat and sterile. No justice has been served to the way it originally sounded. The mix is all over the place. \\"I Can't Reach You\\", has the vocals and tambourine in one channel, while all the instrumentation is in the other. It sounds thin and hollow.My advice is to find a copy on vinyl and experience the original spread of the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't grow on me","review":"I can't name one song here I thought was great it was all very generic for that time period.

But that's the way it is. While the entire Beatles backlist has been reissued, lovingly restored in the original mono, The Who Sell Out is a travesty, missing some material that was on the original, while being afflicted with lame \\"stereo\\" effects (which cannot be easily removed) such as phasing the vocals between channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make this the last Who cd you purchase.","review":"Don't get me wrong. I am a huge Who fan and already have my tickets to their concert in Tampa in September. That said, with a couple of exceptions, this cd in my humble opinion is mostly silly junk. I guess I just don't get it.There are a lot better Who cds' for sale and I would recommend that you buy any of them before you get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who Primer - All the seeds of what was to come","review":"In 1967 a small band of awkward teens knew that The Who Sell Out defined a point of no return, and was more important than anything at home or in school. This is the real Who primer. It contains the grade-school version of every Pete Townshend masterpiece to come. \\"Tattoo\\" is every great Who melody in a single-song three minute opera. \\"Rael\\" includes the great Sparks/Underture theme from Tommy. \\"I Can't Reach You\\" is pretty much Townshend's entire solo career in a blender. \\"I Can See For Miles\\" is Pete's hit single that never hit. It's so good that The Who have rarely tried to pull it off live. And for the guitar hero crowd there's the twin peaks of the all-time greatest 1-note guitar solo (I Can See For Miles) and the elegant solo acoustic guitar of \\"Sunrise\\". If you can just buy one Who album....That's impossible! Start here. Then do what you have to do to get the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Who record","review":"This is probably my personal favorite Who record. There is quite an eclectic assortment of songs here, and it may strike most listeners as \\"unconventional\\". The hilarious faux-commercials are especially odd. Rael is the best song here, and it's interesting to hear echoes of Rael in the Sparks track from Tommy.However, I recommend getting the deluxe edition of Sell Out for the bonus tracks and additional commercials rather than getting this version.Ivan Rorick"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First GREAT Who album","review":"\\"The Who Sell Out\\" is one of the Who's most daring and melodic albums, yet it also showcases everything that was great about the band. Pete Townshend is one of Rock's greatest lyricists and his tongue-in-cheek humor is splashed all over this disc. The album plays like a 60's British pirate radio station broadcast, right down to it's hilarious public service announcements scattered between songs. The songs here are criminally underrated, from the tender \\"Our Love Was\\" to the harder-rocking \\"I Can See For Miles\\" and \\"Armenia City In The Sky\\". \\"Mary Ann With The Shaky Hands\\" is a typically great Townshend song rife with sexual innuendos and \\"Odorono\\" is a fabulously funny ditty about body odor. This album ranks second only to \\"Tommy\\" in my book. An essential disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite who albums","review":"Along with \\"A Quick One\\" and \\"Meaty Beaty Big & Bouncy,\\" this is one of my favorite Who albums.

As much fun to listen to as Psychadelic Rock is, I don't feel The Who do Psychadelic Rock quite like The Doors or Jefferson Airplane. And I realize that the radio inserts are part of the feel for the album, but I find them to be a bit annoying. I would definitely say a fan of The Who should get this album, but anyone that is new to experiencing The Who should look at \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Who's Next\\" or \\"Who Are You\\". But I'm sure there are many big fans of The Who that really like this album and are most likely pleased by what they hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"pOp ArT","review":"This is the Who's best album by such a wide margin that it's hard to even measure it. Recorded after their groundbreaking Mod glories and just before diving headlong into \\"Tommy\\" AOR nonsense, \\"The Who Sell Out\\" is the rare (only?) \\"concept\\" album that actually works. The whole thing is staged to feel like an afternoon listening to BBC radio (complete with brief commercials for fake products!), which sounds like a rather silly thing to attempt, but The Who succeed due to the strength of the SONGS (something most concept albums don't seem to be too intersted in): \\"I Can See for Miles\\", \\"I Can't Reach You\\", and \\"Our Love Was (Is)\\" are just a few of the brilliant surprises to be found on this deeply fascinating and remarkably odd album."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best albums of the sixties.","review":"In \\"Sell Out\\", the Who have fullfilled what, probably, at the time, none belived they could do. \\"A quick one\\" was a good album, with some very decent tracks, but \\"Sell Out\\" was far far far away better. It is mostly the songwriting which makes it so good. Townsend and Entwistle were at their peak of creativity. The songs are short and beutiful. Three and a half minutes of heaven. The production (Lambert?) is fantastic. This extended version is much better than the original.

They look great, feel great, and the price was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS BOOK IS VERY INSPIRATIONAL, HELPED ME THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES LOVED IT SO MUCH BOUGHT ONE FOR MY BIG SIS, WHO IS GOING THROUGH TOUGH TIME RIGHT NOW AND TO READ OTHER PEOPLES ENRCOURAGEMENTS IS THE BEST !

The title alone spoke to me (and most of the women I know). With it's common-sense, Christ-centered approach to living, THE WORN OUT WOMAN gives practical advice on slowing down and regaining control.I love that the book is 'interactive' with many suggestions on things to do and a reading/study guide for each chapter. This is the type of book you want to get for every woman you know who is doing too much and being all things to everybody -- and slowly killing her soul in the process!I'm going to lead a discussion group on the book because I know so many women who can relate. WE ARE TIRED and looking for a better way!

Stonehouse doesn't attempt to prove or debunk any of these stories, and nor should he. He's just trying to put on the record some of the tales that make the rounds. This is a good collection and each story is told well.

Not enough friction.

I don't know why I didn't see that coming, but as soon as I tried one of my high impact step DVDs, I realized the oversight. My knees ached for 3 days post-workout. Fearful I'd have to give up anything high impact (or else face having to drag all of my crap back upstairs to our bedroom), I started shopping for puzzle mats. I finally took a chance on these and ended up loving them. My knees haven't felt so much as a twinge since. They're easy to set up and break down (I only do high impact 3 times a week) if you'd rather not use them as permanent flooring, and they store nicely in a closet or under a bed. The surface is a bit slippery at first, but I've noticed that is changing the more I use them.I would recommend getting at least 2 sets for a nice, spacious area. If you can afford to cover the whole room, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bloomcc","review":"It's a good product.

My son bought a bow-flex and we also have a treadmill and a ski machine. Because it was directly on the basement floor, I wanted something a little thicker, and durability was a MUST! The flooring came as expected. It was easy to put together and is serving the purpose nicely. I feel it is a strong flooring to stand the test of time. It was a good buy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"There were moments when this book was a page-turner but the author kept getting in the way too much. I really don't like being addressed as \\"you\\" by a cheeky NewYorker especially when I'm being lectured to about how \\"life is about choices\\" or some other cliches. The plot was an interesting one but unravels in the second part of the book with some very unconvincing events. Also, the author didn't know when to end the book -- editors could have cut out about the last 50 pages. I kept waiting for an unanticipated twist at the end. For all the build up, the book just peters out. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most irritating character ever.","review":"If the concept of the author was to create a main character who is stupid and irritating all at the same time then she has succeeded beyond her wildest dreams.So if that is what you are looking for in a mystery, you should get this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted With This Book","review":"Like several other readers I picked this book up when the Kindle price dropped to the bargain price of 79cents and I just got around to reading it this week.OMG, I am totally declaring this book to be my most awesome deal of the year.

I mean, who amongst us hasn't at one time or another suspected we are adopted because (sorry Mom) there is no way we can share genetics with all those other people.Second, awesome suspense that left me on the edge of my - well pillow since I was mostly reading in bed.Okay, I realize I'm gushing but this is absolutely one of my top books of the year.

Unger writes with a definitely a different style and voice for the narrator of a thriller, but at first it felt fresh and exciting. Unfortunately, it became a rather tired tale very quickly. The plot was predictable, with a solution lacking a basis in solid facts. Overall, it read more like a romance novel than a thriller. It was hokey, unimpressive and used unoriginal characters and relationships. All in all, I was rather disappointed. The most interesting thing was that the adoption motif that I just encountered in Trollope'sBrother & Sistercarried through to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I'm not one to leave a book unfinished, but an est 40% through this one, I've closed the cover. Ugh. This book is a relentless slog through predictability, with the book's main character supposedly a reputable writer AND a nincompoop. Lots of drama, incredibly handsome guy who is \\"a mystery\\", ' family secrets. ... Get the picture? Oh, you've read this book before? A hundred times. You are right, and this isn't one of the better versions of this plot in the worst of the romantic novels storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"D+","review":"Ugg, I really did not enjoy \\"Beautiful Lies.\\" The problem was that I was about 1/3 into it before I realized, and I wanted to see the ending. Turns out I didn't have to keep reading, because the novel concluded exactly as I'd suspected it would! In addition to the predictable plot, the main character and narrator, Ridley, annoyed me to no end. Plus the writing style was not my thing; too many \\"By now you're probably thinking that I'm crazy.\\" stuff--just a personal gripe I guess, but I don't like it when the narrator talks to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooo boring and very badly written.","review":"Ridely Jones....what did you accomplish in the end other than hurt the people that loved you the most? And for us reader's...did we get to know her 'truth' in the end? NO! what a waste of time.So many questions unanswered.So Ridely Jones still lives in blissful ignorance, with her beautiful lies...which she got so many ppl in trouble over nothing for. Should've left it that way from the begining. Was the author in a hurry to finish off the book?!?!Well,thats the feeling i got.I agree with another reader...how did this book get so many stars??Unbeleivable. Story line is so predictable, therefore, was boring and was not a page-turner. The main character,Ridely Jones...very ungrateful and immature!

The plot of this book just keeps getting better and better. When you think you have it figured out, you're thrown another twist in the story. Each relationship is different yet special in it's own way and it keeps you so hooked because you just have to know what's going to happen between everybody. I love how real the dialog is between characters. It's honest and brutal sometimes, but so is life. There is so much love and so much hate throughout the book that you really feel for some of the characters and can probably relate on a very real level. Can't wait to read Sliver of Truth, the sequel to this book! Definitely recommend this book, and have to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews here.....","review":"Had I read the reviews here before getting this audio, I would have skipped it! Unfortunately, I was stuck on a long car ride with only this book to listen to. It was pretty dreadful. Too long, overwritten, unlikable characters, silly situations, predictable scenarios, repetitive, awkward. Wasn't there an editor involved in this mess? I cannot believe this was a bestseller and a BookSense book!All of the \\"mob\\" stuff was just not at all believable, nor were many of the \\"action scenes\\". The flimsy-at-best premise of the book was not strong enough to carry all of the weight that the author attached to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read if you're looking for a thriller!","review":"I am perplexed by the good reviews this book is getting. As a thriller, this book gets 0 stars. You can see every plot twist coming from the beginning. The only reason I kept reading was that I thought that perhaps there would be a major twist at the end that would shake everything up and make it worthwhile, but no.There are a few instances of inspired writing, but these are diluted by the repetition of the idea until it's just annoying.If you want to read a novel about a woman's search for her identity, then it's fine. Just don't expect any brilliant surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I picked this up based on the starred review from Publisher's Weekly. What a disappointment.

I cannot believe that this book is on any best-seller list. From the first chapter I should have known to put it down. All the rhetorical questions Ridley asks makes me want to throttle her. \\"Like you know what I mean?\\" I actually SKIPPED 100 pages in the middle of the book, and didn't miss a beat with the story. The entrie book sounds like it is coming from a 7th grader writing a note to her BFF in class.

This book had an interesting premise but the execution left me wanting to scream. The main character Ridley was so stupid and insipid a character that I actually lost my patience. I really hate when authors are repetitive to the point of annoyance, this is one of those cases. Not only is Ridley the saddest character I have run across in a long time, not because of her situation but because of the way that her character comes across. If I were to meet here, she would get on my nerves inside of five minutes, the conversations just drag on forever. The conclusion of this book was watery and there was no \\"ah-ha\\" moment, just more vague conversations. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, it was recommended to me by Amazon.com because of my book purchases. Most of the time, its dead on, this book was a disappointment, big time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why the price change","review":"I was interested in purchasing the Kindle version of this book but saw that the price had been $0.79 and now it is over $7.00!!! Why the change?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Do You Trust?","review":"A very quick read and one that holds your attention from the start. I found the story to be inventive and plausible.

Her face is plastered all over the papers and she make appearances on all the morning news shows. Everyone recognizes her wherever she goes. Then she receives a package in the mail, in it is a photograph of a man, a woman and their baby. And suddenly she begins to question everything she thought she knew about her self, her life and the people she loves.I thought this was so well done. I loved the characters. The way Lisa Unger tells the story...I just thought this was a great story, very well done, a book to get lost in. I never wondered what the editor was thinking.

I can't believe this book made top book lists, who are these people?!!!!The author's style of writing is very adolescent and annoying. The plot was predictable so therefore the book dragged out when this book could probably have been a short story. The narrator kept on directing rhetorical questions to the reader which really put me off about the book as well. All the \\"philosophical\\" or thought provoking comments ridden throughout the book shouldn't be new ideas to anyone who has ever had any deep thoughts about anything.Don't waste your time picking up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought I would love this book. I eagerly awaited its arrival from my book club. I was so disappointed. The premise seemed so promising but instead, I found the book predictable and unbelievable at times. The strangest feeling I had was that I didn't like ANY of the characters and that's a first for me. I didn't care if any of them were in danger. None of them were likable -- especially the heroine and her hunky boyfriend. I had to force myself to finish the book hoping the whole time that it would get better. This is coming from someone who adores a good novel full of mystery and intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read! Could not put it down!","review":"Someone sent me this book and I read it, with no idea who Lisa Unger was. Therefore, I did not have any preconceptions or expectations whatsoever. I was very impressed and cannot wait to read the second book featuring this same heroine. I could not put this book down and read the entire thing in less than a day. Not only is is a first-rate thriller, but the author has very believable insights into human characteristics. Her writing style is razor sharp. Bravo, Ms. Unger!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and annoying!","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book but I was so disappointed by the drippy tone of the narrator and the constant one-liner questions directed at the reader. Yuck! I also didn't understand what the big deal was over the beautiful lie, it could have been a great storyline but the action scenes and the twists felt sooo contrived. I wanted to scream, \\"where was the editor?\\" Needless to say, I will not be buying anymore books from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and not just because it was free!

I believe you will enjoy it, too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Mystery","review":"This is the only Lisa Unger book I have read and I purchased it due to the low price. If I had it to do over again, I would pass. The mystery was very thin and too easy for the reader to solve. I also became very annoyed with the main character, an emotionally insecure and spoiled rich girl. I understand this is Ms. Unger's first novel. At some point I may try another, but not without sampling it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...sorry","review":"I've got this book on my E-reader, and it only cost me 99 cents. I hadn't read a thriller in a while, so I was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, I was let down by the book no later than chapter 4. To me, the author tried a bit too hard to create suspense. The vibe I detected early on was something like, \\"trouble's brewing.\\" but not in a suspenseful way. It was more as though Ms. Unger was telling us instead of just showing us and allowing it to develop. Good suspense should surprise you, thrill you, chill you, and maybe freak you out. I didn't experience any of this. In addition, the lead character, Ridley, was devoid of personality. None of the characters had any depth and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The book inadvertently revealed itself very early on. Once I realized that nothing about it was original, it was pretty easy to unravel the mysteries. I eventually just started flipping pages until I got to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Interpretations.","review":"Nice combinations of old and new. Vocals were impeccable. \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\", while not playfully coy like Ann-Margaret's version, is a sweet duet. \\"The Marvelous Toy\\" was equally fun. Thankfully, standard Christmas tunes (\\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" & \\"O Holy Night\\") are gently understated. A dynamite compilation album all in all... AND proceeds benefit Children's Hospital. Can't beat that with a stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid music","review":"If you want to hear really bad singers from the Northwest, the whole \\"Christmas In The Northwest series\\" is for you. If you want your money to go the Children's Hospital, donate it directly to them, not the CD's. Children's had a great idea, but stores like Bartells & Ikea really overkilled it with advertising every 5 minutes. Ikea went so far as to have the actual singers there. The last Christmas in the Nortwest (10 or 11) had a terrible group called the Wannabee Idols singing \\"I want to be Blake, I want to be Sanjaya\\".

Interesting for the range of topics it suggests relate to its subject, although its coverage of them is aweful. It is somewhat useful for the references it offers, in case the frustrated reader is still interested enough in the topics to try and make up for the book's own failures by reading up on them elsewhere. As for the rest, it is hard to follow and confusing on all but the most elementary points."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting, but pedagogically feeble","review":"This book is contains a fairly substantial (from the layman's point of view) discussion of randomness. It discusses the fundamentals of probability, information/entropy, etc. It ends with an appendix of \\"technical notes\\", an appendix on binary notation and 6 pages of references. But it has no exercises, and presents its material as if the layman could assimilate it by simple passive reading. Not so. You need a paper and pencil. You need to manufacture exercises to master or even understand the material. I am comfortable with algebra and basic calculus, but got lost and gave up after a couple of chapters (I did not break out pencil and paper).If you are not mathematically sophisticated enough to just \\"get it\\" by reading, I suggest you buy a real textbook, where the author is actually makes a commitment to teaching, rather than mere exposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the Worst","review":"This stuff doesn't dry.

I liked Carrie and Kusac, and even Kusac's family. Even Kaid. All that has been destroyed in this book for one main reason. Carrie and Kusac had a wonderful relationship, and there was no reason to destroy it, along with the story, but destroy it has been done. By allowing Carrie to have an approved affair was absolutely disgusting, the worse because it was sanctioned. There was no need for that. Not only that, I tortured myself by reading the later books and it only got worse.Read the first two books and STOP THERE. The rest of the books are not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":". . .and they mean FIRE, alright!","review":"Well, there was no science, no logic, no true conflic (even though there is war) and a bunch of romance: this equils a no - brainer. This novel was the WORST I have EVER read, and I speak truthfully on that one. I hate this book (and the rest in the series) with a passion. I know this wouldn't apeal to the male audiance (I am woman though)To much pointless relationships and no action. All in all, I don't think it is right to burn a book, but this one sure did get my bon-fire started rather well!

I suppose it's because the story itself is really good despite problems in style, and the secret soap-opera lover in me likes the interplay between the characters, particularly the romance between humans and the feline Sholan. Ms. Norman has steadily improved her writing since her amateurish debut in Turning Point, but she still seems to be childish in her style . . . it's like a drama written for teenagers, with emotional histrionics, people being immature, plots randomly thrown in for tension, etc. The main draw for me is the Sholans themselves, and the touchy-feelie closeness you experience as you read. A good read, but intellectually and stylistically still immature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big for its large size....","review":"Very warm, but its large size is too big for my boyfriend, and he usually wear large size clothes...so I just returned it and get a medium size one instead, hope that will fit right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for Me","review":"As a student I needed an easy way to carry data between class and home.

Written in a down to earth style, the reader is given an intimate view of the main charaters Caroline and Julian English and are allowed into their WASPish country club molded mindset.

O'hara's APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA is a slowdescent to and in hell for its protagonist, Julian English.English's plunge is triggered by his realization that 1930was not a year to be in heavy debt. But, the power of thenovel is seen in just how shallow and surface English andhis peers lives are.

There is no comparison at all; this story is boring beyond belief, rife with characters who are irrelevent to the story, and led by a protagonist who I couldn't have cared less about. This book has a definite 1950's tone throughout - the female characters were so unbelievably rendered that they almost seemed like stepford wives. It's rare that I cannot finish a book - but this one seemed a huge waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"This novel should remain forgotten in the dim past. It's a period piece, all right. Blatantly antisemitic -- and I don't think the author was making a comment on his characters in that regard; I think it was the author speaking.Boring in stretches. Long stretches.I finally gave up and heaved the book across the room.Out of curiosity, I read the author's Butterfield 8 a number of years ago and, trust me, it's worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"Recommendation from HEmmigway which says it all. If you like Hemmingway, you MAY like O'Hara"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Honest","review":"John O'Hara is like a cross between F.S. Fitzgerald and D.H. Lawrence, if you care to think of it in those terms. Not only do I recommend the book for its social insight into the club-set of the 1930's (like Fitzgerald,) but I also recommend it for its brutal honesty. O'Hara, like D.H. Lawrence, could take any character, a woman, a man, a priest, an alcoholic, and tell you what they would do, why they would do it, and what they would *think* while doing it. We know the lies that they tell themselves, simply because O'Hara knows them and would never let the character get away with lying to his readers. He knows the ins and outs of every kind of mind. In effect, we feel the jealousy, anxiety, anger, and hopelessness of a great range of people.This book is excellent for those readers who are a little weary of carefully non-offensive works. Prepare for some 200 pages of frank sexual discussion, *real* mental insight, and a story that ends the way it would in real-life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely honest work.","review":"O'Hara introduces his main character and drives straight and hard to the story's conclusion. He writes peceptively about marital relations, and about how men and women think about sexual acts.

A tale of the trajedy that lies not far below the surface of the otherwise perfect life. If you love good ol' American story telling, you won't find anything more smooth than Appointment in Samara. Like any master O'Hara makes story telling look so easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLEP History of the United States I w/CD","review":"CD helped a lot. The real test was a little harder than the practice test but did pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed, but I still passed","review":"I wanted to post this review, because I must have misunderstood the purpose of these CLEP books. As was indiciated to me today by the testing center, these books are designed to refresh the memories of people who have a good knowledge base of the subject. For individuals such as myself, who haven't taken American History since the early 90's, it didn't prepare me like I expected it to.I studied this book for three months, I had a 95% on each of the practice exams, and I barely passed this CLEP. Passing is passing, I agree, but just keep in mind that this book is a framework. There were so many questions on my exam on topics my clep book didn't touch on. Good thing I like the History channel.Anyway, good refresher, but maybe it's wise to supplement with a cheap high school/college text to be safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of the Info you Need","review":"I read the whole entire book and did both quizzes. When I took the actual CLEP test the questions are nothing close to what is covered in the book. Luckily I had taken US History AP in high school which helped me in some of the questions. Don't rely on this book alone to pass the CLEP. Best advice is to get familiarize yourself with the people during the time. For example: Phillis Wheatley, Roger Williams, and what they signified. I did pass with a 54."},{"rating":"2","title":"I passed","review":"Regardless of the book's flaws, I passed the CLEP test. I studied for about 10 hours, focusing on the 3 practice exams. I first did the exams with explanations turned on, and then re-took them with explanations turned off. I noted which questions I got wrong for further study. As other reviewers noted, 3-4 of the questions have wrong answers: the explanations indicate a different answer than what is scored as \\"correct.\\"During the actual test I felt that I was guessing a lot and didn't think I'd pass. I think one skill that helped me was practice analyzing multiple choice questions and increasing my chance of a correct guess through the process of elimination (e.g., four of the answers somehow group together, and one of them sticks out as not belonging).Considering that I only spent a week preparing for the test, I'm very satisfied with my passing score and not having to take a semester-long class."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets the job done","review":"Just remeber that, like most REA/Clep study books, not all questions in the sample tests find an answer in the main text.

This was the only resource I used to prepare. I read all of the text, took the 3 exams, and reviewed those answers that I've gotten wrong. I retook the exams as practice, and re-reviewed those few questions I might've missed again. It has a helpful section with explanations for correct answers. I then went to take the real CLEP and had no problem passing.

It had 50 \\"practice questions\\", and most of them seemed to be on the test in one form or another. I really felt that going through the official review guide was what had the greatest impact on my score. The review section of this text is just bare bones material. It has skipped over many important people and I had issues with discrepancies between the review and the practice tests. I highly recommend using other sources in conjunction with this book to study. All and all, I got a 71/80 points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was extremely helpful. Especially the practice tests.

It's not possible to cover it all, and this book doesn't do that. But it does cover the high points and many items that are important in passing the CLEP exam. Much of the material covered was on the version of the CLEP that I got, and the material was covered in concise form.The only complaint I have about this book is that the language is sometimes difficult and laborious to read. I guess I would classify it as \\"poor sentence structure.\\" However, the material is there, and if you take your time reading it, you should get out of it what you need.The tests on the accompanying CD were probably the best thing about this book. They are spot on as far as being similar to the material you should see on the real CLEP, and the format is similar enough that you will feel right at home when you take the real thing.This book and the CD were my best weapon in passing this exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me","review":"Some of the other REA CLEP studies are just ok.

When we were done with the whole box, we ordered this clay again (some time in June 2011), this time from a different seller (7GIFTS or something like that). I believe this second set is worse in quality: it's drier, harder, and crumblier. It takes forever to soften it so that my daughter can play with it, and in the end it's just not fun. This second set has been sitting practically unused for a couple of months already. Every time we try to play with it, it's just frustrating. I don't know if the clay is just old or if it's actually of worse quality.

Even tho they are all 1oz bars (half of a normal single package of Sculpey) there are so many colors that come together! Getting 30 colors for $20 is a good deal. Getting 30 colors in the store could run you close to $60~$75.Another good thing about this is Im not overwhelemed by the sizes of them.

For anyone who has done dissections in Anatomy, you would recognize the smell.

Whatever caused it, I could not get it off with washing, even in the dishwasher. I have read other reviews for the light-color version that mention the smell, while others do not. But for me, the last thing I want is to be reminded of anatomy lab when I am baking bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peel emits strong odor","review":"I purchased this item in Dec. This peel gives off an overpowering chemical-like odor when handwashing as well as when removing a hot pizza from the oven. This nauseating odor is absorbed into the pizza crust which ruins the meal.

When so many beautiful items can be knitted using circular needles, this author opted for straight.

I thought that this was a bit small when I received, but that is a good thing for storage purposes or having to leave it out on the work bench too. I bought this so I would stop killing my garage queen's battery when not in use. I hooked this up as soon as I got it and it charged my battery in about 2 days or less on an almost completly dead battery, not bad for the size of this thing.

Just in general, the construction is much more robust with heavier duty cables and nice touches such as a cap over the end of the battery cable hook up to prevent accidental shorting when not in use. I've also observed that it cycles through the charge/maintain modes as I would expect. I guess none of this is particularly exciting but it's nice to see something that works as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, sturdy and just what I needed","review":"Great and sturdy. It is a float charger so it is safe to leave your battery plugged in forever and it will never overcharge it. For those that do not know, trickle chargers pay no attention to the discharge rate after it is full so it may overcharge, ie shorten the lifespan, of your battery. Float chargers on the other hand charge as much as the battery discharges over time. I left a size 27 deep cycle charging a few days before sandy to have power during the store, with an inverter, for some lamps and small devices. Worked wonderfully. Doesn't heat up and the full metal construction is a great thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great charger!","review":"This charger is great for anyone that needs to charge their car or motorcycle battery and is a must for cars that don't get used often, cords are long also.

The 'BATTERY TENDER Plus' keeps the cells fully charged after long periods, while the Bimmer's clock, computer, radio and alarm system try to drain them down.

DOn't come to me saying that this is a great portrai of the lost generation, blá, blá, blá.

(Writing a review of it almost seems to tarnish its greatness.) Hemingway's terse, impactful prose works in full force telling the tale of Jake Barnes and his (impossible) love, Brett Ashley. It tackles all the relevant themes of the Lost Generation and captures the spirit of expatriot Paris and Europe. In my opinion, it upstages \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by orders of magnitude including its portriat of post-WWI decadence, its writing, its romance, its action, its story, and most importantly its realism.

They bicker and whine about lost and purposeless relationships. What is the point???? The writing is slow, except for some parts, like when two men go fishing in Spain. Otherwise, it is tiresome, boring, almost painful, and quite frankly, of little redeemable value. Or maybe, I should just move on, hoping I get to the point where I find Hemingway's purpose in writing this book (surely, there must be other far better books written about post-WWI emotional dilemma).

All that I kept thinking of was if I was near the end. I chose to read this book for my AP English 11 class during the summer and found that it was one of the worst novels that I have ever read. I saw that the most dominant aspect of this book was the incessant drinking that the characters engaged in throughout the whole story. It irritated me because all they did was drink liquor all day long. This book also should me the unhappy lives of the characters. Ugh! How boring! This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor is Wearing no Clothes","review":"Let's start with the characters of the book. They drink beer, they eat, they smoke, they sip coffee, they chat, they sleep, and then they wake up and start the whole process over. They really don't do a whole lot more than that and you've got to wonder why anyone would willfully chronicle this. They sound like early twenty-somethings on the party circuit (and we all know how profoundly interesting that time of our lives was right?).

Now let's have dinner and walk around. Let's go drink some more. I just don't see how this novel warrants all the praise it has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing, View Into A Different Age - Recommended","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was required reading when I was in school (oh so many years ago) but little of the book stayed with me. On my recent second reading I now recall why this book is considered to be one of the greats.Hemingway is a master story teller and this book includes some of the best character interaction I have ever read. The locations and plots lines are well handled, as are the insites into the issues and morals of post WWI Europe. What I forgot was how much I disliked almost all of the characters in the story. Every last one is shallow, weak, and flawed in major ways. Hemingway did a great job showing us the human side of his characters and still kept the book interesting.Truely a master work of fiction - Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs adjectives?","review":"This is a wonderful book. The laconic prose can be refreshing. It captures (I assume) the emptiness and indifference of the \\"lost generation.\\" This is evidenced on a textual level by Hemingway's fondness for short, sober sentences devoid of exuberance. There are moments of emotion, but they are confused, realizing the characters' impotence to express themselves or even know what they are feeling. The last lines of this book are chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"realistic","review":"This book is a snippet of a person's ordinary life. Much like our own day to day lives, it is completely boring except for the people who are living it. Though...Hemingway's writing is so concise, REALISTIC and to-the-point that it seems more like we are LIVING this book than reading it, and then it ceases to be boring.And another thing: There's too much drinking? It's about the lost generation! Of course they drink a lot. Their lives are going straight to hell, and they're depressed out of their minds. THEY'RE PATHETIC!

I've read it five times."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT THOUGH CHARACTERS ARE REPULSIVE","review":"I had never read Heminway before though I always wanted to. I read this book in a little less than two days. It really hooked me. An excellent novel, but the characters are infuriatingly childish and irresponsible.If you are sick (like myself) of writers who take five pages to describe an armchair (mainly because they're in love with their own writing) I'd give Hemingway a go. His writing style is quite direct and unadorned. It's lovely, to be frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight into the Lost Generation","review":"People told me that I would not like Hemingway's style. To be honest it took quite a few chapters to get into the story because in the beginning Hemingway wrote about a group of expatriates flitting around Paris continuously getting drunk (can anyone REALLY drink as much as these people did in the novel?) This seemed to go on and on. A reader of this book really needs to understand the context of the times before reading this because you would simply think that these people are stupid. Understanding that this book was written after the horror of the Great War one can really begin to see what this \\"Lost Generation\\" was all about.The book really picked up for me when the group goes to Pamplona for the fiesta. I think that bullfighting is disgusting but the way Hemingway wrote about the bullfights was amazing. The detail puts you right there next to Jake and Brett.I do like the writing style of Hemingway. No fluff, just lay it out how it is. Take it or leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sun Also Rises","review":"The Sun Also Rises - Hemingway gave a glimpse into a lifestyle today's youth would doubtless disdain as silly and prosaic. What he actually provided generations to come was a lesson in how it was to be decadent, talented and hard-working. He proved, also, that the nature of the beast hasn't changed a bit. Worth a third time around for me. I am re-reading Fitzgerald and Pound again as well. Yes, I'm no spring chicken! Read this time around on my Kindle from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Meaning","review":"A meandering novel with many meaningless conversations that really don't amount to very much. There were a few high-lights - the bull-fighting scenes towards the end were, I suppose, vintage Hemingway. Also the setting at the fishing village (or vacation spot) had the beginnings of some introspection, but was not taken very far. The first one hundred pages in Paris were repetitive and bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into Hemingway's psyche","review":"This is the 3rd Hemingway novel I have read. The first one, Farewell to Arms, I read in high school, and never finished. The second, Old Man and the Sea, I read in college after visiting Cuba, and loved it.The Sun Also Rises falls somewhere in the middle between the two. I love Hemingway's style of writing, and the personal tone...you really feel like you are getting a glimpse into Hemingway's psyche. I have grown to like his concise writing style, it makes me work harder as a reader, and I appreciate that. I love that he gives very little description in regards to what any of the characters look like (except for Lady Brett Ashley's short hair), so an image is formed in my mind based entirely on their actions.Like some of his other books, It is easy to tell what Hemingway's true passions are...I found the sections on fishing in the Pyrenees, the running of the bulls and bullfighting in Pamplona to be the most descriptive and interesting part of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sun Also Rises","review":"I read this book anticipating Hemingway's sparse, minimalist use of language, but I quickly became disenchanted with the style. It may have been innovative in its time, and such a sere but straightforward use of the language may be appropriate for other subjects (I'm thinking of The Old Man And The Sea), but in this instance I found it simply impoverished and, oddly, pedantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"the sun also rises","review":"This title is way over rated. Written by Earnest Hemingway, it is basically a story about a group of misfit alcoholics jumping from drink to drink. It is written in a narrative style that reminds me of a grade school reader. It does spend a few pages on the bull fighting fiesta in Pamplona Spain. Sorry, I cannot recommend this book at all.If you want a good book go read Virginia Wolfe (To The Lighthouse), William Faulkner (Light in August) or Thomas Mann (The Magic Mountain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE'S N USE IN DEFFENDING THIS GARBAGE","review":"The only thing that will rise while you're reading this book is boredom. Terrible, infalible boredom. GOsh, what a book !! Absolutely nothing happens, nothing !! They say this is a \\"Portrait of the lost post-war generation\\". POrtrait my a...!! SO, if it is a portrait, I don't care about it, because it is so badly written. THe main female character, BRett, keeps the whole book dancing and flerting and dating the guys. THe guys ( and girls), go into pubs, get out of pubs; then go into hotels, get out of hotels; then take some drinks; then go to sleep with headaches. All this \\"enchanting\\" plot is narrated with truculent writing, as if the writer didn't know what he wanted to achieve.

It was some what interesting. I thought that the book was kind of boring also. I'm not a big reader so I guess that makes a big part of it. It's considered a classic and a great book because of who it was written by and the fact that the book was written in the 30's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Travel Itinerary of a Boring Drunk","review":"I cannot fathom how people praise this book. I can sort of understand that in 1926 almost all Americans had never been to or seen Spain and maybe were fascinated by the accounts of the running of the bulls in Pamplona.Other than that, this book is terrible. Boring descriptions of how much people drank and what they ate. As another reviewer put it, \\"If you took out the descriptions of drinking, eating, hotels, and the towns you're left with perhaps 50 pages.Hemmingway does this in A Farewell to Arms also, but at least that book is interesting.

Though mine is lost for reasons entirely different from Hemingway's, the need for expression and recognition is as strong as ever. But I think in this book Hemingway offers insight that all our \\"American Beauty's\\" couldn't hope to achieve. His characters endure for reasons they don't realize. Life is miserable, or at best empty. Jake Barnes and Lady Brett exhibit \\"grace under pressure\\" as Hemingway himself defined it. Ironically, for me, this novel is a reminder of the good stuff in life. Hemingway doesn't offer much hope through the dialogues between his noble characters, but in an optimism wholly uncharacteristic of his writing, he offers us a reminder, or the title. The sun isn't always setting, sealing disappointment and despair as it falls, but it also rises. Even when we can't see the reasons, through the enduring actions that endear Barnes and Brett to us we can at least hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read- but not if you're looking for action.","review":"I'll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn't dissapointed. It isn't a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school \\"in crowd\\" I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn't a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn't the one for you. However if you're looking for more than a casual read you won't be dissapointed. This is one of his very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal favourite","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. The story flows like a wide river, the atmospheric changes between the wild and crazy days in Paris and the passionate and dangerous time in Pamplona is excellent. For those who have never read the book - just think about this sentence: \\"It's terribly easy to be hardboild about everything in the daytime, but at night it's something completely different.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, Dusty and Getting Rusty","review":"When S.A.R. first came out in the 1920's, a review of the day said that Hemmingway's prose,\\"...put conventional English to shame.\\" Well, that was then, this is now. The more I read it the more I wanted it to end. Is it entirely possible that in the American myths about Papa's alcohol soaked hunting and fishing trips, we've elevated the work because we wanted to like it as we seem to like the man? Hemmigway is the perinneal 'Uncle That We All Wanted', but a much better and true account of the Lost Generation authors in Paris is A Moveable Feast, please read it before reading 'Sun...'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book of all time.","review":"This is the first book that ever had a profound effect on me. I read it just after returning from travelling through Europe and it makes me yearn to return to the lifestyle of an expatriate. You see passion and love dispersed throughout wonderful travels. I have read the book four times and it never fails to keep me up at night. By the way, Jake and Brett are like any other couple in love, they just call themselves best friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Kindle Edition -- Buy the Other One","review":"This Kindle edition is a big disappointment. It's full of errors and the formatting is terrible -- hundreds of misspelled words, page numbers and chapter footers in the middle of sentences, etc. It seems like a bad OCR of a scanned document that nobody bothered to clean up. Buy the other Kindle edition from 2004 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Book","review":"I say that this novel was very boring.. A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow...but good!","review":"I have to admit that it started off extremely slow for my taste. But as I read on I learned to love the characters and by the end of the book I wished I belonged in Jakes social group. Not Hemingways best, in my opinion, but it was an amazing first novel for an amazing writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled","review":"Not one of his best. I found the book very limited and not very interesting. The main character is constantly rejected by a rather flighty woman he is in love with although he is prepared to rescue her from various unsuitable liaisons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystified","review":"This is the only book of Hemmingway's that I have read, and perhaps it's therefore unfair to characterize him by just one effort. However, I chose this because it seemed to be recognized as one of his best.Alas, for me, this book was nothing more than dead ordinary. If this is all that there is to Ernest Hemmingway, I am mystified as to why he has such fame. It's pretty pedestrian stuff, that (forgive me Hemmingway devotees) is really not worthy of notice. It is not awful, just awfully average. He makes no great mistakes, but also fails to do a single thing that would elevate him above the teeming ranks of authors out there. I slogged through it dutifully, waiting for the book to come alive, to show some wit, or intellect, or creative artistic expression, right down to the last page I was still waiting. And, I concluded - So! That's Ernest Hemmingway???Why does anyone care?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have Heard Every Reading","review":"All other published readings pale in comparison to this one. After careful listening, I believe that what Charlton Heston did as Santiago in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", William Hurt has done as Jake Barnes. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines the Lost Generation","review":"I decided to revisit this classic after reading The Paris Wife, which gives witness to Hemingway's inspiration for and creation of The Sun Also Rises. I enjoyed reading it in college and wanted to re-experience it as a more mature reader. Knowing more about Hemingway's life made me want to explore some of the autobiographical elements of the novel.Reading this book made me want to drink! I was amazed at how much was consumed, and Jake Barnes and his friends could turn their drunkenness on and off like a switch. They often used their \\"tightness\\" as an excuse for their unsavory behavior. The banter was somewhat redundant, but the bullfighting scenes were exciting. Hemingway really captured the atmosphere of Spain and Fiesta. He also illustrated the tension and combativeness of Jake's group, specifically between Robert Cohn and Brett and Mike. The moral ambiguity is at the heart of this book and it is an enduring commentary on the \\"lost generation.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific purchase!!","review":"This was a terrific purchase. The book was exactly as described. It arrived quickly and was well packaged to prevent damage during shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway at his finest.","review":"The Sun Also rises incorporates everything Hemingway is famous for: his terse prose, his disillusioned characters, an exotic backdrop. Having been taught this book by a Hemingway scholar, I've come to appreciate the novel so much more. Hemingway writes subtley, so each reread is like uncovering a hidden layer of the characters. All wonderfully complex, Jake Barnes narrates a web of disillusionment and confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ REVIEWS.","review":"I needed the novel, The Sun Also Rises by E.

In our English III Honors - American Literature class, this has been by far, the most boring book. Although there were other books that we teenage readers could not identify with, some of them have been quite enjoyable.This book is the exception. It is dull, nothing happens, the dialogue is confusing and always pointless. The spend a good part of the book talking about nothing. It's like watching Seinfield without anything funny.This book is so boring that the cliff notes are boring.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE TO FOR AN ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS ONE OF HEMINGWAY'S WORST WORKS.

The dialogue (of which most of the book is written)is corny and the only charcters worth saving are the natives that are encountered in the Basque Region and Pamplona.Thankfully Hemingway wrote less than 200 pages. I kept hoping that the story would end with Lady Ashley, Jake Barnes, Robert Cohen, and the other \\"ugly americans\\" and arrogant Brits entering a detox center and becoming the initial success stories of AA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those who feel \\"lost\\"","review":"I had to read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" for school. As a sixteen-year-old, I could very well say how much I thought the story [was bad] but in all honest, I really enjoyed this book. I was about the \\"Lost Generation\\" feeling out of place after World War I. Trying to go on with there lives in a war that changed their lives forever. They are looking for meaning for life and truth and freedom.I think the thing that made me so intrigued in this book is that ii was a real story. About real people. And there real problems. Real people, trying to grab a hold onto thier lives. Trying to find where they belong. With there same old boring problems and their same old mixed up lives.This book, in a way, speaks to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sun?","review":"I thought this novel was quite boring. Let me give you the bottom line. A group of people drank at clubs to get away from their problems and all they thought about was sex. Everyone is this story is so concerned about themselves that it's sickening. All they think about is how they need to satisfy their sexual needs and to cope with that, they drank like every night. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have gone through all of this. He doens't deserve all this pain. He's an innocent man that just wants his \\"crush\\" Brett to return his love.This novel is somewhat similar to modern life now. People do drink to get away from their everyday troubles. But after reading this novel, you realize that love is not about sex. It's about true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snapshot of a generation","review":"The point of TSAR is not to convey any specific story, but the general story of the Lost Generation. The focus on atmospheric detail and characterisation rather than plot is purposeful. Hemingway gives us a portrait of youths who are aimless, without moral centre and weakened/impotent.A similar work, from ten years ago rather than eighty, is Douglas Coupland's Generation X. I recommend reading both: the deja vu is palpable. Those of us who are Gen X or Y might not find much comfort in having Hemingway as a partner in disillusionment and malaise, but it is at least heartening that those generations that get \\"lost\\" can still produce such beautiful (if stark) literature.The Sun Also Rises is not only a classic, it is as relevant in 2001 as the 1920s. It's also good for the Spanish tourism industry ;-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway's First Novel","review":"The Sun Also Rises is Hemingway's first novel. His style is lean, but there is really a breadth of depth to it. At the time of its initial release, F. Scott Fitzgerald provided suggested edits to it which Hemingway followed if not begrudgingly. I found the novel to be entertaining, full of people from a time gone by and I can only recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand the test of time","review":"On my third attempt, I finally made it all the way through The Sun Also Rises. I forced myself to finish it, even though the plot never engaged my interest and the dialog is terribly dated and worn. I read it to see what make it a classic. To me, the book doesn't stand the test of time. To quickly paraphrase the story: We ate. We walked over there. We drank and ate. We walked over here. We argued. We watched a bullfight. We drank some more... If there is something \\"important\\" about this book I missed it. If you're a fan of clever dialog and would like something a bit more current, I'd recommend \\"The City of Your Final Destination\\" by Peter Cameron or \\"The City of Thieves\\" by David Benioff."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as i expected.","review":"i had to read this book for school, and although it was good at times, i would never even think of reading it on my own. the first part was really boring and did not contribute anything to the whole book. about the second part, im a very patient person, but having the same thing happening over and over again without any action was really making the book longer and longer. seriously, every single day the characters did the same exact thing: drink, argue, drink, drink, and argue again. the only thing i liked about the book was the way hemingway wrote it. he really has beautiful and very poetical writing. im from spain, and i was really surprised at how exact his descriptions are of my country. though sometimes his descriptions were boring and lengthy, it was almost as if you were reading a photograph. i just think the story wasnt that great... my point is: why read the book? just come to spain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was there once","review":"SAR was my first Hemingway book I read. I was in Europe with a friend whom had read SAR and she kept telling me about the book, the bullfights, the partying, lady Brett, Cohn the boxer, Romero the young and handsome bullfighter. Upon returning to the states my friend gave me a copy and again I was back in France and Spain. I could definitely relate the all night drinking, visiting the bullfighting arena and hearing the brute stories of the fights. Hemingway puts you in the story with his vivid description of the mountain sides in Spain and fresh water fly fishing. Who needs a European vacation? SAR takes you there without leaving the comfort of your own home. I've now read it twice and I've also read Hemingway's Short Stories. I'm not an everyday book reader, but now I realize what I've missed. If you are not a Hemingway fan this book is a great start,but if you've read it before enjoy SAR one more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it?","review":"After reading \\"The Paris Wife,\\" I decided to read Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" I kept reading even though I found the dialog tedious and uninteresting. Surely there will be something coming ahead that has made this book a classic I thought. As it turned out, there was nothing ahead but more of the same. If this is one of Hemingway's better novels, I won't be reading any others! Don't waste your time on this one unless you want to read a bunch of empty dialog between shallow, selfish, and soulless individuals who don't learn anything but how to continue on their own destructive paths while inflicting harm on others. However no one dies or is severely injured, because that would be too memorable or interesting for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please remember that this is his first novel!","review":"Just a quick comment for all of you that think this novel deserves 5 stars. It does not! This is Hemingway's first novel and as such it shows a young developing artist attempting to find his voice and build his craft. Like many writers at this stage he does not fully make the grade. If you read say \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" immediately after this book you will be able to see a great leap forward in Hemingway's prose within just the first 20 pages (to say nothing of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\"). Please restrain from making a book that deserves a \\"3\\" at most into a 5. (By the way I have lived in Paris and been to the running of the bulls so this book was a treat for me on that level). Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing \\"classic\\" unworthy of its fame","review":"This is one of those books that I always wanted to read, but somehow never did. That is, until just recently. I suppose I was caught up in the romance and adventure of a Hemingway yarn, but \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" just didn't cut it for me. What well-read reader with an interest in history could not be attracted to the group of post World War I expatriates living in Paris? If this book was any real indication of the life that Hemingway lived, I am afraid that the whole scene of getting drunk and watching bull fights just isn't for me. I found Hemingway's prose to be too simple, and the story line did not hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listening to this \\"Hurt\\" me!","review":"William Hurt cannot read. At all. The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt's reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable.

There should be a warning label, \\"Danger, listening to William Hurt's reading of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is known to nauseate expectant listeners\\".On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway's works including \\"True at First Light\\" read by Brian Dennehy and \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" read by John Slattery.

It left me wondering what all the praise could possibly be about. It also left me completely dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost generation, aimless novel.","review":"We have only one life to live, so we can find some subjects worth reading and thinking about. This lost generation that is depicted in this badly written book is not one of them. Think about unsung heroes from generations that survive lesser known genocides, and the people who galvanize a society after unspeakable destructions brought by ruthless revolutonaries, guerillas, and militias. There are far better books written by less-known authors about these \\"lost generations\\" that do not go about aimlessly drinking, binging, and partying but instead do something more noble and redeeming, even in small ways. If only Hemingway were not so famous, anyone can recognize that this book of his was written in such a mediocre way, and he unfortunately chose a sad and hopeless subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Note...","review":"The Sun Also Rises is indeed an amazing novel and I'll leave it at that. I would like to point out to a few of the \\"reviewers\\" who have waxed poetic about \\"the lost generation\\" quote that maybe they should read An Immovable Feast to get the history (Hemingway's version) of this overused label. You might not find it so metaphoric. Also, this novel was during Hemingways slice of life period. Many of his companions were leary of mentioning stories in front of him for they would be incorporated into whatever he was working on at the time. The story of Robert Cohen and the trip from Paris to Spain were real events, Bill was based on Robert Benchly and another cohort, and the reason Jake is impotent is because Hemingway was married at the time (Pretty deep, huh). Anyway- Strip off the psudosymbolic layers and take the story for a story. You'll find the soul without the searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Indolent Life","review":"This is Hemingway at his best, a straightforward simple narrative which gives an insight as to how one group of people lived their lives in the 1920's. It amazed me that they could get by without working (Jake excepted) and drink to the extent that they did. But they all appear as self-centred and at the end it's difficult to have any sympathy for them, again, Jake excepted-possibly! After all, he was prepared to live the same life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sun Also Rises\\".

I am yet to find anything appealing about Hemingway's writing. They almost seem to be written by a child, there is never a story being told, the characters are always underdeveloped and flat, the dialogue is mind numbing. They are just outright Boring..I read The Sun Also Rises about a month ago and I can hardly remember anything about it.Perhaps they relate to that generation only and do not carry over ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"I've been looking forward to reading this novel for a long time, as Hemingway is considered one of the greatest American writers who ever lived. Sorry folks, but I can't believe this pile of garbage is considered an all time classic. If I wrote this and took it to a publisher he would have thrown it in the garbage after a few minutes. I can't believe so many people gave this meandering, meaningless piece of trash all the stellar reviews. I will never read another Hemingway...and I was looking forward to reading them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic author","review":"The review of this book should be one of great raving and wonderful words. Hemingway is a classic writer and revered by many and has earned his place in the literary world. For me, this book is very dry and drawn out. It is slow moving and the point of the story is hard to decipher.Jake Barnes is a writer and Lady Brett Ashley is wealthy and goes through her life drinking and with no purpose. The story describes their relationship and lives. The story did not hold my attention and was not one that caused me to stay up all night to finish reading.William Hurt is a good actor but as a reader his inflection did not work for me. I had a difficult time telling which character was which by voice alone.All in all, I am more interested in writers of mystery, crime and science fiction than I am in a classic author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I had high hopes for this book being that it was from Hemingway and regarded so highly by so many people. But I just dont get it. The metaphors and whatnot are not lost on me. But they arent that profound. Not only does this book not really say anything as you're reading it, I mean nothing happens in this book, but the message that it is trying to deliver is not so hot either. I like to read books that say something profound about humanity. When I read a book I like for my thoughts to run wild with new ideas and understanding about mankind. This book was a chore and delivered none of this. I've read the positive reviews here, but this stuff that people point out just isnt that fun or interesting to read. The point that the book makes could be made in one chapter, or could be a side point to a more interesting tale. I give it two stars instead of one because I was able to finish it (although perhaps that was because I expected to eventually be rewarded and it wasnt that long)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing","review":"I'm sorry. I love to read. I love classics. But I would have to be able to discuss this in class or a book club to enjoy it. Hemingway's style is absolutely aggravating unless you read it with an eye of appreciation for what it did to American literature. This is probably a great read within a group, but I hated it as I trudged through it on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I've never read Hemmingway before and thought I would give this book a shot since it was his first novel. Can anyone say boring??? Hemmingway's use of run-on sentences and mindless detail describing insignificant things bored me to tears. It seems his characters basically spend their time drinking, drinking, and more drinking. I couldn't wait to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok read - but there's better stuff out there...","review":"I suppose its bad form to say something negative about a classic like The Sun Also Rises, but to me the book clearly demonstrated the emptiness and futility of living a life without purpose. I think this book communicates a message about a generation of utterly lost individuals - searching for meaning and significance in the trivial stuff they do, but in the end living lives of despair without true happiness. Great book to read for that significant life lesson - and the fact that Hemingway writes so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a fast read and features some very beautiful writing by Ernest Hemingway. It is populated by some rather affectless Paris expatriates who decide to visit Pamplona. One, Jake Barnes, is a strong man with an unfortunate wound. Another, Brett Ashley, would like to be Jake Barnes' girlfriend but can't be. They and their friends experience drama and calamity but fortunately have plenty of alcohol at hand to numb themselves with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Sun Also Rises","review":"\\"One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever...The sun alos ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to the place where he arose...The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits...All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.\\"-EcclesiastesHemingway's theme is that of immediacy. As he draws readers into the scenes and dialogue, they are easily tricked into becoming characters of the story. There is a simple, active writing style that's easy to understand. Figuring out the underlying meanings that fall in between Hemingway's words is a more difficult task. It's a great book with many implications that deal with human nature. Read it for fun and read it to realize how easily people go through life without actually living it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"Having previously read - and enjoying immensly Hemingways \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" this was a disapointment. I did not understand this book. It was neither entertaining, funny, deep, or even enjoyable. Nothing happened. I have no idea why it is a so called classic, and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Very Dull","review":"The book is about the protagonist Jake Barnes. It details his many days as an expat in Spain and France. The trouble is that there isn't much to his days except for drinks, breakfast, lunch, and more drinks. Jake and his friends, Robert, Mike, and Bill along with the loose Lady Brett Ashley get soused and dance at bars and argue and drink and vie for the attention of said loose Lady Brett Ashley. Mike is Ashley's current beau but Robert keeps trying to take her away while Jake(who says he's already been with Lady Ashley) is still secretly in love with her and suffers in silence.Throw in a bull fight or two along with a fist fight between Robert and Jake, an affair between the bullfighter, Pedro Romero and the loose Lady Brett Ashley and you have the entirety of the 251 page boring melodrama.If you are at all curious who the 34 year old loose Lady Brett Ashley chooses in the end, you'll have to suffer through reading the entire bunk like I did or skip to page 247."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillfully written but boring","review":"As someone who thought Old Man and the Sea and Green Hills of Africa were masterpieces, this was a huge disappointment. Hemmingways skill as a writer is evident. The plot was exceptionally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story about immoral alcoholics","review":"My main beef with this book was that no one was likable AT ALL. They were all a bunch of morally-bankrupt, selfish and snobby rich Americans who trot all over Europe satisfying their whims and drinking themselves into oblivion, all while imposing their disgusting lives on other people.(Autobiographical?) If you took out every reference to how drunk these people got, this would be a 50-page novella. You might say, \\"That's what Hemingway was trying to portray\\". OK, in that sense this was a powerful book because the characters' pathetic lives were so vividly impressed upon my mind. Perhaps. However, I could never recommend this novel for the very subject matter and tone of the novel. Hemingway's writing is, simply put, bizarre. He translates Spanish syntax anad phrasing into English, which results in awkward-sounding phrases and his descriptive abilities are marginal. I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read!","review":"I just loved the attitude in this book. The way these people looked on love. They did't let it suffocate them, it came as something natural. Like breathing. Life might have been hard, but they didn't let it bother them. And yet there was nothing brave or heroic in them. That came naturally as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"THE SUN ALSO RISES is one of my favorite books, and easily Hemingway's best (he thought so, too). One thing RISES has that Hemingway's later novels didn't is personality. Hemingway's later novels were very dry in tone (and I love them), and the characters spoke with verbal sterility (Richard Ford wrote that Hemingway's characters sound somewhat like robots. This description could in no way apply to RISES' characters). THE SUN ALSO RISES has humor and life, and the best dialogue I've ever read. I've read parts of RISES countless times. It's been knocked for being a collection of vignettes, and not strong on plot (and I don't consider \\"plot\\" a sin like some literary snobs do). But the vignettes (that do serve the story) are so beautifully crafted, they are a pure pleasure to read. There are two books I've read where, in parts, I wish I could have stepped inside the books and lived what was happening. WAR AND PEACE is one. THE SUN ALSO RISES is the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Jealousy!","review":"This is a timeless book about how pettiness and jealousy and alcohol and loose lips can ruin relationships. It's also a look at how people try to drink to numb the pain that life provides. Jake, Robert, Brett and the others in this book are the arty, literary type who go to Paris to watch the bullfighting and the running of the bulls, but are soon torn apart by factions, fighting, and pettiness.The book is set in 1926 Spain and France, but it speaks of issues that transcend time and culture. It's not a great story, but it captures in a classic way a timeless problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Novel","review":"This is the first Hemingway novel I have read.I both enjoyed it and found it puzzling. I disliked the characters yet also liked them. I enjoyed Hemingway's prose style. Some of the descriptions, the constant moving about from bar to bar, is rather a nuisance in a sense, yet also entirely necessary in that it serves to parallel the overall scheme of the novel.Well worth reading, even if just to admire Hemingway's style. Like another person pointed out, this reads much like an extended short story. The fishing trip is very nice; the best scene, which had me most into the book, was the when the boxer got a few punches in--!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Perfect Book","review":"This book is comes as close to capturing ecsasty as any book possibly could. It is as if Hemingway cut a physical chunk out of his life--all the passion and love and pain--and handed it to you on a tray. This book is a litmus test. Anyone who relates to it knows feelings of over-extension, failure, and desperateness. But, like the title says, the sun also rises: these characters, far from at peace with themselves, revel in what they do have. It is my favorite book and the most complete, revealing, book into a man's life ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Part of the Twentieth Century Mindscape.","review":"Hemingway captures the disillusionment of a generation jilted by the Great War. He captures the nuances, feel, and attitude of this \\"Lost Generation.\\" This is a piece which captures the mind set of a people after the most signifigant event in modern history. But this is not just a chronicle. Hemingway's sentences are so simple yet when deciphered (even blurbs of dialouge that don't play with the scene or theme) we come to realize earthly truths from every color of the spectrum of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfunny Friends episode w/good travelogue of Spain","review":"Several self-centered ugly Americans get drunk repeatedly in Parisian and Spanish locales. This novel maybe might have been 2 good short stories, one about fly fishing in Spain, one about the running of the bulls and the bullfight--those parts were lovely, but the characters and plot were boring and pointless, and worse, ugly. Perhaps the novel had more of a shock value in 1927 with the descriptions of promiscuity by an English lady and the drunkenness of the characters, but unfortunately all of our cities,d suburbs, TV sets and movies are filled with adolescents doing the same things. The later works and the Nick Adams stories are so much better than this. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"william hurt can't read","review":"this is the worst audio book i have ever listened to. william hurt is a well-known actor but doesn't know how to read. he reads this book as if he is just learning how to read. he pauses every other word. hemingway perfected a spare stripped down style that made his writing revolutionary. hurt's reading is the opposite. caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anomalous","review":"I have a great deal of respect for writers who can produce great literature composed of simple language. Hemingway has always been one of those authors who I've held up to others as an exemplar of such writing, and I was surprised to find such an ordinary piece of work in Fiesta. His charcterisation, which is usually so deeply and thoughtfully evoked by memoir and circumstance,is flat and unmotivated in Fiesta. The plot is weak, the drama shallow and the interpersonal relationships are at best puzzling.If this is your first encounter with Hemingway, don't give up - \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" are all magnificent, and EMH deserves his reputation as one of this century's greatest authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemingway? To Have or Have Not?","review":"So, yeah.. I read The Sun Also Rises.. twice. I even watched the movie. There is nothing interesting here. His prose plods along. His characters say 'extroadinary' things. They drink. They are 'just too much', they argue ..oh, well.No, I'll never get why people like Hemingway. What fascinates me about this book is how someone can take such interesting characters and paint them in such a dull manner. What can be done with this book? Do as Hemingway always said. Be practical, take a book like this and use it practically. Roll it up, ..wow! ..it's a small cricket bat or tennis racket! Yeah, maybe he'd like that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm and hypnotic","review":"Hemingway's simplistic style is surprizingly hypnotic.

At some points it was very interesting and at other times somewhat boring. The book also had its points where it was a little difficult to understand.

Even though the book wasn't terrible its not something that I would just pick up and read in my spare time.The book had its good points. The book had a lot to do with stuff that is going on today. That is one reason that I continued reading the book. If it wasn't for the many problems in the book I doubt I would have finished it. I also think it had I little too much going on because it reminded me of a soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sun Also Rises Review","review":"Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is a tragic, enteretaining and important story. The author captured the feelings of desperation, and hopelessnes that the author along with many other survivors of the trenches experienced after WWI. This book is, I believe, is especially important now as America embarks upon another war. We should read this and remember the devasting effects war can have on a generation of young people.I also think that The Sun Also Rises, a timeless classic, no doubt.No other author could capture such a tragedy as elegently as hemmingway. But i think its a bit hard to follow, and understand easily. But this book contains good contents and good use of words."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First and Best Hemmingway Book","review":"The Sun Also Rises is, in my view, the best of Ernest Hemingway's novels. it is full of good humor, raucous characters and interesting events. it is upbeat and optimistic even in its downbeat moments. Unlike his later books there is none of the pending doom that foreshadows the action. The story centers around a small group of relatively young persons who start out in Paris and then go to see the bull fights in Pamplona, Spain. They drink a lot, argue a lot, and then drink some more. it is all good fun and sometimes sad. The dialogue is as good as it gets. If you haven't read anything by Hemingway, this is the place to start. If you have read some of his other works, but not this one, then you are missing something that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst crap I ever read and that's putting it mildly!","review":"I was so bored reading this book. After reading the grammatically incorrect sentences on the first page, I should have stopped. However, I was lulled by the great Hemingway name and continued onto the dull, dry book. It was so hard not editing his badly constructed sentences. They call this prose? Hah!!! No flow, no plot, not much in adventure and I could not wait to finish, just to see if anything was indeed worth the read. NOT! Don't waste your time and money.

I have even read Hemingway and loved it. I couldn't finish this book.Their is more dialogue than anything else. The dialogue gets very confusing and repetitive. It seems unreal. I don't see real people talking that way. Now, that might be because I don't hang out with people who spend their lives in foreign countries and party every day and night.That's something else. All they do is drink, flirt, eat, and go to another party. They also insult each other and then are best friends. Maybe after I go through and read some analysis and commentary on it, I might enjoy it better. But I shouldn't have to do all that to enjoy a book.There are some that find this book outstanding. Great! Read on. This just wasn't for someone likes to read for enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expats Party From Paris to Pamplona","review":"I have actually heard more than one person say that \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is their favorite book.

The four men in the group are all in love with the one woman to some extent. And the woman has affection of some type for each of the men.There is some humorous drunken dialogue from time to time. There are some good descriptions of bullfighting and trout fishing . Beyond that, there is not much to recommend \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"There is very little story to be told. The book reads like the travel journal of a lovesick person that has been translated from another language into English. Perhaps it just hasn't aged as well as some of Hemingway's other work. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was lost on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Forget to Think","review":"This is a response to some of the other reviews. You have to remember that there are such things as symbolism and metaphor in literature. Also, there is historical context to keep in mind when reading this novel.

Example, the bull fighting is not there just for entertainment, it is also a metaphor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn fine!","review":"Having visited Pamplona during the \\"Running of the Bulls,\\" this book has a little more added meaning for me. Nevertheless, the book should be enjoyed by most everyone who reads it. Don't buy it looking for action or adventure, it has very little. Knowledge of the Spanish countryside makes the book more enjoyable, but is definitely not a requirement. Anyway, it is a great story of Jake Barnes, an expatriate of the first world war, who seemingly just can't catch a break. He is injured in the war and is unable to perform sexually because of it. He is hopelessly in love with Lady Brett Ashley who is a nymphomaniac, for lack of a better term. he seems all alone because he can never have the one he loves and he struggles to find a meaning to all this nonsense happening around him.

I liked it ... not loved, but liked it enough to read more of his work. But this one ... I struggled through it. I felt like each page was the same -- group of friends who don't all like each other and lots and lots of alcohol.

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DREGS (1979) catches the band at a key transitional point. While essentially a studio album, some tracks are from a 1978 concert featuring new keyboard player T. Lavitz, whose synthesizer work would become an important part of the band's sound. Throughout the album, Steve Morse's fiery guitar, Allen Sloan's Jean-Luc-Ponty-on-Wild Turkey violin, and Rod Morgenstern's frenetic, popping bass all play demolition derby amid metrically and harmonically sophisticated compositions that still offer plenty of visceral satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Account of One Ballet Student's Experience","review":"This was an interesting story and it gave a good feel for the drive and obsession that is associated with being a standout ballet student and ultimately a professional dancer. This was a very subtle book, however....in some ways, it seemed that very little actually happened within its pages and that much of the activity was felt, implied, unspoken, and under the surface. I feel that the girl's teacher, F., acted very cowardly in his final act and was very much to blame in making the heroine feel that she was \\"above the law\\" at his ballet school....no doubt driving her over-confident behavior. Overall, an interesting read for anyone interested in the day-to-day lifestyle and requirements of a ballet dancer in-the-making!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncaptivating","review":"As a former dancer I was intrigued by reviews of this book. It turned out to be a complete waste of my time. The writing was dull and thoroughly uncaptivating.

Freud wrote it deliberately for the ordinary reader at the turn of the 20th century and, as fresh editions appeared, constantly added new illustrations and anecdotes without changing his basic theories.Here, with brief examples, we have the simple but convincing explanations of things that are familiar to everybody: the sudden forgetting of proper names, of sets of words, impressions and intentions, childhood and 'screen' memories; bungled actions and other errors; and all those little, significant mistakes of tongue and pen that have come to be called 'Freudian slips'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly converted book","review":"This book was stolen from a Canadian sight and is riddled with omissions of words that make many sections incomprehensible.

Penned by five scribes including the director, Lee Shin-ae, who previously wrote Fox Stairs, and Lee Hyo-chul, responsible for Hanbando, it is a dreadful mishmash of different agendas and styles, without any coherent sense of what it's groping for.And if you were hoping for more backstory on the \\"Family Curse\\" the movie teasers warn you about, forget about it: that theory got thrown away faster than Ka-In's unlucky aunt on her wedding day."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!

I started the book as bed-time reading, but found (to my wife's disgust) that it was keeping me awake at night. In the end, I had to devote a Saturday morning to finishing the book for domestic harmony.If your idea of a good read is a slam-bang space opera with cardboard characters, this is not the book for you. But if you like your books to be thoughtful and thought-provoking, with excellent characterization, then this is the one.Bova's strength is his ability to really make the characters in his books come to life. The scientists in the novel were just like some of my friends, struggling with the issue of how do you get someone to pay for your hobby and indignant that someone might actually want to make a profit from it. The mystery and tension built throughout the novel, making it harder and harder to put down. It was great.I am looking forward to reading Bova's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt like I was on Mars.","review":"This book ( along with it's prequal- MARS ) was so vivid and real that I felt like I standing on the cold Martian surface.

From the deeply spiritual Indian(Waterman) to the rapacious, overbearing capitalist(Trumball Sr.), each major character was a carefully crafted melange of superficiality and blandness. The prequel to this book had all these elements but they superseded by the scientific elements. The speculative exploration of Olympus Mons could have been interesting but had to be sacrificed to make room for the broadsides at Trumball and capitalists in general. I reccomend the first. I regret my impulse buy of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre.","review":"This is the sequel to Bova's \\"Mars\\" novel, which was a more-than-tolerable read. This novel was barely worth finishing. Essentially, Bova is plumping against the notion that those awful Earth capitalists might exploit Mars by wanting to go there. The politics in the first novel were asinine, in this one just plain wierd. Somehow Bova has an American Indian tribe claiming the rights to most of Mars, thereby keeping the great unwashed capitalist masses away from Mars. Yeah, like that's going to happen.Bova's Left-wing political slant is worse in this novel than it was in \\"Mars.\\" It gets worse, by the way, in \\"Venus\\" which I was unable to finish, and therefore have not reviewed.I gave this book 2 stars because I was able to finish it.

The message, which Bova beats the reader over the head with the subtalty of a sledgehammer, interfeers with what otherwise is an exciting story of exploration rich with scientific and technical detail. Those space enthusiasts who dream of Mars as a new home for human kind will likely take exception to Bova's anticapitalist, antihuman tone and the message that Mars must become a science reserve, closed to human settlement and development. Because of this controversial view, Return to Mars if nothing else might stirr heated debate on what shape space exploration should take in the coming century.--Mark R.

To start with the bad news, the game is not durable at all. Once the solution is worked out it cannot be played again by any of the same players. One thing you should make sure of then is that none of your potential guests have played this before (you might want to do this even before you buy the game).Another weakness is the plot, which is what you are trying to put together to find the bad guy/girl. There are way too many red herrings, over too many hours, to try to deduce the culprit. The actual chain of events is very obscure and the clues don't clearly illuminate it. This means that however much fun you and your friends have in playing the characters at the end it's a dissatisfying experience in terms of solving a mystery.Overall I'd say it's a good way to have some fun if you just want a laugh and don't care too much about the outcome or how you got there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey but superb taste and texture!","review":"This is the best gluten-free pasta I have ever purchased, HANDS DOWN.It's firm and holds up to stirring with a spoon while it's cooking, and it's really delicious.

But if you have gluten senstivity, or if you prefer a brown rice pasta (healthier alternative) it is the BEST one on the market.I bought this one and the curly pasta, and both were equally good. So I assume that all of the brown rice pasta by this company is going to be good.It also takes a little longer to cook-- about 17 minutes. And you should stir it frequently so that it cooks evenly.

The author apparently has no particular love for her subject, his music, or for the musical theatre. She describes all three dispassionately, most likely getting her facts right and offering us occasional quotes from people who knew Rodgers. But the book itself never catches fire.

But the book itself left me cold, which was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Recycled","review":"This is a very dull biography of a man who has yet to receive a good one. It's full of familiar stories and no new insights. The character of Rodgers himself never once comes alive; he remains a cypher.

However, one has to start somewhere and this particular cd (one of a series by various artists on Verve) serves a distinct need for the jazz fan......you and I. As such this was my low budget introduction, used, at that, eight years ago.I still play this and find it a good compilation of Evans with such artists as Jim Hall, Eddie Gomez, Jack DeJohnette, Shelly Manne and the orchestral accompanyment under the direction of Claus Ogerman.

Frank McCourts books are better if you want a feel of Ireland, albeit from an earlier time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are We to Make of Computers, and Computers Make of Us","review":"Winograd and Flores' \`Understanding Computers and Cognition' proposes that the rationalist tradition in AI must be replaced by a hermeneutic approach. Associating the rationalist tradition with the goal of building a human mind, the authors propose that a hermeneutic approach must adopt the goal of constructing prostheses which magnify the human mind. This paper argues that what AI needs is not so much a hermeneutic approach as a better appreciation of biology and psychology. Understanding Computers and Cognition is a groundbreaking book that presents an important new approach to understanding what computers do and how their functioning is related to human language, thought and action. Byte Magazine has recognized Understanding Computers and Cognition as one of the all-time 20 most influential books on information technology.Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and Brilliant","review":"Understanding Computers and Cognition is an excellent book giving the right background and walks you nicely to understand all the notion of Speech act, Intention driven comversations and how these can be translated to a computer software.

I'm a gamer, though not a hardcore one, but this mouse does an okay job.I'd recommend this product to anyone as a great general use mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I bought this because the old one I had completely quit working.

Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bianca Ryan Superstar","review":"Well.... Bianca's rendition of \\"The Rose\\" and \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" are just so moving - actually brought tears to my eyes. I am amazed at not only her beautiful voice but the soulful inspiration she projects. I bought 2 copies fo this CD for starters & will probably buy several more for friends & family. Actually the only song I didn't much care for was the bouncy Christmas tune.... even so, I'd buy the recording just to hear \\"Rose\\", IBICF and \\"And I Am Telling You\\"...... incredible vocals. Love this girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bianca Rocks","review":"There are several excellent songs on Bianca's Cd. Everyone is going to have their favorites but here is my picks, Pray for a Better Day, Awake,I wish that,and I will all are potential hits. They are very catchy and Bianca nails them. For the older crowd, The Rose, You light up my life, and I believe I can fly will be pleasers and my prediction is that Superstar and Why couldnt it be Christmas Everyday will be chart toppers. Overall an excellent album. I forgot to mention And Im telling You. This is the Jennifer Holiday version and its very jazzy so there is something for everyone on this Cd. As for my fellow reviewer who complained about some ot the lyrics. With songs now days if we are going to complain about them Bianca will be left to singing Row row row your boat. Lyrics that are going to appeal to a mass audience probably will have some adult situations. Anyways get this CD you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I heard Bianca on America's Got Talent. She was great then, and she is even better on this CD.

She makes me cry when I hear her and very few singers can move me to that! Her voice is soooo soothing and better than people twice her age. Her whole CD is great. Can't wait for the next one. Awesome job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Bianca's voice and singing ability is nothing short of breathtaking. More than a few big-name have attempted to sing The Rose, all have failed to evoke anywhere near the same visceral effect that Bette Midler does.

But I should mention that the cd has selections from Brothers And Sisters album which does not truly include long jam songs. Wasted Words is played the way it should be, that is: slow. But if you prefer a vibrant song jump to Sothbound.Sothbound is as brilliant as the studio version, and it truly is a classic. Ramblin' Man is another live gem here. In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed is shorter than it is on LIVE AT FILLMORE EAST, this is a drawback, in my opinion. The great epic Jessica finishes the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"where the Live at the Fillmore album, the bands 1971 masterpiece, is arguably the greatest album of all time, this is, in my humble opinion. the worst live album by a major band ever. One star is too good a rating. The beginning of the end of the first golden age of the band. The rhythm section is asleep, Dicky is too busy worrying about whether to be called Dicky or Richard to play with passion, and Gregg doesn't know where he is. AVOID AT ALL COST. BE THANKFUL IT IS OUT OF PRINT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid 70's gem with a twist","review":"I just listened to this recording and i have to say i was very impressed, several of the live tunes have a more jazz flavored tempo due to the excellent work of longtime Stones pianist Chuck Leavell. The high points include Elizabeth Reed, Southbound and Jessica all delivered with skill by the brothers lineup at the time. With D. Betts doing all the guitar work and the added keyboard the listener experiences a tight 6 man unit delivering the tunes with the skill and precision that the ABB are known for. I don't understand the critical reviews of this CD as the performances are top notch and the song selection is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best","review":"I think this is the best Allman Brothers release. It was not ground breaking or released in a magic age like Fillmore East was, but it is fantastic. OK, Fillmore East was great but after listening to it for 70 minutes you need a rest - very high volume, high speed and twanging electric guitars all the way. You need a rest and an ear message after listening. On Wipe the Windows, there is time for great piano work from Chuck Leavel, organ from Greg A. and a great dual drum workout. And William's bass, especially on Jessica is stunning. Betts starts off many solos laid back, but the energy and intensity slowly builds. (Filmore East hits you with the speed immediately). I love this and Filmore East but this is the best and their live versions here are far better than their studio versions of the same songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I think back..,","review":"It was 1979 and almost every big 60/70's act was making a comeback. At the time I knew little of Duane Allman (that would change of course later). I've bought this album on vinyl and cd many times and for some reason it keeps coming up missing. Back to the story. As a group we had all just seen Yes, The Moody Blues and Alice Cooper and the older folks wanted to go see this group called The Allman Brothers and I was happy to tag along. I had never seen anything like it before and this was the album they were touring for. Since then I would work for The Allman Brothers many,many times but it would not be the same as that night at The Forum.Buy this album!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left something to be desired","review":"Although laced with facts it posed no new ideas and a majority of the reading was difficult due to confusion on which Franklin was being refered to. the Inclusion of the letters and speaches in the back was very informitive but if you are truly interested go to the library and just look up the such for yourself.

I have yet to see a \\"bad\\" one, or one I did not like. However, the part in this movie was far too lightweight for him. He's much too good of an actor to be in such of a role. He's best in tough-guy parts. He fits those like a glove.This film, which is about a couple's desire to have children, is a good film for the most part, but it doesn't do him justice. He was miscast in this part. This is a Cary Grant type of film. Doris Day is sweet and lovely, as usual, but Gig Young is totally annoying. His part could have been deleted completely.As I said, the story itself is pretty good, but it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - Just Awful","review":"As a big fan of Doris Day movies - movies that my family watches over & over - read the reviews posted - and bought the VHS. Richard Widmark's acting is dreadful. Too bad he had the lead! Doris Day & Gig Young terrific as usually, but Widmark's performance was so bad it ruined what could have been a delightful movie. Every new buzz word & phrase popular at that time was in the dialogue making the scenes awful & phoney. Have seen Widmark in other films and enjoyed his performances - not sure why he bombed here.

This movie fails on so many levels, it's hard to know where to start.Let's start with the phantom himself, Julian Sands. He is handsome, well built and doesn't even have to wear a mask. DOES THIS SOUND LIKE A GUY RAISED IN A SEWER BY RATS! Asia Argento isn't bad, she just doesn't have a whole lot of interesting things to do. The photography is REALLY played down not only for a horror, but for an Argento flick. The music is bland and the ending is truly upsetting.If you want a good Argento movie, see \\"Terror At The Opera\\"(AKA Opera), \\"Deep Red\\", or even \\"Suspiria.\\" But this....well you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - not widescreen!","review":"The viewer from Oakland is correct. I have so far tried two DVDS of this, and on each disc the supposedly widescreen side turned out to be full-frame with nothing but a slightly stretched look to suggest it started out as anamorphic. I have no interest in watching a Dario Argento film in anything but the correct ratio - let's face it, we don't watch his films for the dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...just no...","review":"This was the worst version of the story I have ever seen, and I have seen nearly every form of it. The Phantom doesn't even have a mask. You cannot have a Phantom without a mask. And the movie seems to be little more than soft-core pornography. Gaston Leroux's novel is sensual, but *not* sexual. Perhaps this would be a good movie for horror/smut fans who have no interest in the actual story of Erik and Christine, but as a devoted Phan, I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"This movie is not worth the time, money or effort, Bad acting, silly special effects. What happened? This effort is far below any other of Dario Argentos work. I was looking forward to this and was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what happened when Daria left Dario","review":"As most Argento fans know, Daria was Dario's partner and collaborator from Deep Red on through Opera. In other words, she helped Dario achieve his great artistic peak that spanned about a decade, and spawned the lead actress of this film, Asia Argento. Well, if Daria can be given shared credit for Dario's greatest successes, perhaps we should blame her absence for this dismal, cheesy atrocity.I imagine this film would be painful and numbing for any viewer to watch, but it is especially excrutiating for a fan of Argento who has seen the masterpieces of which he is capable. At any rate, I urge everyone to stay far away from this debacle. Watching it is akin to undergoing the sadistic torture that Argento's villains subject their victims to in Dario's other films. You've been warned!One final note: don't confuse this movie, Phantom of the Opera, with Argento's much different and much better movie, Opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline sacrilegious...for a Phantom phan","review":"This movie, for Phans at least, would borderline on the sacrilegious edge. WHAT THE HECK? This is truly one of the WORST movies I have EVER watched. I can honestly say....I was nearly scarred for life! I had to watch the 1925 Chaney version, the 1990 Charles Dance movie, re-read the original novel and Susan Kay's \\"Phantom\\" over and over and over again JUST to cleanse my mind of the horrid movie I had watched. I was tempted to do an ALW mantra for days afterwards (and ALW is my least favorite composer these days...) DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!

I does have it's bright spots but not enough to save this film. I think that the idea for the film was good but the overall product was bad. The acting was atrocious, and some of the effects were totally unneccessary (i.e. the CGI sequences).To go one step further this DVD is flawed beyond belief, the dolby digital soundtrack on the WIDESCREEN side is miscued, so the music cues in late, voices do not match the lip movements.However the Pan and Scan side of the disc the soundtrack is perfectly in sync. Although I refuse to watch the Pan and Scan version of anything that was shot in widescreen, I viewed this when I found out the sound on the Widescreen side was flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily Argento's worst film to date","review":"This film, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, is without question, without doubt or without whatever, Italian horror director Dario Argento's worst film to date.... I'm of the belief that if you haven't got a good script, well then you haven't got a good movie either. And this film's script has no redeeming qualities. What were they thinking!? It's not scary. Not the least bit. And it never manages to be funny in a dark sort of way. It's just boring. So when the basic premise for the film is this lousy, it doesn't really matter if the photography is pretty and that the cast is all-in-all o.k. The film was simply built on a much too lousy foundation, and thus it crumbled to pieces upon where it stood. It's best that we just forget about PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and instead see SUSPIRIA one more time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dario Argento's Phantom of The Opera","review":"The Phantom of the Opera is one of the greatest stories ever told. It make a perfect horror theme and it's been done so many times. I called Argento the master of the kill because each one of his movies usually has one awesome kill. That all being said, this movie should have been a pure winner. Well, it's not. The opera scenes are beautiful, the music is good if not standard, but the story sucks. The Phantom is raised by rats and his face is not scarred at all. The one problem I had was during the kills the screen just turns black and all you hear is screams and thuds. I have no idea why they would do that but oh well.Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera is not the best version of the film by far. If your a hardcore fan of the story, movies, or Broadway plays then you may want to stay away. If you know nothing of the story and just want something to watch then i'd check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"It is not the best movie ever made but it is watchable, mainly due to Morricone's Music and the opera selections. Asia Argento plays the main heroine, young talented opera singer Christine. I don't think she was bad and her face is unbelievably beautiful - she reminds Olivia Hussey of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (1968) and Uma Thurman if Uma ever decides to dye her hair dark. Production values, costumes, special effects, decorations, and the singing voices are very good. I noticed that I laughed a lot during the film - perhaps Argento made a dark comedy of the familiar story?I did not like Julien Sands as a non-masked Phantom. He looks a lot like the creatures that raised him.The film has an orgy scene that is so funny it could've came directly from \\"Caligula\\"Overall - I had a lot of fun, and and can call it one of my guilty pleasures.2.5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dario Argento's worst effort","review":"This is easily Dario Argento's worst movie. It's got very little of his signature traits (most notably the cinematography), Ronnie Taylor's assistance (from Opera) doesn't help a lot either. It's biggest asset is easily Ennio Morricone's awesome musical score.What we do get however, is some over the top gore (well served, of course) but for this movie it simply doesn't apply. It seems also that handling romantic situations isn't Argento's cup of tea. The love story between Christine and the Phantom gets more ridiculous as the movie progresses. The brothel scene is a bit hard to take. And finally, the humour misses big time.That said, a bad Argento film is not a total bore at all. Julian Sands is good as the phantom and is not to blame for the movie being unsuccessful, the music is wonderful and we at least get a very original take on this often filmed classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting representation- very different from the book","review":"I did not care for this version. It is very gory in some places and it doesn't follow the plot of the book very much. I was surprised at how bad the story was displayed. The Phantom seems to be compared to rats too much, which was not in the book at all. Plus I didn't care for the settings because I had thought that the cellars under the opera house had been built, and in this movie they were catacombs of sort. I wouldn't reccommend this movie, read the book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the mask?!!","review":"I don't know if you really care but, contrary to the cover, the phantom in this film does not wear a mask (though judging from his horse-like face, maybe he should!). Personally, I think the movie itself is worse than any face a mask would ever hide. The plot is tampered with in the worst ways, the intimate scenes (which shouldn't even be there) are horribly scripted, and Christine's boyfriend is a complete jerk!Seriously, I can't think of any reason why anyone would want to make a POTO movie this way! I'm not even talking about the mask now, though the mask itself was somewhat symbolic in the original story. This is about taking a story and ripping virtually everything good from it. Yes ,there are some good parts, but they are few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting","review":"What should have been a tale of beauty and love, turned into one very obscene and pornographic film. I know that a lot of Phantom fans can't resist seeing something new with the name 'Phantom of the Opera' printed across the box, but please, if you want to remain your sanity, DO NOT SEE THIS!Christine prances around in see through nightgowns, she and Raoul have no chemistry, and Erik rapes her.

An uneven reinvention of the Phantom tale in which Argento borrows from Batman Returns and other films, then combines it with Odious Comic Relief (the ratcatchers) and falls far short of his masterworks. The score by Ennio Morricone is plush and beautiful, but borrows too heavily from his previous work (the tunnel chase is just the Roof Top Chase cue from The Untouchables reworked)."},{"rating":"1","title":"!

About this version I just have to say, it bites, nothin' else to it. I mean, did the people making the movie even read the book, see the musical, watch the Lon Chaney movie? Basically the only similarities between this and the other versions is that it's in an Opera House, that's it. Even the Robert Englund movie was better than this.

Sands is a perfect choice for the phantom role. (and to think Argento wanted John Malkovitch to play the phantom!) Still, what we have here is an often obscure, confusing and sometimes lethargic movie. Many of the characters fail to have any depth and yes Asia Argento does'nt always seem with it. I liked the idea of the phantoms ugliness being on the inside (as Sands didn't want \\"cartoon-style make-up\\" again). The film also contains some eroticism and even the sleazy undertone of paedophilia. Sands' phantom is not all monsterous, he also shows some human emotion and even cries when he sees his beloved Christine find comfort with another man.Argento's version is very Art-House and won't appeal to everyone, but it is still a great movie worth seeing once, also the soundtrack is wonderful. Overall I think it is one of the better versions available."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn!!","review":"i typically like anything that Argento does but this movie is simply dull. it is not even interesting to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Curtain Calls","review":"Argento is renowned for his camerawork, but he really stumbles with this badly done production. Julian Sands looks like Michael McKean from \\"This is Spinal Tap,\\" and I want an \\"uncovering his scarred face\\" scene, not the weak ending that seemed a little tacked on. Asia Argento is okay as Christine, although getting naked for daddy's films is a little odd.

There is no atmosphere and no pulsing Goblin music to set an ominous, spooky mood, so what does that make this \\"Phantom\\"? A load of junk that feels like a rerun of that old \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" TV show (you know, with Ron Pearlman and Linda Hamilton), rife with horrible acting from Julian Sands (\\"Naked Lunch\\") and the director's daughter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take away the junk from this film....","review":"and you'll find more junk underneath.

Same goes for ever directed it! Gaston Leroux is proably humilliated that his name was even on it! Don't waste you money on it!

I am a very loyal fan to both Webber and LeRoux, having enjoyed both of their versions of the tale. However, I was very disturbed as to how this movie portrayed the story. The Phantom is a derranged pervert who has nothing but a sexual obsession with Christine. There are several vulgar occurances that go on between Christine and the Phantom that I'm sure neither Webber or LeRoux had in mind when writing their masterpieces. The Phantom is seen as someone who kills for pleasure, a lunatic; certainly not a Michael Crawford.

His route includes conversion, purgation, illumination, the dark night, and divine union. He includes many personal and historical examples, as well as his own philosophical insights. It is in the midst of all these words that the journey is lost. Perhaps his experience of the journey is different form mine. (Simpson is a married man, with a PhD in Greek philosophy, and a member of the Episcopal Church.) There were moments when the book was clear, unfortunatley these are few.

The main problem with the album is the much larger inclusion of Dee C. Lee. I'm sorry, but her voice has never sat well with me, and it's never more apparent why than on this album. She has a very generic, un-interesting voice. There is no oomph, nothing special about it. It's much better suited to singing in a chorus than dueting or taking lead. \\"A Woman's Song\\" evokes nothing in me, because her voice has no feeling to it, even though the lyrics are fantastic. Also, \\"Angel\\" has such a gorgeous melody, but her voice completely ruins it. She's trying too hard to sing out of her range, which isn't that great to begin with.

But overall, the mechanism for the camera to \\"produce\\" photos gets worse over time, not better.

I tried to contact the company via email, and it bounced back--no address found. I then tried to email thru the Amazon website, and the same thing happened. I called the phone number on the website, spoke with a courteous woman who picked up (four times in over two weeks) and never got a call or email.

Whilst they are not as good - or as effective as weights - they are much more convenient. When you travel once a fortnight interstate or overseas this is important.I would highly recommend buying both. Some exercises are more effective on the larger bullworker and some are far better with the steel bow. Also it has encouraged my 6 year old daughter to exercise with me which is a definite plus. In fact I am thinking of buying a steel bow for her. My wife has also expressed interest as the exercising looks safe and fun so it is a healthy and fun device.I hope this helps anyone considering this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Playlist","review":"Amazon has the wrong playlist listed for this album.

Not dark in the sense that it has depressing minor chords with quiet, brooding vocals, but rather that it is more of a black comedy.This album is basically a mocking of the world, so lost in all of its incredibly complicated ways, and for the most part, oblivious to all of it. It gives me a funny feeling when I listen to it--a bit uneasy, which is understandable. It is an album about the uneasiness of the current situation of society.This album is far beyond anything that any other band was making in the 70s. It posed as a pop-rock album but instead was a heavy and intense criticism of so many complicated and ugly things in society through the format of pop-rock. Very, very, very unique album. I have heard nothing like it before or since.Certainly and album to buy, study, enjoy, and remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jethro's on a roll here","review":"WarChild has kind of a charming offhandedness after the grim Passion Play, but shares many themes (Job considers Calvinism or something like that). There was no need to stitch the songs together into some overarching narrative like the previous few records so the songs stand on their own merits. The instrumentation tends toward the cartoonish but the melodies are strong and it all holds up 30 years later. I enjoy just about everything the \\"real\\" Jethro fans hate about this record. Accordions, silly sax & synth & strings, just a lovely goofy job all the way through, biting lyrics notwithstanding. Except that awful little tune \\"Solitaire\\", a real lapse of judgment that seems aimed at one the group's print detractors. There are occasional jarring volume changes and some questionable resort to engineering gee whiz but generally this nutty record hits the bullseye. Think it got to #2 in the U.S. and there was even a hit single!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Info on Warchild","review":"Apparently Warchild is a love it or hate it proposition. I'm very fond of it, and I think it fits in well with both the albums that proceed and follow. For the reviewer who \\"doesn't know what was in Ian Anderson's mind\\" at the time - Warchild is the soundtrack to a movie that simply was never finished. Anderson released the album anyway, since it was essentially finished. \\"Only Solitaire\\" may or may not be a response to critics - but it was written well ahead of the rest of the album, and was a part of the \\"Chateau D'isaster\\" tapes that were recorded just before Passion Play.Because Tull's career is now so long, I think each album has to be looked at as part of the whole. There is a lot of good music on Warchild, and it definitely leads the way into the albums that follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put the band on track after Passion Play","review":"The only thing Kaleb (my fellow reviewer) has wrong is calling Thick As A Brick and Passion Play \\"obscure\\".

People can chat and get to know one other while they play the game. And if you and your friends happen to be mystery lovers, all the better, because the \\"How to Host a Murder\\" games are marvelous fun. The game provides plenty of structure, making your party easy to plan. You can be as elaborate (costumes, multi-course meals) or as casual (jeans and pizza) as you like.\\"The Last Train to Paris\\" is an excellent episode, particularly if you would like to throw an elegant party (characters include a princess and a spy). The mystery is top-notch; nobody guessed the murderer at the party I attended (and we were a group of avid mystery fans). I HIGHLY recommend this game for mystery lovers and adventurous hosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated to Have Natural Conversation","review":"My husband and I hosted two murder mystery dinners with another company. We then played this one. Our guests and us found this game to be very detailed and complicated. Improvisation and the flow of regular discussion was difficult because you had to follow such a complicated WWII plot and know how to pronounce all the French names. The other games we've played (made by other companies) were very easy to play, conversation flowed naturally, and the plot wasn't so thick that you couldn't have fun. Also, this game series doesn't tell the muder that he/she is the murderer. The other games we played let the murder know bythe first round. Personally, I think it's easier to play if the murder at least knows at the beginning if he/she is the murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Base Layer","review":"I live in Denver and ski/ride regularly each winter -- often in extreme temps.

The cord, which is so convenient and thin, and which wraps so neatly around the mouse, either pulls out of the USB connector or breaks internally at the point where it bends sharply. Somebody who does not wrap and unwrap the cord to use the mouse will probably never have this problem, but for a user who needs to pack the mouse away and unpack it frequently, this design issue is fatal. If you need a mouse that's truly portable, don't buy this one. Get a small Dell mouse with a permanent cord.

After about six months the scroll suddenly failed. Very weird indeed, but that's what happened, so i had to buy a new one...this time larger.

What a disappointment! I have always trusted the Logitech brand, but they missed the mark here. This mouse is too small and does not fit my average sized hand. It looks and feels cheaply made, and I don't expect it to last very long. The scoll wheel is crude, and you can actually count the notches as you scroll. To move around a page, I have to pick the mouse up and re-position it on the pad to go very far. I have only used this Logitech mouse for a few minutes, and am ready to drive to Wal*Mart for a replacement. I bought it to replace a Microsoft wireless mouse that developed a problem with the left button.

But I couldn't find a \\"Notebook optical mouse plus\\" anywhere on their site after searching via three categories, and visually, and by using their search box. The mini manual doesn't say what the software is for. But it worked when I plugged it into my MacBook anyway.It's back to genuine Apple for Mighty Mouse for me. Design matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived","review":"I bought this item on May 11th, and today August 24th, it died. I'm using it on my Lenovo laptop which I use at most two hours a day. The size was right and I could use it with either left or right hand. I don't need a fancy mouse, but I do need a reliable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"This mouse is just what I needed for my netbook. It is small enough to pack away for travel, the cord wraps around the sides/base of the mouse and the USB plug snaps onto the bottom of the mouse so it stays put for storage. Originally I wanted a wireless, but with a netbook, I don't really see the need and extra cost. This works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Trouble","review":"I've bought this mouse twice. Each time it would work great, felt great, just the right size for a traveling mouse, but then the first broke after about two years. I bought another this past January, it's broken already (October). Both times connection to the USB port went; exactly the same problem. I won't be buying this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another mouse tries to be special","review":"This is smaller than the desptop mouse and feels a bit flimsy. It does the job which is why I gave it four stars, but the feel just isn't right. The cord as others have commented is about a foot short and thinner, too. The reason for the light weight cord is so it can be wrapped around the mouse body and the USB end attaches onto the bottom of the mouse with a plastic button snap. This is all very useless and unnecessary. The mouse is a replacement for a Kennsington Pocket mouse and I have yet to see how long it will last. My old mouse lasted ten years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need REAL information!","review":"What fool measured the PACKAGE instead of the product? Those of us with netbooks are interested in the measurements if the mouse, not the package!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I bought this mouse a few months back.

I works sometimes and doesn't work other times. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long term report","review":"I've had this mouse for about a year and a half and today it died when it lost its tail. The wire that goes into the USB connector end is flimsy and eventually the individual wires just broke.This mouse has otherwise been good and accurate, but it just doesn't hold up to the stress of being wrapped up (as its supposed to be around its base) as much as someone that has a notebook computer may need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine","review":"Works as expected. Cord wrap is nice for storage in laptop case - wraps easily. A bit smaller than a traditional mouse, which is fine for my wife, who we got it for. Would not be perfect for me, but that's ok in this case..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for!","review":"I use my notebook computer as a desktop replacement, and I'm not wild about using the touchpad all the time. This little mouse is the *perfect* alternative. The plug-and-play functionality is seamless -- it doesn't matter when you plug it in; it always starts right up with no rebooting required. It features 3 buttons and a scroll wheel, so unless you're used to using a really souped-up mouse, you won't sacrifice anything you'd have on a regular mouse.The most convenient feature, without a doubt, is the cord. It winds up neatly into the base, and the USB plug snaps into the bottom. No tangles, no unruly cords, no retractor-widgets prone to breakage. Brilliant. The mouse is small, but I honestly don't notice the difference while I'm using it.All in all, this mouse is a winner in both form and function. It gives me exactly what I need from a mouse in an incredibly convenient little package. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Satisfied","review":"I bought this mouse on a whim because I thought it was so adorable and I loved how the wire wrapped around the base. I'm SO glad I acted on that whim. Its got to be one of my favourite of all the mouses I've tried. Its small but not too small, you can keep the mess of wire in your laptop bag to a minimum with the wrap around base, it worked amazingly well, and it lasted me a good three years now.The wire on mine has broken inside I think since now it's a little glitchy. The computer sometimes doesn't see it so I'm here to buy a new one. I was thinking about purchasing a different mouse but I'm just so satisfied with this product I don't want to change. :DOnly problem is that the wire is a little short so if you don't have USB slots on the back right or right side of your computer, you should probably rethink buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse","review":"This mouse works great with my new Dell laptop.

It is a little small for an adult but it is used mostly by my kids and I have small hands. I would reccomend this product especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Logitech Optical (mini but Mighty) Mouse","review":"I saw this item on Amazon while searching for a replacement of an older ball mouse. The laptop for which it was to be used is my primary business computer, so comfort and reliability were critical issues.Several other Amazon reviewers of this item discussed my key concerns in a positive light, and thus I took a chance on the mouse in question. Once purchased and put into use, this mini but mighty mouse lived up to its billing. It performs tasks without problems (i.e. moves around the window as directed without pauses or glitches). Its smaller size is not an issue for me (a guy with a medium to large size hand) and is actually a space saver on my desk. The convenient wrap around wire allows efficient pack up for travel and includes a button attachment so the wire when wrapped stays put. Finally, the price at Amazon was attractive - even to a Scotts/Irish kind of guy like me who rubs pennies together with the best of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after a few months use","review":"Had been working great. Then one day it just started behaving badly...like there was a short in the wire. Maybe it got treated roughly when I was not looking (I've got four teens).

Better to have a elastic type cord to set to your prefered distance..I got around by unwrapping fully and using the USB ports on the oppposite side of mouse so wire does not get in the way.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using it Right now!","review":"This little mouse is great.

It is small and compact for business travellers who take their laptops with them on trips. It is also excellent to be utilized at home when your deskspace is limited. It also fits perfectly for those who have small hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse, but too small!","review":"This is a great laptop mouse for the price, its portable because its small and the cord wraps around the bottom so you don't have to worry about it dangling when you carry it around.But, for extended periods of usage, your hand will get tired trying to poise itself on its small surface and clicking its small buttons. If you have any problems with your hands from typing or something already, this isn't for you. So, its not too comfortable, and if you want that, go for something bigger, so you can rest your palm on the mouse to take the stress off the fingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size for laptop","review":"Works great and perfect size. I'd give the mouse 5 stars but when you wind the cord up and snap it into the bottom it is quite tight. I worry that the sharp bend in the cord might cause problems in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby .. =)","review":"I bought this Logitech Optical Mouse to replace an existing one and I'm very pleased with its accuracy, lightness, and ease of use. I had thought about purchasing a wireless mouse but I didn't want to worry about it dying on me while on the go. It's convenient for those that travel with their notebooks because the cord can wrap around the base and have the usb plug snapped into place. The size of it is not too big or too small...it's perfect. I have not found one flaw in it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaced it twice","review":"MMm.. it's not a bad mouse, nice and light, with a place to wrap the cord. Good response and click wheel. BUT I've had to replace this mouse twice now, and am convinced that there is indeed a design flaw, namely how the cord attaches to the USB dongle. Basically they've made the wire going from the usb to the mouse as thin as possible to make wrappable, but problem is that it consistently wears and tears. After a month or two, it just works sporadically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy laptop mouse with unbelievable packaging","review":"I bought this mouse because every laptop mouse I have had seems to last only about 6 months and this one has great reviews. So far, after two weeks, the mouse is working fine but I cannot use it in a conference or meeting because the scroll wheel is so noisy that it would draw attention. I have never heard such a noisy wheel. I was also very disappointed that the people at Logitech have absolutely no concern for the environment. The excessive amount of heavy duty plastic packaging seems more appropriate for the crown jewels than a cheap mouse. I needed a heavy duty knife to cut through the sealed plastic and then the sharp plastic edge cut my finger. In short, I would not buy this mouse again."},{"rating":"2","title":"very compact","review":"Very compact to fit in my carying case. The way to store the mouse cable around is great. Just don't know how reliable it is after time. Has this mouse for a month now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, and smart","review":"This is the perfect mouse for a notebook computer on the go, or even at home. First it's not wireless, so you never have to worry about batteries dying. Second the cord has a place to wrap around the mouse (where you can't see it), and the usb part pops into the bottom, making sure the cord is never a hassel during traveling. I can't believe there are not more mouses with this feature. Third it's not ultra small, but just right for travel and hand comfort.The only thing that keep me from giving it five stars is two things. First no back button, or in other words a third button. The back button saves so much times while browsing the web, i can't believe they don't have it on here. Third, when I bought it, I thought it automatically retracked, like a measuring tape, I was a little disappointed, but i'm sure they'll make something like that in the future.But right now I think it's the best you can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short life due to poor design","review":"The mouse cord wraps around the unit and it has to be stretched out and bent at one particular location to wrap correctly. Due to this poor design, as opposed to retractable cords used by other mouse manufacturers, the mouse went dead with only a few months of use. If you are not planning to carry the mouse around and leave the cord extended all the time, this is not a bad mouse. However, if you are plannig to use this mouse like how a notebook mouse should be used, then stay away from it. I was expecting this to happen when I first received my mouse in the mail, (I didn't know that it was a wrap-around cord at the time of my purchase.) but still not this soon. Overall the most poorly designed mouse I've owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a few months","review":"I see that a few other users also had this failure issue after a few months.

It is exactly what I needed, but I was a bit concerned when I received the package. I wasn't to sure that it was going to be in one piece. The box that it was shipped in was not in the best shape and appeared to have been crushed by something laid on top of it. When I opened the package, I was a bit surprised that it was still in one piece and not damaged. I checked it over real good and found no major damage to the wing except a few indention marks on the top surface. It doesn't appear that this will have any effect on the dynamics of the plane. It was very lucky that there wasn't more damage than it appeared, but even this could have been prevented if there had been more protection and better packaging.

After many, many phone calls and nonsense they agreed to send me out a new unit. I had to send the old unit back and did so with expedited shipping so I could get it back asap. It wasn't until nearly a month afterward that I received the replacement. Upon using the station I realized the temp readout was not the temp of he iron, far from it. The recovery time was awful, and the tip was very shoddy. After using the unit for approximately an hour it died and I don't have the time to deal with Kaito Electronics once again.

But then I saw that it has a wonderful collection of classical guitar music, much of it played by one of my favorite guitarists, Alexander-Sergei Ramirez. Amongst the many gems there were a couple of disappointments, a few pieces not so well played. I would have wished that Denon had included the version of Barrios' La Catedral that was played by Ramirez instead of the one they included. Ramirez' version is the best I've heard, bar none, so I was surprised to hear the one they included.

At this rate, i'll be dead before the entire Stooge catalogue is on DVD. By then there will be another format anyway. The real sleaze tactic by Columbia is throwing in a few \\"new\\" ones with the other re-treads, to kind of force you to buy the thing.

Anyone with some knowledge of art and the art world will be in danger of losing their eyeballs in the back of their heads - from rolling them so much. And as escapist fantasy - the plot twists and gimmicks are rather predictable, and when they are not predictable it's only because of the astounding ludicrousness. Frankly, for escapist fun the unabashedly over-the-top Bond flicks are much better.Maybe good for a rental - I certainly don't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD MOVIE!","review":"THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL ACTION,NUDITY,AND ECT.RENE RUSSO LOOKS VERY PRETTY.I CAN SEE WHY SHE DID THIS KIND OF MOVIE.FOR ONE SHE'S GETTING OLD,HER FACE IS BECOMING OLD AS WELL.IN THE MOVIE THEY SHOW A CLOSE UP AND IT GROSSED ME OUT TO SEE THE CRATERS IN HER FACE.BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE LOOKED VERY FINE CAUSE ALL THE MAKE UP HIDES ALOT OF IT.SHE GETS NAKED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER MOVIES.THIS OLD WOMEN STILL HAS A 20 YEAR OLD BODY AND SHE SHOULD STICK WITH THESE KINDS OF MOVIES IF SHE WASNTS TO MAKE IT IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS.PIERCE BROSMAN IS A VERY GOOD ACTOR THIS MOVIE CAN ALMOST BE BETTER THAN 007 BUT 007 HAS WAY MORE ACTION.THIS MOVIE IS LIKE \\"ENTRAPMENT\\" BUT BETTER.TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THIS MOVIE IS WORTH BUYING BELIVE ME AND TRUST ME.BUY IT NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and implausible","review":"I went into this movie expecting to see a witty game of cat and mouse. Instead I saw an underdeveloped story line with scene after scene of unbelievable dialogue and preposturous characters.The story should have been much more interesting, but Rene Russo's character was so rediculous in her alternating between being a tough investigator and falling for Brosnan. Her character never developed enough to believe her inner struggles as she tries to come to terms with her duty and her desires. I really enjoy Dennis Leary's work, but here too he is not allowed to develop. He is a one-dimensional cop who stands on the sidelines as Russo runs the show.Rather than be thrilled with the excitement of the chase, the implausible storyline kept pulling me out of the setting of the movie, so much that by the end I was laughing at the movie, not with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie Killed by the Soundtrack from Hell","review":"This might've been an interesting and snappy flick if it weren't for the horribly intrusive and inappropriate soundtrack. Romantic scenes turned into beer commercials and action sequences seemed more like car ads. Awful, awful music. Think music can't ruin a movie? Check out the sequence in \\"Mission To Mars\\" where the spacecraft suffers a dangerous air leak. If the quiet and loopy organ music creates even the slightest air of tension check yourself, it might be embarrassment instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give no stars","review":"This movie sucked! It went on and on. It was extremely boring. Overacted and melodramatic are the words I would use to describe the romance between the two main characters. The last two minutes were cool, but it is definitely worth neither the money nor the time to sit there waiting for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take me to the Marmottan instead","review":"Monet's Impression, Sunrise hangs in the Musee Marmottan in Paris, far from the idiocies of this film. Brosnan hits his marks providing the viewer with a spot on parody of James Bond without his Walther PPK. Everyone seems bored in this movie, the school kids at the Metropolitan Museum where the action takes place, the cops who'd rather be shaking down wife beaters, and of course Miss Russo who looks like she wants to be anywhere else. If you want a good museum heist story stick with Topkapi. This movies is as predictable as the Met's closing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to see James Bond taking himself seriously?","review":"I think most people like this movie because it's BEAUTIFUL.Yes, male and female models dressed in gorgeous outfits (sometimes naked) drive outrageously expensive cars, they live in urban luxury or take a break at the Jamaican villa (owned by one of them), talk about true llove, art and megabucks. It's all VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL! Anyone wants to be in their shoes for a couple of hours.But what does it have to do with the moviemaking in the levels from Kent cigarette commercials and up? The movie too artificial to resemble the real life and to pass for a caper it's lacking that twinkle, the tongue in a cheek quality of the genre's masterpieces.It seems that most commercially successful James Bond wants to be taken seriously. It's known that Mr. Brosnan is of a rather humble origin - there is nothing wrong with that, I am not a British Lord myself - but that explains a lot.What we see is a mega-budget home movie of the leading actor who is also a producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Crummy!","review":"First, what ever happened to the four Romanians that Crown presumably hired to create the diversion? Second, the police are portrayed as a bunch of idiots who do nothing but sit around and drink coffee. Third, does anyone really believe that a female insurance investigator is goint to have all of the stats on a Sikorsky helicopter right on the top of her head? Fourth, the police detective unrealistically lets Russo excape with Crown because he really doesn't give a damn about a stolen Monet? Fifth, does anyone really believe that an insurance investigator is going to seize evidence illegally? Sixth, does anyone really believe that a real-life Thomas Crown would throw everything away to run away with this?? He wouldn't even do it for a Zeta-Jones, who would be much more compelling. Don't spend the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No crown for this affair","review":"My wife and I used our free PPV coupon from our new cable TV serice to see \\"The Thomas Crown Affair,\\" and we didn't get much for our money. Pierce Brosnan thought he was still playing James Bond, and Renee Russo's nude body failed to stir any lustful, let alone romantic, impulses in either of us. The story line was none too clear, the life-style of the rich none too attractive, and the net effect was to make us wonder what gimmick these two hedonists would have to think up next if their affair were to last another week. All in all, this was \\"an affair not to remember.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"soulless nasty tripe!","review":"A totally vacuous piece of hollywood nastyness. Brosnan and Russo have about as much charisma as pieces of lettuce. Rene tries desperately to be sexy and alluring but fails dismally. Urrrggghh...the worst Hollywood has to offer. The whole thing plays like a homage to greed and emptiness - see our intrepid cardboard cut outs slumming it in luxurious appartments eating oysters and taking joyrides in Helicopters.

I found it to be very entertaining. Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary are unparalleled. As remakes go this is one of the better ones as of late.

The major drawback was the complete lack of any wit in the dialog. The characters weren't developed very well--there was a lot of exposure to their lives and lifestyles, but we never REALLY got to see who they were until the very end. Some things seemed to happen for no reason--points or conclusions were derived from what seemed to be inconsequential events. I'm bummed that I got duped into thinking it was a fabulous movie. There was one saving grace, though--at least my boyfriend and I found a film where there were leads for BOTH of us to drool over! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD...","review":"I never expectec that director McTiernan could deliver such a lousy movie, tasteless, without any rhythm and with a history without any real climax.

Easily one of the worst 20 movies I've ever seen. The only plus, if you consider such things pluses, is that whenever the film gets so ridiculously horrible you're ready to walk out, the main actress takes off her top and you get some gratuitous nudity. This movie is horrible.

I figured we'd be seeing Thomas Crown committing burglary after burglary and constantly fooling the authorities. Instead, we get two whole burglaries in the movie and Rene Russo's character, who's supposed to be assisting the police in aprehending him, fawning all over him and generally making a fool of herself. Her character was so not believable that it was ridiculous. There was no motivation for her inane actions...she fell in love with him after seeing him on a security camera for five minutes, if that.

Rene Russo has never been better in her perforance as the insurance investigator trying to catch Cown, after he steals a painting worth $100,000,000.

Kissing the limit of erotica in the movie but as for the 1999 version, you get the package of male fun. More than kissing is shown; nudity is a strong point in this film (that's right, Rene Russo gets topless and it is not ugly).Although this version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" is much for complex and \\"full-length\\", I'd still recommend the older version more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great condition","review":"The dvd was received in a timely fashion and in the new condition in which it was described.

It is smart how he returns the picture. It is not only a thriller but a comedy. It is good at doing both. The main reason is Dennis Leary, who plays a cop. I was suprised to find Nudity.

Not a good word for this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated & Expensive","review":"I read reviews and looked into this product before buying it. I was surprised this headset was so expensive as it has no features other then a volume switch. Because I am on a Mac, my selection is limited. I found the \\"Plantronics\\" products work but are so poorly crafted they break within a year. I think the construction of this product may be better but for the price (3x as much) isn't warranted for the lack of comfort (the ear pads are to small to fully cover the ear), And there is nothing in this to explain the price. I got the G-35 form Logitech and they were amazing in construction and bells and whistles but none of the cool stuff works on a Mac. They just become headphones. I would not suggest paying this price for this product! It's better then two tin cans on a string but it's overrated. I would give this one star, when comparing the hype to the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset","review":"Sennheiser has made me a long-term fan with their high quality, high value headphones, and this headset is no exception.

No straining to hear or understand the other party. I use this headset primarily for Skype but I do listen to music from time to time and the music is great. I do have two complaints. They do not fit snugly to my ears so the top cushion set on my head and can get uncomfortable after several hours. The second is the volume control on the cable moves very easily. So if it brushes up against my leg the volume can change. When the volume is low on a call I always have to look at the volume control to find that it moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine but nothing special","review":"I got this for traveling.

As a thorough buyer I emailed Sennheiser tech support regarding this problem before buying and they replied that it was a non issue and that I would have no problems.Well I did have problems and even after tweaking everything that can be tweaked the volume is inappropriately low to listen to music pleasurably.I had to return the headsets to the retailer and lose $20 attributed to re-stocking fees.

This is the closest so far to what I need, but there is no noise cancellation and it is VERY bulky to travel with. The sound quality is good, and the mike is directional, which helps eleiminate background noise. I had to keep the molded packaging and carry in my travel bag, since it won't fit in my computer bag.

Bring together all the rattling fill-ins from Purple & friends, like Whitesnake's \\"Bloody Mary\\" or Rainbow's \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" and you will get this totally faceless album. I know that many will disagree, but I'd rather listen to good pop than to bad rock. Their next album, \\"Slaves and Masters\\", was bashed by Purple fans, but I think it was much better than both the \\"House...\\" and their previous effort, \\"Perfect Strangers\\".

Yes, they bring you the cut down LP version.This album is way better than Perfect Strangers, which was a rather flat attempt to be another Machinehead.

The rest are hardly worth mentioning. Songs like \\"Dead or Alive\\" and \\"Mad Dog\\" have plenty of energy but no life. (The blue lights are on but nobody's home?) Overall, these songs sound almost like each musician was recorded separately and the tracks were later mixed.\\"Perfect Strangers,\\" which preceded this, is one of Deep Purple's best albums, and \\"The Battle Rages On,\\" which came after, is very good.

Captain Scott O'Grady's story is fascinating because it is a regular guy's fight for survival, alone, behind enemy lines, and for most of the time cut off from all comunication with friendly forces. The book gives us the secret to his having returned with honour and become the overcomer: it begins with a stable home and strong family ties; continues with intense loyalty to one's country and a perseption of being in the service of something greater than oneself; above all a knowledge that there is a God who knows us, knows our needs, and who is ready and able to respond to the cry of all who trustingly seek Him. Scott O'Grady bears witness to these facts. Read this book. Give it to teenagers and school children. In an age where idols usualy come from the decadent entertainement world, we need to promote true honour, integrity, character and sense of duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I found Return With Honor to be inspirational and exciting.

He did a pretty good job.... typical for such books. A \\"grabber\\" in the early going, and the background after the reader is hooked.Regardless, as an infantry fighter, I was glad for the careful explanation of the electronics that dealt with his plane and his ejection from it. After he was down I could appreciate his decisions and how he carried them out. Obviously his faith was instrumental in his escape, and I also appreciated the bravery of the Marines who went in to extract him.Overall, an interesting story.

Scott O'Grady is an inspiration. Not only did he survive a SAM-6 shoot down, but he become more focused in his life and belief in God. During his evasion of Serb para military forces, he focused his energies on surviving another day despite food and water.When one thinks of fighter jocks, people think of Tom Cruise and Top Gun. O'Grady tells the truth. These are conservative guys taught not to make great risks. They are very professional in how they perform their duties. This is demonstrated in this book. Scott goes about his duties with clear thought and precise action. Scott survived because he did as he was trained. He did not take great risks.This is a nice, inspirational read.

You need 50 to pass so I obviously did not get that. I read through the material of this book twice and took both practice exams twice. I scored a 75 on both practice exams. The book fooled me into thinking I was ready. It just does not go into enough detail, which is exactly what the CLEP asks for. The test is very detailed. I don't know what I would recommend...maybe a college textbook or something instead. I definitely learned from this book but I didn't pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time","review":"Despite the glowing reviews from others, this book was of little or no value in preparing for the CLEP exam. The format of the questions was not the same (the study guide had zero long quotations to read and answer questions about, but the real exam had many) and the material covered was not remotely distributed the same way. The bulk of the material covered in the study guide was mentioned little or not at all on the exam; the exam contained many many many questions about things that were mentioned little or not at all in the book.

To study for the CLEP History II exam you will need to know a bunch of worthless quotes (and their authors) and information like \\"What river was Mark Twain a river boat captain on?\\" Definitely use this as a supplement to a history book, because the only thing this book does well is frame domestic policy (which constituted very little of my exam).

By question 20, I began to worry. While this book has great info it did not have the detailed info needed for this version of the US History II Clep exam. Quotes, authors, a lot of culture and sadly after my relentless studying I FAILED with a 45. That turns out to 38 questions that I answered correctly. Do not simply rely on this book like I did.

Even though the AIMING section of the book offers some good stuff, I'll suggest that you take the time to read it only if you find yourself having REAL trouble pocketing balls.Personally, I found myself focusing too much on technicalities rather than making my aiming process the easygoing part of my game.You might find most of the subjects easier explained and far more understandable in other books.Perhaps this book is better intended for beginners, and it would be a good idea to make a notice on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paralysis through analysis","review":"This book might work if the cue ball would travel on a straight line which it hardly ever does.

Also because of throw the true angle of a shot is not the point on the object ball farthest from the pocket. The only way to get accurate is to look at each shot see where the object ball has to go to make a clean entry get down with the object balls line of travel in mind and when you are sure your going to send it there shoot.Trust yourself.

There is something about the way they write (or maybe it is the way I read) that makes their books fly by.I think this is a fine book about Patton in WWII. It isn't a full biography, it is exactly what the authors says it is: A Study in Command. The history is good, even if he blows past the unfortunate slogging match outside of Metz, and he gives a great feel for what made Patton the legend he is today. Very highly recommended for anyone interested in Patton or armored warfare in WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging and mood-capturing translation of a wonderful work.","review":"This version of The Bacchae is not only beautiful, but the printing of the words of the chorus and the style and breaks in the lines of the text catch a perfect mood and speed as well as rhythm. The pages have the text spaced nicely, and it seems to breeze quickly and chaotically because of the rate that the pages need to be turned. In this way a mood is captured that is not always seen in translations of ancient texts. Besides that, it is a compelling tragedy that raises many questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A authentic Greek Tragedy","review":"This is a fabulous version of The Bacchae. The feeling is completely tragic, but insightful into how the Greeks saw and explained life. Appearances are not always what they seem in The Bacchae.

Just wait till you hear his collaboration with George Lynch on \\"Tears Of Sahara\\"--it'll bring tears to your eyes with it's absolutely heavenly sonic aura and killer lead trade-offs. You won't find solos with more feeling and better tones anywhere this side of the universe. And Tony's keyboard playing is right up there with his awesome guitar playing, making him a talented guy of fearful proportions.

Story gets fast paced and unexpected, ties up as it unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great film from Cage.","review":"I love Nicolas Cage.He is such a good actor, because unlike actors such as Sylvestor Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger who put out in invincible sort of act, he puts out the innocent guy who really has a life and can be killed act, and it works great.Thismovie is basically about a boxing matchl;there is a shooting during a big fight, and as the story line unravels you discover all kinds of conspiracies amdn mysteries.This movie keeps your attention, i loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"to long to receive","review":"i rated this cause it took a while to get it .........i did enjoy the movie just was annoyed it took as long to receive it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different take on the suspense thriller...","review":"I saw Snake Eyes when it was in the theaters and I was impressed. Nicolas Cage gives an unusual performance that only he could act. Gary Sinise is also very good. This DVD is great in the Dolby Digital 5.1 because you get all of the atmospheric sounds that are in the movie's storyline. A great film that is worthy of being a DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable But Artsy","review":"Within the first 10 minutes, I could see the evil culprits. Although that was the case for me, it may not be the case for everyone. The flashbacks made the movie interesting and the use of cameras in odd places was effective and enjoyable. I really didn't care for the ending but if I tell you why it will give away the ending. Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SHORT","review":"Needed more info and storyline. I was predicting a tasteful long Cage flick and got a semi ok short swiftly solved murder mystery. Brian De Palma fans may like this movie. Some people who enjoy direct, to the point movies that run 1 hour an 32 minutes, this is your flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW BAD CAN A MOVIE GET?","review":"Well, Ill tell you Snake Eye is so bad that I can't even stand to write the name out. Nick Cage is great in everything,don't get me wrong but don't see him in this. Now, the Rock is one of my favorite movies(See it and then buy it). I don't think I've ever hated a movie so much as this(except for Batman and Robin,its very close). It was also a very predictable movie with absolutely no thinking involved. The ending of the movie was the worst I ever seen, it just ended(with the storm and all happening at once). Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"a silly goof-January 7- Kabb","review":"Come on people can you think of more of a thriller than this worthless trash. This movie was way to obvious,about who assasianed the secertary of state. There were no good Performances except for the women that is sitting in the arena and suspected in the killing, but other than that it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"i didn't like the movie. it didn't make sense. i like nick cage but he should of pass on this movie. face off was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"dePalma's Unique Directorship is worth the price","review":"As old newer classics go, this one is definitely worth the admission price. It starts out with a long, incredibly well choreographed setup in which a camera follows Cage, constantly ad libbing as only Cage can, and this whole sequence unfolds over many breathtaking minutes, with no apparent \\"cuts\\" in the action. That was memorable when I saw this flick over a decade ago, and it's still unsurpassed by the CGI junk that we see today. Gary Sinise is wonderful as the sneaky evil dude, and Carla Gugino was new and gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"fight night....","review":"Good movie. Nicholas Cage being one of my favorite actors made it even better. Keep your seats because you don't want to miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tame no surprises hear , boring thriller .","review":"Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise are both great actors but why theydecided to star in this lame thriller is beyond me. After the 30minute continuous shot it just slopes downhill. Cage and Sinise both act well but whats the point its like being able to swim when trying to drown yourself. Its worth seeing for the first 30 minutes but after that you may aswell go for a walk or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Cage and Brian D. stuff.

After the latter is beat-up, he stumbles around in an almost comedic fashion. This particular scene had me unintentionally laughing -- definately an indication of a performance gone awry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of 1998","review":"It was not suspenseful and there was no mystery as to who the killer was. The only redeeming quality in the movie was the 17 minute opening shot. Horrible movie with some interesting camera work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Eyes.","review":"For years, I have followed the successful works of Brian De Palma, but recently it seems he's lost his edge, his style. Like Mission Impossible, Snake Eyes takes the leading actor ( Nicholas Cage ) and thrusts him into the spotlight. Supporting actors like Gary Sinese are reduced to nothing more than window-dressing and the overall movie lacks emotion and substance. Without a doubt the film's appeal rest solely on the popularity of Nicholas Cage, but take it from a avid movie-goer, Cage's character quickly becomes annoying to down-right stupid. To only saving point, is the continous 25 min shot in the start of the film. HOWEVER, it's the worth the price!!! Rent it! I dare you to try and stay awake during it ( I didn't )!!! Snake Eyes is a disappointing and dull attempt at De Palma's reclaim to fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"DePalma the Master Director","review":"Move over arnie,sly and jcvd. Nic Cage is the new action star of the decade! Look at his movie all action and thrill (the Rock, Face/off and ConAir) are my favorite movies and now Snake Eyes is also my favorite.

So, see this movie over and over again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was very good","review":"Snake Eyes was a good movie with all the aspects I expect to see in a thriller...The \\"WHO done it\\", the \\"WHY he did it and HOW do we figure it out\\" and the \\"ARE they gonna get him\\" Bacily this movie is a small mini mistery-suspence-thriller.

He can copy them down perfectly yet turn them all his own. In Raising Cain he took the famous Psycho scene where the car sunk, copied it, and added his own good thrill to it. But now, DePalma rips off his own films. Yet again he has the long uncut opening. And also rips off his own film (which was a rip off of another) Blow Out. Cage is irritating. The plot lacks thrills or susprises (and it ruins it's key surprise too soon). And then it gets incredibly cheap, as if they ran out of money. Pretty lame Brian!--wcg"},{"rating":"2","title":"A murder mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat!","review":"Classic DePalma mixed with new age cage and sinese makes Snake Eyes a film that was totally under-rated by critics and movie-goers. Set in an Atlantic City arena during a boxing match, with a huge tropical storm ripping up the coast, the secretary of defence is assassinated. The rest of the film is set in a who-done-it atmosphere. The whole film takes place in real time and is one you shouldn't miss.

I love mysteries, and the \\"whodunnit\\" part of the plot wasn't that hard to guess, but since it's given away rather early on, the rest of the movie is never predictable. I can't say enough about Gary Sinise. Hopefully he won't be typecast after this role, but he is outstanding. Brian DePalma directs masterfully and I loved the camerawork. That's almost the best part of the movie. Viewers looking for a typical shoot 'em up Cage action movie should look elsewhere. But if you want a compelling mystery that's good in both acting and camerawork, take a peak at this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Eyes","review":"No suspense or thrill about this movie whatsoever.Very poor movie that I strongly suggest avoiding(not even worth 1 star)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"The only good point about this movie is Cage's excellent performance. Almost everything else is under average. The movie repeats some familiar twists of a generic thriller/murder mystery without any ingeniuty. I would say that I could figure out the whole story from the first 20 minutes. Everything after that was mere filling the gaps. I felt disappointed with this movie in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak..","review":"Sinise looks more as Robert Fitzpatrick in \\"Terminator 2- Judgement dAy\\" - walking with the eyes of a robot, to show determination! The plot is uncredible weask, the only merit being the flashbakc method of telling the history. Cage is very, very good, but it doesn't save De Palma's lack of inspiration in directing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cage was over-staged.","review":"This is the first movie I've seen where I didn't like Cage's role. He was not staged well: over-done, too TOO dramatic. He is a great actor. I don't blame this one on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"An offbalanced,overconcieved movie","review":"Snake Eyes is the worst suspense movie of the decade, though it had some good acting, and 1 good scene of the movie and some good humor to give a **1/2.

So it quite clear it's not very intresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would DePalma do this movie?","review":"I love Nic Cage, but he is simply miscast here. We never believe him as the loveably crooked charmer, nor as a highly respected and influential detective. The plot is SO predictable and worn, we wonder why someone like Depalma would be interested in shooting it. Because it is beautifully shot. This movie is for DePalma freaks only, although it did have a nice preformance by a lovely creature named Carla Gugino."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE","review":"I went to see this movie cause I love all Nicolas Cage movies.

The open ear was nice as most headphones tend to hurt my ears after a half an hour or so.Within a month the mic wouldn't respond. I took it back and got another one, same thing happened on that one. Within a month or so the mic went out. On the second one I made sure to keep it put up and safe, was extra careful with the cord and made sure it was pampered, but it still happened.Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I have three boys and we all play online games with our PC. These are not meant for comfort. After a while of play my ears would hurt. Then I got a report from online players that my mic did not work or it was very intermittant. Now there is a short in the wire and the sound cuts in and out. I have had these for about a year. SHOULDN'T SOMETHING LIKE THAT SUPPOSE TO LAST LONGER!!!! Was Logitech bought out by someone? Their items have been poor in quality and break after a short time of use. I have had a couple of mice by them recently stop working after a short period of use! I think I am done with Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider ear replacements if you use these.","review":"Sound quality is 'ok', is what you would expect from a cheap headset. I didn't allow this to be on my head long enough to test the mic. They freak me out. After placing the ear extractors onto my head, in about 5 minutes my ears feel like they will permanently be pointed strait out to the side. After about 10 minutes they are what I would consider 'painful'. After about an hour they feel great...er that is because you went back to best buy and exchanged them for a different set. Logitech has never let me down, until now. Simply put, don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable and does not sound good at all.","review":"After wearing these things for maybe 5-10 minutes they are very uncomfortable. The large padding around the outside does little to help with comfort. They sound like listening through a pringles can. I tried using these with Counter-Strike: Source, and the gun shots sounded like hi-pitched firecrackers. Very annoying.I returned these and picked up a Altec Lansing headset and mic for $10 more. Much happier with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted for two months","review":"I expected much better quality for a Logitech product. The headset is very harsh on your ears after wearing it for more than a hour. The boom is not adjustable and does not pick up my voice well at all. The worst part of it was that the mic stopped working after two months. I am very disappointed with Logitech and will stay away from their headset products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design","review":"These hurt my ears, and because they use pressure to stay attached to your head, they press your ears against your head when they work, and after a while, the pressure wears down, then they pull your ears down and I'm sure after a while they will just stop working, because they can't attach to your head anymore. I'm very sorry that I bought these. The microphone is very low quality too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Headset","review":"I bought this headset recently and was amazingly disappointed with it almost immediately. Other than a stylish design, this headset has no upside. The sound quality is terrible, even for the price. The mic is worthless; in all my attempts to use it in gaming(what this headset was purportedly designed for) failed utterly. People were unable to make out my voice at all. Don't waste your time buying this trash, you'll just have to return it and replace it within days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Fit and Style, Terrible Sound","review":"I bought this headset because it looked sturdy and had good specs for the price. Within 10 seconds of firing up World of Warcraft with these on (before even trying the voice part), I noticed that the audio quality was way below par. When you loot an NPC that has money, there is a kind of ringing noise like a cash register that occurs when you take the money. At least it sounds like that through any decent speakers or headphones. With this set it sounded like I was taking a wet bag of money from the bottom of a muddy swamp.Also, music has no oomph and voice is tinny. I will be returning these and getting a Sennheiser set, either the PC145 or the PC155."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I was looking for a decent pair of headphones to use for a program called TeamSpeak. My outfit on a game called Planetside uses it to do faster communication. After comparing prices, this was the cheapest and, because of the trusted name of Logitech on the side, I thought I could trust these headphones were of decent quality.Wrong, goes to show me once again, ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS! My troubles started when people couldn't hear me unless I shouted to the heavens even after I had the settings on the highest they could go to boast performance. Next was the horrible design. After 30 minutes my ears started to hurt because there was no support for the headphones, which pulled and pinched my ears. The sound quality is fine, but unless I held the mic close to my face, it wouldn't pick up, which is impractical to gamers.I plan on returning these less then 24 hours of purchasing them and to buy something decent that I reviewed this time.

I literally cannot stand to wear them. I actually got a headache from having them on during my first time wearing them. Over time I tried again and again to \\"get used to them\\", but it didn't work.

Main problems: One of the ear's on the headset stops working, Microphone stops working, earpads fall off making it uncomfortable to wear.Its just cheap. Spend the extra 10-20-30 bucks and get something that's worth the money, no reason to waste ur money with this.

I made the mistake and trust the brand name! Logitech products are usually really good, but this time I'm very disappointed.One reviewer stated, do not use these headphones if you wear glasses, and oh boy, I should've read the reviews before I bought these horrible headphones.I'm a heavy gamer and can spend hours playing. Therefore, I need headphones that are comfortable. These headphones do not deserve the title \\"gaming headset\\", because the fit is extremely weird, the ear pieces are very uncomfortable and the sound is mediocre at best.The ear pieces are round, so they will put pressure to different parts of your ear and need constant adjusting. The way the clamp down around your head feels unnatural. They are so tight, that you will also adjust your glasses all the time.So, I recommend that you add a few bucks to your budget and buy something else.

Sure, the headset is atractive, maybe a little big but the design does call gaming. Thats about it. Sound its substandard commpared to other gaming headsets of the same price, and if you have moderate size ears like me, this thing will hurt them like a medivel torture device. Somebody made a good comment about the open air design of the speakers and the fact that your ears don't sweat...and it's true. They don't sweat...they could bleed maybe...but no sweat.

They are more expensive but you get every penny worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Craftmanship","review":"Just got this item in today. First problem after plugging them in was the volume control on the chord was stuck. I had to force the thing to move.

I took the POS apart to discover that the right earphone was not soldered to the proper location. I will not be returning these because, I don't want Logitech to refurbish these. I want them in the trash. I also hate to say, based on what I saw, I will not purchase anything audio from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Any review you read here will not be able to fully express how terrible these headphones are. I have fairly normal ears. All ears are a little goofy, but these headphones HURT my ears after a few hours. The sound is fine, the microphone is pretty crappy, but works. I don't know whose idea it was to design these headphones, but either they or the person who decided it was suitable for sale should be fired. Behind my ears there is visible damage where sharp plastic and insufficient padding have been pressing tightly. Additionally, the volume control is awful... it's a little tiny nob that runs in a circle, counter clockwise raising the volume. On top of the nob being too tiny, it is also very difficult to turn, rendering it nearly useless. I can either move it with my teeth or adjust the volume with game settings. Pretty ridiculous. Bad form Logitech, my last product I will EVER buy from you... two bad headsets in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headset","review":"I bought this headset back in 2005 when I got my first real MP game, Battlefield 2. It is now 2008, and these things are STILL being used with my games and they work great. The sound quality is good and the microphone is better. As far as sound cancellation, eh, but I put voice on the headset and actual game sounds on my Bose speakers. These fit my head well because I have a small head and they fit tight, nor do they constrict the ears or which make them perfect for me. My ears get irritated and hot when wearing headphones that clasp or sit on my ears so these are great, they sit a good 1/2 inch from my ears. I can see why these can be uncomfortable though since they don't adjust and are a tight fit.Summary: these are good for young gamers with small heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply useless if you can't wear it","review":"I was shocked to find that Logitech, a name I normally trust for peripherals, had created something as sloppily-designed as this headset.First, the fit was just plain atrocious. It was insanely uncomfortable, yet felt ready to fall off at any time. The other reviewer who said this was right on. (And yes, I had them on the right way!...)The sound was passable, but nothing near what I expected with the \\"Gaming Headset\\" moniker attached liberally to the packaging.Sadly, the only decent thing about it was how easy the return process was. Avoid at all costs if you wear glasses, and try to stay away even if you don't. Your ears will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know you failed if your product needs duct tape right out of the box","review":"I received this gaming headset for free by attending a course, and when I got it I was amused at the concept of a gaming headset. It took me 5-7 minutes to get out of the packaging, and then you have to adjust the mic. Unfortunately, after you adjust the mic, you have to put on the logitech label to secure it. I couldn't get it on, so I had to use duct tape.Once I put it on, it felt flimsy and uncomfortable, like it was constantly about to fall off. I reached for the mic to try and adjust it and the mic BROKE OFF. I threw the thing in the trash, it's totally worthless. I didn't even pay for it and I still feel ripped off. Dont buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"put your head in a vice","review":"I've been using this headset for about 3 months and I can't stand it. The wrap around your neck puts pressure on your ears and is not comfortable. The ear cups are so large, you won't be able to wear glasses with this set on unless you rest the temples on the top of the earpiece instead of on your ear.The sound is ok and I like the volume control. I'd look elsewhere for a new headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 3 weeks?","review":"I purchased this item about 3 weeks ago. I was very excited, it sounded great, my voice came over more clearly over the voice chat program I use for gaming, ventrilo. But 3 days after purchase the mouth piece mic fell off. It kind of snaps back in but falls off with any little nudge, but the microphone still worked. 3 weeks later the microphone stopped working altogether. I had to resort back to using my old desktop microphone.The on-cord volume is kind of a pain to use also, as it doesn't turn very well, and I have to use fingernails in order to change the volume, not a big deal since I can adjust it on my keyboard, but kind of useless to me since I do use the headset while gaming, digging my nails into the volume nob to get it to work is distracting.Next time I will spend a bit more money to get one that will last a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This is a nice headset.

No matter what size your head is. It has a thick hard plastic band that goes arount the back of your head. The band is not adjustable. It is one solid peice of plastic. The band does not fit snug. It just kinda of hangs, leaving the very heavy ear phones to weigh on your ears until they want to fall off. They are very uncomfortable. You have to try to keep a balance in feeling like you can't move an inch or they will fall off. The way that these fit on your head make the mic hard to be heard by the recieving end.

The mic is adjustable up and down but you cant position it closer to your mouth. The inline volume control is a nice touch so you wont have to exit a game to adjust the volume. The headset is pretty comfortable unless you plan on wearing it for a long time. After about two hours of playing counter strike source or day of defeat source I'm ready for a break. I must mention that these things are durable. I think you could run them over with your car and they'd still function. To me, that's their best feature since I've had other headseats break.

This was not a sensitivity issue with the program I was using, as I had the voice register set to max.Also, the voice on/off switch was delicate and easy to accidently brush on/off against clothing or my desk.The earpieces themselves began to hurt after an hour of use, but I have found this problem with several headphones in the past which fully cover my ears.The only perks are that the cord is long, and thus I didn't have to move my CPU around as I've had to do for other sets.

Problem, is, there is a ghost in the prison that is uploaded into the game and starts killing people. First the virtual reality ones, then the real ones. In the end, it is (drum roll please) not defeatable. Now there is a twist. If you haven't seen this story line a half-dozen times before, you haven't been looking.The script is weak. It takes a good 30 minutes of the movie just to set up the background. The dialogue is nothing but F___k, and S____t. The acting is weak and ultimately the movie is a waste of whatever time you invest, including the time it takes to get the DVD out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Did you ever have one of those dreams where nothing makes sense, the dialog is poorly written and the acting is terrible? If you haven't, now's your chance to see what it's like. A group of drug using young but successful techy types use inexplicable technology in inexplicable ways. Hijinks ensue when a ghost starts killing people. Attempts are made at a plot. It doesn't turn out too well.To the writer's credit, the premise is fairly creative.

She would make a movie about needlepoint worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to launch","review":"Other reviewers have already spoken about the poor acting, dialog, sound, etc.After a slow beginning the movie launched into the \\"horror\\" sequence.

The acting is actually better than the material, but that's not really saying much at all. Rachel Taylor (Transformers) is at least easy to look at and she has a sexy Australian accent, but that alone doesn't save us from the boring story. Even the kills and villain are lame.

I'll be nice and round up to two stars out of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn inducing video game horror","review":"Ghost Machine is the latest in a line of gory cyber-horrors that is expected to cater to both horror fans and gamers alike. Coming from across the pond, Ghost Machine revolves around military video game techs Tom (Never Back Down's Sean Faris) and Vic (The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor's Luke Ford) who discover that their stolen software has been infected with the a vengeful ghost (Hatla Williams). Before you know it, Vic's military girlfriend Jess (Rachael Taylor from Shutter and Transformers) has immersed herself in the game as well, and things go from bad to worse before you know it. Loaded with stilted acting and poor CGI gore effects, Ghost Machine is pretty boring throughout, and takes plenty long enough to set up its plot. There are some decent moments of action to be found though, so the film as a whole isn't a total waste of time. All in all, you could do worse than Ghost Machine, but you could certainly do a lot better as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable... if there's nothing else to watch","review":"\\"Ghost Machine\\" is a pretty typical \\"people running around in a dark house getting killed\\" movie. The two most interesting things about it are:1) A lot of the action takes place in a virtual reality setting.2) It's a UK production (Northern Ireland), so people have accents.Other than that, there's nothing here that you haven't seen before. Also, as is typical of British production, the plot development and action move much more slowly than in US films. It takes a long time for anything to get going, and then it doesn't go very quickly.I \\"watched\\" this movie while I was working. It made good visual wallpaper, but I don't think it would have held my interest if I have been giving it my full attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"This feels like a SciFi (well, SyFy) special.

When I first heard about this movie I thought wow that's going to be cool. I was disappointed, although it was an interesting concept it never quite got off the ground. It was over 20 minutes into the movie before it even got interesting for me, but never delivered on the science, the fear, nor did I have any connection with the characters. Although I did like the acting of Luke Ford and Sam Corry, their characters were believable. I don't think it was completely a waste of time but would I watch it again? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitably Unghostly","review":"Despite having at least some potential for a good story( the way its described in the interview with the main writer of this film) we basically wind up with a poor cousin of the spookier kind. Even given that the writer Sven Hughes makes some reference to the EXISTENZ film, but traces the genesis of his idea ten years before to a scientist who experimented with religious experience inducing techniques; we also have a poor cousin of Poltergeist where the Ghost is not even as spooky as one could hope for, and the ending is as lame as three legged donkey.Admittedly, some cool gear is used, however, the cool gear is countermanded by some immensely boring sequences where we discover things, and we \\"get scared\\"... well no not really, a few good chills start to develop, but it feels like some editor or censor thought better of the idea. Even OPEN GRAVES is spookier than this film, and thats because Eliza Dushku is in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it...

I'd hoped it would be something worthwhile, futuristic, cyberpunk, etc. But, it wasn't.

I do like the idea behind the story, the VR device puts you into a \\"Waking Dream\\" state and that is where the ghosts are.Unfortunately, this good idea is buried under tons of bad acting, bad writing and poor FX. And I mean SyFy movie of the week bad. I don't know why some script writers think using swearing as punctuation for every sentence is a good idea, but it just comes off as something only people in movies do.Overall, if you are snowed in and need something to pass the time, it's OK. But don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"OK. So if you are incredibly bored, this movie will at least fill 92 minutes of your time. I tend to like bad horror movies because you can laugh at them. But this one has no humor, even the unintended kind. The plot has been way overused. If you can see anything original in it, you obviously have been eyesight than I do. The acting is about what you'd expect in the average low-end B movie. Watch it if you feel the need, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unoriginal","review":"I wanted to fall asleep during the first half hour or so of this movie. Not only is it boring there is just nothing original or unique about it. There are several scenes with badly done CGI, and others where the screen is almost black and you have no clue what is going on with the discombobulated storyline.About the only redeeming quality in this movie is Sean Farris and Rachel Taylor's acting. Both are excellent, especially when they are dealing with this storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Sweet It Is - NOT!","review":"I like some of Stryper's stuff, but this album is pretty lame.

I'm speaking for the entire series. The idea that a normal man can be brainwashed into becoming the perfect assassin is a brilliant idea and the fact that he cries every time he kills as a release is what makes this anime so great. Much of the time, Freeman is naked but you don't see any of his *important* parts due to shadows and this huge tattoo that covers his body.

For those of you who have seen and love the anime version you will understand what I mean if you ever decide to watch this one. The only good parts about this version are the actor/actress that play Freeman and Emu. I was told before watching that this was supposed to follow the anime version almost ver batum, and was sorely disappointed when I realized that was not the case. Too many scenes in this version did not even follow the storyline of the anime version.

His life's story shows that we can train ourselves to \\"see\\" without the physical sense of sight. There is much more happening in the brain and the mind of the blind person (or at least this particular blind person) than just the other four senses compensating for the loss of sight.Even those of us who do have physical sight see a very limited portion of the spectrum of light waves.

This reads like a bad mills and boon from the early 80's. They were part of their time and place but this book has no excuse. It had so many internal inconsistencies and cliches that it infuriated me.I was skimming by the end and even so it infuriated me. It was so predictable and banal.

Geez! If I have read this book first, I would have stopped there. This book is poorly written. It is an attempt at an old style romp which falls far short. The \\"hero\\" is quite unpleasant and ultimately unlikable. We are to believe that the mere sound of this heroine's voice is enough to make this guy change behaviors and attitudes that he has developed over a lifetime. Throughout the book the silliness builds until you think it can't get any worse. Then it does. The ending is supremely inane.

The dialogue is stilted and archaic; I had to keep reminding myself that the story takes place in the present. Only the continual mention of computers, the Internet and cell phones kept me in the 21st century.

I'll start with the high points since it is always good to start with a compliment. Dodd retains her sense of humor that you expect from reading her historicals, and that is good. The book moves fast so it can be read in one sitting (If you chose to finish it, that is) I don't however, believe that most people upon hearing that a child's parents had been accused of embezzlement would blame the child for the crime, especially in a modern city like Boston. That is just too unbelievable for words. Combine that with an irrational contempt for Wal-Mart (Hey, dosen't Wal-Mart sell her books?) and community colleges, and you have a reciepe for alienating most of your reading public.

I don't know if it was the characters (who I couldn't identify with), or the story (which didn't grab me) or the setting, or the time period, or whatever--I wasn't impressed.

She never took the time to make up her own mind about him. Not only that; she bad-mouths him to someone she thinks is in his employ (like her). I don't know about you, but in my experience that's not professional behaviour and her intolerance made me dislike her. I don't blame him for not telling her who he is after she jumps in insulting him the first time they talk. As it turned out, he was kind of a jerk sometimes, but that's besides the point.

The rest of the cast contributes plently with Ted McGinley being my favorite as Charley. The poor guy just can't win with Kelly.I wish this show had run longer or Kelly would do another sitcom.

Instead, I heard something that was more akin to John Tesh and Yanni (not that I own any of their albums, but I've heard the infomercials...) While there are a couple good songs, and certainly some fine guitar playing, I found the tracks ruined by the insertion of strings, disco-pop beats, and synthesizers a-la Tesh.

Its predecessor was an OK fantasy book, and I expected at least as much from this one. Unfortunately Ring of Intrigue doesn't live up even to its mediocre promise and ends up being rather annoying and dull.Mikheyel is the central point of the book and its best part. His emotional tangles are the most interesting portion of the tale and we are drawn into the book, if only at brief times. Plotlines from the first book are left hanging. Instead the book gives us pages of Khoratum dancers who want to dance again (please!), rulers making idiotically simple plots, etc. Its all played out and dull.If the rest of the series is going to be this lackluster, I wouldn't advise anyone to pick it up.

Aliens has always been one of my all time favorite movies. I never get tired of watching it. Cameron gave us great acting, speical effects, suspense, and kick ass action. Once the action starts it doesn't let up and its a roller coaster ride right to the finish. I enjoy most of the footage that Cameron put back in the Special Edition. Many of the restored scenes add more to the story and the charactes, especially Ripley. This one is a must have for any fan of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star classic;great entry in Alien movies.","review":"After seeing aliens i thought that it was the best sequel ever made.And now that i have the new version with the cut marteial,I know it is the best sequel ever made.Every body konws the story of course-war between marines and aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunningly created together with great acting!","review":"I really hit rockbottom when i recently could't find this on Laserdisc.

Aliens is the most gut-renchingly intense movie I've ever seen by far (second only to Terminator 2, also directed by James Cameron). It offers it all: Incredible action, believable characters, excellent direction and sound, good acting, and it's actually quite frightening, too. Totally blows the other Alien movies away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A RARE SEQUEL THAT STANDS UP TO THE ORIGINAL!","review":"This film has a completely different feel than the original film! This is a good thing, rather than make the same movie Ridley Scott did, James Cameron, goes all out in this explosive action Sci-Fi thriller! Great FX slow pacing and slam bang action make this one heck of a thrill ride!The creature design has been tweaked in this sequel and we get to see more of it and we get to see more of them! The Queen is a site to behold and the finale is probably the best \\"Cat Fight\\" in film history! I rate the film 4 1/2 stars only because the length could have been trimmed a little and Bill Paxton is the most whiniest marine I've even seen, even though he delivers some of the best lines in the movie. The DVD transfer on the box set is fantastic and you get two versions of the movie and plenty of extra material. The box set is the way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scifi every made","review":"This is the best Science Fiction movie ever made, and the two disk set is outstanding in every way. It offers beautiful packaging, two movies (theatrical and Special Ed), and a bonus behind the scenes disk. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens","review":"The first half of this film is like the first one. It's very slow and focuses more on scaring us rather than thrilling us. But then the second part kicks in, and the action never lets up.This film does that rare little thing that not many sequels can do: it surpasses the original. Everything about the film is better. The effects, the action and of course, the Aliens. They are more convincing this time around, due to a great blend of animatronics and puppetering, and as a result we are allowed to see more of them.Also, this film introduces us to the Alien Queen. She is one nasty mother ******. Also, I think that she was actually designed by the director of the film, James Cameron, as well as many other things. So this is HIS film, in every sense of the word.The acting is great, but the film can slow down at times, which does hamper your viewing pleasure. The additional seventeen minutes are good, though. I thought that they made the film better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens: Better, WAY BETTER, Than The Original","review":"Aliens is one of the best films ever made and is way better than Alien. Unfortuanlly, the 2 bad sequels can kind of out shadow it sometimes. Aliens takes Sigourney Weaver, in a Oscar-Nominated Role, and has it where she is in the future. She goes back to the alien's planet and must defeat them. She teams up with some of the most memorable characters from any film, the Marines. Lead by Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn of The Terminator), they are tougher then the aliens, but not as quick.Aliens was breakthrough in Special FXs and makeup effects. The alien queen, from the cover of the DVD, is a very life-like creature and looks like it can do a lot of damage. It has amazing set designs of the Alien queen's hive and the colony of which the aliens have taken over.Sadly enough, the DVD doesn't due this film justice. It does not have the special features that Aliens needs. But, this is still a must have for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Five Star Movie if there ever was one","review":"I'd only feel insignificant trying to add my comments to the number of good reviews here.

Why has the DVD revolution become an excuse to shovel in useless \\"bonus\\" footage from the cutting room floor? Films are historical and artistic documents, and are meant to be seen they way they were originally released. \\"Aliens: the Special Edition\\" is a glaring example of this. You can argue up and down as to the merits of the 17 extra minutes of footage (I, for one, think they dilute the plot, hamper the pacing, and leave less to the viewer's imagination), but the fact remains that this is not \\"Aliens\\" as it was intended to be. If you're a purist, steer clear of this one. (That is, until the marketeers decide to make a few extra bucks by putting out an \\"Aliens: the Theatrical Release\\" someday)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Damaged disks","review":"The movie I received was damaged and refused to play past 1 hour.

The only unfortunate thing is the transfer seems less clear than the one on the previous widescreen VHS version with the plastic cover. It's like watching an old movie on tv rather than being crisp and clear like The Fifth Element or a great DVD. I gave away my VHS copy in anticipation of this, unfortunately. Still it's such a great film it can be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any DVD collection.","review":"Only a handful of sequels have surpassed their originals. 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Terminator 2', 'The Godfather Part 2', and 'Aliens'. A true masterpiece, Aliens, is the cream of the crop when it comes to Sci-Fi horror, and no film has come close since its release back in 1986. A rollercoaster ride that doesn't let up."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES EVER MADE!","review":"Well its the best science fiction movie in my book anyway. A James Cameron masterpiece. Usually sequels do not add up to the original, but this is different. The technical and special effects aspects of this movie have made it a classic. The acting and story is also great. There is just something about this movie that amazes me. I've seen it over 30 times and I still can't get enough. James Cameron is a true visionary. Kick ass Vasquez and all hail Ripley!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A so so DVD","review":"The movie of Aliens on this DVD is really nice. The extra 17 minutes of footage fill in pieces of the plot and make the movie have a better more rounded plot. Almost worth the DVD itself.However, I said almost...There are no good extra's on this DVD. No directors commentary, in fact, there are no commentaries at all on this DVD!What extra's there are on this DVD are pathetic; Some short home footage of the model of the Base and Atmosphere Processor on LV-426, and how the Face Hugger, and Chest Burster mechanics work and a concept of the Alien Queen. There are also some stills from the movie and that's about it. I expected a whole lot more.As a movie, I would rate the 5 out of 5, but as a DVD, only 2 out of 5.Mr. James Cameron can make some really good movies, but his DVD's really stink in comparison to what other directors put on their DVD's.If your a hardcore Aliens fan, get this, other than that, spend your money on the Gladiator DVD since it is a much better DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Alien movies...","review":"This is one is a must have movie for any new BD player.

This DVD serves as a reminder as to the great job editors can do for a movie. The extra footage provides us with a pointless scene in which Newt's family discover's the alien ship, a cheesy sideplot revealing Ripley's motherly side, and sappy heartwarming talk bewteen Ripley and Hicks. Yes, with four minutes left until nuclear meltdown, Hicks tells Ripley his name is Duane.These are indeed 17 minutes best left on the cutting-room floor.

I have always liked this film & enjoy watching it time & time again. The Blu-Ray is pretty good, with some minor grain throughout. The picture quality is much better than the Dvd. For me it is definitely worth having. The audio sounded real good to me, although I listen through external speakers hooked up to my old fashioned stereo system. There are also {2} versions of the movie on this disc. I prefer the extended version myself. As far as special features go there is a Commentary, Deleted Scenes & {2} Musical scores. Overall I would say if you don't want all {4} movies but maybe just this one like me, than I say go ahead & get it. I'm sure you will like it. One last thing.

This is my opinion though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph Conrad in the Alien Movies","review":"Ok, I've said I love this movie before, but that's not what I'm here about. As far as I can tell, I don't think anyone has noticed this before: Every ship in the first two movies is named after a book or town in a Joseph Conrad novel. The Nostromo is named after his book, called, well, \\"Nostromo\\"; the Narcissus is from his book the \\"N-----(it's an offensive word) of the Narcissus\\" and the Sulaco is the name of the town from \\"Nostromo\\". I guess the whole \\"Heart of Darkness\\" thing parrallels with the Alien movies, but in the last two Alien movies, the script writers were too stupid to get this. I mean, geezus, they could have named the Auriga the \\"Brute\\" or \\"Duelist\\" or something from Conrad, if just to keep up the tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Special Edition","review":"This should be the Special Edition, since it's running time is 154 minutes. It should have all the stuff that they made Cameron cut out (like the relationship between Ripley and Hicks, the colonists finding the aliens, the ultimately cool \\"sentinel guns\\" and whole lot more). This should be the same version that was released in the UK and similar to a version that was shown on TV a few years back.If this is indeed the Special/UK version, then it automatically gets five stars. I'd give it six if I could.I hate using the word \\"should\\" a lot, but there's no way to tell for sure. All I know is that the running time extactly matches that of the UK version. I couldn't dig any info up about this DVD release on the Net.

It was alright. Then I rented Aliens. It is now on my top 7 favorite movies. I haven't seen Alien ressurection, but out of the original trilogy it is the best, I recommend it, (but then again Terminators 1 & 2 are good so it may be Jim Cameron).

The film plays upon fears that people generally have--the unknown, the dark, insects--and exploits all of them brilliantly.

There is Alien, Aliens, and then, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. Aliens is the best of these four, because it is the most action-based and the scariest ( the second best is The Resurrection, being the second scariest ) film of the saga. It is great, that this movie has many aliens, not just one, like in Alien, and Alien 3. This is as frightening as the game; Alien vs. Predator, and you will enjoy watching this film second, third, and fourth and beyond times, because this is a classic you should watch at least once...

I already own the disc and would not buy another when the sound has not been upgraded to DTS, et al. I was accused of being an \\"audiophile\\" way back in the days of vinyl (that is one who is more interested in tweeking expensive equipment than listening to music) and this could be true.

I suppose they are digital artifacts or film grains. The picture is very sharp in some places, but grainy in others, expecially when the background becomes dark. If you pause the DVD once in a while during the chapter when Ripley goes back into the complex to get the girl, you'll see what I mean. I watched the Alien DVD (first movie) on the same TV set and the picture stayed sharp in that one, none of this fuzzy stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series","review":"I think this is the best of the series of Alien movies. The addition of the new scenes add to the film & help some of the continuity. They also freshen it up & almost make it a new movie.

The DVD transfer seems well done too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic film, shame about the 'special edition'","review":"The point of an editor within a film is to weed out uneeded material and ensure the film works and runs seamlessly. Maybe if I had never viewed the original, watching the special edition may not seem so bad to watch.Most of what is added stands out from the rest of the film...it seems weakly scripted but for the most part is irrelevant and spoils the impact for some of the scenes.Unfortunatley now the original edition is never shown on television or is available to on DVD.

I also felt this film had no right borrowing elements from the adrenaline-charging but limbbrained Rambo film series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated series!","review":"Almost everybody I know who's seen this movie loved it. But I have to be honest...this movie is so totally boring, I almost fell asleep when I saw it. And what's the point with letting this movie last for 2 1/2 hours. What a total waste of time. I haven't seen the first one, but the third wasn't so bad. The only thing which is keeping me from rating this movie 1 star, is the killing of Bishop (Lance Henriksen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated: Get Standard Version Instead","review":"This review is of the special edition of Aliens, which clocks in at 150 minutes, versus 117 for the theatrical release. This version moves with the pace of molasses in wintertime. The extra bits would have been nice as \\"deleted scenes\\" extras, but plugged into the movie, they ruin the ride. Instead of an adrenaline, white-knuckle experience, this is a cure for insomnia. I recommend getting the normal version, which is an awesome movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Will Not Play","review":"Not a Review for the movie but the instant watching version.This is the only video in my video library that will not play.Waste of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must own for any Science Fiction Fan","review":"This movie is absolutely fantastic for blu-ray. I was a little worried whether or not this movie would get the right treatment for high definition. So many classics have been butchered when it comes to bluray releases and I am just so happy that they truly spared no expense in making sure this movie looked fabulous.For all Aliens fans or for anyone that hasn't seen it, this is the time to jump aboard because this movie feels so new and fresh again that it is worth the purchase to upgrade from DVD.

Soldiers were in a place where there was many aliens and had to fight all of them. But how do the aliens kill? All I know, is that they do use their second mouth. The queen was huge and it ripped one guy in half around the ending. Good to watch. The aliens were kinda creepy looking too.

The special edition with it's extra footage (showing the discovery of the alien craft) adds so much more to the film and ensures that those who have not seen or remember Alien, will enjoy it.Of course, the DVD version ensures that you see it in the glory that Mr. Cameron expected. Turn up the volume on your home theatre system when Bishop rescues Ripley and Newt from the mother alien - you will see, hear and feel what it's like to \\"punch it\\" out of a reactor about to go critical.Buy it - NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripleys One Bad B*tch","review":"This has to be one of the best action movies ever! There are times where I feel like watching Merchant Ivory films, then there are times when I feel like watching some A** getting kicked.

It's bigger and in some ways better than the first, but there's no hiding the fact, there's less surprises and less atmosphere than in the first one.Ripley's character is expanded and Sigourney Weaver's performance is even better in this film than the first one. It's more action than horror or science fiction but an exhilarating roller coaster ride of a film with deservedly award winning special effects.The 17 minutes of additional footage in the special edition slows things down a little bit, but gives us important details which improves the over-all film.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder...."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"Different, but worthy sequel (and it should've been the only sequel), Aliens is more of an action film than its predecessor. Although afflicted with terribly commericial sensibilities, James Cameron certainly always gives 100%, and this is an action movie you can enjoy without compromising your intelligence. It's well-made, solid fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real humanitic action story.","review":"Some people call T1 and T2 a real humanitic story. But I don't think so. This film called Aliens is a true classic that will be remained to the people in this world. The 17 minute plus director's cut is kind of long, but still one of the best action films. I think it's better than the original because it has more action, thrills, and it showed the dark side of future. These Alien series isn't just a plain action sci-fi film. This shows the dark side of the greedy company, it also shows cooperative things that should be shown in the actual human life, we can see the relationship between Ripley, Hicks, and the kid. So people who just call this film an enjoyable no-brainer, are stupid! I give it 4.5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super awesome","review":"This movie is not as good as the first but the end fight scene is definitely awesome. And the movie on the whole is pretty rad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game over man!","review":"The second and last truly good Aliens movie. You really can't go wrong owning this. Lots of good action, aliens, a great cast and of course I can't leave out the one and only Hudson. He makes this movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vision of mastery","review":"The first version of this sci-fi film was weaker in story, and narrative impact than this expanded version. It's the original vision of James Cameron's intense sci-fi.Visual and mechanical effects here are not outdated yet. The sight of our central character, Ripley, holding adorable Newt in her arms in front of the mother of all space monsters, the Queen Alien is a standout of the genre.Ripley is played compellingly by Sigourney Weaver. The only question that remains from watching this sci-fi masterpiece is \\"why didn't Weaver get an Oscar?\\" You have every right to ask that. It seems hard to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT ALIEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN.","review":"This movie is by far better than alien, the original first film. The first film is good, but cannot match the tension that permeates the sequel. Aliens just plain rocks!!!! By the way steer clear of Alien3."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sequel Ever Made","review":"Aliens is the best sequel ever made in my opinion. This movie had it all, more aliens lots of gung ho soldiers and a cute little girl who shames Paxton with her courage. Couldn't of asked for more from a sequel. Now what came after in the other installments is another story. What they should have done or should do if they ever make another installment is to have it where Earth actually finds the home planet of the Aliens and sends in an a large force to destroy the horrible creatures for ever. A good title would be called \\"Aliens Genocide.\\" Lots of action and you wouldn't even need to have a good plot, just shoot em up bang bang.Or you could have where we capture an alien and bring it to Earth for study and it gets loose and runs amuck, but that would surely be horrible but you can expect something like that. Go with the Home planet idea. {:~)But I won't hold my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not AS good as the original","review":"Aliens is not as good at Alien, but not by much. It's still action-packed, fun, suspenseful, and even scary sometimes. The only thing I think makes this a little worse than Alien is that they do too much shooting in this one, which is OK, but it doesn't create as much atmosphere or suspense as the first one did. Sometimes I think Aliens is a little overrated, but it's still great fun! The Special Edition DVD is great, s I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Aliens fans","review":"This is great for any fan of the original theatrical release of Aliens. The deleted scenes really add to the story. I appreciate having the full picture of what happened before the Marines arrived, and also having more info on Ripley's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sci-Fi Horror Ever Made","review":"This is the best sci-fi horror movie ever made. It isn't no where near as dark as the first one and had a great script to back it up. This one had far better special effects then the original but then again it was seven years later. Instead of one alien they create a legion of them over running a city that is now gone cause of them. Segourney Weaver gives an outstanding performance along with Micheal Bein, Bill Paxton and Paul Rieser. The scene where Ripley takes on the Mother Alien is thrilling on the edge of your seat entertainment. James Cameron knew what he was doing to put out a movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"It may not be the first one but it is a very good sequil anyway. ( Make that only good sequil) Since the alien movies become even more horrible and less scary, they make this movie look like a classic. The only thing wrong with this movie is that the marines make it seem boring. But buy it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"not scary like the first one","review":"They were shooting and killing the aliens like flies in this movie and thats not scary.What made the first one so scary was you couldn't kill it it almost seemed invinsible.In this sequel they are killing aliens left and right with simple guns whats scary about that?I'm one of the few who found this movie a huge disappointment.I also don't understand why they waited so long to make a sequel since the first one was such a huge hit.It probably had to do with the person in charge of 20th century fox quiting.The new person in charge didn't like alien i heard and didn't want to do a sequel.I haven't seen one james cameron film that is good,that includes terminator 2 and titanic.Wish they could have kept ridley scott for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take me to your failure","review":"This movie is trash compared to the original Alien, which is beautiful. Aliens (2) is full of cliche stereotypical James Cameron mainstream storytelling. It tries to turn a horror movie into a family movie, with goofy dialogue (though some of it is humorous), a prominent \\"poor and innocent yet optimistic and brilliant\\" child role which is really annoying, another cliche annoying \\"I'm stuck up and will do anything for money\\" character, a cliche \\"Hero\\" character, and crazy meaningless numb violence. The only good things about it is Bill Paxton is fun to watch and there are a few neat special effects. Do yourself a favor and watch the original Alien, again if you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie ruined by extra footage","review":"This is a great movie, but the twenty minutes of extra footage is ridiculous. Yes, as a fan, I was curious to see the extra footage. But no, as a fan, I do not want to have to watch it again. The new scenes are sometimes long, sometimes boring, but mostly just annoying. Other DVDs, such as Austin Powers, provide cut scenes as bonus materials on the DVD menu. This is a nice feature. The same should have been done with Aliens. If you have three hours to spare and are a loyal fan, buy this DVD. Otherwise, wait until they (hopefully) will release the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"To me the worst Alien movie","review":"The idea of having not just one but an army of aliens to fight was interesting. But that's about all that is interesting about this sequel. James Cameron could not resist making another childish movie with simplistic characters (the soldiers), unrealistic relations we just don't care about (Ripley and the girl), and stupid robot scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoned dvd's","review":"I recently purchased this dvd and had it shipped to New Zealand the zone warning came up but i took a gamble anyway.

I'm a proud female and I was always taught that the main duties of women include cooking, making sure the family is content, making clothes and avoiding the work force. So just who does Ripley think she is?? A man?? Uh nooo... but that's not the only reason I give this movie such a low score. The story was boring and aliens were just way too disgusting for me.

Ripley's extra-motherly affection for the little girl to name only one thing. I am delighted to see more and more movies in it's intended cut, not the studio cut, which is often geared towards a (percieved?) short-attention span audience.Aliens is one of the examples on how a movie can get better by re-editing and adding footage, and last but not least the DVD sound and picture quality are excellent. Sci-Fi fan, go get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Transfer","review":"This Blu-ray rendition is top-notch. It purposefully retains the film's grain - a decision that likely was made as opposed to smearing the image in attempting to remove it.The audio is superb - one of the best mixes for any movie.

Lt. Ripley is also one of the most memorable characters in any sci-fi movie or science fiction franchise. Aliens is so good, I can almost forgive Sigourney Weaver for her recent, ridiculously cheesy Direct TV commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Movies.","review":"Aliens is the best of the Alien series of films, it is one of the greatest action films ever made, and it is, along with The Terminator and The Abyss, one of the defining films of James Cameron's early career.This DVD presents both the adrenaline pumping, oppressive, upsetting, and exciting theatrical cut, and the longer, better developed director's cut. Both are excellent films, and for the picture to be truly appreciated, both are essential. If one is better, it is the theatrical cut: the filmmakers were forced to jettison all but the essential pieces of the story and action, making for a brutal, exhilarating ride.The special features are equally worthwhile, most especially the commentary and introduction by Cameron. The film speaks for itself, however, and we should each feel individually privileged to have both versions presented to us in such excellent sound and picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the greatest sci-fi film of all time ...","review":"\\"Aliens\\" is the shining star of this series. James Cameron produced a masterpiece which succeeds on multiple levels. The movie provides white-knuckled, edge of your seat excitement. The scenes with the colonial Marines preparing to descend to planet LV-417 are superb and build the tension.Sigourney Weaver as Ripley excels as the on-board Cassandra warning the high-tech warriors that all their vaunted weaponry and arrogance may fare poorly against the potent xenomorph. A terrific supporting cast too. Sprinkled throughout the taut thriller is some funny as hell dialogue and lines which will have you slapping your knees.A masterpiece that survives multiple viewings 22 years after it was first released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consola's Done It Again!","review":"Given the variety of compilation CD's available these days, I have been frequently disappointed by so-called \\"continuous mixes\\" of \\"current\\", \\"cutting edge\\" music featuring one or two great cuts padded with six or eight pieces of junk gathering dust in someone's piano bench.

There's just a ton here and it continues to wait for me to dig further. There are so many stories and you enter a world that you know exists somewhere out there, portrayed lovingly in these pages.

It's sad to watch how low his standards had plummeted in the 3 years since \\"Don't Shoot Me\\" and \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". Instead of the driving rock of \\"Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting\\" Rock of the Westies serves up the cliche-driven \\"Grow Some Funk Of Your Own\\". Taupin's usual lyrical cleverness is conspicuously absent from weak songs like \\"I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun Of Robert Ford)\\" and \\"Billy Bones\\". Granted, Elton still had a ways to fall, but his descent unquestionably begins with \\"Rock Of The Westies\\". I recommend any of his albums prior to this one. This is not the Elton John CD to spend your 13 bucks on if you havent yet purchased \\"Dont Shoot Me\\", \\"Honky Chateau\\" or \\"Madman Across The Water\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure but not Oblivious","review":"This was one of the last albums before Bernie and Elton quit working together and was in a peroid of waning popularity for Elton, also he was using many differant musicians in this peroid. This album is worth purchasing alone for the epic and beautiful\\"I Feel Like a Bullet(In the Gun of Robert Ford), but is then followed by the jazzy and wistful shuffle of \\"Feed Me\\". Two of Elton Johns greatest tunes in my opinion.Also take a listen to the \\"Medley (Yell Help, Wednesday Night,Ugly)\\" and of course the Hit \\"Island Girl: and you'll see why Elton John is one of the most prolific songwriters of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton's Hardest Rockin' Album!","review":"I LOVE this album! Having owned everything Elton's put out, Rock of the Westies is, in my opinion one of his top 5 albums--though it's a bit underappreciated. This is E.J.'s hardest edge album with heavy reliance on guitar licks throughout. It's got a funky and slightly weird edge. Its beauty lies in it's roughness where as lately, Elton has become so polished.In many ways, this work is very similar to the earlier release, Honky Chateau (coincidentally the only other E.J. album cover that pictures him bearded). It's got that same New Orleans edge but with heavier guitar and strings. Not as popular as some of his other mid-1970's releases, it's best to take Rock of the Westies as a whole. The only successful single off this album was Island Girl.If you love the crazy, funky Elton John of the mid-1970's, then next to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Rock of the Westies is a great choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock of the Westies","review":"Ok,maybe I am wrong but this is for me the worst Elton's album. The songs are not catchy. Someone said here that Elton's tank runs out of gas. And that is true. GYBR is great album and also Caribou and other albums from 70'es but this just isn't. Only good song here is Island girl(that is something like Crocodile rock). Dan Dare sounds like ugly interpretation but it's funny.In all this rock songs there are not even a good song like Pinball Wizard or Saturday...! Only good thing is that this is Elton's last album with songs like here. I don't want even to imagine how will be sounded Rock of the Westies(part two). I know that almost no one will be agree with me but don't shoot me ,I am just a guy with my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Often Overlooked Gem","review":"Released in the Spring of 1975, \\"Rock of the Westies\\" was the last great album by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. It most definitely rocks harder than most of his albums, but in a distictive style consistent with and instantly recognizable as Elton.Notable tracks include the mega hit \\"Island Girl\\" which is still a pleasure and has held up much better than most contemporary chart toppers. \\"I Feel Like a Bullet\\" is a classic EJ tune in a similar style to other songs from prior albums,I've often wondered why it wasn't a bigger hit.\\"Medley\\" and \\"Grow Some Funk of Your Own\\" rock with the best and \\"Dan Dare\\" is a quirky gem.

Some of it is for sure: \\"Island Girl\\" was a big hit, which is interesting because it's also offensive faux-reggae and #1,234,567,890 in a long line of Bad Elton John Songs about Hookers; \\"Dan Dare\\" is a space-funk flop; \\"Hard Luck Story\\" is a rote Elton rocker. The other single, \\"Grow Some Funk of Your Own\\", is much better, a lighthearted funk stomp with a funny chorus; the band rocks out on the \\"Saturday Night\\"-like \\"Street Kids\\"; \\"Feed Me\\" is a nice little subdued melodrama with a screaming guitar part; the Bo Diddley/heavy metal fusion \\"Billy Bones and the White Bird\\" is so weird you have to hear it at least once. Not overly brilliant, but pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Island Girl was absolutely HUGE. All cds that follow classics take a beating by the so-called critics. Caribou was blasted after Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - so you had to expect a lot of downers for Rock Of The Westies after Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy. Lots of quality in this cd though, and unusually hard driving pieces of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Download the few great tracks from this one","review":"This was a disappointment but it did turn up a few gems. \\"Billy Bones and the White Bird\\" was a great rocker with thundering drums, a must-have for any Elton John fan. \\"Island Girl\\" was a textbook Elton John single for that era, and \\"I Feel Like A Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford\\" was a first class Elton John ballad; don't settle for live versions of the song that appear on compilations. Of the remaining six songs only \\"Feed Me\\" would be worth downloading.Imagine the shock of hearing an album open with not one but two awful songs before rolling into the single. This had been unheard of for an Elton John album up to that point. \\"Grow Some Funk Of Your Own\\" was a grade Z single at the time and in retrospect is better left forgotten.The few memorable songs make this the last hurrah of Elton's seventies classics. One can't hold his subsequent recording history against him too much though given the string of great music he gave us in the early to mid-seventies."},{"rating":"2","title":"second best to the jam","review":"The \\"mod\\" movement of the late 70's in England was bound to die as are all fads. Most of the \\"mod\\" music that came out of that period stunk (secret affair, lambrettas, etc). The Chords were different. Even though they wore the mod uniform, musically they held a lot in common with some of the more punk bands. I think that they are the closest I've heard to the Damned. Anyway, the album is fantastic. It's full of teenage anthems that carry with you all day long. For those of you just beginning to explore the mod scene, this is a must to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"mod revival leaders","review":"Well, if you were around in 1979 then 'the Chords' must mean something to you.I recently bought this album (after years of trying to find it in dusty record shops).Tracks like 'Maybe Tomorrow' blast me right back to those mod times with a burning nostalgia.Being in England ,only two bands mattered..the kings of em all,The Jam and the Chords.Their version of Sam and Dave's 'Hold on I'm coming',has a raw edge and a certain uniqueness.I'm not too sure about 'she said,she said' though!A lot of these songs hold a real insight into the minds of 19 year old British youth culture,all love and angst.Keep listening...it grows on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a SHORT while","review":"It worked for a month or so, then it seemed to indicate that my fridge was having issues.

I had bought this model, luckily for only $6 back last July. It did not work at all out of the box. Would not go below 50 degrees or so, even in the freezer. At the time I also bought the MUI #90062MIU #90062 Commercial Freezer Thermometer, which worked fine, as in both the fridge and the freezer, and it has a much nicer display, and since they raised the price on the Cookrite, the MUI model is cheaper too. I verified the Mui is accurate with a mercury thermometer. The Cookrite would come close, like I wrote it was off by over 30 degrees. I was going to send an email to the maker of the Cookrite or return it to Amazon, but for 6 bucks it wasn't worth my time to pack & ship.

It contains all of Crashaw's works including his Latin poems.

Nomzamo and No Love Lost are inspiring and breathtaking. The lyrics of Human Nature are a masterpiece. The rythm and melody changes are stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not strictly progressive but...","review":"This album was released during the period in which IQ changed temporarily his original singer (who then reunited with the band and still remains in the group). With the entrance of the new vocalist the group acquired a more commercial oriented approach, which perhaps hadn't the favor of the most progressive fans of the band. Still, for me is a very good album with an excellent and very catchy song: \\"Promises\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"When Proggers Go POP","review":"Trust the other less-than-enthusiastic reviews regarding Nomzamo and don't waste your money!

When I saw a new CD by him I bought two copies so I could turn someone else on to his music. I am sad to say that this collaboration with Carly didn't work for me.

This CD will get one more play before it get relegated to the back of the pile. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Clear is WONDERFUL","review":"May I first address the AMAZON review written by a John Diliberto.Carly Simon does not appear on Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring or Carol of the Drums--both songs are wonderful instrumentals.Mr Vollenweider treats us to stunning interpretations of classic Christmas songs such as The Holly and The Ivy (11th century, France) and Child in a Manger (Gaelic folk song).He also introduces the uneducated music fan, like myself, to some amazing songs like The Coventry Carol (15th century, England), The Wexford Carol (12th Century, England), Over the Hills and Over the Vale (15th century Italy) and many more...Andreas and Ms. Simon bring this collection into 2006 and beyond with 4 songs sung by Ms Simon.

In fact you can put this on any time of year and it can be played gently in the background to envelope your dinner party guests!

Sorry to say, this is a major disappointment. The ONLY track worth hearing a second time is \\"Midnight Clear\\", with Carly Simon's achingly beautiful vocals. The worst crime is \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\" -- one of the most sublime pieces of music ever written, here marred beyond repair by the senseless addition of a bizarre repetitive interlude midway through.

Its more like a book about the author's depression. I was expecting a story about the actual attack and the events which happened immediately after the attack, sort of like the mountain climbing accidents I often read about. It was nothing like that at all. Also, this book is not for those with a queasy stomach. I could hardly read some of the details of surgery and medical conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, bad book","review":"Per Bak's ideas (and ideas of others that are occasionally presented without quoting the original sources) are remarkably interesting, but the book itself seems to be a product of an uncontrolled avalanche in author's brain. Too low rigor and signal-to-noise to be interesting scientifically, too poorly written to be read as fiction - sorry, two stars. A 10-page summary could have done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"no universality classes...","review":"Per Bak has a record as one of the best, most stimulating physicists of our age. However, I am not happy with the idea of SOC and do not count it as among his best work. The weakness is that universality classes for sandpile models (and complex adaptable systems) have never been defined. Without universality classes one cannot claim that an arbitrary mathematical model (like a sandpile model or a 'complex adaptable system') describes or explains anything in nature. One or a few scaling exponents do not define a universality class for systems away from criticality. There is no evidence, to date, that turbulence, economics, and most other phenomena that occur in nature or society are critical phenomena. Socio-economic phenomena surely do not obey any invariant laws of motion. I suspect that the best that one can hope for is a model that maybe works temporarily and then fails because moods and behavior change, like the Black-Scholes option pricing pde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Per Bak is overwhelmed by his own enthusiasm for his theory","review":"Per Bak came up with a nice theory for complex systems. Potentially it has wide ranging implications, however it remains speculative at the moment. I think SOC will in time come to be a useful tool for describing a broad class of complex systems however I doubt it will ever reach the hyperbole given in this book. Unfortunately Bak's turned this book into a sales pitch for his theory, forgotten any pretense of reasoned arguement and so spoiled what could of been a good popular science book on what is a extremely interesting are.If you are of a slightly mathematical bent get Jensen's book. There you will get a reasoned account of what SOC has given us and what is has not even if you skip some of the derivations. Balance is something you won't find in Bak's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physicist Opens Lab Window","review":"Science often progresses when physicists open their lab windows and look at the real world. Bak's book is a fun popular read for everyone.His intent on being the man who extented Newton's laws is self evident. Not a scholarly text, not probably intended to be so, Bak is quite unaware of intellectual activities other than his own.Other reviews point out the complete lack of reference to fundamental advances in what he claims to be HIS invention.We in geology welcome Bak's discovery of the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written drivel","review":"I have read a large number of books on complex systems but this one is by far the worst that I have come across. The writing is poor, unengaging, and overly verbose. He also tries to give himself much more credit than he is due. Given Bak's obnoxious reputation, I should have expected this but I had my hopes before I started reading. Unfortunately I put the book down completely unimpressed.

As soon as it was online it sounded terrible. I am nursing it along only running it for the minimum of two hours per day. I figure it will also quit soon, again, due to the impeller.

It is an action packed film. It has a good story to go with that action. It has some comedic moments and it has some old school direction. One of the very few good Rolan Emmerich films that has come our way. The story is pretty simple , but it has many layers. It is a film about loyalty , orders , honor and betrayal. It is about what defines a machine and what defines a human and where do we draw the line. I think if your looking for something fun with a story and some cool action. You can't go wrong with this movie. Jean Claude Van Damme is great with his moves and his acting gets better. Dolph well he steals the show and he is all \\" ears\\" here pun intended. This blu-ray has a good video and audio track and it is a decent upgrade and at the price it is selling.

For me, Dolph made this movie more than Van Damne! I actually found his character funny as well as sinister. Van Damne's character was definitely a straight shooter here.Overall, it has good action, a few cheesy moments but also a few memorable catch phrases (some of which I can't repeat here).

Heaven sent these two lords for the holiest movie of all. Van Damme beats up guys at a diner because he couldn't pay for the lunch bill and Lundgren kicks three guys in the face at one time. Talent! There is a good pacing to this movie that even grandma could keep up with, and it's still lordage. You may need to sit down on this one, it's intense with a final fight in a barn.

But I started reading Twilight Of Fury and could not put it down. Not only have I read the whole novel but I have read almost everything on Mr. Matlock's website- I didn't care about the recipes though. Most of the sound files are good too. I think what I really appreciate is the way Mr. Matlock writes details. They're blended into the story without getting in the way. I like the way the story pulls you along and creates a mini-movie in your head as you read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre grammar and poor structure","review":"One bogus review after another. Matlock's grammar is borderline while the story structure is marginal at best. And the British syntax is not even close, according to a British friend. She said Matlock's British verbage is akin to something out of Disney.As for the historical accuracy, the HISTORICAL NOVEL REVIEW insist they have never heard of of JOE MATLOCK, nor Hilliard & Harris, whom happens to be a PRINT ON DEMAND PUBLISHER (aka vanity press!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive for a mainstream drama","review":"I read mostly mysteries and thrillers. Dramas, particularly historical mainstream, tend to be too slow, artsy and full dull information and talk. Twilight Of Fury surprised me. Matlock wasted little on useless data and the story proved to be exciting if not, at times, a thriller. It has love interest but not romance in the strictest sense. It has military conflict but it's not a war story. It has drama but it's several notches above social ho-hum. The aerial combat is exciting and I loathe manly 'motor' books. Last part of the book was wonderfully thought out. Several men I know need to read this book; my boyfriend is one of them! Matlock's website was a little boring for my taste since I don't care about history."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say?","review":"Below, a review has called to others to state more.

So much here can be learned through entertainment but the reader must volunteer to take that step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a sports car, this novel shifts gears...","review":"Excellent descriptive reviews have been given below so I'll write this as an opinion.This novel shifts gears like a sports car moving through varied driving situations. Life is fluid dynamics and Twilight Of Fury lives those dynamics. Matlock does not tell a story, he helps you live it.Five stars is something I'd give to a classic, like A Christmas Carol, and while Twilight Of Fury is probably a contemporary classic worthy of five stars, I just can't do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"not like the cartoon but still good","review":"this movie is good for martial artist it has great fight scenes'of course its gary and the scene were he takes on all of shins hench men is very cool one after a nother. not like the toon but its live action how can it be that gory without bigtime effects. besides i would rather see great fight scenes instead of computer c g"},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditional Hollywood [garbage]","review":"This is yet another poorly done martial arts movie. The acting (what acting?) is garbage. The plot is much the same. Also, being a blue-belt in Tae Kwon Do (Take my dough) and a green belt in ninjitsu (student of Stephen Hayes) I have a pretty good idea of what is and is not realistic in a fight. The martial arts used is standard Tae Kwon Do (mostly kicks; mostly for competition). So basically the fighting is completely unrealistic (when's the last time you saw someone throw a kick after the first 5 seconds of a fight?).This unrealistic fighting wouldn't be as bad for your suspension of disbelief if it wasn't for the ... plot and acting. If you want to see a similarly-themed movie that is at least slightly better I'd reccomend \\"Blood Sport\\". At least Van Damne has 2nd-rate acting skills which is still way over the abilities of any actors in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live action vs. Anime","review":"Ok first of all, this movie is Live action. Your not gonna get the gore quality of Anime without kickin out some serious bucks. Had George Lucas and his movie entourage taken over this production then many of the opinions written here would be justifiable. Unfortunately it wasn't, so what are we left with? A decent dialogue, extremely well rehearsed fight sequences that smack of John Woo, and a very good storyline. Gary Daniels and Costas pair off very well together. If you want a Hot action movie then this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars...AAAAGGGHHHHHHH.......","review":"This is, quite honestly, a low-budget ripoff of a good idea by people who had absolutely NO clue as to what \\"Fist Of The North Star\\" was actually about. Downtown Julie Brown is downright laughable in her role. If you've read this far, you're WAY too interested in this waste of time and probably need therapy in the worst way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Ok the Orignal Fist Of The Northstar movie was good for it's time. However, this real life remake is crazy good. I like the fact that even though this product seems to be made on a low budget they kept everything important intact. For example, this move has very artistic moments. The acting is very good and the storyline is even better than the orginal(even tough it basically is)this one makes the story easyier to follow. The one thing that made this movie almost impossible to make on this budget and at this time was Ken's strength. The moto \\"fists fly heads explode\\" translate to \\"fist fly why didn't his head explode\\". A true fan would say hey they tried, or at least this if humerious. Good job, you have done well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give Lower, I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the most heinous tribute to an anime feature I have ever had the sorry displeasure to ever witness. The fight scenes were mediocre, the actors were as exciting as 3 day old dish water, and the fact that they had the nerve to associate it with so venerable and revered an anime classic as the TRUE FIST, makes me wish to humbly vomit in the ajacent vacinity of these film makers. Why would Malcolm McDowell lower himself to so low an estate as to associate himself with such a slipshot production? What the hel possessed the film makers to even make it? Do they wish to insult the public?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 good fights","review":"This movie is pretty terrible, I saw it on the sci-fi channel, it's basically Cyborg. The name of this franchise proves Shakespeare's \\"rose is still a rose\\" quote wrong, if it was called Blood Fued or some other corny name no one would give a dang about it. The first fight Kenshiro gets into is the best, very stylized, the sparse sound effects make it more powerful. The .5 is a culmination of a combo here a kick there. Gary Daniels does this pretty wicked spinning side kick, but I have to critcize him for taking Van Dam's splits spin kick. I wouldn't even bother renting this though. Now that I think of it, I think Street Fighter was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Christ!","review":"What is this! The anime was awful, but they decided to make a live action movie on the Fist of the Northstar. First of all, I think everybody should watch Trigun, and then I would like to see what you think of one of the worst anime's out there, Fist of the Northstar. The only cool part was with the Viking saying that he didn't believe in magic, and MAGICALLY turned into steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten Live Version of Anime Classic","review":"I loved the anime version of FIST OF THE NORTH STAR. But this dreadful live action knock off is ghastly. The fighting is unconvincing, the acting is truly horrible and just when you think it can't get worse Downtown Julie Brown shows up as a guerrilla fighter. Aaaaaaaargh!

It took the name Fist of the North Star and tainted it so much I think a tear came to my eye. It took everything I held dear about the Anime (the story, the fight scenes, the coolness) and raped it. Bad action sequences and poor martial arts left me wondering where had all the choreographers gone? I think I've seen better fight choreography from my neighbor kids in the back yard with their sticks pretending they were in slow motion! If good action movies were a building, this movie would be the plane that crashed into it! (Thanks Maddox) I put this on par with Mortal Kombat: Total Annihilation! STUPID!

It'll put this live action movie to shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fist of the North Star DVD","review":"When I first seen the animated version of this film I said this movie has got to be the most bloodiest animation movie of all time. Then I saw this movie and said it does not even compare to the anime but the movie it self is actually very good. I mean the movie is a low budget \\"B\\" movie but what makes this movie great is the above average fighting scenes, good acting from the main villian, average special effects, I love the way the movie was filmed. I could have sworned the movie was supposed to be in widescreen but it isnt. This movie also has the best synthesizing orchastrated music I have ever heard.

If you see this movie not expecting alot you will be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THE ANIMATED VERSION!!!","review":"This is almost certainly the \\"live action\\" version that was made a few years ago, which was absolutely horrible.

Scenes such as Daniels' Kenshiro delivering what is probably the most anticipated line for fans \\"You're already dead\\" turn the viewing experience into a head-scratching inner monologue questioning how many takes did Randel do and was that really the best one?An example of this east to west translation gone right will probably be Steve Norrington's adaptation of Ninja Scroll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!!","review":"People complain that it wasn't true to the anime, and maybe they're right. Still, it doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. I'm sure that if you start to nit-pick you'll find a million reasons to hate it. But if you just sit back and enjoy it instead you'll find it to be a real fun and entertaining movie. My only complain is Rufio (yes, that dude that showed up in HOOK as well).

All of the compartments open, all of the intricate parts such as dash dials, lights brake handles, etc are well detailed.I don't think I would let a 5yo play with this though - the body is die cast aluminum, but there are many parts that could easily be broken off (and probably choked on).

For me the book could better have continued in this vein of explaining concepts we've seen before but never really grasped intuitively, and perhaps because I'm not terribly interested in mathematical games I found that segment less fun.

BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT: The parent (video) unit always has to be plugged in with the AC adaptor- you can't use batteries- not convenient for a Mom on the go.For about 105.00 with tax, these problems were unacceptable. We returned it and bought a portable security camera from The Sharper Image- the best purchase yet!My advice- check out The Sharper Image store on ebay and you can find a similar, but better product for about $120- Believe me, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful awful","review":"the only reason why I didn't return this awful monitor is because I like to see my baby.

Tune a radio to your favorite station, now tune to the next strong signal, now tune right in the middle and crank it up. That's what this thing sounds like! Further, eventually, you'll learn to ignore the loud hiss and then miss the sounds of your child.

At night, the picture quality dims, but we are able to tell if her eyes are open. However, turning off the monitor and using only the audio receiver (the video display lights up a bedroom at night) is not possible due to the background noise and popping.

You cannot use the sound part because the scratchy noise from the horrible reception. Save your time and money. Go to Lowe's and get the GE 2.4GHZ system. You can even buy one that hooks up to your TV ($150) so you don't have to have another bulky TV type monitor sitting around. You can add up to 3 cameras to one adapter so if you have more than one child you can watch all of them on your own TV. It costs a little more, but is very worthwhile. The reception is fabulous day or night. It's great to lie in bed and be able to switch to the channel your monitor is on and check your child while watching TV.

We bought the Sony monitor for sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"Received this as a shower gift, glad I didn't pay for it. Picture is very snowy, lots of static, even from the next room. Tried adjusting antennas, changing channels, moving the monitor and camera, nothing helps. Also the monitor does NOT operate on batteries, something I didn't realize when I bought this. Not that it would work outside, anyway, considering it doesn't even work 10 feet from the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it...until it broke ;(","review":"This was by far my favorite and one of the most useful baby \\"gadgets\\" I received. I recommended it to everyone and thought I could never live without it. HOWEVER, just days before I was going to buy a 2nd monitor for my 2nd child, my first one broke (after less than 16 mo.) The monitor just has a line down the middle. I am so disappointed. I don't know what I'm going to get to solve this. Just wanted to warn people that this product will not last long."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still can't live with out it and my child is 21/2!","review":"I leave the camera on 7 - 24.

Reception is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could find the receipt to return this monitor","review":"I don't know if there's outside interference but it will take me 10 minutes, at least, to be able to get a picture on the screen. Then when i get the picture to appear, it disappears to static just a few minutes later. The audio won't even work.I can't believe i blew $100 on this monitor. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love!","review":"We received this monitor as baby gift and it is wonderful. Our baby is now 8 months old and we have used it faithfully. It is wonderful that we can see and monitor her every move and sound. I would highly recommend this monitor. I have lived in two different houses with is monitor and have not had any problems with interference. I can see us using this monitor for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Family Child Care","review":"We bought this monitor a year ago when I started a Family Child Care, it is an excellent way for the children to be able to sleep in a quiet room and I am still able to see them without having to go into the room all the time. Its a great way to keep an eye on 3 children when they are napping. I am currently pregnant and me and my husband want to get another one for our child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential Hazard","review":"I bought this monitor from Babies R Us and immediately had to return it. It did not work straight out of the box. Believing this to be a fluke, I exchanged it for the same model. This one worked well for about 6 months and then the AC adaptor cracked in half (we presume from the heat that the adaptor was generating) ??? We were alarmed by this but bought a new adaptor. After having the monitor for a little over a year, it just \\"gave out\\". No picture, no sound, etc. We contacted the company whose warranty expired at one year. Overall, this is an expensive product to have so many problems. I am sure there are better alternatives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this monitor","review":"We purchased this monitor so that we would be able to watch our baby at night. When we hooked it up, we noticed that the top third of the monitor screen was messed up (fuzzy, distorted lines). So we exchanged it for the same monitor. The new monitor does not have the distorted lines, but it will not work in our bedroom. After hours of trying to adjust it and reposition it, we were still unable to use it in our bedroom, which of course defeats the entire purpose of having it. Unfortantely, we are going to return it and look for a better monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work for very long!","review":"I was SOOO happy with this when I first got it as a gift.. I thought we had got the ONE set that would work with no problems..

Save the money and get a reliable non tv monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, spend more for a better quality monitor.","review":"I purchased this for my 6 month old son.

Save yourself the hassel and spend more for quality, I wish I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much static","review":"Picture is fair but the static is terribile.

Well let me tell you, it is a waste of money. The picture is fuzzy and i cant even hear my baby since all you hear is fuzz. I was scared having the baby sleep in her room and when i bought this item i thought it would help. I have not slept since i purchased this item and now have the baby in the portable crib beside me. save your money on this product because it's not worth it. i am going to try the safety one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the $$$","review":"I have a 19 month old and bought this monitor about 10 months ago. First of all, it's great to have the peace of mind at 2:00am that your baby is ok, just a little fussy, instead of having to get up and go into the room, upset baby and open another can of worms. I love it for that!!Now that my son is older, we put the camera down stairs in the playroom. It's nice to know that if I want to run up stairs for a few minutes, I can see him on the video screen to make sure he is safe. In my opinion, sight is a real peace of mind.I agree that there are times that the screen is fuzzy and it's hard to see what is on the monitor. However, I just mess with the antenna a little or wait a few seconds and it usually clears up. My thought is, it could be a lot worse.Over all, I am very happy with this monitor and will buy it again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound but no picture","review":"I received this monitor for a shower gift. No matter where I put it I can't get a picture. I called the company and they want me to ship it back to them and they will ship me another one. I hope the new one works after reading the reviews it seems like they have some sort of problem with the monitors. It's very dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Monitor","review":"This monitor is horrible, a big waste of money! The reception is awful. It makes loud static and noise all night long. While your baby may be sleeping, you cannot sleep with this monitor around! My mom got a cheap monitor free with other purchases and she has no problem with it at all. Our monitor just broke. My baby is a year old old and now the picture does not work. The screen is completely black and of course there is no warranty so we basically paid over one hundred dollars to use this monitor for a year. Now we're going to go buy a cheap one like my mom has. Trust me, save your money this monitor is no good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor is very bad","review":"I bought this monitor and I couldn't see the entire image on the display. It requires two people on both rooms to adjust the antenna. So, if you take the monitor to another room and you are alone, for example, you have to go back and forward a 100 times until you have a quality image. There's also a background noise. I already returned, but there's a cost for it. Don't waste your money!!! It's true!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"We first had another monitor from a different company, it went dead. We love this monitor so far (knock on wood.) You never know how these things will go. We could not live without one of these monitors though. If it broke, I would buy another one. We use it that much. In fact, we have a tele. monitor in our bedroom, and bought another monitor for the livingroom. We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monitor went out after 20 seconds of use","review":"We registered for this item and received it as a shower gift. After hooking everything up, I turned on the monitor and was able to view my wife's face. The picture was a bit snowy and there was a lot of static with the sound. The worse part though, was when the picture went out all of a sudden after about 20 seconds. I am going to return this item, and will be looking for an alternate brand. I'm considering just sticking with an audio monitor, or perhaps purchasing a \\"nanny cam\\" and hooking it up to my television."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Monitor(TV screen) is not good quality","review":"I bought this monitor because I liked the fact it was a video. I loved it from the moment I brought it home and started using it.But suddenly the screen stopped working. I contacted the company and they said I could send it to them and they would try to fix it. And if it had been under 1 year since the date of purchase I would get a new one for free, if it could not be repaired, otherwise I'd have to pay for a new monitor(just the TV part). Unfortunatly, it had been just over a year, so I just opted to buy a whole new monitor set. Well, that was less than 2 months ago and my NEW monitor screen is just about DEAD!! I am furious!! My sister in law said she had the same problem with hers. So I am returning my monitor this weekend and getting a different brand....hopefully I won't have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"17 Months of use before the Monitor stopped functioning...","review":"There is another review that states they got 15 months before the monitor stopped working. We were able to get 17 months of use before the monitor stopped functioning altogether. No sound, no video, no nada.To be fair, my wife did take the monitor from room to room, so it had it's share of handling. But it was never dropped or jossled too heavily to cause the monitor to just stop working one day. I am disappointed and will look at getting a replacement that is a non-Summer brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love It - Hate It!","review":"We purchased this video system about 10 months ago and have used it daily. While the picture is not super clear, it is sufficient for baby monitoring and works especially well at night.That's the good news. The bad news is that the monitor just burned out with less than 10 months use. By the time you figure repair costs, the only way to fix it is to buy a new unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace of Mind !","review":"I bought this to buy me some peace of mind. My toddler is very active and I am always wondering what all the noises are on the monitor. I would end up going in and disturbing her sleep. Now when I hear something I just look over to the monitor and she what she's up to. I does take a little bit of fiddling to get the best angle, but all in all it's a clear picture and good sound. I read the reviews but have no trouble with this one. She is upstairs and I am downstairs. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no picture, poor audio","review":"We received it as a shower gift. We then followed the instructions to attempt to optimize the performance using all combinations of options available. No matter what we did, it's way way below our expectation - basically, there's close to no picture and the audio is too bad. We couldn't believe a product with such a low (or no) quality could be available in the market. We wondered if it was just a defective item so we tried to have it replaced online but were told that it's not available from the supplier. Not sure if our item (n=1) can represent the product but if it does, stay away from it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Video Poor Audio","review":"Night vision works good. Interference was a problem.

Don't waste your money on this monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Live Without It!","review":"I don't know what we'd do without this. Everytime that my daughter goes down for a nap, I turn on the monitor and close her door. I can see her and hear her, so there's no need to tip-toe into her room hoping that I don't wake her up. We keep the monitor in the family room where we spend most of our time, but it's easy to pick up and plug in anywhere in the house - and even on the back patio. I haven't had any trouble with reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Our daughter is 13 months now and I still love this monitor.

We got a lot of fuzz and couldn't even distinguish our son from the fuzz. It could be that our room is too far away from our son's.

Bummer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYERS BEWARE","review":"All of our expectations went out the window when we plugged in this baby monitor system. The poor quality of the video and the sound in itself, is enough to keep a person awake all night, but to exasperate the situation further we really don't know what is going on with our infant daughter because of continuous visual and audio static and this too keeps up hoping to her room to check on her. It would have been better to go with an old-fashioned audio baby monitor than to have wasted our (budgeted) money on this system. We are very perplexed that others have found this monitor invaluable; we have found it to be worthless. Buyers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"The frequency makes a big difference","review":"I just wanted to toss my two cents in. We bought this monitor with caution, due to some bad reviews. I think I figured out why some love it and some don't. If you have a cordless phone in your home that are on the same frequency as this monitor, you will get major static. We happen to have 2.4 ghz cordless phone and it seems to be just fine for us. We did bring this monitor to my in laws vacation home and found that the cordless phone they had was on the 900 mhz frequency, the same as the monitor and we had lot of static. So maybe this is the problem others are having. I hope this will help those who are cautious to buying this monitor, it really does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby monitor","review":"Safety 1st is more expensive then this monitor but it's well worth the money because this monitor is terrible I have to put the camera on top of my son to be able to see anything, the image is terrible and the light from the camera is way too bright, the only thing good about it is the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money.........","review":"We got baby's Quiet Sounds Video monitor last week as a gift and i was excited abt it specially after reading all the 5 star reviews of this product. When we tried it out the picture was shaky and not so clear. Also, it was impossible to slightly increase the volume (due to high pitched static) even after unplugging all wireless and turning off everything.It is certainly not suitable for an apartment use, maybe it works better in bigger homes. We returned it immediately and got the Sony-27 channel audio monitor instead....and i have to say tht me and my husband are amazed by how crystal clear it is (with everything else in the house plugged in)....Sony has really given quality to their monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check in on baby.","review":"I bought this for my daughter.

Since then I would not let her out of my sight because of the gagging, afraid she would choke. I had her with me in my bed until everyone started giving me hard time. So after long agonizing over it I decided to bite the bullet and put her in her bed, at first just for some afternoon naps. Now she is in her bed at night thanks to this monitor. I do not know what I ever did without it. It has a clear picture and I carry her from room to room with me on the TV. Now we are both in our own beds and I have the same peace of mind as if she was in the bed with me. A must have for all moms who also don't want to leave their baby alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good option","review":"I can't understand how people rate this as a good problem. Also, I cannot understand how they can name it QUIET. It's not quite at all. We have had lots of interference problems with it.

There has been several time, when our baby is crying, before we actually see him moving. This really upsets me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sensitive","review":"We received this Monitor as a shower gift, having included it in the registry because of the high reviews. Well the first one wouldn't work at all, the monitor was broken. The second one worked but the picture popped and jumped way too much and this was after 10 minutes of moving and adjusting the monitor and antenna. The sound included a great deal of static, and the pops and screachs matched the jumping picture. We knew we couldn't take a day of this let alone 15 minutes so we brought it back for a simple no picture type.

I'd registered for it based on the same glowing reviews you've read here. Stupidly, I waited several months, (until we were ready to move our baby out of our room into the nursery) to hook everything up. The reception is unbeliveably poor. We live in a 1 story, 4 bedroom house with 3 cordless phones. Thinking the phones might be causing our bad reception, I disconnected them all. We found this made absolutely no difference. No matter what channel, or which camera, or room I tried, nothing seemed to work. At last, I hooked the monitor up in the hallway directly outside the baby's room, and managed to get a constantly rolling, grainy view of the crib. The static was horrible. We will be donating this and buying something more worthwhile - like a $19.99 set of Fisher Price audio monitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"new mom","review":"we bought this monitor when our daughter transfered from our bedroom to her crib.

The company called me about a week after I shipped the camera & monitor to them and told me the fuse had blown in the monitor and it had been corrected.

Compared to our previous (broken) monitor, the picture itself is perfectly clear during the night & day. However the static is constant no matter what room we move the monitor to. As long as the volume is on the lowest setting, it reduces the static tremendously. Then we can just barely hear baby, sometimes not at all.

I brought it home and opened the box and much to my displeasure the same piece was broken off and not only was it broken off the piece wasn't even in the box!!! I now have to go back to the store (yet again) to see if I can find one that isn't broken.

Our camera is located approx. 3 feet above the crib and I can see his entire body as well as am able to listen to his breathing, although there is more background noise than my Fisher Price sound monitor.It would be nice if the picture had a little more detail, but for the cost it is hard to argue this point.It may help that my cordless phones are on 2.4ghz instead of 900mhz, this maybe one of the reasons others have had poor reception.I recommend the product as this has allowed my wife and I a greater level of comfort since we moved our baby into his room.

It seems it worked for some wonderfully and not so great for others or not at all. The sound worked great but I could never get a picture at all. I took it back to the store and they said certain brands dont work in certain homes. I thought about exchanging it for another just like it but figured it wouldnt work. I saw the safety first one and it was slightly higher in price but i knew my other regular monitor was safety first and it worked so I bought it and got it home and it worked fine. If you want this monitor I suggest trying it out for yourself in your home instead of just reading these reviews because it does depend on how your house is set up just dont get your hopes up and be prepared to run back to the store to exchange just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static!","review":"We bought this monitor as well and I can honestly say it's not worth it! Too much static interference-you can hardly go 5 mins without static! Very frustrating .. would not recommend it at all. The only nice feature is that you can see your child, but I keep the volume off of this monitor and use another audio monitor with it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea/Product, HORRIBLE QUALITY","review":"This product is great, no doubt about that. My monitor is a 1 1/2 years old and the monitor shows no picture now, completely black, and the company wants to charge $50 to fix it since it's no longer warranty. Call me crazy, but for the money I think it should last longer than a year and half! ...And I had to send one of the video cameras back to get fix, right before the warranty expired. For the money, I'm buying another system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for while it lasts.","review":"I loved this monitor when I first received it. I think it lasted 6 months for me. I could watch my little one while he slept, especially when I had to let him cry himself to sleep. I knew if he was falling asleep. But I could never get a great reception the antennae would never stay in place it kept falling over. And then the adaptor plug would get really hot and I dropped the plug once on carpet and it just shattered I had to duck tape it back together and then all of a sudden my picture wouldn't come on any longer. So now I am back to my old listening monitor. I am going to write to the company and see if I can get it fixed. Its so sad that this great monitor was made so poorly. I don't even think I would waste the money on this. Wait and hope the company improves it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"This product worked beautifully for the first seven months. Then the picture went out. I tried contacting (...) for weeks and finally got through by the third week. They charged me another (...) and sent out a replacement monitor. When the monitor arrived, three weeks later, I immediately connected it only to find that the reception was horrible. I now had a monitor that worked without sound. Upon inspection of the replacment, I found that it seemed to have been previously repaired. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The poor reviews for this product are dead on. We rec'd this monitor as a gift and we are extremely dissapointed. As I write this, I have the monitor on the baby--in the very next room--and although the pictures is fairly clear, the static is so loud that you can't hear the baby. The visual works from about20 - 30' away tops. Anything more than that and forget it. Don't even think about trying to watch baby from the family room while he/she is sleeping in his/her crib--unless of course the family room is right next to the room. Bottom line, this monitor is poor quality and basically totally worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to have it","review":"we registered for this monitor and got it as a shower gift. at 6 months, we still love it, and are looking forward to using it as she grows. We use it in conjunction with a two-way audio monitor, so i don't use the sound on it at all. The picture made it easier for us to let her teach herself to fall asleep, without worrying that she was in danger or had pulled a blanket over her head. Its not the best picture in the world, but we have 3 cordless phones in our 2 story house and everything works fine. I'm VERY glad to have this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATCH OUT! The green monitor is an old model that doesn't work!!","review":"I own a blue Summer Infant monitor and it is great! The picture is clear and interference is very rare. The built in sound monitor picks up everything, including my baby's breathing. Much better than smaller more portable screens since I can leave it on a shelf and see it from anywhere in the room. When I wanted a second monitor I ordered the green one because of the price. Once I received it I realized that it is an older model and it was terrible. I couldn't get a picture even just a few rooms away in my house. When I did get a picture it was impossible to see what was going on. It also wouldn't work with my blue system. I could have received a faulty one, but I suggest paying the extra to get the newer, blue model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you see me now?","review":"Not a great investment, I spent a lot of time squinting, trying to make out where my baby was.

Was WELL taken care of and only used at night. Monitor started rolling...then sparks from the back... then died! Won't purchase this one again for our second baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed...","review":"The first monitor, right out of the box, didn't work. I took the monitor back and exchanged it for a new one. For the first few months it worked, OK (I'd say about two months). We always had interference from our cordless phone, but that wasn't a big deal. From then on the monitor has been terrible. There is constant interference, from what I have no idea. It is so noisy with static. And when you turn the monitor on for the first time for the night, for about five minutes there is just a black screen with a white line going down the middle. After it finally tunes in the picture, the static continues. If you are going to spend the money, you might as well spend a little more and get a better quality video monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"need to be recalled !!!","review":"I received this as a gift and I am going to return it next week.I would like to alert Toys r Us and consumers about this product...ok it is a working video and sound monitor, but the supplied power adapter of the monitor is made of cheap plastic housing that cracks from the metal prongs when it gets hot. BEWARE that you may not be electrocuted while unplugging it. please check your equipment ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you can monitor the baby in the same room","review":"Interferes with lots of other things (mobile phones?) and the image is unusable half of the time. Add to this the fact that it's dead if used at more than 10 meters (and 1-2 walls between) and even if there is no sound at all, the thing has some permanent background noise and hisses and pops that makes it unusable as audio monitor too. (it should have had some sensibility adjustment or \\"transmit only when something happens\\" feature?)The only good thing is the sound strength indicator but it's a bit expansive if that's all you can use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace of Mind","review":"I was using a co-sleeper while I was breastfeeding. Switching my 4 month old to his crib was an adjustment for all of us. His room is at the other end of our house and it worried me not to be able to see him like I used to be able to. I was told by some friends that this monitor would be the best thing I bought - and they were right! We all sleep better at night. I can still look right over and see what he is doing. The only thing I had a problem with were the channels. I couldn't get a clear picture with the sound and picture on the same channel. So we had to put them on different ones and I still need to use my other monitor for the sound. I don't mind at all though. I just like being able to see him and what is going on in his room. That is what gives me the peace of mind to sleep better ant night. I would suggest this to all new moms. I will being using this for a while and I'm so glad that I purchased it! Well worth the $100!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great...until it breaks, and it will.","review":"I used this monitor for about 14 months, and it worked very well. But sure enough, once outside the one year warranty, the picture shrunk on the monitor and it no longer works. I found out the the exact same thing happened to a friend's unit that was approximately the same age. The company will repair it for $50, which is certainly not worth it considering I already paid $100 for a 14-month lifespan.I would recommend not cheaping out and buying something of better quality (which is what I am doing to replace this). I've had a 5\\" Zenith B&W; TV for 22 years that still works, so I can't see why the picture should go out after 14 months on this thing. No excuse but poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a mind saver!!!!","review":"What a great Monitor I have a 16 month old and have been using this monitor the entire time. The sound and picture are sometimes fuzzy but not real bad. Keep your nextel phone on the other side of the bed it screws up the monitor and makes a loud ticking in the monitor. I can sleep knowing that all I have to do is hit a button to see him with out waking him up just because I am nervous. Now I have a four month old daughter and I need another camera because I don't want to take the other one out of my sons room, I want to be able to see both of them. As an emergency medical technician I would suggest that all parents own one of these monitors, it makes you feel relief hearing your child breath from the other room."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"The concept is great - however after 6 months, the video image no longer works... what is the point - any baby monitor will do what this does now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!!!","review":"This item is junk!!!!!!!!!!!!

Spend a little more money and get a better quality monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reviews are Dead On","review":"We have been through two monitors so far and both have become so hot we have had to unplug them as they were a fire hazard. To make matters worse, when the monitors were on the audio and visual was so poor they were useless. We have made several attempts to contact the manufacturer, however all the recordings say they are having trouble with their phone lines. I imagine it is because the call volume is so high with complaints on this item. Do yourself a favor and look at another monitor as well as a manufacturer that cares about how their customers are treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality but poor performance","review":"The quality of the unit is done well, but the performance was much worse than I anticipated. The monitor operates on the 900 MHZ band, which is used by many devices. The camera was on the second story of our house, and the video monitor was in our bedroom on the first floor about 45 feet away. We also have wireless LAN and wireless phones (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Regardless of how much I adjusted antennas and channel settings, the picture and sound quality was very poor. The sound always had a large amount of interference even at very low volume levels. I would not recommend using this product unless the camera and monitor were very close together and other wireless interference was limited. There are higher frequency monitors, so I may try one of those next.The infrared picture worked well - you could see fairly well even though the room had almost no light."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so disappointed","review":"I was really excited about this monitor. My Safety First monitor broke because we are the clumsiest parents on the face of this earth and have dropped it a bunch of times. After 18 months the thing finally broke. We received this monitor at a baby shower for our second baby. When I turned it on, I was so disappointed to see that it did not compare to the safety first monitor at all. The picture is grainy and so is the sound. There was no way I would be able to sleep with the noise. The next day I returned it to the store and bought another Safety First monitor. Hopefully we will be more careful with it this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broadway Lights","review":"Although I could see and hear my child, the camera shines a fairly bright light in the crib.

From day one it has never worked correctly. Rather than giving us piece of mind at night, we are constantly playing with the antenna trying to get a picture on the screen. the camera is only down the hall maybe 25 feet from the monitor and still works poorly. Add that to the uncontrollable background static and you have all the ingredients to a sleepless night...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased With This Monitor","review":"My husband and I are very pleased with this monitor.

When we first started using the product, I wrote to their customer service complaining about the static that was keeping us up at night. They told us to keep the monitor away from electrical appliances, etc. We tried this, it didn't work. After ten months of use, the monitor broke. The picture turned to snow and then the monitor died. It was never dropped or mishandled in any way.

I know that she is moving, but can't tell if her face is facing down or up. Most of the time I can't hear because of the fuzziness. I had to hook my regular baby monitor in so that I could sleep.

My 14 month old got a hold of the camera and broke it so I sent my husband out to buy another one. He accidentaly came back with this monitor, but I figured I'd use it because it did have the video feature. I've had it for exactly 5 days now and I don't like it at all. I must say that the sound is wonderful, but the video is very poor in comparison to the Safety 1st monitor - and that's when it works. For the past 2 days, during my son's nap, the monitor will not work. All I get is static.

A major McCartney fan, I was sorely disappointed in it. The writer tries to be hip by using British idioms and inside jokes that few Americans will even understand. He skips over, with merely a sentence, major portion's of Sir Paul's life or explanations of what happened. He teases you with just a small portion of a story, with inadequate detail. It seems to contain few, if any interviews or original documentation; it's all excerpts of previously written stuff. If I hadn't read other bios, I wouldn't have a clue what he was talking about half the time. Almost any book out there will give you a much better picture of this musical genius than Sandford's, which seems to be no more than an extended article in a cheap magazine. He's more interested in style, than in providing the proper biography that Paul deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable drivel","review":"Of the dozens of books I have read about the Beatles, both individually and as a group, this is one of the most glaring examples of unreadable drivel I have seen. Another reviewer lauds this book for not containing any factual errors, when, in fact, it contains many, all easily verifiable through other reliable sources. Sandford's writing style is obnoxiously self-absorbed and annoying, and his reviews and opinions of the Beatles' music are totally unnecessary and expendable. There is little here that hasn't been hashed over dozens of times in other, better books.

The review section in the beginning of the book was ok, though it went into insane amounts of detail. I took the \\"practice test\\" in the back, which was so different from the actual test I wanted to scream. The actual test is far more clearly written, thought out, and fair.This book also gives a section to explain why you got that one question wrong about how bacteria reproduce. Sounds great, right? Wrong. Sometimes the explanations say things like \\"Answers B, C, and E can be eliminated because they are wrong. Answer D is the correct choice. Answer A is also a good choice.\\" How helpful!Save your money and read another review book or your freshmen bio text."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find a much better review book!","review":"Although the book does contain sections on most of the important topics to review for the Bio GRE, the writing style is often confusing, and the author places emphasis on obscure aspects of some topics. There are also some typos (for example, omitting one half of an equation) and questionable or misleading statements. The practice test at the end has many poorly written questions and is not really very similar to the real practice exams available from ETS. Try another book if you need a bio GRE review guide!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chef's Best Kept Secret","review":"Kitchenaid introduced their cutlery line at the same time I was divorcing. I left behind a legendary set of knives, costing nearly a $1000 dollars. I bought these, because I had good luck, in the past, with the handtools, and didn't have a lot of money to spend. I have been amazed with these knives and would never consider anything else.

It's a bit harder to steer, but the more challenge the better! It has a very nice feel to it. There is a light on the top to show you that it is plugged in. Very good concept. I reccomend this controller for MOST racing games.( i have heard on others it is too sensitive)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its okay for the price","review":"There are clearly better wheels available if you want to spend the money, but for the price, this one is okay.It is a little difficult to get used to, but once you do it drives okay. It has better sensitivty then a normal analog thumb-stick, but not as much as a higher-end wheel.As soon as you hold it you can tell it doesn't have the construction quality of other controllers. One faulty bit of design, the springs that re-center the wheel depend on small plastic knobs (with a screw through the middle) inside the controller. If you turn the wheel too hard you can break the plastic knobs and lose the spring back to center."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahhhhh! off course by a concerned 11 year old gamer","review":"This controller is BAD! I don't mean cool bad, I mean bad-bad!I try playing rallisport challenge with this controller and lose every race! On rallisport there are lots of long straights and I veere off-course on a straight!

While complex and eclectic, Lefebvre's book provides ample food for thought for those interested in the means by which we as human beings understand space in the world and how we negotiate and transpose it in our minds.Overall, it's damned good stuff. I read this book and the idea for my Masters thesis came exploding out of me like one of those creatures from \\"Alien.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"an open book","review":"This is a fragmented and speculative work, from which readers (e.g. Soja, Harvey, Elden and Shields) have been able to draw rather contradictory and diverse conclusions. In part, that's because there's a lot in here, but it's not terribly consistently or coherently presented. I've read most of it twice and parts several times more -- there are lots of intriguing sketches of ideas, and the reader can fill them in in lots of different ways, but I'm not convinced it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Avid Hiker","review":"I finally broke down and purchased this item. I \\"live\\" at the parks with my daughter and there are many that just aren't stroller friendly. We used to do a lot of hiking and camping, which is why I decided on this product as opposed to similiar items such as the Evenflo model. So far we have only used it on moderate hikes. It is pretty comfortable and has lots of storage space. I have seen similiar products and this one seems to have the most comfortable child seat. The child hangs in it with nice thick padding around their thighs and felt covered straps.We will be taking it to Yosemite in the future and I am curious to see how it will do on an all day trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Whole Nine Yards","review":"I gave it 2 stars.

A clone of Jean Harlow asks a private detective for help. At first reluctant (it's just a clone after all, not a human) the detective chooses to do what is morally right, help the clone. What follows are a series of unique and startling adventures that never fail to entertain, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strongest of FPW's \\"future\\" works","review":"Of all the futuristic, \\"harder\\" sci-fi books that Wilson has written, Dydeetown Town is by far the most successful, largely because it finally emphasizes character and plot, which are Wilson's stronger points, over his interesting but somewhat shallow worlds. Mixing private eye stories with genetic engineering and Orwellian government, Dydeetown World creates an intriguing subculture out of its cast of outcasts, black marketeers, runaway clones, and violent underworld figures. And in its three short tales, Wilson ends up crafting a complicated tale that would hold its own in the mystery genre, one with some legitimately surprising payoffs and some nice twists along the way. It's no Repairman Jack, but of Wilson's future-based books, it's easily his strongest piece, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthful reading book for medical students","review":"it is easy to realizing basic clinical medicine but important with a model of questions and answers.

The most memorable track is the first single, When Smokey Sings. I recently (re)discovered this band ABC, and love them to the fullest extent. Their cool rhythms and funky overlays create a totally unique experience for the listener. Funny, brash and cool as a blade; their lyrics inspire and recreate an era gone by, pairing the gay sensibility of the early 90's to perhaps the savoir fair of early film. This album, however, has only one stand out track, and most of the album fades into the background, catching them at an era wrought dry of the inspiration found on their preceding opus, \\"How to be a...Zillionaire\\". Fans who love Martin Fry's crooning voice need to get all their albums, casual officionados of the 80's looking for a party album to add their stack need stick by 'Zillionaire'."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC's best CD","review":"Been looking for a copy of this CD for years after the tape player in the car ate my original. Absolutely worth the time it took to track down a copy just to hear some of the other songs on it. Love ABC and this is their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits Highs","review":"It's amazing that \\"When Smokey Sings\\" works at all. Basically they're singing \\"We know we're not as good as Smokey Robinson!\\" But it works. Maybe it's because this band has been so stuck on themselves that any change was welcome. The rest of the album is good too - they are obviosuly paying more attention to songwriting here (\\"King Without a Crown\\" excepted). Their last hurrah, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Many recipes left me drooling. It was a wonderful easy quick read.

I do this because there is always something better and there is always something worse. I have found the something worse. This book reads like a fifth grader's report. There is no plot, or even a coherent timeline. She gives you tips and tricks, going so far as to name chapters \\"How I Fooled My Parents,\\" \\"How I Kept The Weight Off.\\" She promotes self recovery; a process I doubt works, as it clearly did not work for her. In her recovered stage, she is nervous about eating and gaining weight. She must eat with people to prevent overeating. She is self righteous about herself in the book, and is obviously not honest to the reader. I have read books twice as long in half the time because I could not stomach more than one or two chapters at once. \\"Anti-Ana\\" or \\"Pro-Ana\\" I would not recommend this to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"Why didn't I listen to these other reviews? I am not trying to be rude but this was just sad. If I had to choose one word to describe this book it would be \\"redundant\\" She wrote the same sentences in every chapter it seemed.

She's a very honest, intelligent, and talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"This book is a travesty.

This women is still very sick and it shows in her writing. The whole book could have been summed up in two or three chapters. As a recovering anorexic myself I would be very scared to let someone trying to recover from anorexia anywhere near this book. I do feel bad for this women, it doesn't seem like she really ever got help for her disease.

The keys are large enough to handle women's fingernails and 45+ year old eyeballs...both important in my world.The paper roll print option is nice to have; only gets turned on during year end inventory, but is good as an additional function.I strongly endorse this and the other Casio calculators.

I don't know if ours is defective or if they're all like this but they're very poorly balanced. Even while sitting on her bottom and scooting, unless she's sitting in absolute center, the scooter will flip up on the other side, dumping her onto the ground... over and over.

This is a really bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Recipe for a Good Series","review":"The Net Force series was a good concept when it began, but has steadily gone down hill. This most recent effort appeared to continue the trend toward cranking these out by a predetermined recipe, rather than using this the opportunity of changing main characters to break new ground. Even the high tech angle was getting decidedly RW. And the story abruptly ended like someone reached a predetemined page length and said, well we have to end this thing. Can't we spice up the recipe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and most of his Net Force books and this is the worst one by far. Fortunately I was able to read it quickly since I could skim over most of the book since it was material unrelated to the plot. The books spends a ridiculous amount of time on fencing, guitars and a VR world that to me is completely ridiculous and unbelievable.

I have never seen a man or woman give up their identity, needs, and desires in personal situations. Though highly trained, and do obey a commander, they do not stop thinking.

Authors need to take a few seminars","review":"The storyline in this book is excellent. The ability of the authors to tell a story, unfortunately, is not. The problem is the authors seem to lack storytelling skills. As a technology professional I admire their writing, which would sparkle if the book were a technical dissertation. However, when I read a novel (a rare thing), I want it to read like a novel and not like a technical document. If the authors take a few seminars on creative writing, learn how to use words to elicit emotions (except for disdain) and to engage the reader, then rewrite this book it would easily rate 5 stars.

Then, they release the trade collection (only one month after the comic arc is completed!), but without any of the extras (the back-up stories are directly related to the main plot, so you WILL be missing information by reading the trades)!They basically release the trade as fast as possible, but with the smallest size, the minimum content they could, just to \\"get\\" the trade fans (with the small price - due to the cut corners). At ther same time, they release the monthly comic with the alternate covers and extras to force the readers to collect the singles too (you can't get the complete thing with only the trades). That's really sad.Worst of all, the story suffers from multiple artists in every issue. In one page Chun-li looks like a cute girl, in the next she'll look like a man, then an old woman! Their artists can't even do 20 straight pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the comics instead","review":"I'm completely upset by this trade.

We live in a society of repressed emotions that come out in violent outbursts. This books tells parents how emotions develop in a baby and toddler and what we as parents can do to help our baby develop all of their emotions. It also teaches us how we can help our baby handle and express all emotions so that they don't become bottled up and come out in violent outbursts. Most of the advice in this book goes against conventional parenting advice, but in my view we've been following conventional advice for 50 years and look where it has gotten us. It is time for a new, more sensitive way of parenting that teaches our children that emotions are ok and can be expressed in appropriate ways. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, hard time getting through it","review":"I think I am too analytical to appreciate this book.

The character development left me not caring for the people involved, and the plot bounced all over the place, often without good reason. Elliot relies on greasy hair to vilify one character, and good looks to let us know if a character is a \\"good guy\\". Touch, (the main character) is a man conflicted by the death of his bi-polar wife two years ago. This a great base for personal growth and insight of the lead character. Instead, Elliot turns Touch into a macho, drinking tough guy, who somehow is justified in things like fighting on an LA freeway and lying to protect people he likes.

If that's the case I'd rather use a software solution, like cryptosidekick, to make a secure vault out of any flash, which would be also significantly faster. This particular drive is extra slow, who knows why, it doesn't seem to do strong encryption, in fact, there is no information if it's secure at all.

It wants to save all passwords you type in in a 'vault' so it can later auto-enter them for you. Unfortunately, password saving doesn't play nice with several pieces of software I run; Microsoft Money and Password Safe for example. With these two particular pieces of software, it 'hijacks' the screen and won't let me type in the password. Emails to Transcend asking how to disable the password saving went unanswered.

This Roan edition has a pretty decent picture quality, but about half-way through the film there is a dramatic drop in the audio for the rest of it. There is also one bad splice. The Image/All Day Ent. disc in the Ulmer Archive set is even worse. The print itself is better, but darker, missing the splice in the Roan edition. But early in the film everything goes out-of-sync for a few minutes and then back into sync(obviously poor quality control). I get exhausted wading through the garbage people that don't know what they are doing keep putting out. This is a super film. It would be so easy to just make one good print out of two.

I figured I'd try it, since I now had 96 bags. I've enjoyed all of the other Yogi teas I've tried, and this was no exception. There are enough other flavors present in this tea to make the rooibos flavor more of an accent than an overpowering main flavor. I liked this tea hot; I love this tea iced. Its flavor is really refreshing iced.I usually steep four tea bags in four cups of hot water and refrigerate over night. Alternately, you can brew the tea double strong (i.e., four tea bags and two cups hot water) and either add enough cold water to make it regular strength or serve over ice which will dilute the tea to single strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like any Thai Tea I Ever Drank","review":"I second the reviewer who said that this tea is unearthly bad.

The person who came up with the name \\"Sweet Thai Delight\\" and the packaging person both deserve raises--they are really good at what they do.

This first Mr. Big popped up and then quickly disappered with no explanation and then the second Mr. Big (Richard Nixon) popped up later. Michael Jai White's comic timing is way off.

The fight scenes are the most exciting aspect of this sham, and even those get old after the 2nd or 3rd one (the final fight sequence with a fictitious Nixon got a few chuckles out of me).

So it's acceptable for a black person to use racial slurs against white people as long as its in a comedy huh? And to shoot honkeys in the [blank]? There was no moment in this movie where I completely lost my serious face.I didn't laugh once in the theater, maybe just once but that was at a fat lady who had fallen out of her chair in the theater.Pretty awful movie and it's a shame you can watch this film in Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent comedy BD","review":"If you can get over the fact that the movie is SUPPOSED to look and sound a certain way; this is a great BD to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the time","review":"Everything was a work of art. One of the best recaptures of old so called black exploitation films. There are some pretty funny parts. My only shortcoming is that I thought the trailer was far better than the movie. But overall its definitely a great value. I recommend to show this to a group of friends after a night of drinking. Get a bunch of hot wings as a complement to the movie. A blunt is recommended but not entirely necessary if you already have your drink on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie of the year.","review":"If you've ever even heard of the blaxploitation film genre, you have got to see this movie. This timeless parody will have you rolling with laughter. Every scene is a riot, and the camera \\"mistakes\\" and the bad lines are all very intentional and hilarious. If you only ever see this movie once, you will never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite","review":"A good time was had by all, great for unwinding and reminiscing with friends about the good old 70's - fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"Any fan of the black-splotation films of the 70stwo will absolutely love this movie and its homage to those films of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cool, baby","review":"A blaxploitation movie in the best spirit of the genre. Crazy plot, ham acting, superfluous martial arts and gunplay - this movie has it all. Open a cool one and sit back to watch the Dynamite in action!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comedy!","review":"I had heard of this movie over the past year from a few people and word of buzz from Cons and such. I finally picked it up and was not disappointed! This movie captures this era of films so well and knows exactly how to poke fun at itself while still being a good movie.I recommend this for any fan of the grind house vibe of films, back when film making was dirty and cheap!There is a lot of homages to older films and great comedy sequences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE Black Dynamite","review":"We love this movie!!!!! It never fails to provide tons of belly laughs and howling. Black Dynamite is a classic at our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"As good a parody as the Naked Gun series. Watch it ten times and you'll fall outta your chair ten times. They make fun of everything Blaxploitation, from the sloppy production (boom mikes hanging over the camera) to the over-done, wooden acting (\\"his little Chinese eyes lookin at me\\") to Jim Kelly's \\"Soo-yee!\\" fighting yell. This is Undercover Brother on steroids.

No, a resounding NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couple of really funny moments, BUT...","review":"I expected a little more from this movie. They did a pretty good job recreating the look and feel of a 1970s movie, but it just never quite makes the grade as a finished product. I won't give any of it away, but there are some good scenes, while others are just too staged, drawn out, or over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got what I wanted","review":"The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, personally, I'm a little picky when it comes to stores putting stickers( genre sticker 'comedy' placed on the back case and price tag in front) on my movie cases. But other than that small issue, the disc and case is in good condition. The seller even left a little nice card with a short description on their family owned business and invited you to take any issues with their order up with them. All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This movie is funny, I have seen it a bunch of times, the quotes get better and better ever time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love humorous horror.

I thought the story was horrible and I didn't find it funny. I do have a demented sense of humor but apparently not that demented. I thought it was gross and just very disappointing. I expected so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Eye Candy...but NOT A WORKOUT","review":"I give this one star strictly for the eyecandy and nothing else. Don't waste your money if you're looking for a workout video. What cuiing there is, is lousy. The only thing that may come close is the stretching in the beginning.

Do you see that cute white top and pink shorts she wears on the cover? She doesn't even wear that during her \\"excercise session\\". She's clothed in an unsexy black outfit from the neck down. If you want to get some excercise, go out and do some jogging. If you want to see some stripping, buy a different DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carmen Electra Aerobic Striptease","review":"This DVD begins with a few easy exercises and stretches. Would not recommend it if your looking for a good work out. The second part goes into a very long and boring strip tease act showing you step by step how to do it. I was expecting something a bit more fun where as the act in the DVD is very boring, mostly done by laying on the bed. I hoped in purchasing this DVD to learn more exciting moves and get a better work out. Was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease- In the Bedroom","review":"Product just as described... a fun & clever way to burn calories & to heighten the romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok?!?","review":"This is an ok dvd but not the best. I don't feel that it really gives you much of a work out. Plus I felt a bit silly actually doing it...I had to make sure nobody was going to be home for awhile! I feel like a speed walk around the block would have been more of a workout..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I own the entire Carmen Electra series and was excited to hear a new DVD was coming out. I pre-ordered it even. I think this is the worst out of the series, followed by her other new release, Vegas strip. It starts out with a warm up, that doesn't have her speaking during it. They put her voice in, and it makes the workout feel very impersonal. After the warm up they change it and she speaks while demonstrating the moves. I don't feel like the viewer learns anything new with these two releases, and is left challenge-less."},{"rating":"1","title":"No warm-up, no full run-through...disappointing!","review":"I own the original set, and really love them. These new ones are just not up to par. This one is especially disappointing. The moves feel like they're right out of the mid-90s, and the only full run-through of the combination with music is filmed more like a music video...complete with SLOW-MO scenes, meaning there is NO WAY to follow along with it! A total waste. And not at all a workout! NOT EVEN A WARM-UP! I love Carmen, but I doubt I'll ever use this DVD again, unless i'm trying to prove to a friend that it really is THAT bad...Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip\\" I really love it, and it gives you an AWESOME workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arent we supposed to be watching your hips, not your face?","review":"I own 2 of Carmen Elecra's aerobic workout videos, including Vegas Strip. In the Bedroom is a flop. There is no workout, and most of the time the camera man is zooming in on her face. Um, excuse me, but isnt the more important action happening below the waistline?I love the Vegas Strip workout, you can actually feel where its working, and see how she is doing the moves. But dont waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!!","review":"Gives you a great work out while having alot of fun!! My best friend and I ordered it and now we have work-out nites with friends. Its a great way to stay in shape and have a good time.

Anyway i think everyone should order a copy and see for themselves! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Fun and Useful!","review":"I really liked this product because I can work out in my bed!

So it is a wonderful workout for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical","review":"The skills taught in this book can be used from the day I read it.Although there is enough number of books analyzing abuse, this book is different because it is so helpful in coping with life for adult children like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't find this book useful at all","review":"This book is for novices who has very little knowledge on IPv4 and now trying to know something about IPv6. My sincere advice to any serious reader on IPv6 would be, never go for this book. It gives no information but stories about how internet evolved and kind of stuff. And anybody who is working deeply on IPv4 would know that. And this book gives fifty to sixty pages of printed RFCs, may be to make the book bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"reat music ..horrible graphics","review":"A great set by the Dead ruined by awful graphics that totally obscure the band, especially cut 18, intro to the Other One, and 19, The Other One. Some of the most complicated music on the DVD and the players are completely obliteratd by lousy graphics. Its almost as if someone assumed we wanted to see crappy graphics rather than top-notch playing. The music on the DVD is great, the graphics that obsucre the musicians suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad show","review":"In reference to the editors note, there is no Dark Star on this DVD! The Dead merely trickle into The Other One coming out of Drumz. The show on the whole is well played but I agree with the other reviewer about the exclusion of a great 3rd set with the Neville Brothers! One more note, the opening Bertha is good but the editors, for some reason, lopped off the the Bobby opener of Promised! Who knows? Anyway, like any dead video, digital or otherwise, this is a must have for your libray, enjoy and keep the faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start","review":"I am not a Grateful Dead fan, but I wanted to find out more about the band. This is my first Dead concert. For me the concert got off to a slow start. As it picked up I began to become enchanted with the performance. I have the VHS copy. The quality of audio and video on the VHS is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime (Despite the Eye-Bleeding Graphics)","review":"The music's incredible. Jerry's on, the band is, too. The middle segment is interesting and frequently very funny. Jerry's cooking show segment is hysterical.The graphics are painfully bright and very \\"early computer age.\\" Might be wonderful if you'd ingested something measured in micrograms or if you were feeling particularly like a \\"fun guy,\\" but sober it's just... Uh... Kind of over-the-top.This is a wonderful performance, and it's wonderful to see the band obviously feeling so good. And seeing Bill Graham is an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super, except for effects.","review":"This is my first Dead DVD & by the time the 1st song \\"Bertha\\" was over I realized I was in for a real treat. The audio was excellent & video was cystal clear, featuring numerous angles both close & wide. All was well as I settled in for the rest of the show. Shortly thereafter however, the \\"special effects\\" video overlays began. Not only did I not want to see this stuff, (didn't buy it for an \\"art\\" show), but the quality of the effects rated a negative 5 stars: cheaply done by a child or someone's pet?, same effects repeated time & time again in different songs, annoying to say the least. I still recommend this DVD & am glad I got it but will be closing my eyes during the effects in future viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"I have watched this video to many times to count. I just love it to death. It is the greatest high in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"See \\"Down Hill From Here\\"","review":"I was at this show, What a blast. New Years Eve was always the clunkiest show of the run, from a musical stand point, but NYE was always about more than just the show. They started this show a little sluggish. By the time the video reaches the parts where they are warmed up in full stride, you can't see anything because some one decided to put tracer effects and fotage of WWII in the way, (I kid you not) the post production video effects are about as nice as the strings they used to attatch to pop songs of the mid 60s. Either show us the footage or don't. The 1989 Alpine vid on the other hand is the real deal. It will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat yourself to this album, you won't regret it.","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Every track is a real treat, especially Brashear's originals. He's backed by some all star bluegrass musician's who are all tasteful, Peter McLaughlin, Jody Stecher, Laurie Lewis, Ed Neff and Bob Black. Together they produce a solid band sound that is original, creative and very enjoyable. I have no criticism's of this album and highly recommend it.

Our family hardly watches the trashy programs on network TV, so we are still accumulating \\"classics\\" to watch when we have downtime. Tony Randall is the perfect actor for this part! The casting was great overall. I highly recommend this for anyone who do Not need skin, explosions, blood and profanity to be entertained. Oh, and Debbie Reynolds worked pretty well with that hog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Family Entertainment","review":"When this movie first came out, I was a teenager in the 1960's. I remembered how much fun it was to watch the movie, The Mating Game, on the big screen.This is an hilariously-funny movie and quite entertaining for the entire family to watch. From the beginning to the end, it kept us all smiling and laughing. While growing up, these actors were, always, admired favorites of mine...because of their great reputations as talented actors, as well as having respectable character traits. The characters and the story was \\"believable\\". I left the movie wishing that I could live on a farm. A sound and respectable moral code was evident...The \\"good guys\\" won!I am so happy that I can watch this film whenever I need a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, classically corny comedy","review":"Great movie! Tony Randall is adorable in one of his few leading characters, and Debbie Reynolds is a little too sappy, but it's a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"silly but nostalgic","review":"I always enjoy this movie.

This is a bit more varied than Thunder, but these guys are all about quality music. Two of the most consistent musicians in the last 15 years! The U.S. needs to wake up and perhaps have a musical equivalent of the Boston Tea Party. Europe & Japan know better and have around 10 or so releases from these UNDERRATED / UNDER THE RADAR / MUSICAL KINGPINS! Well worth seeking out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book was Great, But . . .","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie's style and substance, and \\"Crazy for You\\" has plenty of cute twists and turns. Everything from the bank tart to the show-stopper with Quinn's mother shows a flair for terrific plotting.Her talent for circular storytelling is terrific, and the malicious acts that are inflicted on Quinn are perfectly righted, and done so by the spunky heroine.However. I had a couple of problems. The hero, Nick, acts like a jerk. And because the dog was the catalyst for so much of what happened, the end could have been more satisfying had the dog participated in righting some of the wrongs done against her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Repeat of Tell Me Lies","review":"If you want to reread Tell Me Lies, then read this book. The plot, the characters, the foibles, the passions - everything is the same except for some name changes. I found Tell Me Lies to be original, hysterical, beautifully written, captivating - but why write an identical book? I know it must be difficult to break from your artistic style, i.e., groups like Boston (oh oh, showing my age!) in which every song sounds like the previous one! That said, based on Tell Me Lies, I still look forward to Jennifer's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"If you want to chuckle and laugh at the absurdity of life read this book!

A wonderful and entertaining story with a cast of characters that are equally endearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange mix for a \\"romantic romp\\"?","review":"I must be missing something here. Although I found the characters well defined and the dialogue sexy and lively, I had trouble relating to any of them. I found the women to be petty, bitter whinners and the men to be pathetic imbeciles. The only one who knew what they wanted was Bill and he turned out to be an abusive stalker. This is my first book by Ms. Cruise. I'm willing to try another one to see if its me or the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"It looks like I'm going to be the voice of dissent here. But just coming down from the high of reading \\"Watermelon\\", I was sure \\"Crazy For You\\" would be the perfect choice for my next read. Wrong! For far too much of the novel the \\"villian\\" is too pathetic and lost to be the least bit threatening. When Crusie finally turns up the heat the end is already crystal clear. Great sex scenes....but I stopped reading romances just for those scenes around high school. The rest predictable and flat. I'm thankful I only invested in a trip to the library on this one. For a great break-up-and-change-life-for-the-better romance try Marian Keye's \\"Watermelon\\" and for a great romantic suspence with wonderful tension try Karen Robards \\"Hunter's Moon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Only Jenny Crusie could get a plot out of a woman adopting a stray dog!

Quite dull, jumping all over the place with several different characters and a hero and heroine that were completely uninteresting. I guess what she wanted was small town charm, but it came out as big time boring.Nick just seemed like an old hound, living in a crappy apartment, drinking beer and dating twentysomethings. If he weren't \\"gorgeous,\\" would any self-respecting woman go near him?Quinn was a dope. She had no spine and is such a wimp. I can't believe she is viciously attacked by Bill, who is clearly mentally deranged, AND SHE WAITS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY TO GO TO THE POLICE???? How dumb is that? And to hear the characters say \\"Oh, hell\\" a thousand times got real old, real fast.Get any other book, \\"Bradley,\\" \\"Manhunting,\\" or \\"Anyone But You\\" if you want vintage Crusie.This one was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Terrible.","review":"This was my first (and last) Jennifer Cruise book. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich, and was looking for something to read while awaiting her most recent installment. Several people suggested Jennifer Cruise to me as an alternative. I was totally underwhelmed and unimpressed by her writing. Weak plot, lame characters, and tacky sex (in a high school, no less). What is there to like about this book? I managed to make it through the entire book, but was extremely thankful I had checked it out from the library. Needless to say, I won't be reading any of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same book????!!!","review":"Are we talking about the same book?

I wonder why it's getting such good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie since reading Tell Me Lies and Welcome to Temptation. But I must say that my favourite so far of hers is Crazy for You. She has combined an excellent blend of romantic emotion (I love it when the guy has been burning away with a unrequited love for a long time), humour and suspense. A very good contemporary novel if you're trying to get away from the run of the mill romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read.","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny.

What was the point of this story? I was in the mood for something humorous and I love to read about dogs. So, the first few pages were promising. But the story never really went anywhere.

Besides liking the part about Nick and Quinn, (Duh, who doesn't?! But it helps that Nick is super-hot and Quinn is so lovable,) I also really liked the part about Max and Darla. Throw in the part about Quinn's ex,Bill, an ex-boyfriend-turned-freaky-stalker, and you have the perfect read filled with romance, steamy sex, and just a bit of suspense.\\"Crazy for You\\" is recommended to everyone. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy for You","review":"I originally reached for this book for the sheer fun and delight I knew this author would provide. I got that, of course, in Nick and Quinn, and Quinn's family and friends and even in her students, but it was the fascinating downward spiral into madness of her former boyfriend that had me riveted to the pages. Such darkness amidst such humor, each handled so skillfully by Ms. Cruisie, has cemented this fan's opinion that this author is one to watch out for--and enjoy--for years to come. I highly recommend this book (and it also had one of the best \\"love\\" scenes I've read in awhile!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"This is my 3rd Crusie book and I had just finished Fast Women which I really liked. As I started getting into this book, it felt like deja vu. Quinn and her ratdog was like Nel and her Sugarpie. Darla was another Suzie from Fast Women. Both stories took place in small towns where everyone was somehow connected. Darla and Quinn both looking for that \\"zing\\" in their life, the passion they both needed. Like other reviewers, I actually liked Darla more than Quinn. But I have yet to finish this book. In most Crusie books, I think the supporting characters are actually better than the main heroine.So 2 stars because of the recycled material. I will continue to read Crusie as long as each story is different and unique from the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"Crusie is an automatic keeper. Her writing is witty and the story lines are interesting. The only reason I haven't given her 5 stars is because I can't read them in one sitting (over 300 pages). :) Too bad she is such a prolifice writer! See the other 64 reviews to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I agree with another reader - were we all reading the same book. I was really looking forward to this book. I've read other Crusie books & loved them & this book had great reviews. But I was thoroughly dissappointed - bad in every way. The plot was lame, the characters were lame....lame, lame, lame. And have I mentioned boring? I do not recommend this book. Neither do I recommend \\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" or \\"Charlie All Night\\". But I have read a few greats by Crusie - I RECOMMEND: \\"Bet Me\\" and \\"Welcome to Temptation\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes me smile;)","review":"What a delightful read!! Quinn and Nick are so down to earth, as are all the people we meet from Tibbett, OH. Lots of little twists and turns, all so human and believeable! Sometimes I feel like Darla, I love my husband, but after 10 years, things get stale at times. I can't wait to read more Cruise books and meet new characters!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"This is a fun book with a real plot to it.Quinn is a boring, safe, school teacher and she is sick and tired of her life. She decides to make some changes. She gets a dog, dumps her boyfriend and buys a house. Her taking chances in her life, inspires people around her to do the same. The ripple effect is great -- from her mom to her best friend (I don't want to give away too much!).Her ex-boyfriend's character is a bit over the top -- unbelievable and then just not enjoyable to the story anymore. I think it was a great book w/o all his drama, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But it is a fun, quick, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Crusie's characters literally pop out of the page at you. I found myself wanting to smack Bill, the ex-boyfriend, gossip with Darla, and help Quinn move, just from reading. The book's exploration of what one small decision can do to affect the lives of practically an entire town is interesting and thorough, and Crusie throws in enough quirky characters and plot loops to keep one interested the entire way through.

Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Women's Best Friend IS her Dog !","review":"Too bad this book is fiction instead of non-fiction. Then it'll prove that females do rule this world! With a little change with Quinn McKenzie (that is a girl! ) everyone around her starts changing also. Her mom is coming out of the closet, her best-friend is moving in with her and best of all, that sexy Nick and her may have somethin going on. The story gets really interesting when Quinn's persistent ex, Bill, starts stalking her. Things get intersting and all this from a little change with Quinn getting Katie, a poor looking dog that really looks like a rat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I have read in a while!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read \\"Tell Me Lies\\" last year and did not purchase this book until it came out in paperback. What a suprise! After reading this I will not even wait for her next book to come out in pb. I am running to the store for \\"Welcome To Temptation\\" in March!The reason I loved this book were the characters and Ms. Crusie's wonderful writing style. Funny and sexy go well together! Also I love the fact that Quinn and Nick seem like normal people. Not perfect, yet still attractive to each other. They are not super rich or super thin or super models! A nice change from all those other romances where the hero and heroine have perfect looks/bodies/money, blah, blah, blah.And Quinn's family and friends are as intersting as she is. Not to mention hard headed. I loved them all! I only wish it didn't have to end! Bravo Ms. Crusie. You are a terriffic writer and my favorite new author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CRAZY ABOUT CRUSIE!!!","review":"Jennifer Crusie hits a home run with this one! I lost an entire day's work because I couldn't put it down. It's funny,fresh, and completely satisfying! This is one book you won't feel as if you've read a hundred times before. I loved the characters, the humor, and the surprises. The best book I've read in months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusie tries a little too hard sometimes","review":"This book was adorable and will suck you in from page one. It's a great ensemble cast and you really will enjoy each story that's going on within. It seems to be Crusie's trademark to have strong secondary stories alongside her main characters.However, Crusie tries so hard to have the style, wit and cool of Sex in the City type characters. In my opinion, she doesn't make it. Her love scenes border on vulgar and her girlfriend talk tends to be over the top. Every scene of intimacy was discussed the next day with Quinn and her sister or her best friend or even with Nick himself. And those conversations were just too in-depth for me. I think I'd be embarassed to discuss my love life in detail. While I talk with my friends about anything, there's just some things you don't need to say. Get the picture?Read the book: You will laugh, cheer, cringe and laugh again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town Life at its Craziest....","review":"Quinn McKenzie has lived in a small town all her life. At the age of 35, she is living with the dream of the town - the high school coach and is enjoying her job as art teacher.A student brings a stray dog to her and this dog serves as a catalyst for Quinn to evaluate her life. She has always just peacefully gone along with everyone and as a result - her life is flat and boring in her eyes.Quinn rebels and suddenly it seems as though the whole town is rebelling as well! What ensues is somewhat disturbing at times, but realistic in many ways.An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Book","review":"This is my all-time favorite, go to book when I need to read something wonderful. From the opening when Quinn meets the dog to the end when Quinn and the dog Katie do what eeds t be done.... perfection.Quinn is a perfect heroine. She's smart, focused, funny and she changes everybody in her life because she needs to change her own life. Her one decision to buy a house (and leave her live-in boyfriend) sets an entire town into motion.I loved Quinn and Nick. I loved the slow spiral of Coach Bill.

I really enjoy her sassy style of writing and interesting subplots; however, the heroine in \\"Crazy for You\\" annoyed me.

Everytime ANYTHING happens, the characters think \\"Oh hell.\\" This sometimes occurs several times on one page.It got to the point where anytime someone said or thought \\"Oh hell\\", it made me cringe.I mean, do you use the exact same phrases as everyone else you know? Couldn't some of the characters say \\"Oh crap\\" or \\"Uh oh\\" or anything but \\"Oh hell\\"???Other than that annoyance, the book was good, easy, light reading. None of the characters are especially deep, but you don't expect that from these types of books. :)Crystal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only interesting if you are in junior high","review":"I bought this book because I thought it might be a fun read but I was terribly disappointed. The characters are one-dimensional and extremely boring and the plot is riduculously stupid. The ending is something like you might read in one of my seventh grade students' favorite books. As a teacher, I felt that Quinn and Bill's professional lives were nothing like any teacher I know. I'm a dog lover and I didn't even like the dog. If you feel compelled to read this book just grab one of the Sweet Valley High Series books--they are a quicker read and will leave you about as fulfilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusie, Crusie, Crusie","review":"Another Crusie great. Who would have thought adopting one poor, little, skinny dog would change Quinn's life? What a change it is. She goes from dating the \\"world's nicest guy\\" to dating her sister's ex husband.

Each page contains 3 months of singles charts, with the even numbered pages showing UK charts directly opposite the same month's summary in the US. The margins are filled with the music trivia of the day. The odd format of monthly charts exaggerates the chart success of songs that were around at the start of the month, but hurts songs that peaked in mid-month. Also odd, each country's chart also include a cross-reference to the WEEKLY position in the other country. But as a nostalgia tool, it's great fun to see what songs were popular in a given month, such as a birthday, wedding or graduation. Also includes an All-time US 100 (with The Twist at #1) and UK Top 100 (where Rock Around the Clock reigns), and cross reference by song title & artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The esoteric version of Sherlock Holmes","review":"It does not get any better than this.

This book was one of the assigned readings. I have this hardback edition. It is a collection of stories about a Sherlock Holmes-type of guy who goes after vampire, werewolves and the like. It is not a gory cut-me-up type of book. It doesn't involve devil worship or other types of child-scaring things. It is simply a great suspense book filled with stories about an investigator going after \\"bad people\\". Like the current show Grimm only no blood and guts. Hollywood should make a tv series with these stories - they would make a mint. The reading is easy and is never boring. I frequently use Dion Fortune's term \\"psychic vampires\\" only I use it to describe people at work who suck the energy from you.

After reading half of the book it didn't seem like anything had happened.I was really dissapointed after reading the reviews and I thought that it mush be a really good book anyway if I can I won't even give it one star.I'm sorry and I hope I didn't offend the ones that loves this book, I just want to say what I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"The location makes it -- worthwhile","review":"Riga did indeed feel like that at that time. The author skillfully takes you back to that time and place. The mystery part is not the greatest, but the discription of the nature of the struggle between the good guys and the bad guys is very good. For the mystery I award three stars. I like the short and common Latvian names that Mr. Mankell choose, but the two dead Russians that drifted to Sweden should have more properly been given Latvianized russian names and not the very Latvian names Leja (valley) and Kalns (hill). For mood, setting and background I award five stars. The average is four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect period piece - another outstanding Wallander novel","review":"I'm hardly the first to praise Mankell for his Wallander series, but this one I found especially compelling. Mankell has done a marvelous job of placing us so close to Wallander that we experience the confusion and fear as he tries to unravel a mystery that takes him to Riga, Latvia as the Soviet system is imploding after 50 years. Like Wallander, we are always just a bit off balance, uncertain of where we are, what is happening, and why events are as they are. At the heart of the mystery is not so much an action or series of actions but an inability to sort friends and foes and the confusion and fear that permeate a disintegrating totalitarian state. It reminds me of Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon,\\" and in fact, one of the characters echoes a central theme of Darkness. So if you like the gun-toting, bourbon swilling hard-nosed dick who can give or take a beating, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing or bad translation?","review":"This is the second book by this author that I have read and am constantly dragged down by the awkward writing. The story line was interesting, but the language was flat and terse. The books do not exhibit a sense of location or richness of characters. It is as bland and colorless as a winter landscape. Perhaps that's the intention. I wonder if the author is a poor writer or if the translation is just bad. Perhaps a Swedish reader could elucidate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dogs of Riga","review":"An interesting story with information about a geographic area that is prettyunknown. I am hooked on Kurt Wallander!"},{"rating":"1","title":"most disappointing of the series","review":"This is the weakest of the six books I have read in the series. The translation into English is flat and the language drab. Usually, the element of mystery and suspense is stronger as is the character development of the detective Kurt Wallender and those surrounding his life. Here, the mystery lacks tension and at the end I hardly cared about the resolution. Also, there was little depth in the portrayal of Wallender or his personal circumstances. If you want to read two first rate Wallender mysteries, choose either One Step Behind or Sidetracked [they are quite similar in plot --and both are extraordinary mysteries]."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking","review":"i see a lot of disappointed reviews here--personally i think this is one of the best in the whole series. it has more unrealisitic spymovie sequences--but they are breathtaking. i honestly had no idea if wallender would survive--and i've read the later books. dont be put off--this book is angry, venomous really, driven and tough. like wallender. i compare it to early LeCarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, disappointing and listless YAWN","review":"This is my first Wallander book and I found it heavy going. It started out well with the two dead men on the raft drifting into Wallander's jurisdiction, but once he goes to Latvia, it's just one vague, awkward paragraph after another. Lots of hints about great suspense, possible death and a revolution brewing but the details are never filled in and you find yourself more and more fed up with Wallander and his endless cups of tea, sleepless nights and trips to the crapper. I never really felt like I knew what was at stake in this novel, it was all very vague, full of insinuation and very little actual political detail. I'm not sure why I kept reading it. I guess I wanted to find out if it ever picked up and got good. It didn't.I'll read another Wallander, just to see if this was a fluke. Hope so, because I like the character, but the writing was mediocre and the suspense non-existant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This was my 1st Henning Mankell book and I thought it was great!! I couldn't put it down. I like Inspector Wallander's down to earth, everyman kind of approach to life. And this is coupled with a strong policeman's street sense and the natural innate ability to come up with the right conclusions every time. I like how the author often refers to his dead and departed police friend and asks himself how he would see a particular situation. I'm definitely going to buy more of these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summer Read","review":"As I've written above, this is a great summer read--it's very readable, entertaining, and even suspenseful towards the end. Inspector Wallander is a very well-developed character, but what I especially enjoyed about this particular novel is how Henning Mankell does a great job of painting what life was like in Riga during the time when the Iron Curtain came crashing down. He also does a great job of hinting what life was like in Latvia during the Communist era. This is the second Inspector Wallander book I've read, the first being his debut, Faceless Killers, and I must say that I enjoyed this second book much more than the first book! The book is suspenseful, and I found myself wondering how it would all end. I look forward to reading the third book, The White Lioness, later this year or sometime next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Dogs of Riga","review":"Perhaps it is unfortunate that this is the only Henning Mankell book I have read, because I would never read another of his \\"mysteries\\" after this. Having been rather disappointed by the PBS renderings of his works, I now commend them on making them as interesting as they can.What a dull book this is. Perhaps if written as a very short story, it would have been OK. But the characters and situations are dull, the plot almost non-existent, and little or no suspense for the reader. I finished this book only because I wanted to see if in the ending there would be something which made it worthy of publication. Sadly, there was none. Save you money and time, if you like tightly constructed and well written mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on -- let's get real","review":"OK, I'm not going to give away the ending. But here is the plot. Two men are found dead in a liferaft, apparently with expensive clothes put on them after death. This is a mystery that isn't solved. A Latvian cop is killed and for some reason, the Latvian police call on Kurt Wallender -- who is Swedish and speaks not a word of Latvian -- to cross the Baltic and solve their crime. Good investigative technique -- interview people who don't speak your language. But that's the premise of this book, and it makes no sense at all! Okay, so it is dark and brooding and Scandinavian, but give me a break. At least give us some kind of plot to make us suspend disbelief (This may be easier in Sweden where everyone drinks, smokes, drinks coffee and commits suicide.) It is well written but you've got to have a plot. Oh yes, in the end the solution comes from out of nowhere after Wallender has messed it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but simplistic","review":"The setting and the characters promise a great read. And while the books is easy to get thru and diverting enuf, it is far toosimplistic and predictable; like a TV crime episode. There are far too many far-fetched turns to make it believable. The basic political tenet is never really explained or backgrounded. This is a great shame as the book's theme and characters hold so much promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Two dimensional characters, predictable plot, tedious attempts at suspense and a lazy, poorly-crafted plot. A friend recommended Henning Mankell when I asked for suggestions in the spirit of early John LeCarre. I was looking for psychological depth and an intriguing puzzle whose answer emerges gradually, delivered in first rate prose. This is Not Not Not that book. I recommend you look elsewhere (perhaps Alan Furst is the answer - I'm going to try him next)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an awful, overrated book","review":"The characters are dull, uninteresting, and unlikeable, while the plot is incoherent and contrived.

You must attach them to the squares yourself.

If this is the best way that Zen can be explained then I'm not embarrased to say I don't get it, don't think I'll ever get it, and don't care anymore (or wait...does that mean that I actually do get it?). I can see from the swarming responses to the other 1 star reviews that I can expect this review to be pounced on by the books defenders. I mean no disrespect to the author, and if you can get something out of it good for you. But after re-reading some entries repeatedly to ensure I wasn't missing anything I interpret this to be mostly nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Had Satori","review":"Shunryu Suzuki never had Satori.He admits this on the FIRST page of this very book.So why should we listen to him?According to D. T. Suzuki, \\"Satori is the raison d'tre of Zen, without which Zen is no Zen. Therefore every contrivance, disciplinary and doctrinal, is directed towards satori.\\"Shunryu Suzuki inherited his Roshi title from his father, without any authentic Dharma transmission.HIS only named Dharma successor, Richard Baker, was a notorious playboy who spent the SF Zen Center money on Porsches and jetsetting.And now the SF Zen Center, run by a bureaucracy of new age politically correct \\"talking parking meters\\", is a franchise temple, spinning off their chain store temples all over the nation, with their emphasis on \\"no enlightenment buddhism\\".The San Francisco Zen Center has yet to produce an enlightened Roshi. They are a fraud.And this fox's book continues to trick naive Dharma seekers.No satori, no authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special...","review":"Does not really touch a whole lot on Buddhism teachings and believes, it does have few good concepts but in all very theoretical, boring to read and a very BEGINNER'S MIND approach.I was looking forward to more knowledge, something that would really think and reflect on new horizons.If you are really interested in Zen teaching, and want some very light no challenge whatsoever, give it a shot.

If you think your body and mind are two that is wrong; if you think they are one, that is also wrong. Our body and mind are both two and one.\\" I always thought meditation was designed to afford you a clearer awareness of the present. How does filling a person's head with this type of gobbledy gook aid in that? It doesn't. The book is an endless stream of this nonsense. If you want your head spinned trying to comprehend what Suzuki is driving at, by all means, dive in. But you'll just be clouding your head more than it already is when the whole point is to remove the clouds that are already there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Modern Zen Literature","review":"\\"The points we emphasize are not the stage we attain, but the strong confidence we have in our original nature and the sincerity of our practice\\" Reading over 20 books on Zen I can confidently write that Beginners Mind is unique among modern Zen literature in that it gives the reader the \\"sense of Zen\\". Unlike other books by D.T. Suzuki or Alan Watts, both of which are very profound writers that write in a more intellectual and formal manner Shunryu is more humane. This is not the best book to start with, a better first step could be Alan Watts \\"The way of Zen\\" or D.T. Suzuki's \\"An Introduction to Zen Buddhism\\" but after a basic understanding of Zen is acquired this book will uniquely supplement it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST IN ZEN LITERATURE","review":"filled with enlightening points and ideas to provoke thought and inspire meditation practice, Zen Mind, Beginners' Mind is the most effective book on zen I've ever read, and I've read plenty of books on the subject. Also, be sure to check out Kaplau's \\"The Three Pillars of Zen,\\" which takes a more direct approach to expaining the practice of zen and does so magnificently. Five Stars for both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beginner's mind best for the moderately advanced","review":"A whole lot of zen - though don't be fooled, for a short and highly recommended book with \`beginner' in the title it's not as crisp and accessible as it appears. Those bent on buddhacide, especially the purist soto crowd, will find the concession of clarity a worthwhile trade for the authenticity of this oral transcription. (Or, if nothing else, by the end you'll have read \`This is a very, very important point' enough times to bludgeon buddha unconscious.)But if you're curious and just looking for a good book to learn about zen, you've got a beginner's mind already -- don't need a book to see that! Save the lesson of the \`beginner's mind' for when you think you know it all about zen. a better start: find kapleau's \`3 pillars of zen', it looks fat and heavy but concisely lays zen open with unparalleled vigor and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen...Minus the Beliefs","review":"A startlingly simple, yet incredibly well-composed book. Suzuki's thoughts on Zen and Zen practice are refreshing and amazingly devoid of any belief systems that might corrupt the practice of Zen, and so I believe that, for me especially (being an American with little knowledge of Eastern traditions), this book was an amazing primer into the spirit of Zen practice. I highly recommend this book to people interested in Zen, Buddhism, or world religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essence of Zen","review":"A must for everyone interested in Zen.Enlightenment always IS, but people aren't aware. This book will awaken you to the True Mind that always IS, even though forms appear and disappear. All that is IS True Mind, but the ego-mind sleeps in its individuality, unaware of this reality. This book will awaken you to the True Mind in which all operates.Read it. Awaken.

I have been studying Zen meditation with a Zen Buddhist monk for a short time and found this book to accurately echo the basic teachings I have been learning. The lessons in the book are clearly explained, and as the title depicts, even a beginner's mind will get the messages without any trouble.

This book became the heart of me, and I often recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"This planet please.... don't do this unless you are into philosophy big time.","review":"I read with interest all the other reviews and thought this would be a good book to get some insight into Zen meditation. Please...... what a joke. The most obvious thing is that there are no drawings to help with various poses that are mentioned in the book. It would help to make sure you are interpretating the instructions correctly to have a drawing or better yet a picture as a reference. Nooooooo.... that would be neither here nor there. If you understand that then you have this Zen thing down. There is nothing beginning like about this book and further more the examples don't really get over the concepts very well. Well although there is no good or bad in the Zen world... in my world there is and this is it. It stinks to high heaven. I expect my tirade can be taken either way by you Zen masters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has nothing to do with Buddhism between covers.","review":"This book is POP Zen, not Buddhism. The late authors intention to write a touchy-feely book for ignorant westerners was his goal. Spefically #1 there is nothing between the covers relavent to Buddhism. #2 the \\"practice\\" of Buddhism is Sati and Samadhi, not \\"zazen\\". If your looking for Buddhism, consult the Sutras or an expert commentator such as AK Coomaraswamy.

The points of determination to uncover self nature by means of keeping the Hua Tao by Suzuki has been lost.

The air filter fits in perfectly and I noticed a little bit better performance after putting it in. I looked around other sites and this seemed to be the lowest price for one including shipping. The price was high for an air filter I thought but compared to what else is out there it's about the market price for one of this quality.

Lots and lots of catchy and memorable vocal melodies. I was really impressed by this album and would say that there are basically no weak songs on here (Although 'Get it up' could benefit from less-cheesy lyrics perhaps). Standout tracks include 'King for 1000 Years', 'The Invisible Man', 'Come Alive', 'The Shade in the Shadows', as well as the single 'Light the Universe'.

Those albums stand the test of time, and so will this album! The addition of Sascha and Dani(new drummer) was the best thing that could have ever happened to Helloween.They are tighter than ever, and Sascha writes some fantastic songs.

Cheesy slo-mo sequences like Bevery D'Angelo's scene where she kneels down in front of her house looked so amateurish. And the sports metaphor of the film! White skinheads beating black homeboys at...get this.... basketball? And the \\"super intellectual\\" high school teacher, reportedly possessing two PhD degrees, using a double-negative in one grammatically disappointing scene. This film could've said and done so much more than it did.

And the story that a guy sent in to prison with Natzi tattos all over his body,for less than a year had his life canged by one black man who he did the landery with.

I liked seeing the transformation of Edward Norton's character.I thought all of the acting was good, but I wish Elliot Gould's character had bit a bit stronger. That's more about the writing involved in the character than the acting.One of the qualities of this film that I like the most is how it shows the negative consequences of violence. There's no glamour in the violence, just emptiness. We need more messages like that coming out of Hollywood.This film is worth the time and the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST POWERFUL FILM I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS!","review":"The film is disturbing in that is shows you racisim from both sides and almost makes you understand a little about where each is coming from.(whether you want to or not). When an actor is as good as Norton, it's an emotional event just to watch him do his job, but in the role of Derrek Vinyard he goes above and beyond anything else he's done.

The number of glowing reviews for this repellent little work of art shows what a fine job our public schools are doing at turning people into mind-numbed, politically correct morons. American History X juxtaposes the perfectly rational dialogue by the film's main \\"racist\\" (Norton's character) with appalling acts of violence, in an attempt to link reasonable and legitimate conservative opinions with outright racism. (I can just imagine what the geniuses who admire this film will say after reading this review... \\"Reasonable???\\") The filmmaker is trying to say that holding opinions expressed by certain characters such as opposition to affirmative action/ welfare is just a few steps away from stomping on someone's head. That is the totalitarian tendency of political correctness. American History X wallows in the most pretentious political correctness ever put on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"As always Norton delivers.

I was not expecting the untamed, full disclousre of life as a white supremisist. This film takes us to a level of reality about society's problems rarely reached by film makers. The actors make this film come a live with emotion and passion. I've never hated a character as much as Derek at the begining and cared so much about him at the end. Truly a great performance. I'll be expecting a lot from him in the future, hope he can live up to the acting challange he opened up with this film. Hats off to director Tony Kaye, I don't know weather he walked a fine line with this film or threw all the political corretness out the window. The story is heart wrenching and the plot developed very intrestingly. I was so wrapped up in the plot I lost track of time. Supporting actors had no choice but to justly frame Edward Nortons shinning performance. Definate must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American History X was an extremely powerful movie.","review":"Wow, American History X was a movie that made you look at life in so many differnt ways.

A very powerful drama demonstrating how some people really feel about racism. Norton was perfect for the role as a leader which was splendidly acted. Great story with a deep message of hatred and how wrong these feelings are. The film shows life's lessons on what comes around goes around. One lesson to be learned is that violence and hatred will come back to haunt you. Norton Jr. trying to turn his brother's life around was a turning point in the film with a sad ending. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE BY ANYBODY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get this movie out of my head.","review":"American History X is one of those rare movies that you are unable to forget.

I can understand people's reasons for not liking other ethnicities (people) because of the way they go about doing things, this story about a young man who turns into a bigot after his father was killed by Black thugs; this story is too true to be good. I think Edward Norton played this role as a White supremacist is his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reality told, a wonderous story stating how life can be.","review":"This movie was a graphic but realistic story about gang life and racism in the current day. As you watch the film, you get so caught up in it, and don't look away for a second. Although the film had some nudity and a bit a graphic violence, children could learn from this. As how not to go about life (of course!). But hey, if you don't trust your children, rent them The Flintstones and get them tucked away in their own rooms. Then bust this movie out, make some popcorn, get some pop/soda/cola, and watch. I gaurantee this movie is worth every renting or purchasing dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent Portrayal of Racism in Todays Youth","review":"This movie, at first, shocked me.

Edward Norton starts out as an unrepentant white supremacist but after his jail experience, he comes out trying to save his younger brother from that life. It is an amazing movie about how racism and hatred doesn't get you anywhere and leaves last ripples. It is somewhat graphic so it is not for the younger crowd.

It is a must own for anyone who enjoys drama films, Edward Norton, and movies with a lesson behind them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a movie that should have been made into a book.","review":"Not knocking this movie but I would have rather read this in a book. It was a little to rasict for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"remember to keep your eyes on the screen","review":"This is necessary. Whatever your beliefs, whatever your background, you will be able to find something of what you know and something of what you detest in this film. That is what keeps you simultaneously revolted and glued to your screen. I found this movie to be a sad awakening to the truth of our society, if not a morbid depiction of the racist aspect as a whole, then at least the unfortunate isolated case. It flows like something between a documentary and a horrible drama; historical fiction for the next generation. If you don't mind a little bit of frustration, it is a small price to pay for the magnitude, power, and beauty of this sad film. Besides, real life rarely has a hollywood ending and this movie is far from being about escapism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Even though it was really hard for me to watch this film given its content, I have to say that \\"American History X\\" is definitely a film worth seeing. I understand that not all movies can be nice and comfortable, and this movie proves that.Edward Norton was incredible in his role as a reformed Nazi skinhead. The array of emotions he projected before and after his reformation left me speechless. He's an actor in the truest sense of the word.Yes, like I've said before, this movie is difficult to watch, but my advice is to look beyond the hatred, name-calling, and violence and discover the message the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely great","review":"Before we watched it my husband thought it was just another racist movie. But after watching it we were both speechless and after finishing the credits, all he can say is \\"beautiful\\". That summarizes everything with the movie.

But one thing is for sure, Violence is never going to do anyone good.Edward Norton is such a great actor. He should have won the Oscars for his portrayal. Furlong too was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessity","review":"I stumbled upon American History X on the Independent Film Channel, and it has forever changed my outlook on life. The first thing that captured my attention in this film was the acting. I have always been a HUGE fan of Edward Norton and have seen every one of his movies, but his performance as Derek Vinyard blew me away. Asside from Primal Fear, this is Norton's best piece of work to date.As for the film itself, there is nothing that can be said to acuratly describe the power of it, except that it is a definate MUST-SEE.Though X is extremely graphic and for mature audiences only, it is easily one of the most influencial and underrated films of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"The firts time i saw this movie was three years ago. I was simply astounded. Then the more i saw it, the better it got. i personally did not consider Edward Nortan one of the better actors of our time, but after this movie, he defenetly proves himself. This movie deals with one of the biggest problems of our era: racism. It shows the perspectives of both sides of the mirror. While watching the movie, you knew that what Derek Vinyard (Norton) was doing was wrong, but you understood his rage. I personally think this movie is more worthy than many other movies of the same year. Basicly, the moral of the story is \\"Hate is Bad\\" (Furlong)P.S Dont listen to what other say, the ending is the best ending ever directed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very power full wich sends people a message.........","review":"This movie is basicly about a rasist skinhead who changes after he is commeted a crime to blacks. When he changes he shows his followers what he was missing this whole time.His brother on the other hand doesnt like the idea wich leads tomore truble. Edward Norton is very well done in this film.This movie defintley sends a message to viewers. I loved this film and put it in my movie collection. This was a great indepent film for me. It was also one of my most favorite idependent films.I wish the ending wasnt so sad. It left me really upset at the end. But if you think about it he had it coming. Still it was really sad ending.If you ever think about getting a good independent film.Get American History X.I also recomend you watching 21 Grams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfull impact on all","review":"When I first saw this DVD, I was stunned. Words failed me for at least a few minutes. The artfull way that this story was put together sends you into a world of raw reality that can make anyone feel the fear and anger the characters protrayed. I really loved the flash backs in black and white. There is so much in this film that every time that I see it, I STILL see something that wasn't there before. All I can say is that this movie is priceless and one for every one to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Edward Nortan","review":"American history X really helped to show me how much of a great actor Edward Nortan is.

In this film, you see what life is like through the eyes of present day skin heads, as well as the consequences for their actions.

I tip my hat to this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it Twice","review":"Thought provoking. Some of the best acting I've ever seen. Edward Norton is the hottest young actor out there.

I recomend this to everyone, kids should be required to watch this in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Thought Provoking","review":"This is without a doubt one of the most riveting films that I have ever seen. Ed Norton, no slouch whatever his role, puts forth one of the finest roles he will ever play. Eerily believable, his twisted logic will at somepoint challenge even the most liberal of thinkers to question where their beliefs come from. Even if you are leary of buying this without seeing it go to the store and rent it. This is one of those movies that kids should see and discuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie With A Great Message","review":"This is an excellent movie. The acting was universally great, the writing was sharp, the characters believable. Even the neo-Nazis are rendered believably, no small feet in a Hollywood movie. And the conversion of the lead character from racist agitator to normal person is convincing. The anti-hate message is excellently sent, and the audience is not bludgeoned. The characters are given reasons for their hate which render it understandable if not condonable This makes their conversions all the more believable. The only complaint I have is that the script writer obviously hasn't read Mein Kampf, not ordinarily a bad thing, but the book is crucial to one of the movies central moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward Norton gives a blistering performance in . . .","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give an allstar performance in this chilling tale about the consequences of racism. A skin head named Derek is put in jail for brutally killing two black guys who are trying to steal his car (this was my favorite part of the movie). After a very rough prison life, he is released (no longer a racist) only to find that his little brother Danny is following in his footsteps. It is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL!!","review":"In one word this movie is indeed \\"POWERFUL\\" American History X is a movie unlike any other I've ever seen.Edward Norton (The Score, Fight Club) is brilliant and Oscar worthy as Derek Vinyard, a bright young man who is at the breaking point and falls victim to the trap of racism by listening to the lies and propaganda of white supremist leader Cameron (Stacy Keach). Derek's younge brother Danny (Ed Furlong) destined to follow in his older brothers footsteps must learn the wrongs of his older brother so he doesn't repeat them. Perhaps the only one who can reach Danny is his brother Derek.If you've never seen it American History X will shock you to say the least. It contains Extremely brutal violence, extremely harsh language and subject matter, wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers. If your looking for a \\"POWERFUL, SHOCKING\\" movie with superb acting than check out American History X! Well worth a look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Oo my goodness, the movie american history x was sooooo good! That movie was deep!but it's a good story and I am hearing take to Review its I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very real, extremely well portrayed","review":"American History X is a tragic story about the influencing lies of neo-nazism and white supremacey. derrick vineyard is a 20-something young man who has just been released from prison for maliciously killing a black man. his mission through out the entire movie is to show his younger brother the realities behind the lie that he's being fed by the skins that he hangs out with, and to hopefully teach through the mistakes that landed him in jail. the movie is very graphic but an accurate veiw of the neo-nazi way of life. i would recommend this to anyone. the story is powerful, the acting is believable, the cinematography is awesome(color for the present, black and white for the past, lots of symbolism that you have to watch the movie a few times to really understand.) and the message behind the movie is very clear:\\"life is too short to be pissed off all the time.\\"-American History X"},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpecting, real-life drama- excellent movie","review":"Norton and Furlong were excellent. I am not racists or anything so when i first started watching it I didn't think i was going to like it. Boy was I wrong! When i saw how real life this movie was, i was hooked. I watched it numerous times and still can't get enough! Both Furlong and Norton deserve an award for portraying such difficult characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing from beginning to end","review":"Chillingly realistic. Insight into the mind of what troubles America today. It isn't pretty. It is graphic and intense which keeps the tone of the move through out this amazing movie. Racisim today is a glossed over problem because it does not directly effect most Americans today. We don't see it so it must not be there. This movie made me think a lot of how I look at and treat other people. That is what we should ask of movies today. Not only do we need mindless entertainmet but we sometimes need to have our eyes opened up and see what really goes on around us. Truely gripping and compelling. The use of black and white flash backs was quite interesting. Well acted and the direction is great. Ed Norton is amazing. A gifted actor. Looking for good things from him in the future. A very well crafted movie. A real must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie, horrible quality!","review":"the first and last hd movie I rent from amazon. the movie itself is great, but the quality was awful. the entire movie sounded like an old dragging cassette tape. for $5 I expected better, or my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done","review":"There is nothing new here just the usual Hollywood hype. Grossly exaggerating the threat of neo-Nazi's while ignoring California's minority gangs. More people are killed by gangs in one day than in the last 10 years from the nazi's. If you watch/buy this, just don't think. It aims soley at the emotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am i the only one who saw thru this garbage?","review":"Ok, i admit, i was totally blown away by the shock factor of the first half of this movie. Gutsy, Gutsy, Gutsy. But after that, it totally falls apart. It goes from the shocking, disturbing truth to the ultimate hollywood cliche: \\"Guy realises he's done wrong with his life and wants to make everything right.\\" This movie turned cheeseball in a matter of seconds. Pointless scenes litter the last half of the movie. The writers cheap attempt at trying to explain Edward Nortons character's hatred was a joke and totally unnecessary. Couple that with the predictable ending and you have a typical sub-par hollywood movie. It's really too bad too, cuz the first hour is amazing. One thing is for sure though, Edward Norton is one of todays best young actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"One little thing","review":"The only negative thing that I have to say about this movie is the sterotype on skinheads. Not all skinheads are Nazis. Actually, it's only about 10% of the skinhead population that are white supremisists. I personally am not a skinhead but I have friends that are who are completely against that sect of skinheadism and don't even consider those who do fit the racist neo-nazi mold to be real skinheads in the first place. You should check out a documentary called Dark Planet:Visions of America to get a real, unbiased look at the skinhead scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"enthralling and moving","review":"What I liked most about the movie is its non-biased, unstereotypical view of people getting into the dilemma of committing race-related crimes. That's why I'd rather call this a film and not a movie because it's far away from any Hollywood-commercial-happy-end productions.It aims at understanding how easily our own environment can become a ground for everyone's own evil potential to grow. Undoubtedly we all experience the manupilative impact of our surroundings, not only the obvious effect of right-wing propaganda but also of educational efforts as shown by Dr. Sweeney. The viewer realizes it won't do to put the blame on others for things that shaped and determined their own life but to take action oneself to make sure that our ''memory'' (...) will be once ''touched'' again '' by the better angels of our nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"it's a bit old, but it is timeless. the first time I saw it, I liked the hate, but this last time I saw it I saw the meaning and cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie","review":"American History X stands firmly in one of the most moving films I have ever seen. Despite alot of graphic material this film portrays the destiny of most people in gangs and shows how ignorance can be aboslutley devastating to ones life and family. What a blessing it is to have this movie on hand and to remind myself of the life I was living (using drugs, robbing people, running reckless) and today have been sober for over a year what a blessing. This film should be carefully watched by mature audiences knowing right from wrong and please try to get the overall message behind the film. Which is hate breeds hate and love is the greatest blessing one can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping until the end.","review":"American History X is more like a documentary, than a story. It follows life as a skinhead, through the ups and downs. This movie does not pick sides at all.It more documents things and says \\"this is what happens when you are a skinhead with these racist ideals\\". It doesn't say it's right or wrong, just that it is. The story is told in such a way as to keep you gripped throughout the entire movie. At no time does it get dull or drag. I would reccomend it to anyone. Infact my dad is getting this movie from me this xmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"American History X","review":"This is the quintessential movie about race relations in the United States. A stark portrayal of neo-nazism in the United States, American History X is the tale of the young Derek Vinyard and the transformation he undergoes, as he realizes that a life revolving around hatred of others just isn't worth it. What sets this movie apart is its ability to give the audience a critical insight into the thought process of white supremacists. It doesn't justify their behavior, but it rationalizes their thinking and makes the audience understand where they are coming from. This movie is almost entirely devoid of subplots. There is no hidden message or underlying theme. It is amazing that a movie so simplistic can have such a powerful emotional effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great (but sad) movie!","review":"I first watched this when I was younger and it first came out. I suppose I didn't understand the message at the time, and watching it again, I realize it is a great movie. Edward Norton plays the best role he's ever played (in my opinion), and I feel like most people who love it or hate it do so for the wrong reasons. Some people love it if they are bigots and they think that this movie is justifying and glorifying their hatred. Some people hate it because they also believe that. However, the message of the movie is that hate is not inherent, it is learned, and it can be un-learned. Highly recommend this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It skips","review":"Despite being as \\"Good as New\\", the DVD skips in every player I put it in. I several-minute blocks of content, and it takes forever for the player to try to find the next readable data. It's a great movie, but I expected to get a disc that at least mostly worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"American History X GREAT","review":"This movie is action packed, racist, and knowledgeable. It shows how pointless raceism is and how it shows long term effects of racism and hate crimes. This movie was required to watch for a class in college. I got an A on my report. I highly reccomend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite and important","review":"I have to echo the sentiments of the viewer from Seattle, WA. My husband and I are both in our 50's and we both wept throughout this movie, and it is not superficially emotional...designed to make you cry. It is just so deeply impacting that it pierces something deep in your psyche and your spirit. I have not seen a more important motion picture in my life. Everyone of every racial and political persuasion should be required to view this film. This makes anything Spike Lee has ever done, look like idiocy. When a movie like this was out there to be made, a film that truly addresses the honest racial attitudes of real people, it makes one wonder wonder why a piece of filth like \\"He's Got Game\\" was even allowed to go into distribution. I hope Spike has seen this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think, just feel...","review":"Don't think too hard about this film, because if you do, you'll soon realize that the story is pretty much implausible. Instead, suspend your disbelief, and allow yourself to believe Ed Norton's finely crafted performance and be absolutely blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Performances By an Actor in 1998","review":"American History X is one of the years ten bests films and Edward Norton has given a performance of a life time which shouldve won the best actor award at the oscars. I should also note the very good performance from Edward Furlong. But this film is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acting, but problems with overall continuity","review":"This film was much better than I had expected. I guess I thought that this was going to be just another formulaic story about a white supremacist who somehow becomes enlightened. This film is scary, intense and intelligent. The acting was superior--the dining table scene was incredible. But there were some definite flaws. There's something wrong with the overall flow of the film. It feels like several scenes pieced together, rather than one conhesive piece. Still, it makes a compelling statement and I was completely engaged throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific flick, a bit too thick, though.","review":"I thought this would probably be another \\"perfect world\\" movie filled w/ liberal propaganda, but, rather, it simply gave us a look into the nature & reality of hatred. I still think a lot of this is blown out of preporsion regarding all of the racial hatred. I just don't buy itEdward Norton is incredible, just as he was in Primal Fear; I think this is one of the most powerful acting jobs in recent memory. And I agree, the b&w shot of him proceeding his murders is one I won't ever forget.I could have gone w/ a little less moral at the end, but overall this is an excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"skin head staff","review":"when two brothers named dan and derek lose there father from a drug dealer, they blame it on the black people because his dad died from a black person, when derek th big brothr is arrested and sentenced to go to prison for killing two black people his brother who is still at school is startin to become like him and become a bad kid in school. when his brother is realised from priosn the family is back togther but the big brother decides to stop as he knows he can't just start to blame it on people and decide to leave his group of gang, if he can."},{"rating":"2","title":"It looks at racism at Hitlers point of view","review":"Well this movie is about a racist learning how wrong racism really is. Edward Norton gives the performance of his life. Im normally not the type to get touched by movies but this movie really effected every thing I believe in. Edward Norton was a huge racist and was sent to prison for killing a black male in a footpath. He was sent to prison and was betrayed by the white males there. A chris tucker like black male ended up being nortons only friend . When Norton was released from prison he realised how wrong his old view were. Only.........it was too late"},{"rating":"2","title":"talk about breathtaking","review":"\\"American History X\\" is probably the best film I can remember seeing in my collective memory of life. It is the single most stunning, true-to-life, scary, and exciting film I have ever seen. The cast was top-notch, everyone born to play his or her role. This film is guaranteed to shock you with surprises 'round every corner. The last scene left me up all night with excitement. If you're looking for a drama that will frighten you terribly when you realize how true it really is, \\"American History X\\" is your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"American History X","review":"Following the openning murder scene, I could not keep my eyes off the screen, because I was watching so much of what I've seen in modern society. The racism was very much familiar. Not just the poor little black slave living in the projects because big bad white america is supressing them, but it shows the hatred of the blacks towards the white and vise-versa. The extremes of their racial hate was provoked by their own anger in general, therefore they imply the negative energy in racism (they come to realise). While the racism was portrayed in an exagerated extreme manner, the over all message hit close to home. There was one steryotype, however, that was particualarly getting on my nerves. The characters constant implication that conservatives are Nazi facists out to supress minorities and those with liberal views are more interested with raical untiy. Give me a break. That aside, I loved \\"American History X\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!!!!!","review":"I have seen this movie about 5 times and like it more and more whenever I watch it. I bought this movie as a gift for my girlfriend(nothing says I love you more than American History X =P)because she as well liked the movie so I figured it would be a good gift. Anyways, all I have to say is that it is a good movie focusing on a person who committed a hate crime and tells his tale from beginning to end. If you have not seen it, go either rent or buy it. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"American History X review","review":"Great product, love the movie. Took a while to ship from this seller but movie is great overall. Mixed feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"RACISM...!","review":"As always Edward Norton proves he's a powerful actor. The story is extremely powerful and disturbing... but the question remains would it succeed to put an end to racism?!!If I want to discuss my opinion about the movie, I'd say it is a well-done powerful disturbing movie that I recommend watching! It may not be suitable for some because of some violent scenes but at least there is a good cause behind this movie.The story of this movie can be applied in most (if not all) countries in the world. Wherever there is hate, there is racism. And wherever there is racism, there is hate and all leads to a society weakness.The main point that I think the film missed to present was RELIGION! All religions, emphasized on loving each other whether it was Islam, Christianity or any other. All stressed on peace and love... but it is us (mankind) who start hatred and wars. The film should have presented that all of this hate was developed because of lack of faith!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting can't save a naive and manipulative script.","review":"This movie has its heart in the right place, I suppose. A man struggles with his ignorant past, grows and abandons his miserable lifestyle of hatred and violence. But this film's naivete and its imbecilic portrayal of prison life just cannot be excused. People go into prisons with open minds and come out racists for life. It never works the other way around. This film is a honkey fairy-tale for doofus liberals who think they're walking on the edgy side. The only controversy here is how woefully unrealistic this film is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder...","review":"if we will ever have a movie exemplifying the racist attitudes of the people of Israel?The problem with this movie is it portrays ethnocentricism as a white pathology, which is completely contrary to what we find in this world. How many people like Norton's character really exist in our modern world? Very few. If we are going to make a movie about ethnocentric behavior, the portrayal of an Israeli soldier would be much more relavent and believable.Ultimately, this movie provides no insight to real life racist behavior. It simply promotes the hollywood myth that egalitarianism is the normal human tendency, and only white people prefer their own race or tribe over others. Meanwhile, the whole world is errupting in ethnic wars and indoctrinated Americans don't have a clue as to why."},{"rating":"1","title":"how do you make neo-nazis appear trite?","review":"i was eagerly looking forward to catching up with this movie id missed at the time of its release, esp since im a fan of both edward norton and eddie furlong (even as just an acxtor, lol). however, this was an overwrought and overthought mess. there is nothing here that hasnt been covered (sans the dirty language) in a slew of tv movies dating back to the episode of \\"twilight zone\\" where dennis hopper met hitler. and a bald eddie furlong is not much fun to look at. norton is less and less interesting an actor as time goes along, but at least here he was still trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, absolutely amazing!","review":"American History X was a fine piece of work and one of my favorite movies of all time. Edward Norton is perfect and does an excellent job as Derek Vineyard, a neo nazi skinhead trying to prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from going down the same wrong path he did in life. I think everyone, everywhere should see this movie. We can all learn something from it. I know some people may have found the ending a bit predictable, but i didn't even see it coming. I couldn't even get out of my seat. It gave me a sick feeling leaving the theatre. No other movie has done that to me before. But I loved it. The rest of the cast did a great job too, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Avery Brooks, Elliot Gould, and Ethan Suplee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma) But this movie belonged to Norton and hopefully he'll get his award for Best Actor. He deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PROVOCATIVE AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED MASTERPIECE","review":"THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF LONG, DETAILED REVIEWS WRITTEN FOR THIS FILM SO I AM GOING TO WRITE ONE THAT GETS STRAIGHT TO THE POINT- THIS FILM IS CHALLENGING, INSIGHTFUL AND EMOTIONALLY REWARDING AND NORTON'S PERFORMANCE IS AWESOME. FURLONG IS ALSO EXCELLENT. THE FILM WAS CRITICISED FOR STEREOTYPING BUT I THINK THAT \\"DANNY'S\\" BEAUTIFUL RESOLUTION MAKES HIM A VERY NON-TYPICAL KID AND \\"SWEENEY\\" IS NOT AN OVER-EXAGGERATED, UNREALISTIC CARICATURE AS I KNOW SOMEONE VERY MUCH LIKE HIM. THIS IS JUST A POWERFUL, SUPERBLY ACTED FILM AND WHILST IT MAY HAVE SOME FLAWS IN ITS PRESENTATION, THE MESSAGE IS AN IMPORTANT AND PAINFULLY RELEVANT ONE. DON'T MISS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, daring, powerful","review":"This film is a gripping account of racism in modern America. The character of Derek is brilliantly written and developed.

I can't say anything new except for watch the color imagery that is compared in the opening scene and the final scene. You will see what I am referring to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Times may change but people never do","review":"I think that this movie showed a great example of how much prejudice and violence exists in our world and how it always will. Although Edward Norton's character (Derek Vineyard) saw the error of his ways, he's still only one person and he cannot change everyone's views. It's revolting that there is so much prejudice and a shame that even when people seemed to have learned their lesson that there are things that were set in motion that could not be stopped such as the death of Derek's younger brother Danny. I hope that the people that saw \\"American History X\\" got something out of it and have been influenced to help change the prejudice that they live with everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is too short for hate","review":"Hate... Hate and love are the two most powerful emotions in the world. The two of these emotions can be taken too extremes, and when they do, very powerful events can happen. In American History X, the feeling of hate is overwhelming. Derrick radiates this hate to all that surrounds him. He holds this rage inside, and lets it consume his life. He is so blinded by his hate that he does not take the time to see all sides of the story. The death of his father just seemed to justify thoughts that were already implanted in his head. American History X, shows this powerful emotion of hate like no other movie has been able to do. The reality and no nonsense presentation of the movie are what touches each person so deeply. To capture the essence of hate is a very powerful thing. The movie was able to capture the idea that hate can take over and run your life. You become blind to what you are actually doing, and become desensitized to all other human emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"prejudice? think again...","review":"This movie made me realize how strong hate can be. Edward Norton does an excellent job of making this movie real to everyone's life. The idea that anyone could watch this and not walk away with a changed attitude amazes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I have used a Labtec microphone with my laptop for quite some time, and with good success. The microphone is decently built, and the quality of the captured audio is excellent.On the other hand, this Gamimg Set product from Labtec is a real disappointment.

But, you never get to appreciate the cd fully because the songs seem like they're cut-off in the middle and and the sound quality is a little too staticky to fully appreciate these great Jazz musicians-and Max Roach's drums sound like he's a kid (a musical genius kid) playing on a pile of books with a couple of pencils. But, if you can past the noise and the truncated tunes and appreciate jazz masters recorded live in a vintage show, then buy this cd and imagine that it's 1948 and it's raining-maybe hailing and you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fr. Manning preaches lies - don't be one of the deceived!!!!!","review":"Fr. Brennan Manning is a Franciscan priest who attempted to marry without being dispensed from his vow of celibacy in 1982. He has since peddled a false gospel that is built around the idea that God's pardon is unconditional - a euphemism for saying that you can be forgiven for your sins without repenting and amending your life. This is a lie, and a defense mechanism Fr. Manning has evolved to assuage his guilty conscience. If you really want to seek the Mercy of God, I suggest you read \\"Divine Mercy in my soul\\", the diary of St. Faustina, avaulable here on Amazon.com. God's Mercy is endless, but you cannot be pardoned if you are not sorry; Fr. Manning's false gospel will do you no more spiritual good than it has done him.

It will record in decent quality (I used it to record kids shows, not really trying to get great recording) but it's tricky and hard to figure out. The remote is small and the buttons are small. Not very easy to use.My big beef with this is that I can't play half the movies I buy. I have bought at least 3 dvds that I can't play. The machine reads \\"no disk\\". I keep thinking maybe I need to find some sort of code, but haven't found anything yet. None of the dvd's I've purchased are bootlegs, so I don't get it. My playstation 2 will play it, but this won't.If I had paid for it, I'd have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematical at best","review":"I had a myriad of problems with this unit, including things as basic as setting the clock(easy? try and find it without the manual). It would not accept DVD Rw disks if they had ever been \\"touched\\" by another recorder(even if blank). It would not always replay the very recorded disks that it itself had made. It would occasionally miss a recording date and have the next day scheduled, as if today(for some odd reason) just didn't warrant a recording. Most of all, it had a strange logic to its controls and internal commands, neither logical nor similar to the rest of the industry, which has pretty much standardized procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be tempted by the price","review":"Bottom line - don't waste your money or your time.This is the worst item I have purchased. The remote layout should be warning enough. Even though mine worked out of the box (which according to many reviews means I was lucky) my DVR 1600 soon stopped recognizing the same brand of DVD+RW that worked initially. Changing DVD+RW brands didn't help. Updating the firmware (front & back end) didn't work.

This one is 10 times worser.I got this DVD recorder during the holidays. I thought I was excited, Turn out I wasn't. The DVD player itself was made quickly and cheaply. The remote was puny and has rubber keys. and the recorder itself wouldn't take all of the blank DVDs I put in (It would only take the sample disc that came with it). Just one advice for you, DON'T BUY THIS RECORDER! Cyber-Home went out of business last year, so don't expect any more news out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I've owned this unit for over a year and a half and it is junk. The DVD's it records all freeze momentarily during playback in other high-quality DVD players. It has also started freezing up during playback of store bought DVD movies. I'm talking a complete freeze. Even the clock on my unit GAINS 5 minutes each MONTH! Always having to reset it.

At the end of recording maybe 80% of the time you'll have a disk you can watch. 80% of the time isn't good enough for me. I can get an ulcer worrying whether what I'm recording off the TV tuner will work or not!!! I bought a DVD Recorder as a step up from a VCR.This company was raided because they refused to pay copyright to Panasonic---NOT because they are selling junk that doesn't work.

You'd be lucky to ever get to the end of the recording without getting a bad disc or disc error message, which means you have to dump your dvd and start from scratch.

Since there are only play/pause, eject, record, and standby/on controls on the front of the unit, if you lose the OEM remote you can no longer navigate menus or skip ahead/back. This is constantly a real pain in our family since we habitually lose the small remote that came with the unit and cannot use the other three universal remotes to control it.Also, we have had problems recording DVDs - sometimes it messes up during formatting the disk and leaves in unusable -- sometimes we record a disc-full of programs only to find that they are unplayable later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Quest Animal Matching","review":"This is an excellent and fun game for my 2 1/2 year old, my husband, and me to play. It is also a game that I haven't grown tired of (which is important...as I'm sure you'll agree). This game reinforces vocabulary (24 different animals), taking turns, and consentration (you must pay attention to be able to make a match). I would recommend this game for young children.

It leaks, the suction's terrible and it overpumps making a loud annoying noise (just what you want at work). I could also only pump about 1 oz when I'm usually able to get 3 or 4.

It is a great product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I purchased this pump when I went back to work so I could remain breastfeeding.

Three months of pumping with the Isis got me spoiled and I will never reccomend anything but Isis from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"I had been using the Avent Isis but it had cracked, the only one available at the store was this one. I was experienced at nursing/breast pumping for 7 MONTHS so this is experience here.This pump LEAKS - I would pump 4 ounces and 4 would be in the sink, it is hard to use and horrid. It would cause someone NEW to the whole experience to quit. A product that would undermine a Mom's nursing and a babes HEALTHY development!I emailed Avent - they sent me a replacement part for free & a free sippy cup too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP","review":"This pump is a waste of money. It leaks badly, and makes pumping really hard work. Plus it broke after 6 weeks, and the Evenflow customer care people could care less. Their remedy for a broken pump is to send you a new instruction booklet!I bought the AVENT ISIS - and it's a joy to use. Save yourself the money and time and just get the avent pump - it's a better pump and well worth the extra $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pump EVER","review":"I would highly reccommend putting out the money for a medela or better brand breastpump. I thought that I was getting a bargain when I picked this breastpump up on sale. I figured it would be great since I planned on pumping only once in a while. Unfortunatley my son had a poor latch on. I was able to use this pump twice, and both times I wore more breast milk then what was in the bottle. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than electric, but not nearly as good at Isis!","review":"I gave this pump 2 stars only because it produced more milk output than the electic doulble breast pump I used, but it definitely leaks and is not nearly as comfortable nor produces as much milk output as the Isis Manual Breast Pump. Spend the extra money and by the Isis, you will save yourself time, frustration and money in the long run! I even got this pump on sale and it still wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky pump","review":"I bought this pump as my second evenflo pump. My first one was the electric one(that just quit working after 3 uses). This pump has failed me several times. It leaks around the top when not held in the EXACT way it says. After having problems with this pump and my other evenflo pump I called the 1-800 number on the box and got a recording 5 different times telling me that they were experiencing \\"high call volume\\" and could I try my call again at a later date. I was then disconnected. I wouldn't recommend this pump to anyone. If you are deciding on breastfeeding and are going back to work after your maternity leave, I highly suggest investing in a better pump.

Don't be affraid to spend the extra money once instead of three times like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS PUMP","review":"When I went back to work, I used the Avent ISIS pump and have had great success w/ it.

The original batteries lasted 18 and 26 month respectively. The Energizer batteries have a slightly higher capacity than the originals, but as I have only been using them since September 14 2010, they have not had time to prove themselves.The price at the time, was $14.78 each, which was cheaper than a lot of sellers I looked at for this branded battery. Delivery was 4 days to Fayetteville NC, quicker than the estimated time of six to nine days. So far, the hand sets have been performing very well with these batteries, lasting well before the need to recharge, and providing enough power to keep in contact with the base unit from the top end of the back yard, 320 feet away, in amongst the Longleaf Pine trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job well","review":"This clip does its intended job very well.

When the chef's knife, of my set, broke (the handle cracked), and I saw this price, I thought, OMG how expensive. Since it is the knife I use most often I chose to purchase it based on its brand and the reviews. I am so glad I did!I've only used it several times so far, but it is by far the best knife I've ever owned.

Out of all the ballroom competition movies out there, this one is the least entertaining. \\"Shall We Dance\\" is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tortilla Chips without the Chile Sauce","review":"If you're looking for a movie that is hot and sexy with lots of dancing - give this one a miss. As an avid Salsa fan I could not wait to see this but I was hugely disappointed. Saying it started slow would be an understatement, it crawled painfully along on it's belly. The dancing came in fits and bursts, there was no 'big dance moment'. I felt like I was being teased right the way through, I kept thinking \\"it's going to start now, it's going to start now\\". Way to much emphasis was given to the love story (which was ashamedly unoriginal) and not enough to the dancing (which was average when there was any). If Chayanne hadn't been such a gorgeous specimen of a human being I would have bailed out after half an hour. I felt his full potential was not shown(innocent smile), I'm certain he had a hot tortilla lurking in there somewhere, if only he had given us a bite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it like the plague.","review":"This movie was horrible. After reading some of the good reviews I tried to watch it but had to turn it off. The plot is a little simplistic, but I don't mind that; it's the astounding gaps in the storyline that made this movie ridiculous to watch. The Cuban man who can't dance professionally, just with his heart, starts off cleaning floors, then all of a sudden is doing ballet, and with absolutely no transition is in a dance contest in Las Vegas. Literally, that's not a summary, that's how it went. Horrible production and editing. Acting not bad, and the 3 minutes of dancing in 2 hours was decent; but not as good as any other dance movie out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Dance Movie","review":"If you like dancing, particularly salsa, you'll love this movie.

Vanessa Williams looks incredible in this movie and her partner Chayanne looks so handsome too. I absolutely enjoyed the part where Ruby and Rafael go to the Salsa Club TITON and Dance together so wonderfully, it was so much fun to watch them together. Rafael was such a gentleman to her when he walked with her back to her apartment. My favorite part of the film was that WHITE HOT love scene!!! I love the way he touches her and kisses her, I definitely would've love to see them make passionate love to each other full on nudity and everything. Vanessa looked stunning in her costume and makeup in the dance sequences plus I definitely want a Rafael of my own and I'm an Dark Chocolate African-American female. Too bad Vanessa and Chayanne can't get together in real life because they would be beautiful together. I would like to see another movie similar to this from Williams and Chayanne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Cliche","review":"I was invited by my friend's mom and sister to watch this movie. To be polite, I had no choice but to sit down and watch the whole thing and pretend that I enjoyed it. It might be great for people who like dancing movies, but to me, every minute of it was torture.You can guess what happens. Just like in every other dance movie that has ever been made, an unlikely dance couple is thrust into each other's arms. They must defy all odds and learn how to dance like the wind and somehow achieve glory in some \\"highly touted\\" dance competition. Woopty do.Guys, if you are thinking about renting a chick flick to impress your significant other and are considering \\"Dance with Me,\\" let me tell you, this one should definitely be avoided. There are other \\"light romantic comedies\\" out there that are much more bearable than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was so awesome and breathtaking.","review":"I loved this movie.

Skilled acting, a fairly decent script, enough tension between the characters to keep the film moving along nicely, and plenty of character acters for spice kept me interested. The music was a delight, particularly in the Cuban bar scenes. Wow! This film highlights what dancing is all about: Fun! This is a \\"chick flick\\" that guys will like, too.

I dug this one up &.....Good Lord! If all Stine's books are like this one, these are the kind of books you will deny ever reading when you get older. I wondered how he could write 10 books a year; now I know. This guy's a joke &, evidently, he knows it. It sounds like a junior high student wrote this. I know these are teen books but that doesn't give a writer the right to not give his work the proper attention. Even teenagers have more vocabulary than these characters do.

One worrying finding: the author is extremely careless for a scientist in his interpretation of inheritance of IQ and the work of Sir Cyril Burt. It is reasonably clear now that the vicious attack on Burt was politically motivated. Provided that very substantial inheritance of IQ is now beyond technical dispute, author's undocumented blatant denial is of not much worth. My concern that when I see such an apparent flaw in argument on the topic of my knowledge, it raises unnecessary doubts about the book as a whole. Hopefully, such attitude is only a formal pledge of allegiance to \\"anti-racist\\" dogs who currently control the MSM."},{"rating":"1","title":"read-and smell- before you buy","review":"as far as blood types go he is a waste of money. the only good survey in his book is the one that says native americans have a population of 98 percent blood type 'o'. apart from this figure he groups blood types not on racial characteristics but on continent. logically the remaining blood statistics are inconclusive. he has a little information on blood types and languages and dna, but it's all been geared to correspond to his \\"Outstanding\\" theories. as far as honesty goes i seriously doubt all people who claim to be able to understand other languages merely by their own one. eg. an italian claiming to understand portugese and spainsh merely by knowing italian, or someone claiming to be able to read greek from knowing cyrillic. this overpriced book wouldn't be worth a review, only most of the other reviews praise it. another thing is the ink and paper print quality. if you get a whiff of this book's smelly pages, that may be enough to dissuade you from buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"This book was definetely biased and dumbed down. Some of the information was factual and helpful, but I was hoping for a more balanced and serious discussion on the topic. Coming from a scientific backround, I definitely felt like I was being talked down to and lectured at.Also, I didn't see anywhere where it mentions the fact that several vaccines (including chicken pox, and MMR) are produced using aborted fetuses, which is something I came across on the Christian Medical and Dental Association website. This may not be of concern for some audiences, but it certainly was for me, and I think all people should know about this, and the book should mention it if it wants to be considered an informative text for parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID: very biased and one-sided","review":"Very biased information, conclusions that go against most studies and common sense.

The book clearly outlines why immunizations are an important part of a child's life. I liked the fact that it clearly and simply explains what each disease is that a vaccine can protect against. Descriptions are given about what happens to kids that are not properly immunized - the stories are horrible. I would never want my child to expereice such ills. I also liked the parts in the book that talk about saftey issues. As a new parent I want to do what is best for my child - not put her at risk.

The overall sound has changed considerably from previous releases - mainly the lack of piano, keyboard, harmonica, and sampling. Some THE THE fans will be disappointed by this. Although I miss the diversity of sound that I am accustomed to, NakedSelf manages to maintain complexity in its songs with the guitar and guitar effects. Perhaps it is the 7 years of expectation, but NakedSelf left me wanting more. I found Voidy Numbness a bit simple, and Salt Water too loud. Swine Fever and Global Eyes are the only songs on the album that are \\"in your face\\" political. Mind Bomb fans will like these songs in particular as did I. The rest of the songs carried the album for me especially Boiling Point which I consider to be pure and timeless THE THE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of The The... esp. Soul Catcher","review":"I listen to this The The album more than any other in my collection - The The's most poignant and melancholic I believe, esp. Soul Catcher. Highly recommended and incorrectly ignored by the record label. I'm hoping The The has more in store for us with such a strong effort here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredself","review":"I guess i am the only one who have negative feelings about the album. I too have waited for 7 years and Nakedself isn't the album I had been expecting. Matt Johnsonn is of course a genius, but this album doesn't add anything new to his genius. The lyrics are so simple..what happened to the man who wrote Infected and Mind Bomb? Salt Water, Voidy Numbness don't feel like The The,they just feel like any other industrial rock band.I believe that Mind Bomb was the peak moment of this genius. Apart from other albums, this album can be regarded as pretty good. But if it weren't The The, I wouldn't buy it. I wouldn't even download it for free. I don't know if i am being too rude here, but as a person who have been listening to The The more than 10 years, I can say Nakedself can be forgotten for another 7 years. Don't mention Hanky Panky..i won't say a single thing about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY good, 'The The' album..","review":"This is VERY good.

Worse off, they seemed to attract the mice (due to the peanut butter bait we used) but the mice simply chewed through the top to eat the bait last night.

We're going to the store to buy traditional mouse traps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective at all","review":"I put one out with peanut butter & another out with cheese. Got nothing for a week.

Great concept, but horrible results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"Since we built our house in the middle of a field, it makes sense that mice would try to make themselves at home here. These traps did nothing to fix our mice problem.I followed directions but never saw any evidence the mice were at all interested in these, although occasionally other traps would catch them. What worked best was the triangular shaped mouse poison boxes, but I'm not a fan of using those.Next time we have a mouse problem, I plan to try either the Mice Cube or a similar hinged-door type trap. I won't try these again, though. For us, they were a total waste of money. Maybe the picture of the dead mouse on the trap scared the mice away?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!","review":"I bought this product after seeing one mouse in my kitchen. I placed three of them around my house. After one month I had to throw them all away as the mouse had figured out how to get the bait out of them and remain alive. I purchased the Scott Ortho traps with the same no view feature and within 24 hours caught the little pest. I put one out with cheese and one with peanut butter and the PB was the bait that worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex, expensive, not sure it even works","review":"I bought two of the no-view, no-touch, at the same time I bought two \\"regular\\" mouse traps.

Yeah, they do not work, anyway for me. Didn't catch any mice at all. Had to use other styles - snap traps sat right near them and then I caught the mice.

Oh well, lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"It works. These traps caught 2 mice for me. But you need to use peanut butter. I orginally used some artificial mouse bait that claims to be better than peanut butter and cheese, but it didn't work. I literally sat in the kitchen and watch the mice ran over these traps. So I decided to try again using peanut butter, and it worked. One trap caught a mouse within a hour. What I did, in addition to putting peanut butter in the center compartment under the tape, was to put a little bit around the side opening. (I did that with the artificial mouse bait too, but that didn't work at all.) Note that these traps do not kill the mouse. For the one trap where a mouse was caught within an hour, I poked around the trap for a while, and could hear the mouse moving around. Also, I left around for a few minutes while I finished doing my chore, and I could hear the mouse making a crying noise inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally watched a mouse go in and out","review":"I bought these for the obvious reason. I had a towel hanging over a hamper and a mouse climbed up and was trapped in the hamper. Luckily the hamper was clean so I just put the trap down in so it would get caught. I watched the mouse go in and out eating the peanut butter. I finally got a broom and hit it hard enough to spring the trap and kill the mouse. So, I have the other one set. Let's see how it goes. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, mice can't even get in when they want to!","review":"I was forced to buy these as the other kind I was looking for that were working were out of stock, got these in the meantime.

At first I used peanut butter like the directions mentioned. Then, after about a week of not catching anything, I decided to change it to dried fruit (the mice had gotten into a bag of dried apples just a few days before). A couple days later, I checked one of the traps to see if maybe it had gone off, but I couldn't see if it was still set, so I picked it up. I heard something rattle around inside and tilted and a mouse dropping fell out. The trap hadn't even gone off. I wouldn't recommend this trap at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money!","review":"I found a mouse problem in my house a few days ago and having a dog and a one year old in the house I wanted to find a safe alternative to wooden traps or poison. These seemed like a great idea at the store. I was wrong! I set these up a couple days ago with no results. Tonight I literally watched a mouse climb on top of the trap and sit there acting like it wasn't even interested in what is inside and like it was his little stool to stand on and mock me.

I'd probably pass out at the sight of a dead mouse. So I bought a dozen of these wonderful traps and set them out, baited, as instructed, with peanut butter, some with cheese. As of this day, I have not caught a single mouse. Somebody screwed up with this one and it was probably me for buying it in the first place. Remember, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"If you are thinking about buying the newer traps by D-Con----DON'T! When used precisely as directed, the rats outsmart the traps by turning the lightweight plastic trap over and chewing through the paper label where the food is stored in the food compartment of the trap. It was not a smart design. \\"No View, No Touch\\" is about as good as it gets. One would think turning the mouse trap clockwise as directed would place a hard surface under the food department to prevent rats by-passing the mouse's entrance.

The delivery was faster than promised by the dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entry DJ controller","review":"I bought this simply to make some basic mixes as well as play some casual parties with more control than a simple Itunes playlist. This has definitely worked well and suited my needs.I will point out that there is no headphone output on the controller, so you will need a usb soundcard or a special headphone splitter if you want to use your headphones while mixing. Also, the included Torq LE is very basic and lacks some features that more experienced DJs would want, therefore you will most definitely want to upgrade to a more advanced program.All in all though, this controller's functionality as an entry level item is great and has worked extremely well. The sliders and knobs are easy to use and it has an intuitive design. Worth the money if you are looking for a cheap way to test out mixing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Built To Last","review":"I bought this as an affordable controller when I first took on Ableton Live. One big reason why I liked it is that I like the feel of a cross-fader, and this one has it. The serious buzz kill came after I'd used it less than 10 times and the cross-fader went out. I usually like M Audio, but they way they built this one stinks. THE CROSS-FADER IS NOT REPLACEABLE!!! Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy a controller with a replaceable cross-fader, or if you use Ableton, look at the Novation Launchpad or the AKAI APC40."},{"rating":"1","title":"The samples are all in Stereo the CD is in MONO?","review":"I can truly understand why the music business is in the sad state that it in.

I liked \\"Just the Way You Are\\" a lot and couldn't wait to read the next one in the series. While I usually read a book every two days, this one took two WEEKS, and that was with trying to skip past the pages and pages and pages of overdone sexual fantasies (and finally experiences). Way too much sex; it got to be sickening. Had a hard time forcing myself to pick up the book.Unlike some of the reviews I've read, I did like the plot (for the most part), but it took too long to unfold... WAY too long. I've already ordered Book # 3 in the series, so I hope Miss Dodd redeems herself by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm exausted and it's the fault of this book!","review":"I usually read historicals but I read Christina Dodd's first contemporary and really liked it, so when I saw this was out I snatched it up! ARGH! I was up until 1:30 am (and I know this isn't late for a lot of you, but for me it's way too late). I loved Pepper. I was terrified for her.It's one of those books that make you wish you had a more exciting life, and glad that you don't at the same time. It's enough to make me quit reading historicals, because you never get this kind of excitement in historicals.This is a GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE!","review":"What a fun and charming book! I've always enjoyed Ms. Dodd's historicals and was doubly delighted when I found out she was dabbling in contemporaries last year. This is the second book in her Prescott family series. I liked Pepper just as much as I liked Hope in the first book. And Dan, an ex Special Forces guy, made for a yummy hero. I also liked the way she sprinkled some suspense into this book too.

The book contains many interesting stories and facts about how Newark, a city with substantial German and Jewish communities, responded to Naziism.

I guess you have to be a major disco fan to totally like this CD, and I'm not a major fan as I only like a few disco songs! All of the disco songs I like are on the Pure Disco CD's and though there are songs on the Pure Disco Vol.1 and Vol.2 CD's's that I don't like there are also a lot that I do like and I just prefer those CD's to this one so I would rate them a 3 and this CD a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY BAD","review":"I had to listen to this cd 3 times over,and i don't wish that upon anybody ever.But the worst songs on here are KC and the sunshine band's \\"Getdown Tonight\\"and \\"Disco Inferno\\".All of the Legion people liked it,but i didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me the trash can","review":"...Before i throw up on the floor.KC and the sushine band's \\"Get down tonight\\" is really bad.Second is \\"disco inferno\\".I had to listen to this it wasnt my cd.Take my advice-BEFORE YOU LISTEN TO THIS,HAVE SOMETHING TO THROW UP IN."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a Rental Video","review":"It's just him showing off and talking about himself, not very useful or worth your money.

First and foremost that the husband-wife relationship plays such a major role in raising children, and it showed in this book. The relationship between Rich and Sue is an admirable one, one that not is not so common after so many years of marriage. With that bond of love, they raised a house full of kids and later in life, were able to take on one more kid, very different from their own. They gave it 1000% and stuck with it through thick and thin. What they did for \\"Mike\\" is untouchable, precious and blessed. God Bless the Miniters and the best of luck to \\"Mike\\" in his future endeavors to become a chef.........This book more than once will put a lump in your throat and a tear or two in your eye...To learn more about children, about sacrifices, about life, you must read this beautiful story !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any human being !!","review":"This book is not only for those who are adopting or work with disturbed children, but it can serve as a valuable lesson for those who have never been in these situations. It is necessary to know that trouble derives from the early years of a child's life and how important it is to show affection, trust and caring to children at all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must if planning to adopt a special needs child","review":"This book is a must read for all those involved with adoptive special needs children. Whether you are a pre-adoptive parent, a post-adoptive parent or a professional. It is straight forward and very realistic. I couldn't put it down. My child has gone through the exact same cycles. When this book was condensed in the Reader's Digest in November, 1997, it caused me to keep on working with my child who was going in and out of crisis. As a parent of an adoptive boy, I can say that if anything is \\"normal\\" about these kids, it is the ups and downs and lack of trust written in this book. Professionals please read and take note to listen to the parents. Richard Minitor, thanks for writing this informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful display of love and determination","review":"How many broken windows and hearts can one family endure? Obviously for the Miniter's there is no finite answer to that! What a family! I picked this book without having any clue of what it was about. Saw the jacket, the title caught my eye and that was all it took. I was drawn in almost immediately. I am a 20-something woman, that is not married, has no children and is not adopted. I have not encountered many, if any, foster children and I still found this book to be an incredibly moving story. To Richard and Sue and the entire family- you have most certainly earned my respect and admiration. If only we could all be as patient, understanding and as loving as you are! What a great testimony to the good in the world- thank you for sharing your story. I truly hope that you encounter only good fortune in the future, no one family deserves it more than you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Things I Want Most","review":"This is an interesting story of one families struggles to help a foster child feel loved and accepted by their family.

One can feel Swami Muktananda's love coming from the words he has written, a must read. I like the clarity and simplicity, this book is direct and to the point.Every word is meaningful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd book, but interesting in retrospect","review":"This is a difficult, convoluted read... but it is more fascinating to read at this point, with Muktananda having been exposed as a false guru, to better see the development of and maintenance of the guru image, and how devotion can become a cult.The inability of SYDA members to separate themselves from the unethical processes of this cult, even after Muktananda was revealed, has its root in the teachings as presented here. You can really see the motivations and methods employed from the very beginning. Truly fascinating in that respect.A true guru will never create dependence in a student. That's the best guide to tell true from false. It is however very interesting to read this autobiography with active hindsight."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"It is difficult to put into words what is contaned within this book, many who have read it, myself included, find it more of an experince, than just a read. A subject that can often be laborious to comprehend, Muktananda weaves into a colorful, amazing, stimulating and often unbelievably true tale. I found myself mesmerized and willing to set the book down only when I was so saturated with his energy that I would pass out. A deffinate recommend and a great gift to anyone who is on a spiritual path.."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Account","review":"This book is extraordinary in that in gives a first-hand account of the journey of spiritual awakening and meditation that leads to Self-realization. Muktananda writes from both the perspectives of having been a disciple of an enlightened Master and as a Guru who has much to teach sincere aspirants on the inner path. His words carry the conviction of actual experience; this is not a theortical treatise on the ultimate meaning of life and human potential. It is rather a testament to what happens when the power of grace and the longing of a true seeker meet. The intention of this book is not to inspire a belief about the enlightened state of Muktananda; but rather to impart a description of essential truth to the reader which is meant to be verified by actual experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nugget of Gold","review":"Althought this album cost less than the rest I say its the best!

His biographies are prime examples of the bowdlerization of history, cleaned up and skewed to fit the popular prejudices of their time. In particular, Sparks demonized Arnold, epitomizing Shakespeare's line, \\"The evil that men do lives on after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\\" This book is useful only as an example of the kind of biased history that it took to manufacture a national patriotic mythology for an infant nation nearly two centuries ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Heaven bless the people who took the time to recommend this book. I bought it right after booking my trip and was glad that I did. Having never really travelled before this book made my solo trip to London a rewarding and wonderful experience. I was able to find all of the things that I'd always wanted to see and a few things that I would never have found on my own. I carried it with me constantly and found myself feeling very comfortable getting around. I advise marking the pages of what you want to see before you leave and perhaps making a list. Take the book with you at all times and make full use of the maps it provides. I saw more of the city than I'd ever imagined and had a wonderful time doing it. I firmly believe that without this book my trip wouldn't have been nearly so successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Access guides are great but shoud be updated!","review":"I have used \\"Access\\" city guides for many years and have found them to be excellent! They are easy to understand with lots of information that is quite useful. In addition, they are a lightweight and handy size. Unfortunately, they are not updated often, in fact I just purchased \\"Access London\\" eighth edition ( I have all of the previous editions) and have found it to be a repeat of the previous two editions. Much of the guide is out of date. This is disappointing,as I have come to rely on \\"Access\\" guides to plan trips. I now will have to use a more current guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and Out of Date","review":"Though this series embodies a clever concept, both the current edition (the 7th) and the previous one contain many inaccuracies, especially the inclusion of places that have changed dramatically or that are simply no longer there. While the format is convenient for having at hand while walking around the city, I cannot recommend using this book for planning. Moreover, the concept and presentation around which this series is based has been significantly improved upon by the DK-Publishing Eyewitness Travel Guides series.If you intend to walk around London and want an accurate guide that orients you and points out the essential and interesting sites, the Eyewitness Travel Guides series is a much better bet. If you are really looking for a street-by-street, house-by-house listing of everything there is, the Access series is useful--but be sure to check everything that matters to you with another source before departing to make sure it really is there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a useful guide book","review":"We used Access London on our Honeymoon in 2000, and it was invaluable. It helped us find everything we wanted to visit, especially since we studied it beforehand, and marked all the places that were interesting. The maps seemed fine, and we liked the way we could look at the numbered list and find the items on the maps. The color coding was very helpful, and we always had our copy with us wherever we went.We recommend this book, and the Paris one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy these sunglasses","review":"I bought Uvex Shooter Sport sunglasses two months ago.

A new ice age decends upon the planet and creates social and economical upheaval. In addition, many new species are beginning to emerge and punctuated equilibrium theory is demonstrated in the new beasts evolving to cope with the enviromental strains presented by the growing cold. Humans also undergo sudden evolutionary changes and as these strange, genetically different children are born our society seeks to contain what they see as a threat. Weber weaves sound biological theory, scientific speculation, and social and polical issues into an entertaining look at human nature at its best and at its worst. I enjoyed this very much.

These detailed black-and-white engravings give an excellent overview of cutting-edge French fashion for women and children from 1860 through 1914. Since French fashion set the style for the rest of Europe and North America, it's a good sourcebook for them too.The reader has to be careful. These are fashion plates, and the models are impossibly proportioned and impossibly elegant. But the details are invaluable.Descriptions of the images are brief and perfunctory, presumably translated from the original French.This book covers a long period and rather gallops along. There are fashions for nearly every year, but no one year is gone into in a lot of detail. For a general impression of the changes in French fashion between 1860 and 1914, it is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love them","review":"I am teaching our two kids caligraphy and not having to dip the pen in ink is saving a messy step and the process is less daunting.

Unfortunately, the classic literature of sociology isn't emphasized enough in today's educational institutions. Students are entering the real world without the foundation of social prophets and coming up with their own ideas of \\"what the world is coming to,\\" and taking credit for ideology that has long been debated and written down by masterminds such as Weber. Pay attention! What is this book really about? This is a revolutionary work discussing critically the causes and effects of sociological chance, and how the sociology of religion has changed meaning because of the philosophy we now base our ideas on. Anyone interested in postmodern theory, the iron cage of bureaucracy, rationalization, and even symbolic interactionism should read this before continuing to literature of modern sociological thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version.","review":"It's bootleg, simply put.

Go with a real publisher","review":"This version ofThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism(with stacks of $100 bills on the cover) is one to avoid. As the reviewers from October 7, 2011 and October 15, 2011 have noted, there are many problems with this edition. First, and most severe, is that the end note superscripts are full sized. This means that every line with an end note has extra space above it, which throws off all of the spacing on the page. It looks terrible! How could anyone possibly have published this book? Second, there isn't a publisher listed. No city, no year, no company. Further, there is a notice that \\"No part of this book may be reproduced... \\" etc. However, this text is in the public domain, so that statement is false. Copy/reproduce whatever you want. There's no copyright. This looks like a self-published book that was copied from the online HTML version and passed off as a quality publishing. Avoid it.

There are misspelled words, missing words, typos, and random underlined terms that appear to have once been hyperlinks, suggesting that this is simply an essay taken off of the web. The citations are improperly formatted. There's no publisher information inside, just a warning against reproducing any section of the text (ironic, since it seems highly probable that this was itself copied from someone else's work). The cover is also super-pixellated. While the price is sort of low, I would recommend getting a different copy from a legitimate publisher - this one is an embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic work, but avoid this edition!","review":"The Renaissance Classics version is absolutely ridden with typos and other formatting errors.

Mistakes of every kind in the print (for example, at the very first page Max Weber's name is not in capitals). Notes bigger than the text.

This edition is definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for students of Social Science","review":"This book turns Marx on his head in that Marx regarded religion an ideology reflecting classes, Weber seems to be showing that capitalism itself was produced not by economic forces but by the influences of religious ideas. The drive of puritans to work out anxiety over their salvation or damnation, which was left in doubt by the theological doctrine of predestination. The predestined beliefs of the Protestants encouraged capitalism. Weber uses this to describe why capitalism emerged in the western world.

I just lost my beloved pit bull mix to osteosarcoma and after reading in this book for the third time the implication that people who get too emotionally attached to their pets are somehow less than mentally healthy, it was just too much to take. I happen to love my pets. More than a lot of humans I know. Pets don't judge, they are always there for you and never let you down. So I'm crazy because of this? Or less than what the author deems 'normal'?? That's a ridiculous assumption.

I mixed it better just by shaking it. The color chart is good for those who are just learning about mixing colors.

I choose this one because the title looked interesting, to my pleasure the whole book was also interesting. The author has a great sense of humor, I guess you have to when you've worked in education any length of time. She uses that humor to address many of the day-to-day situations teachers and administrative staff must deal with. Having worked in Early Childhood Education for a number of years, I found myself wishing I had read the book sooner. To my amusement/horror I discovered I too had been one of the \\"crazy parents\\" once, when calling my daughters school, and the principal had implemented one of the very strategies in the book on ME!

Overall I was disappointed that so much of it was recycled from her stand up shows. If she is going to expect people to lay down money for a book, the least she could do is come up with some new material. As it is, the book is barely 200 pages and a good number of them are blank except for a section number. Her rants on politics were not funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Many people have said that this book has great material but it lacks Wanda Sykes hilarous voice. I disagree. This book, to me, proves that it's not just how she says her jokes that make them funny. There are times of this book that you wont believe what your reading, such as the part where she says that she doesnt care if you actually read the book because she already has your money. My biggest complaint is that when I was reading some parts of this book, I realized that I had already heard the same exact jokes somewhere else: the Toung Untied DVD. Thats the only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5. If you havent seen the DVD, it's very funny material. If you have, you should still read this because [I think] it's not all used material."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I agree with the majority of what Sykes writes...","review":"While I agree with the majority of the viewpoints in Ms. Sykes book, it gets tiresome.

This is an example of a weak attempt to mix the two. I would agree with another reviewer that one reason this book falls flat is because you have to hear Wanda's high-pitched whine for her comedy to work as opposed to seeing it in print. In cold print, this just comes off as a bunch of mean-spirited, unfunny, profane rants akin to what you could hear from a barroom or barbershop (or in this case, beauty parlor) loudmouth on paper. the literary equivalent ot \\"Soul Plane.\\" Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bust a gut","review":"I found this book on an airplane and could not put it down.

In the case of YEAH , I SAID IT ; gets so boring after a few pages into the book .The book is a lot of what she is done in her stand ups, little stories about politics, celebrities and everyday stuff.

To a large extent, the book tries to speak about general principles of design. As opposed to tying the knowledge to a given fab process or a current linewidth.The emphasis is on CMOS design. Which is fair, since this is the most common digital technology in use. Though earlier pMOS and nMOS efforts also get a mention, along with BiCMOS, where the latter is perhaps most useful in high speed applications.At the systems level, you get a good discussion of such items as using a clock to synchronise actions across a chip. Alternate circuit ideas are also covered.

It is too dumb beyond belief. The story line is like some crappy saturday filler cartoons for mongoloid children. Spare me, please, and don't get this game. I was so jacked for it and then after playing it felt like I'd been taken for a ride.....over the rainbow of stupidity to land in the nation of bland, repetitive god-awful ideas allowed to see the light of day.

No MEDKITS to save the day, and no lives.HAIL rainbow six vegas!, Ghost recon AW!, GEARS OF WAR!, and all the real tactical shooters (Americas Army on the PC is another one of those).This game is great for pure action lovers, but if you like tactics, dont even rent it.(just my humble opinion anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"Got this game to play with online friends. Was not disappointed, graphics are great and the game is fun. Controls need getting used to but learned in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I didnt get very far in the game because I enjoy COD a bit,more I will play more and hopefully it gets better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby of a game","review":"My family (dad and bro) really enjoy this game. While not too complex in story line the graphics are good and the twist for thermal energy is unique. I've read the reviews that gave this game 1 stars, and their main complaint is the thermal energy. Frankly, this game was easy enough on normal not to worry too much about thermal, and I thought it really made this game special. Although needing this thermal in volcanoes or indoors doesn't make too much sense, it does when you're out there in the freezing cold; you need something to keep you warm! Anyway, I enjoyed this game, and the only real complaints are the story line and cheesy cut scenes. Other than that, if you like 3rd person shooters and a nice game to play, this is your pick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I usually live for games like this ... but this game ... B-O-R-I-N-G. It is the same thing over and over again. It really has no redeming values. After the first 5 min ... it just goes downhill. The weapons suck, the enemies are always the same ... it really was no fun and a waste of money. I am going back to playing Gears of War for the 1,000th time ... and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont even come within 20 feet of this mess","review":"This game may have been the biggest let down of the year. Everyone was hyped up for it, but the story line makes no sense at all, and the whole time your playing the game you have to run around like in mario 64 collecting coins, but this time they are little things called thermal energy to keep you warm, but if you dont collect them, your thermal meter ends up running out and you die. Its honestly retarded, whoever made this game must have been extremly high while creating it, because its probably one of the worst games i have ever played. When your fighting a boss, you have to worry about your stupid thermal energy meter and try to run around collecting the little red things, while fighting the boss is already a hastle. All in all, i would say this game deserves no starts, unfortunately amazon made me give it at least one star. Dont rent it, dont buy it, and dont even play it at Best Buy if they have it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capcom fails horribly","review":"This was probobly one of the worst games ever made. The storyline makes no sense and is just so bland and boring that can not seem to keep my attention for more then two minutes. As for the stupid thermal energy thing goes, what is up with that. It makes no sense and half the time you die trying to keep up your thermal energy while also having to fight. I wish I could get my money back and the 2 hours of my life that I spent on this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I did have high expectations of the game and most of it was was to my liking...The story line was confusing, but does come together at the end...

Wrong. \\"A Flower is a Lovesome Thing\\" shows a riskier, more experimental side of the Trio and the results are entrancing. My only critique of the album is that Vince takes center stage and the rest of the Trio is purely background, but hey, it is the \\"Vince Guaraldi Trio\\" after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Guraldi, one of his bests 4 1/2 stars","review":"This is a very mature album from the man who is most famous from his lively, melodic interpretations of songs. On a flower is a lovesome thing the Guraldi trio shows a softer more traditional jazz side than on some of their more popular efforts. It seems as though this album was made slmost to prove the point that the Vince Guraldi trio could play standard jazz as well as other forms of music. The album strats off with the title track a flower is a ... which quietly sets the tone for this album. It like a rose delicate. Other standout cuts are the absolutely beautiful like a mighty rose,Autumn leaves and weepa willow for me. Overall this is a lovely, mature album from the trio. I thourougly enjoy it.

However, even though it's not filled with as much of their trademark \\"Bayou, meets Rock, meets rock-a-billy-meets country sound we've become accustomed to, it stretches and shows Fogerty's ability to write and sing with soul.Just listen to the soulful singing of (Wish I Could) Hideaway, or the Stax drenched sounds of Born To Move. Pendulum is a departure for sure, but a very tasteful and listenable departure. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a Creedence fan","review":"Simply listen to \\"It's Just a Thought.\\" Fogerty's a poet. I have lived by these words.This is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Creedence Classic!","review":"This is one of my favorite Creedence albums. Besides the great (as usual) songs, this album let's you hear how funky the rhythm section could get on songs like \\"Born To Move\\" and \\"Chameleon\\". And who played the cool organ on this album?The extras on the album are really not that interesting, but they are at the end so they don't intrude on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT-- and weird-- stuff","review":"CCR's 6th album was the only one on which John Fogerty wrote EVERY song. But maybe by this time he was over-working himself? Some cool stuff here: \\"Sailor's Lament\\" (real bouncy), \\"Chameleon\\" (with those horns, it sounds a bit like Motown or Stax!), \\"Born To Move\\" (ditto). There's also \\"Rude Awakening #2\\", an organ-based instro which definitely steps into the \\"progressive\\" mold (perhaps TOO far?). Amidst this are the outright CLASSICS, \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\\" (wonderfully covered years later by Bonnie Tyler) and \\"Hey Tonight\\" (funny, both of these were on the same 45!). I note the cover picture is dark, unlike their earlier ones-- and Tom Fogerty has an angry scowl on his face. How often these things reflect what went on behind the scenes! Tom left CCR right after this. Maybe the band would could have held together longer if they'd ALL just taken a nice vacation from all that hard work?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but still solid","review":"With \\"Pagan Baby\\" opening this album, CCR sort of misrepresents themselves. The tune is classic CCR. Think of the vitriol of \\"Fortunate Son\\" and the guitar frenetics of \\"Ramble Tamble.\\" Quite simply, the song, at nearly 6 1/2 minutes, rocks. But it does not at all pave the way for what follows. The rest of the album, though soulful and melodic, is J. Fogerty exploring other musical passions besides rockabilly and the \\"swamp rock\\" for which he had become known. The songs on Pendulum borrow their sensibilities from the Stax sound. There are horns and choirs and tight arrangements. It mostly works, but it is a very different sounding CCR than the band who released back to back to back albums, all classic, all near perfect, only two years prior.\\"Hey Tonight\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\\", both wonderful songs, were the hits from this collection. Not their best effort, but still a solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pendulum swung towards CCR's decline","review":"Creedence Clearwater Revival/ Pendulum: There are two HUGE hits on this album but the rest of the album is forgettable. It is a likeable album but it was clear that something was not working quite right in the band. Worth having just for \\"Have you ever seen the rain?\\" and \\"Hey Tonight\\". Four star release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"As a Creedence fan since 1968, I had previously bought Willy and The Poor Boys,Green River and Cosmos Factory. I could not believe I had overlooked this album. At the time of release I may have not enjoyed it being such a departure from previous Creedence albums but I have to say I found it to be outstanding. Some of Fogerty's experimentation is a little far-fetched but you have to appreciate that he was trying to reach beyond the bayou. Any serious Creedence fan should have this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TO VEGAS!","review":"Tripoly is a fantasic adult game, especially if your friends love gambling!

If you're a fan of their late 80's-present material and you don't like this record, don't bother with any other 70's material. Oh, you may want a greatest hits record for \\"Dream On\\", \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" but this is as solid as Aerosmith gets.

You won't find any of the sugar-coated, sell-out, mainstream geared crap that they've turned out in the 90's. This is the raw, rockin', and dangerous Aerosmith of the 70's. There is not a weak track on this gem. From the rocking bass-driven \\"Back In The Saddle\\", to the bluesy jive of \\"Last Child\\", the fast-paced and reckless \\"Rats In The Cellar\\", the environmentally conscious \\"Nobody's Fault\\", to the grandiose ballad \\"Home Tonight\\", etc., etc., etc., this album Rocks from start to finish. It is clear that so many bands that would come later were listening to this album way back when.

This is Aerosmith's crowning achievemnet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith's Best!","review":"This CD is exellent! \\"Back In The Saddle\\" is a great opening number with lots of fury. This is the best known song along with \\"Last Child\\" which has a classic riff and a funky vibe. \\"Rats In The Cellar\\" is next and is A-Smith's follow up to \\"Toys In The Attic\\". This is probably the band's fastest song along with \\"Eat The Rich\\" from Get A Grip. You have to remember other songs besides the hits. \\"Combination\\" is a cool song with great drums and \\"Sick As A Dog\\" plainly rocks out. This is probably the most sinister and dark album the band ever made. With a doubt it is the best until Pump. This album cannot be ignored--it simply has to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I consider this album Perfect. I give every song on here 5/5. Toys in the Attic is second to this album.

WHAT A SHOW! That's one I'll never ever forget. I was right down front against the stage. Tom Hamilton's bass was bone-shaking. After AD/DC's breath-taking performance, and when I assume music cannot get any louder, Aerosmith open their set with Back In The Saddle. Words cannot describe the sound and feeling of all those tube-amps cranked up.Suffice it to say that this album captures that live energy and dishes up what I think is their best album and one of the best rock guitar albums of all time.

After purchasing their efforts of the 90's like 'Get a grip', and 'Nine lives', I had felt like I had wasted enough money on Aerosmith albums.Then one day I found out that their 70's hay-days were ruined by taking too many drugs, but what I thought was even more impressive is that Steve Tyler and the boys actually wrote their own songs, instead of using a bus load of out-side help.This got me interested, so I took a chance, and purchased 'Rocks', and it's a fine album from start to finish.Stand-outs include \\"Back in the saddle\\", \\"Last child\\", \\"Combination\\" and \\"Home tonight\\", but the entire album is great.

On top of that, you have to run multiple batches because it won't make very much without getting all bogged down. I guess money can't buy a good popcorn popper.

There is a middle piece that has the heating element and stir mechanism and the cover. I really liked the design, however on the second use I plugged the middle piece into the base and broke the protective cover that keeps someone from sticking there fingers onto the power connectors. Seems like a bad design. The ability to separate pieces and wash them was appealing. Would not recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the popcorn?","review":"I received this popper as a Christmas gift. I was very excited until I tried to use it only to find that it popped about 10 kernels of corn and that was it!So I thought it must be the popcorn. I tried another new brand of popcorn and only got another disappointing performance; no kernels popped at all. I read and reread the directions as did my mother and my husband. It just didn't work. I'm really disappointed and wondering after reading all the mixed reviews if I should even try another Cuisinart. I love all my other Cuisinart products, what happened to this one?? I called the customer service number but only got a recording to try another number which gave me a recording concerning a phone call service????!!! I'll try to return the machine to Dillard's today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really excited to have gotten this as a gift.. The first 3 times I used it, everything turned out great and I loved the popcorn. I used 'popcorn oil' from the market. The 4th time I went to make popcorn (all within the same week) I went to lift the base of and the lever to one of the handles snapped. Well, it still worked, but I returned it to the store knowing that the other lever would most likely break as well and I wanted to get it back within the return policy time limits..Disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing standards","review":"This is a popcorn popper that doesn't pop more than a dozen or so batches before the heating element dies. Yes, a very simple piece of equipment is the major engineering flaw in this very expensive piece of junk. But that's not all--as other reviewers have noted, the heating tray has to be positioned just right in order to even get it \\"locked\\" onto the heating element in order for the darn thing to work at all. Then, of course, just when you finally think you've figured out how to make the fickle popper pop, the heating element breaks and you throw up your hands in disgust.What's the point of replacing the $65 piece of junk by paying another $10+ in shipping costs just to have the same thing happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"My wife and I were satisfied with the popcorn taste and overall were quite pleased...until one of the internal plastic parts broke and the oil pan would no longer sit on the base properly and heat up.

And of course the store where we bought it (Linens and Things) is now out of business..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popper","review":"I purchased this black Cuisinart popper for my father-in-law since he liked ours so much.

By mid September, it was broken and unusable. After reading some reviews, we found we had the same problem as many other buyers. A small plastic part broke inside, now the plate would not sit right or heat. We looked up the \\"warranty\\" on the product. After reading, we found out that we were required to ship the popper back to them and send along another $10 for the return shipping. We could have bought another popper for all the money spent in shipping. We called the \\"customer service\\" department to discuss it with them and they were unwilling to work with us unless we sent the popper and money along. Way to stand behind your products Cuisinart!

Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed with this popper, as the popcorn it pops comes out very soggy and chewy. At first, I figured that I had some bad popcorn so I went out and purchased some new kernels. Then I thought that I just needed a better brand of popcorn so I purchased some different kernels but I still had the same outcome; soggy and chewy.It seemed to me that it wasn't letting enough of the steam out of the container so I sent Cuisinart multiple emails and never received any response. Frustrated, I returned the popper and purchased an inexpensive Back to Basics stove top popper that does a great job - no soggy and chewy popcorn.I was very disappointed with the lack of response from Cuisinart and I truly don't understand how they managed to put out a product that seems to be so obviously flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Broken plastic handle.

It is very good for making popcorn when watching ball games. It does better than Microwave in that it pops almost all the corn. The top is a very good container for the popped corn. We were also given a bowl to use for the popped corn. We do not use it as often as it is another item to clean. The unit heating element would not work after about three uses. I unpluged it and examined it closely and found a metal piece was holding the base off the contacts. I moved the unit around (shook) and dislodged the metal. It fell back into the bottom of the base.

Not wanting to needlessly put wear and tear on my ceramic stove, I purchased this popper.First time I used it the popcorn was tough to chew. The whole thing was a pain in the butt to clean also, I mean why make the bowl so intricate? It's like cleaning a bundt pan each time you want popcorn!I use powdered seasoning and it all goes on the sides of the bowl instead of the popcorn. I even tried transferring it to another bowl and putting the seasoning on that way - still went everywhere but the popcorn.I just popped some on the stove, and it's delish! This popper is going back.

Yes, you should turn the machine off and turn it over as soon as it stops popping - duh. Why would you let any delicate food sit in a hot pan once it has finished cooking? And I don't see how an adult can get burned turning it over, unless one is stupidly turning it over with the hot plate TOWARD oneself and actively pressing the hot plate against one's face or something.

Don't use low end corn. What I mean is, don't buy Jiffy Pop or Orville Redenbakker(sp) corn. Get something with quality. I bought kernals from a company called Fireworks Popcorn.2. Do not leave the red lid cover on the bowl when popping, this traps steam in and produces rubbery popcorn.3. Use more oil with the gourmet corn. Double it. I used EVOO.4. Don't use the plastic bowl as a bowl. It's lame. Just use it to cover during cooking and then dump your corn in a bowl. It's better.5. Don't break it.

I wouldn't assume they did, but that would guarantee the results listed.I can't imagine how the 800 unit ever made it into production with such an obvious fault, which leads me to believe Cuisinart quality is no longer a priority. Judging by the other reviews I'd say that they may have missed on the CPM-900 series as well, despite singly addressing the biggest issue.The \\"bucket included\\" idea is a nice one, but in the end these models simply encourage steam buildup, which prevents good results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Popcorn!","review":"UM...

The tabs are very poorly constructed and it is not capable of frequent usage.

The latches that hold the heating element to the base have broken on the first two after only a few uses. Now the one we have is broken were the probes go thru to the cord. The ribbed design is difficult to clean but it is nice to clean the heating unit. We expected far more from this fine company. Only thing keeping us going is the liberal return policy. Make sure you keep your box to send it back. I think between the three we've poped 10 batches at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another fine POS from Cuisinart-the CPM-900BK","review":"Purchased this and on the 3rd usage the handles that secure the heating plate to the base broke off.

How hard is it to design a heating element that will consistently heat up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"turkey","review":"This machine makes fabulous popcorn with only 1 tsp of evoo and the full included measure cup of corn. It is light and crispy. Cleans up in the dishwasher great. THAT SAID:I bought it 9 December 2008. I have used it four times, and its broken for the fifth. Something broke off inside the base unit. I never dropped it, or abused it, or put the heater element on wrong. It just stopped working. I bought it because it was a cuisinart and now I am thoroughly disappointed.We'll see what customer service does. I am calling them tomorrow.UPDATE: They sent me a brand new one, free of charge, and three years later, still works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality ? d/t made in China","review":"I've had this unit less than a year, first the clips on the base cracked within a few wks, then a piece of the heating unit cracked & broke off, finally the whole frame on heating unit fell off. All this after careful use of the unit. I just received a replacement ( had to pay shipping cost), I don't expect any better results as it is the same product. Shame on Cuisinart, I trusted your brand name. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is BAD- 2nd replacement needed in 21 months","review":"Buy a different brand - the quality of workmanship is very cheap.Disappointing for a Cuisinart - If I was the CEO of Cuisinart I would insist this was made better or stop selling it, it is an embarrassment to the Cuisinart name.Purchased in Feb 2010, we make popcorn fairly often. It does work great but the construction is terrible. Within months the popping base broke we called for a replacement and the first one sent was broken, 2nd one was ok but we noticed a crack called and complained about the quality of workmanship and now the base base has broken again. I am now buying a different popper - not sure which one. In the end the popcorn popper lasted about 21 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect - Weak Latching Mechanism","review":"We are pleased with the quality of the heat plate which pops quickly and leaves very few (if any) kernels behind. Clean-up is superior to most electric poppers due to the modular design. The only complaint we have is the weak latching mechanism that connects the hot plate to the base. The connection relies on a thin plastic latch on the hot plate that grips the base. On the third use, the latch on our first unit broke off when pressing the hot plate into the base to \\"snap\\" it into position. Amazon sent us a replacement and the same thing happened with unit #2.Since this appears to be a characteristic weakness of the design, we decided to keep #2 and live with it. Now the hot plate latches at only 1 mounting point and sits slightly off-level to the base.We love the machine's cooking performance and cleanup attributes, but the physical connection between the hot plate and the base is poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Design. Shoddy Quality.","review":"This could be such a great popcorn popper if the heating element didn't give up the ghost so soon. The design is perfect: just throw the bowl and the removable base-plate in the dishwasher!-- (So much easier to clean than a Stir-Crazy!!)But the heating element died on my first popper(a Christmas gift), after only about 5 times, and then it died again on my second popper just as quickly.Wish I could find another popper designed like this one made by another company that actually worked. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthier alternative to microwave popcorn","review":"This popcorn maker is a great alternative to those unhealthily microwavable brands. You make the popcorn to your liking, with very little oil. For me I use a whole mess of salt and real melted butter...we are talking about snack food after all. The best results, though, do come from using less oil. The unit is quick and easy: oil, kernels, and switch it on, that's it. It even pops right into the serving bowl. The vents at the top help the hot air move through the popping chamber making the popcorn light fluffy. But this is no air popper; you know this is the real deal when you taste it. Another thing I found useful was the bottom lid on the severing bowl. It prevents a mess by catching the salt and crumbs that can slip through the vents. Getting the bottom plate attached is a pain but it's a one time operation. Overall, this is a great value and I am quite satisfied with its performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I loved this popcorn maker. I thought it was beautiful, and bought it although for years I thought it was silly to buy something just to pop corn and take up counter space. Well, I moved my toaster oven to the garage just to make space for it.After about 6 months, yesterday one of the little handles you need to press to release the heating plate broke. The popper still worked, but it's ridiculous...the thing just broke off in my hand as I was pressing it. Then I burned myself on the heating plate. I've never done so before, but I wasn't looking carefully and got a bad burn. The problems is you have to pick up the heating plate with the bowl and flip it over. The heating plate has cool handles, but if you get distracted and you are a bit off you can get a pretty bad burn. NOT a good design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cuisinart quality","review":"Cuisinart really missed with this one. I don't think anyone in their Quality Control ever tried popping corn in it. The corn all jams up at the bottom and eventually lifts the lid off the popper as it pops. There are no vents in the top, so the steam starts to moisten the popped corn as well. I wouldn't use the top as the serving bowl for that reason, plus the narrowness would make it easy to tip.On the plus side, it's incredibly easy to clean - I can just pop the lid and the removable bottom portion into the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!!!","review":"I bought one of these for my son and one for myself. It worked for about 5 months and like most of the other people, the clip that seats the heating element BROKE!!! Mine broke day before yesterday and my son called yesterday and told me his BROKE TOO!!!! You would think when you pay $60.00 for a popcorn popper, it would last longer then 5 months. Not going to pay the expense of returning it to the manufacturer or PAY TO GET A NEW ONE, what's up with that?? So much for guarantee's!! Threw it in the trash. Don't waste you time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken out of the box.","review":"The item was broken before it came out of the box. The kernal spinner worked, but the plate didn't get hot. I took it apart and put it back together several times trying to figure out why it wasn't working.

Poorly designed clips that hold heated popper to base. Break too easily. Once broken, the connection to the heating elements becomes unreliable. While the impeller continues to turn, the heat won't always come on. Great care must be taken in use, cleaning and storage so that the very delicate parts don't get damaged. Overall very dissatisfied with the life span. Shortly after 3 months our heated base was broken beyond hope. Bought a replacement base, and that lasted for about 6 weeks. Same clips are breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken...AGAIN!","review":"I am on my third replacement popper. I've had it. Will not request a new one. I'm tired of getting the \\"it must have been something YOU did\\" tone from the Cuisinart folks. NO, it was NOT something I did. I have treated these poppers with kid gloves since they appear to be ever so delicate. First to break were the contacts for the heating element. Second popper's handle clips broke. And now so have the third popper's. Oh, Cuisinart WILL send you a new one. But you have to pay for shipping and handling and you have to send the old one back. Run. As fast as you can to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span - mine stopped heating","review":"I was excited to find this popcorn popper at a substantial discount at a department store. Cuisinart also is a good brand, so I was shocked when the popper stopped heating less than 10 uses later. I had a Whirley-Pop, which works great, but is difficult to clean, and I wanted an integrated bowl.I would not recommend this product as it breaks quickly. I'll be buying another electric one.

Not going to bother with contacting customer service. We just pulled our old Stir Crazy out of the closet and began using it again. Glad I kept it.

(luckily they were covered under warranty.) We've had problems with the locks which hold the popping plate to the heating base (broke twice), a piece within the base broke, the heating element went out, and the bowl cover didn't fit the bowl; it fell off. You'd expect cuisinart to have better quality. (but this does seem much sturdier than similar poppers we checked out) Lucky for us, everything was replaced, but be very careful with how you use the locks (engage the lock b/4 clicking plate onto base - if there is any resistance don't force it), and call them if you have a problem; they may replace it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor plastic body...

They have done the same on the replacement unit. I try and buy good quality items and am not adverse to the cost if the product and service reflect. Cuisinart Service is very non-service, the only response they would conjure is if the product was under warrantee. So back to Costco for return. I am re-evaluating Cuisinart as a part of our kitchen.

We tried various types of popcorn in the unit to see if we could get a single good batch, and we never did. The corn was not light and fluffy - it was ALWAYS dense, small pieces that were tough and soggy. The moisture from the popping process gets trapped in the popping chamber and then covers the corn once it is popped. I drilled holes in the top of the clear cover to let the moisture out, but that didn't help. We ended up giving the unit to GoodWill.

They are really fun to watch, don't take up a lot of space, and are easy to set up and care for!! Any Sea Monkey Set makes the greatest gift a kid could ever ask for! Just remember never to place the tank in direct sunlight, and never place it on an unstable surface or where it can get knocked over or they'll die.

Total cost for two, shipped, plus tax was under $30.I'm all about making a profit but when you can get it for less than half price by going direct to the KA site, one would be foolish not to.Happy shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rip-off","review":"Book is little more than a collection of not very detailed information in very large part already available on the web. Largely an ad for purchases from Pelican Parts auto parts website where much of the information is already available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Book for BMW Owners","review":"This is an excellent book and one every owner of an older BMW Three Series should own. The articles do highlight performance upgrades, but not in an extreme fashion. I find the book most useful for walking me through basic repairs. I have even tackled more advanced repairs and upgrades with confidence saving me easily more than a $1000.00 in repair bills. I am no super mechanic. The descriptions and excellent pictures make it easy to visualize the work and the author frequently gives you good alternatives to buying expensive, very specialized tools. The broad span of coverage for different model years does present limitations, but once you figure out the basics it is easy to apply the procedures from one model year to another. All in all a well crafted and extremely useful book for BMW owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your BMW paper toolbox!","review":"This is a great book for Bmw owners who enjoy doing repairs and modifications yourself.Though this is mainly a mechanics related book,it offers info and tips on bodymods,wheels and exterior.The book is easy to read and is backed up by some great pictures showing each step of the prosess.The colourpictures are great for showing what the parts and problem area looks like.In all the projects featured in this book,the author also gives hints on brandnames and price. It is useful not only for those who wants to upgrade their car,but also for the DIY mechanic who needs info on those everyday smalljobs of replacing worn parts and general maintainance.Highly recomended as a supplement in your BMW toolbox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion book to Bentley Manual.","review":"It's always helpful to get a 2nd opinion. Which is why having this book is so helpful. So the Bentley manual is THE BIBLE for E30 BMWs, but 101 Projects is good in its own right and also worth having to cross-reference against. Probably a bit more useful to the E36 owner than E30. I recommend if you want to start fiddling with your BMW E30/E36- get both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading","review":"The title indicates this book covers E30/E36 3 series cars from 1982-2000 but, going through the projects, they are mostly based around twin cam 6 cylinder engines and modern cars. There is one chapter(project) on replacing a timing belt on an E30 engine and one on adjust the valves on the same but if you have a car from the 1980's, I wouldn't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Performance Projects but Maintenance Projects","review":"If you are looking for a book about Bmw e36 maintenance projects this book is for you! But if you are looking for performance projects that transform your stock car in a power beast, well this book has little about it, it covers little about CAI, chip, turbo, hp gains and torque, there's is nothing about big bore throttle, sport header, flywheel, pulleys, fan delete etc the mods you usually would do to bring your 192 bhp car to a 250 bhp monster. It covers little about others models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth having despite it's flaws.","review":"Any BMW enthusiast who owns the models covered should own this book. It's informative, as several of the tips and photos help fill in the gaps from other tech sources. But it also suffers from a damaging flaw: it tries to include too many projects for too many cars, and as a result, the information tends to be generalized and vague. There is a big difference between a BMW E30 and a BMW E36, yet this book tries to explain something like a brake job for both models in the span of two pages. You just can't do it and be clear and complete in the process.Still, it's a good read and a great starting point for your projects. Just be sure to have a Bentley repair manual by your side when you actually get the wrenches out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blowing session","review":"This is a very nice blow session, recorded almost 9 months after the extremely popular Somethin' Else. Unlike the earlier album, this one is definitely a Cannonball album in style. Unlike many later albums, this is a blowing session rather than a studio appearance by a live, working band.I'll admit to being lukewarm on Milt Jackson and my judgment of this album is probably affected downward as a result. Milt's playing is nice here, just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period, there is a healthy mix of ballads (\\"Serves Me Right\\"), bebop (\\"Groovin' High\\"), interesting originals (\\"Blues Oriental\\" by Milt Jackson) and extremely funky material (\\"Sounds for Sid\\"). Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one. Fans of Cannonball's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaf & Rusher have many products that I find wonderful.","review":"I was given Leaf & Rusher as a gift. It included travel sizes of many of their products. The original oil formula actually absorbs into your skin. The effect, of using this for just a couple of days, is that your skin becomes softer. After using all of their products [except the derma wand], my skin is more even. My daughter-in-laws have commented on how pretty my skin is. My skin actually glows. I highly recommend Leaf & Rusher! I like these products better than Borguesse, SKII [the one with Cate Blanchett], Clinique, Meaningful Beauty [the one with Cindy Crawford], Chanticalle, La Mer, and many more...

This is some of the best pop songwriting I've heard. The production is by far the best of any Apples album.

All the listed songs are in fact, songs. No snippets/noise, etc....where did the girl come from and why is she singing? Her songs are indeed throwaways. Like Linda McCartney singing on a Wings album.The lyrics are certainly nothing to write home about, but it's fun stuff. They like to pay homage to 60's bands and psychedelic nonsense. Kind of like the Dukes of Stratosphear (XTC). They are slowly crossing over into XTC territory, but they'll never be confused with the lyrical genius of Andy Partridge.

APPLES ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well, maybe two and 1/2 stars...","review":"Ho-hum...another Elephant Six album, rife with Beatles/Beach Boys plagiarism, shoddy production values, bubble-gum naivety, cutesy nonsense lyrics, and total incapability to do anything forward-looking with the many influences at hand.I remember when XTC did something similar with those Dukes Of Stratosphere albums, aping everyone from The Hollies to Brian Wilson, but with such an obvious sense of humor and parody that it was easy to digest. But these guys do seem to have a seriously inflated sense of self-importance, as if this stuff were really \\"art\\", when in fact it's simply emulating the masters with finger paintings.For the record, some melodies are enjoyable, there's always a nice backbeat (ripped off from the Beatles album of your choice), and the occasional hook here and there. But I'm tired of it all. First it was cute, then it was tolerable, now it's just plain annoying. For completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"...see, the thing that made the beatles and the beach boys great was their ADVENTUROUS, ORIGINAL, MIND BLOWING MUSIC... the thing that makes this band suck is their lack of originality... and talent... oh, yeah, and soul. can't forget the lack of soul... stick to producing neutral milk, dude, they're the only thing that's good about your collective of elephant poo..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An OK record","review":"This April 2000 release of the Elephant 6's most prominent band is quite accessible, especially poppy, and downright enjoyable. The funkiness (especially of the bass line) of the tenth track, \\"The Bird That You Can't See\\" is a little unexpected and very infectious. The overall mood of the album continues the band's practice of tipping the hat to the Beatles. The harmonies still are suggestive of Beach Boys. Perhaps the dissappointment of the album lies in its unexperimental and totally straight-ahead foci. Of course, the Apples in stereo aren't quite as exotic-seeming as the Olivia Tremor Control, for instance, but some different sounds a la Her Wallpaper Reverie would be interesting. Overall, the record is good as a fairly coherent pop statement. I think it is recommended in the least for listening if not for purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Fits OK But...","review":"The fit is fine however this is quite shallow.

Indeed, Herb Ellis never sounded sweeter; the Oscar Peterson Trio is in top notch form. But then, Ben Webster, Benny Carter, Lester Young, Roy Eldridge (\\"for quiet jazz\\", as Norm Granz says in his intro) and Charlie Shavers (\\"for loud jazz\\") are all playing at the peak of their powers. The introductory jam session builds to a superb crescendo of (almost) uncontrolled chaos; rather than single-man, extended solos, it seems the players trade phrases within solos. There's a generosity of spirit here, a lack of ego and a real sense of fun--which means the lucky listener has fun, too. My only regret is that the pleasure lasts a mere 49 minutes.

Author Carolyn Howard-Johnson pieces together their stories like patchwork squares handed down from generation to generation, until the reader truly feels enveloped in this family's rich heritage. Her writing brings the characters and the setting to life as vividly as an Oscar-winning documentary, and her lyrical style paints them in colors and details to rival an exquisite picture postcard from her beloved Utah.Having lived all my life in Alabama, I thought I knew all there was to know about discrimination. What an eye-opener this book is about religious intolerance--a subject that becomes more and more relevant in today's world of terrorist threats and suspicion. Would that we all could see the issues from both sides as does this book's heroine, Sky Eccles.

The quality varies, which should be expected given the \\"pre-MTV\\" timing of many of the clips.

I had lost touch for many years, but checked it out and thought I'd give it a look. Boy, was I NOT disappointed! From the first video clip with Bon in a dress and pigtails, I was hooked with the band all over again. I couldn't stop watching this DVD, nor could I stop bobbing my head and tapping my foot... this DVD is a must have for any AC/DC fan. I am now a bigger fan than I was in the early 90's, when I was first really introduced to their music. Long live AC/DC!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost definitive collection","review":"The video clips included in this collection is a real treat presented in a chronological order of their album release.

Came to amazon and was amazed when I saw what this collection had. Basically, this DVD has everything, every song you could ever want to hear/see from this group.The packaging is simple and the only annoyance I have is this is a 2 disc set, and they didn't use a dual disc box. One disc overlaps another, so if you want to get to the back disc, you must pop out the front one. Not a major deal, but something that could have been easily fixed.So, if you are an AC\\\\DC fan and you would like 40 of their best songs and be able to watch them...then pull out your wallet, let your MONEYTALK and purchase this set. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been listening to AC/DC since 1976 and really love thier work, even the work of Brian Johnson up till about 1990. I had not seen much material with Bon Scott as far as live concerts and was hoping this set would contain some actual live footage with live audio. I did enjoy the video but it is obvious that the audio is dubbed on top of the video from studio tracks. This was very lame to say the least. I could have just played my CD collection while watching this and had same result. What a jip. I would have rather listened to the bad audio than the over-dubbs. I would recommened this only to people who have never seen Bon perform. Don't expect any live material as this is as stale and commercialized as it gets. Sorry guys but there are no jewels here, just paste passed off as jewels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome!!!","review":"No better collection of AC/DC videos anywhere.

Around forty songs altogether, which makes it a must for any ac/dc fan-- whether you're a diedhard or casual fan. It's great to see Bon's performances in the early days, but there are no TV interviews with Bon Scott or the rest the ac/dc gang on the DVD. It's strictly perfomance clips. Sure, it's the performances that are important, but alternative footage of the band would've rounded the DVD out nicely. Also the DVD is a bit pricey (It costs $40.00 Canadian!). Excellent (especially the \\"Long Way to the Top' video). Highly recommended, but you must see AC/DC live in concert. One of the best live shows I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD 1 is perfection.","review":"Firstly dvd 2 is not bad with some great tunes on it, but I must say I bought this for the early stuff and have not been disappointed. The quality of the videos is excellent, from Jailbreak to Let There be Rock and the live bits are jaw dropping. One thing I always loved about ACDC was there ability to put a smile on my face - the Let There Be Rock video is hilarious!! They seem to be brimming with confidence.

This has been one of my most played DVDs, and for good reason. This is a treasure trove of tv and video performances, many those of us in the US haven't got to see before. Disk 1 is the Bon Era, and contains early Austrailian tv promos and videos that are a blast to watch. These were pre-MTV, and therfore mostly not available here. I do remember the Midnight Special performance of Sin City, and it's great to see that again, but there's much more here. I equally enjoy Disk 2 with Brian. Even if you watched the original MTV Headbangers Ball as I did, most of the 80's and 90's videos were never overexposed. Other than a proper DVD release of Let There Be Rock (hint to Albert Productions), I couldn't want more in an AC/DC DVD.

I expected something along the lines of the Pink Floyd \\"Making of DSOTM\\" disc or the Led Zeppelin 4 Disc set. Unfortunaltely, after taking about 5 minutes to FF through the disc, I realized I'd been taken. The so-called \\"live\\" performances are old clips that I'd seen before with the actual studio recordings dubbed over it, when I hear \\"live\\" I don't expect to hear the track that I could just listen to by putting in the CD. Secondly, there weren't any interviews, commentary, or behind the scenes footage. Nothing on this disc is new (as in never seen before).

To put it another way, if I could do it over, I'd not get this cd but some other more recently remastered release.Overall, as examples of great musicianship and/or songwriting, I suppose Air Supply never were but as syrupy love-song crooners, few could outdo them during that very brief period in the early 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Band Ever...","review":"I haven't heard it but considering the material this has got to be god awful.

Also included were some of their earlier smooth songs like \\"I'll Be Around\\" and \\"Its a Shame\\". We even get the Spinners foray into disco, the remake of the Four Season's Working My Way Back To You\\" is happily included.They were so polished, and if you have gone a few decades (like I did) withoug hearing these songs, they return like a good old friend.

Their songs are classics, many crossed over to the pop charts with lyrics that take you along for the emotional ride and even some songs that take you on to your dancing feet even though I was a child at the height of their popularity. In concert their choreography is a bit comedic as the group members range considerably in height and the moves vary from the tallest to the shortest members.

I bought this book hoping it would help bridge that gap.When the book arrived, I was disappointed because it contained very little background information. Lucado does not help the reader understand what each Psalm meant in its original context.Instead, he encourages the reader to look inward and focus on his/her own experience with the text. Much of the book consists of pages that look like notebook paper where the reader can fill in his/her thoughts.Despite my reservations, I decided to try it out with my Wednesday morning Bible study.

Listen to it all the way through. This young man is very deep and wants to tell his story. This album has a different style than the last, \\"Room for Squares\\". John pulls out the electric guitar and is going for a \\" New Deep\\". We have high expectations for John Mayer because of his incredible talent, and his out of this world success on \\"Room for Squares\\". The best songs on this album are Clarity, Bigger than My Body, New Deep, and Split-Screen Sadness. The rest of the songs really shape the album out. So forget what the others say, if you like John Mayer this album will grow on you, it really is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new CD","review":"While the music is still very heart felt. I really enjoyed his first two albums much better because of there accoustic focus. This album has much more to it than just the plain singer- songwriter feel.

Of the thousands of CDs that I own, this was one of the best I have ever heard. I also had high expectations for his new CD, \\"Heavier Things\\".It started off with \\"Clarity\\" and I was really disappointed. Other postings here list this as one of the best cuts. I disagree, I think it is my least favorite on the CD. That being said, the rest of the CD is fantastic.It's not \\"Room For Squares\\"...because you have to try different things to be a true artist. I did have to listen to it about a half dozen times, but I am totally hooked. He is doing his best to appeal to a wide audience here. There is jazz, blues and pop. Best cut for sure...\\"Something's Missing\\". I already can't wait for the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different But Still Great","review":"This album is WAY different than Room for Squares. And ever since I discovered John Mayer, Room for Squares has been in my cd player. I was ecstatic when I found out that he had a new album out, and when I first took a listen to it, I was VERY disappointed. HOWEVER, the more I listened to it, and learned the lyrics and tunes, I fell in love with it. I love John's acoustic stuff, just John and his guitar, but this cd proves that he can do well with a band and an electric sound. I think that if you aren't open to something new, you won't like this cd, however it is more awesome music from my favorite singer! My biggest disappointment in this cd is that there are only 10 songs! New Deep and Bigger Than My Body are my favorites!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was blown away by \\"Room For Squares\\"...so far, \\"Heavier Things\\" is not doing it for me. I intend to listen to it again & again because, hey, Mayer IS talented, but these new songs have no \\"hooks\\". His new lyrics go deeper for sure, but I haven't heard one song on \\"Heavier Things\\" that even compares to \\"Neon\\", or \\"St. Patrick's Day\\". I think John's definitely the best of the bunch when it comes to new songwriters, but I think he should've mixed up the song selection a little better on this second disc; half of what IS on it, but the other half more songs in the style of his first album.It would've shown his versatility, but satisfied those who like songs with catchy melodies. Listen to the new Steely Dan CD, \\"Everything Must Go\\" and you'll see just what I'm talking about. Sorry John, but as far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out, and I await what you'll do on your third album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"As a huge fan of JM and his previous work, I must say I am very disappointed with Heavier Things. This album is definitely not in the same league as Room For Sequares. Although the lyrics are nicely done (as always), the composition doesn't do justice. \\"Something's Missing\\" and \\"Home Life\\" are the only two decent tracks. Don't expect to find anything on the same par with \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" or \\"No Such Thing\\" in this album. You simply won't.

He is to much like Dave Matthew's and the whole raspy voice thing gets annoying after a while. Most of the tunes are catchy and the songwritng is good, it just didn't have the variety that would make me want to buy it.

How shameless.I'm guessing we have college freshmen across the country to thank for Mayer's popularity.Mayer: Drop recording and get some much needed practice and experience.Do the club circuit.

After he played that song into the ground, he came out with this album that quite frankly is dry, genrally flat, and a typical release for John Mayer, who has slowly become a wanna rocker. His voice doesn't change pitch or tone nearly enough and is boring. Any comparison with Dave Matthews is un-justified, because Mayer has failed demonstrate any lasting skill or extended creativity.

I have turned on hundreds of people to his music, and this latest album is a sincere disappointment. There is a lack of originality and musical talent. This is not John's music, this is crap. It seems like the music company published their own material for him; this is not his work. I am so diappointed with this CD, it is not even worth you listening to. Wait for the next album or better yet pick up his first two. I could go on and on, but what's the point, this CD sucks and that is all you need to know if you are a true Mayer fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost it? I completely disagree","review":"'Heavier Things' is, in my opinion (of course) a much 'smarter' album than 'Room for Squares' in all respects. Musically it is deep, textured and heavily appealing. Lyrically, it's a BIG step up from his first album. Much less 'teeny bopper' and much more wit and depth.For all of you complaining about his more diverse usage of instrumentation, I question your understanding of music production. The guitar riffs are exceptional here, but the additonal timbres of other sound sources (both organic and electronic) really compliment and 'round off' his sound.This album is tight, warm, clean, smart, deep and WELL worth many listens. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a different album","review":"while heavier things is somewhat of a disappointing follow up to RFS, it is still well worth purchasing. unlike RFS, where i loved every single song, on HT i find that 3 out of the 10 songs are weak. however, the energetic \\"bigger than my body,\\" and ballads like \\"come back to bed,\\" \\"daughters,\\" and \\"the wheel\\" make this album well worth it. in john's defense, surpassing RFS is a difficult task and i think that he did reasonably well. as the title of the album suggests, listeners should have expected slower songs which are not as energetic as those from RFS. taken in its own context, HT is soulful and filled with meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than i thought","review":"I was just turned on to John Mayer by a couple of friends and I totally can't get enough of the cd!

I didn't feel it was as good as the first one, but after a couple of minutes into it I started loving it. I am glad it is different from his first one. I loved his first one greatly, but why get repetitive with music when there are so many different things to experiment. I personally love this cd. I think it stands out more than his first one. I also feel that the songs from \\"Heavier Things\\" are more catchy than those from \\"Room for Squares\\". Although, not all the songs are catchy. Some, like \\"Daughters\\" I could easily live without. Some, like \\"Clarity\\" and \\"Homelife\\" I could sing all day. They're more upbeat and pleasent (which is how most songs on this cd are). I feel it is a great investment for any John Mayer fan or even for those who aren't big fans. If you like John Mayer I would also truly recommend Maroon 5, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Josh Kelley, and Vertical Horizon. They're all fantastic as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost his appeal","review":"Let me begin by saying that this disk is different from what I expected. I expected that lo-tech sound that John Mayer had on the Room for Squares disk. Heavier Things sounds over produced and too electronic.

His big hit here was \\"Daughters\\" which is probably the most mellow, laid back, and heartfelt song he's made.

As in my opinion Heavier Things is simply a recording that gets to the point of what artistes should be doing.This album is mature with creativity and yet at the same time it doesn't overdo it by layering too many aspects.The songs are clean and they arrive.This album is worthy of buying and should give great pleasure for listening to many times over without being overbearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby's first solid food","review":"Like baby's first solid food, it's not offensive, but like the title of Track 3 says, \\"Something's Missing\\". It's light, clean pop that is pleasant in the dentist office, but you really wish he had just made it a little meatier. One listen and you've heard it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavier, indeed.","review":"I expected not to love this album based on a few negative reviews. I love being surprised. 'Heavier Things' is the most underrated Mayer album in my opinion....obviously it contains the Grammy-winning 'Daughters', but 'Clarity', 'Bigger Than my Body' and 'Split Screen Sadness' are equally loveable tunes. It's interesting when Mayer sings 'Wheel' and 'Something's Missing', you feel like you've been there, exactly where he's at, at some point in your life, and he knows it. The lyrics are so easy to relate to. Give it a TRY! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer Does Not make Bad Cds!","review":"I highly recommend this Cd! John Mayer is a great artist on todays scene, I am sure he will be around for a long time. This Cd has a great mix of songs that I can relate to. All written by himself it is quite an impressive second studio album. It is just a great Cd to escape with! Congratulations to John Mayer on another great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John does it again","review":"I love John Mayer-Heavier Things. I have to say, first of all people that write their own music are just awesome in my book, and he is one of the best lyracists I have seen. A great songwriter. And singing is suberb, but his guitar playing is just great. I really love Clarity, his single Heavier than my Body, Something's Missing and Homelife. Of course his other songs are good. If you liked Room for Squares I am positive you will like this CD. Good job John."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy uses jimi hendrix's playing style and dave matthews singing style","review":"This kid is a joke. He whines like dave matthews and just imitates jimi hendrix's playing style on the guitar. And this fake won a grammy??? Typical music acclaim these days for un-original artists. Yes, he can play but he has no style of his own. Maybe in time he will become who he is, but for now he is just a clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This CD was released to soon. It is a very poor album compared to his last one. Better luck next time John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artist of the decade...","review":"John Mayer is a perfect example of all that is wrong with popular music in the 21st century. His music is just completely flat, drab, dull and lifeless. Music these days has become a shadow of its former self. Back in the 80s and 90s, music was music, not a bunch of inane chatter. But today, what we once knew as music has been flattened out into a two dimensional droning sound! Artists no longer have anything interesting to say with their songs, they just ramble on about nothing. Music today is so flat and boring, it makes me wish I could go back in time circa 1991! Maybe then I'd be able to turn on a radio and hear MUSIC, as opposed to the monotonous droning of John Mayer, Maroon 5, Jason Mraz, Ryan Cabrera, etc. Where's a time machine when you need one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still sounds like DMB, Micheal Franks etc.","review":"Wish he could live up to the hype. If he could then us baby boomers could relax and have a little hope for the future of rock. If this is the best the next generation of guitar playing songwriters has to offer then my grandchildren are in trouble. Mindless melancholy drivel. I don't get it. I tried. I guess I bought in to the next guitar god moniker but I'm sorry nothing special here. John lose the Strat might as well be playing nylon strings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diluted Dave Matthews","review":"Let's face it folks, this music is boring and unbelieveably pretentious. Not to mention, Mayer is ripping off Dave Matthews, which isn't striving for very much now is it? Both Matthews and Mayers are boring and cannot write melodies or music that stands for anything. They are trying to please everyone, and for that they are truly worthless,weak, and coniving."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer","review":"We saw John Mayer in concert and his live preformance was great! This record is great. Very polished quality. Musicality couldn't be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs that Sound Like I wrote Them, If I had John Mayer's Talent","review":"I could really identify with many of John Mayer's very personal songs. His lyrics touch something deep within and resonate long after his voice is still. May he never lose touch with that part of him that is universal and give in to the almighty dollar or do what music dictates. He is a unique talent and voice with insights that help us to see the lives we live a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another example of poor CD mastering","review":"No complaints on the artist himself - but - Heavier things is another example of how poorly CD companies pay attention to the mastering process. Beginning with Clarity, the first cut, the left channel is over modulated and distorts once the song really gets going. Don't accept the BS the CD companies keep putting out - especially at these prices. For the record, both my home CD player and computer demonstrate how poor the disc has been manufactured. At least Columbia has an 800 number printed on the inside of the cover so consumers can express their complaints - all companies should provide this - but don't expect to get a better copy - it's in the mastering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album BLOWS!","review":"John Mayer is the most pretentious, average musician around. Anybody who has seen him live, or read an interview, will see he is self-absorbed and a minor talent. His has no edge, no depth and no balls ... his music will for ever remain fluff.I love TRUE signer/songwriters (Springsteen, Neil Young, Dylan and Dave Matthews who Mayer has ripped and then polished for \\"pop-radio\\") This album is dull and predictable...but will out sell most good music because the public can't judge talent from garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album! ...but USELESS format can't be put on my IPOD.","review":"if you use an IPOD, DO NOT buy this version of the album. Buy the regular version instead. The DualDisc format cannot be imported into ITUNES so you cannot put the songs on the IPOD.I WASTED my money on this version and now have to spend MORE money so I can actually listen to the songs I already paid for!I will never again make the mistake of buying a DualDisc CD!!!However, the music is excellent and I highly recommend the OTHER version of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a little time - it's worth it","review":"I have read some of the other reviews and thought I ought to try to balance things. I really liked the first album and was a little surprised when I heard how different this was. I have to say that I now prefer this to Room for Squares. The first track, Clarity is truly excellent and it goes on from there.Listen to it a few times before you make your mind up - it really grows on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend it... the whole cd.","review":"I have to say, the weakest song in this whole album is Daughters. The rest of the songs are great. Daughters was such a bad song to start out and market this album because it doesnt give it justice. John Mayer is very talented and I enjoyed this cd the best but he's still bring out great new stuff. His voice and somehow all his music is melodic and catchy. Plus he's a great guitar player. That's all I want, so I fully recommend this cd for many people of diffrent ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"I just bought Heavier Things a few days ago, and it has been in my cd player since. It may not be as good as Room for Squares, but it is definitely better than the average music put out by other artists. Come back to bed was a great song, as were many others. You can't always only compare an artist to his or her past works. Sometimes you need to look at the big picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"To be concise- for a second album with a lot to live up to, 'Heavier Things' isn't bad at all. The overall theme has more to do with growing up, finding confidence, improving, evolving- than it does with falling in love or romance (which might disapoint younger fans who love 'Your Body is a Wonderland). There are heavier guitar riffs and what seem like more advanced lyrics.The songs themselves start out strong, tracks 1-5 (ending with the one really romantic, bluesy ballad \\"Come Back to Bed\\") are especially good. The music loses momentum around \\"Home Life\\" and \\"Split Screen Sadness\\", but the sweetly sentimental \\"Daughters\\" helps steer the album to a more solid finish with \\"Only Heart\\" (a very up-tempo, oldies song) and \\"Wheel\\".All in all, as a fan who enjoys John Mayer for his talent and songwriting I really appreciate this effort and I hope it is an indicator of what's more to come with this artist. If you like Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz, even Norah Jones- I think this would be a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid follow-up","review":"A solid follow up from this Grammy winner. Heavier Things has more of an electric feel and far more tracks are tinged with soul and blues. The album rolls along nicely but does suffer from more droning ballads than catchy choruses. The tone is more morose here, and there is alot of old love. Yet the fusion of lap steel, sax, and keys that pervade the album mix well with a more sonic sound.Well done. Recommended listening: 1,3,5,7,10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your stereotypical sophomore effort","review":"John Mayer has definitely grown with this album. It is a different sound than Room for Squares but still the same drool-worthy smoothness we expect from him. My only complaint is that I would've liked at least one acoustic song. Well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An educated album / for worse or for better","review":"I've been a fan of John Mayer for some time now due to the resemblance of my other favorite acts: Oasis, Fallen From Grace, and Dave Matthews.This is an example of an album that demonstrates the talent that Mayer possesses, but does not deliver the great songwriting that Room for squares contains. Mayer seems to be testing the waters of his musical backgrounds, but I think his most successful writing is in the Folk/acoustic genre. This album seems to stray from his target audience. With that said, they definitely released the right single for the air waves.I would recommend this CD if you are into intelligent songwriting, not \\"Pop-Packaged-Ready to Serve Music\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I expected...","review":"I'm sure this cd has some great moments, too bad I won't find out since its collecting dust on my cd rack. Not what I exactly expected or care to hear from John Mayer. I tried my best to listen to the album fully but somehow it just didn't click. John's debut cd is definitely of better quality. Track 1, Clarity is my standout and that's pushing it. Good luck next time John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavier things weighs heavy on my mind......","review":"in the fact that I paid my hard-earned cash for this highly-anticipated album. This album is deserving of no stars. John Mayer's \\"Inside Wants Out,\\" \\"Room For Squares,\\" and \\"Any Given Thursday,\\" albums are phenomenal. I thought he might be the second coming of Dave Matthews. On this album, his fourth effort, something is lacking in the lyrics and in the sound quality. I don't know that he sold out necessarily, he is just trying too hard. The sound quality is horrific, it is extremely tinny and lacking much bass guitar. Before you buy, borrow a friend's. For consistent artists that keep cranking out excellent music, check out David Gray or Howie Day. John Mayer has begun his trip out to pop-star wasteland and is not making it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I heard about John Mayer when he was underground...","review":"...back on his first album, \\"Closed Doors, Open Skyways,\\" and while he has definitely added a more mellow sound to his music, I can't help but think that his vocals make him sound really, ummm, gay, or at least half-gay. I wish he'd write more songs about crossing the threshold from childhood into manhood, sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I enjoyed JM's first CD. There aren't any catchy tunes in this CD. It is torture to listen to. The guy seems full of himself in every song, like he is curing cancer with each tune. There is a sign of life on the second to last song, I forget the title. It's just a ho hum CD and I just wasted 14 buck on it.This album sucks, IMHO. I'll sell the used CD and try to save a sucker from buying this crapfest. Hopefully the next CD will be better. I won't buy it unless it gets good reviews. The critics hate this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Liner Notes","review":"This disc needs liner notes, since I never seem to make out his lyrics by just listening to the songs. Must John Mayer mumble all of his songs? Get this guy a diction tutor already."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 or 4, whatever mood I'm in.","review":"John Mayer's first album had only 3 good songs in my oppinion. This album is much more consistent.My favorite tracks are \\"Bigger than my Body\\" \\"Clarity\\" \\"Split Screen Sadness\\" and \\"Only Heart\\"Every song is different and enjoyable. I find this refreshing in an age where most CDs are full of the same song 12 times in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you waiting on...buy this CD now!!!","review":"To begin with, why are you even reading this at all. People this is John Mayer...of course it's going to be good. BUY THIS CD!!!The road has certainly been good to Mayer. Because of his coffee house beginnings and his following since then, he has learned how to craft a song well. He draws the listener in with his catchy but never trite tunes. His lyrics play on words but also give you something to think about.You will recognize SOMETHINGS MISSING from his live disc but I think he gives a better performance here. Listen for a little falsetto work on CLARITY and some hip-hop beat on HOMELIFE. My favorites are CLARITY, BIGGER THAN MY BODY, NEW DEEP, HOMELIFE, and ONLY HEART."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to You","review":"I preordered this CD, so I got it a couple days early. More good stuff. Slightly different style from last album, but not a complete makeover (like Jewel or Liz Phair). You'll find it a little more funky, with beats supplimenting the accoustic. More of Mayer's sultry singing (that makes some call him a girl act) in his song \\"Come Back to Bed.\\" It's not a sexual ditty, instead a make-up song. If you liked his last album, this one shouldn't disappoint. Overall, I recommend the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavier than dark matter","review":"If you like grind, you will love this cd. John Mayer belts out the most dense, skullcrushing riffs of all time on this cd. I would saiy it's even heavier than ISIS - Mosquito control, but that would be hyperbole. Suffice to say that this is one of the heavier cds of whatever year this cd came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Did Murmuring Become Singing?","review":"For those fans who are so enamored of John Mayer, I would like to know: Do they understand what it means to sing a song? John Mayer does not sing: he murmurs. I don't know anything about his music--whether he writes it, produces it--or is just the sounding board. However, from all the songs I have heard on the radio, I have yet to hear him \\"sing\\" a single note. News Flash for John's fans: It doesn't take talent to whisper sexily into a microphone with background music playing--which is all I have ever heard Mr. Mayer doing. If his fans think this style is so \\"unique\\", go to any smokey hotel lounge on a Saturday night. I've heard karaoke singers do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":".....","review":"I usually type VERY long reviews, but I'm not even going to waste my time on this DMB impersonating little boy. And DMB is my favorite band. His music doesn't sound anything like DMB, but watch the stupid boy perform. God..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Mathews Wanna Be - but he will never be","review":"John Mayer is a perfect example of the unoriginal artists who plague the music industry today. He brings nothing knew to the industry except corny lyrics and breathy vocals. A couple of his songs are \\"catchy\\" but quickly becoming annoying tracks that you cringe at the mere thought of hearing on the radio. My advice to John: Try being yourself instead of a poor replica of someone who's musical talent is untouchable! If you want to hear music from a truly amazing artist - get Dave Matthews \\"Some Devil\\" - now that dude is a GENIUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This CD was a huge letdown.I liked a few songs on his \\"Room for Squares\\" but was completely unaffected by everything on this album save for \\"Charity,\\" a great song.He's at the forefront of the male singer/songwriter thing right now in terms of popularity, but others are producing much better CDs. Try Patrick Park's \\"Loneliness Knows my Name,\\" Joseph Arthur's \\"Redemption's Son,\\" or Gavin DeGraw's \\"Chariot\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like song #3 on the CD say's, \\"something's missing\\".","review":"The CD starts out strong with \\"Clarity\\". After that you can eject this one from the CD player and save yourself the frustration. After a very fine effort in \\"Room for Squares\\", I find this work lacking inspiration. There is nothing to grab onto or cause the listener to take notice of the songs on this CD , save for track number one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, what an age we are living in!","review":"This is a complete Dave Mathews ripoff!!!!!!!!!! He can't sing, but whispers. The songwriting is wince-inducing, and he as an annoying mouth. Get Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" insted puuuuuuuuuleeeeeeeeeeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Room For Heavier Things","review":"I've been a long time fan since John was just underground music before he became this pop star. Room For Squares was my favorite album the year it came out, but this new album is quite a dissapointment. \\"Only Heart\\" is the oly really good song on it. \\"Something's Missing\\" is missing quite a bit in comparison to the live album. I find a few of the songs just plain annoying such as the opening track. If you plan on getting this album don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not perform up to potential","review":"I am a huge John Mayer fan, especially of his live recordings. I was surprised by this record as he does not appear take his musical arrangements to the next step. John's first cd speaks to a potential filled with songs infused with funk, melodic lines, intelligent lyrics and thoughful composition. He did not perform up to his potential.What he delivered was what one would expect from a 10 day studio session, during which 9 new songs were created due to record label pressure to get the new songs out. Unlike his first record, these songs were not road tested... they are not the finely crafted product of a young adult's life. Rather, they are nice, boring pop songs, with very little original composition or inspired development.He can do so much better and I am sure he knows it. The guy needs to take some time off from nearly 1.5 years on the road and push himself to produce art that is truly inspired and creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"now I feel better","review":"Before I read the reviews on here, I was honestly wondering: DOES ANYONE REALLY LIKE THIS MUSIC? Let's face it, John's a cute kid and MTV/VH1-ready and his voice is solid -- but he really is an awfully dull songwriter. By track 3 of tuneless earnest droning, I had to hit EJECT. I think internet downloading and \\"Greatest Hits\\" CDs were invented for John Mayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sophmore effort...","review":"I love this CD so much...so many of John's songs on both of his albums bring tears to my eye's because they really speak to me. I love \\"Clarity,\\" \\"Something's Missing,\\" \\"Homelife,\\" and \\"Split-Screen Sadness\\" the best I think. The single \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" is great too, but I am sure I will get sick of it (I already am) like I did \\"No Such Thing,\\" even though they are both great songs (radio overkill though). All in all, a wonderful and touching CD that is just enough different from his debut album to be counted as moving ahead in his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Mayer-hating here","review":"I know many have said that this album is a repeat of Room for Squares, but I beg to differ. My faves on the album are tracks 1 and 3, but the whole thing is wonderful, and I thought the liner notes were cute and humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new fav!","review":"I loved room for squares, but this is even better. EAch song is amazing in its own way, but especially come back to bed and wheel. This is a must have! all of the songs are great, and nothing sounds the same as in room for squares..... this cd blew me away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What an inspirational singer!","review":"Theres one word that descrbies this cd...wow! yet i can think of many other words that would work such as exceptional, perfect, a touch on the heart and inspirational. John Mayer is one of the most talented artists on the market right now and he isnt trash like Justin Timberlake or Nick Carter. He has real singing talents and he talks about stuff that matters. Kudos to John for producing another great cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love John Mayer","review":"Whew! I loved &quot;Room for Squares&quot;. His fantastic lyrics are smart, sexy and sweet. I bought &quot;Heavier Things&quot; as soon as it came out. I was not dissapointed. His talent for lyrics is still evident. He has added some more jazz and horns to his sound. It adds a new dimension to his sound and shows his growth as an artist. His songs are truly amazing and thoughtful. I can't wait to hear more from him"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a pretty album...","review":"This is a very solid album. It is somewhat less slickly produced that Mayer's debut album, but is still very well recorded and clear. It overall has a warmer sound.The songs are generally melodically interesting, perhaps more so than RFS, and the guitar work is very lyrical throughout. This is good, as Mayer is an exceptional guitar player. The first three tracks are uptempo (relatively) and catchy. There is a lull for a few tracks. The last two are split: \\"Only Heart\\" is uptempo and has a strong chorus, while \\"Wheel\\" is moves slowly and is a sweet lullaby (the guitar following Mayer's voice is so elegant).I recently reviewed Sting's latest album \\"Sacred Love\\" and called it a stinker. This album wins for all the reasons Sting's doesn't: It is not pretentious, is focused on songs, and is satisfied with being pop. First rate pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!!","review":"This is my favorite album from Mayer. The depth of emotion present on this album really comes through in every song. I've been a fan of JM for several years, and this is the album that made me one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"I am personally a HUGE John Mayer fan! And so you know, the first CD of his that I got was Any Given Thursday, the second was Inside Wants Out and the third, Room For Squares.Having heard AGT and IWO and having gone to one of his concerts, I became completely hooked. Then I got Room For Squares. I'm not a big fan of RFS. In my opinion, it is John's weakest album. It by no means \\"sucks\\", but I don't think it's his best. Thus me being apprehensive about hearing Heavier Things.Well, all that \\"apprehensiveness\\" was for nothing. This CD is wickedly awesome! All of John's songs are great! My personal favorite is 'Daughters', but then again, it's very hard to choose a favorite on this CD.I rarely find a CD that I can put on repeat and not tire of. But this is one of those rare cases. Actually, all of John's records are like that for me (yes, EVEN Room For Squares).So, I strongly urge you to buy Heavier Things. It will be a $13 (or so) very well spent. I'm sure you'll enjoy it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh you naysayers","review":"You gotta love the twits that bash this album. Because this album breaks out at #1 it is no longer \\"cool\\" to like John Mayer because he is no longer their \\"discovery\\". Fact of the matter is , this is a really good cd and still very much in the style of J.M. If the cd is to be faulted in the least is because it is a little more produced. Personaly I prefer the more acoustic side of this artist but I still find this to be an enjoyable listen and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather uninspired","review":"I decided to check out this album due to all the buzz. I was rather disappointed. Mayer may write his own songs, but that's hardly admirable when those songs are uninspired and boring. Lyrically, there are some bright spots, but musically, this album just drags. I would have liked to have seen Mayer challenge himself a bit more. The album feels like he's just phoning it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Heavier Things","review":"I recently bought this album. I was thoroughly dissappointed. I agree with an earlier reviewer that there is nothing on here that truly grabs you. The album felt dark and dour. Way too heavy. A reviewer in the NYT recommended Josh Ritter's new album - much less heavy. Quite a bit more inspiring!. I am on my way now to the used record store for trade in. I am way too heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"What a big yawn this record is. There is nothing and I do mean NOTHING that is appealing about this record. Anybody who rates this cd 2 stars or more, need to get off the caffeine. Currently, I am being tortured everyday because one of my co-workers keep playing this record. And listening to JM, puts me asleep. *YAWN* There she go again----time for a nap. *YAWN*"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"After much skepticism, my girlfriend finally got my into John Mayer. I loved his first album, and was really starting to warm up to him when I bought his follow up album. This album is John Mayer becoming huge and selling out. He was excellent as a charming, humble, down to earth acoustic guitar player, but he flops on this album as an electric guitar playing pop star. A couple songs are good, including the single Bigger Than My Body, but overall this album is nothing like his first effort and will leave you disappointed, maybe even horrified unless you are a die hard John Mayer fan, and even at that, you may find yourself cursing him for being sucked into the over-hyped, over-played bubble gum world of pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly one of the WORST albums of 2003","review":"I liked John Mayer's debut album so I was looking forward to get his new one, Heavier Things, but boy am I disappointed. First of all, as a songwriter, Mayer hasn't improved much from the previous album. That is, the songs are same old mellow songs with similar musical structures. I don't think he put any effort into this album, most of the songs here lack emotions and feels like he put it up there just for commercial purposes.Anyways, if I were you, I would probably borrow the CD from your friend (if he/she has it) and get a sense of songs or buy it at your local used CD store for like .87 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?!","review":"Who buys this kind of stuff? This dude sucks! Plus it sounds like he just gargled with acid, has laryngitis and needs to clear his throat. Total formula crap that my parents used to listen to. This guy sounds just like a rehash of 70's throwback minstrels like Michael Franks (ever hear, \\"Popsicle Toes?\\")and Donovan (\\"Mellow Yellow.\\") Total carbon copy of other such whispering crooners like Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews and Josh Kelly who in my opinion should never have been discovered playing in the corner at Starbuck's or Coffee Junction. I'll be glad when this fad takes a seat next to Joan Baez! Where's John Belushi when I need him to smash this loser's guitar?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover says it all","review":"John Mayer WAS a great acoustic guitarist. Look at the cover, it says it all. He's holding an electric guitar. Then listen to the cd and you even struggle to hear that above the annoying keyboard riffs. Everyone else says this album sucks because its more of the same. I disagree. It sucks becasue Mayer tried to do something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same drivel on each track.","review":"I'm a huge John Mayer fan. So much of a fan that I bought into the hype surrounding this album. There is a certain level of originality I came to expect, perhaps foolishly, of John Mayer- it was not delivered with Heavier Things.Hearing John Mayer sing about the SAME THING (wanting a family, for example) track after track was terribly disappointing. But not nearly as disappointing as the hype surrounding this album. What you see is not what you get. It was mechanically put together and generically bland. But perhaps I'm just bitter about setting myself up for disappointment. I have hope that John Mayer will either return to his former real, raw sound, or listen to his own lyrics, stop writing music, and get that family he really seems to desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had higher hopes","review":"This CD just wasn't as good as his previous work. I may be a little biased since I've seen him play at random bars on Friday nights before he became popular. But it was his acoustic style that has kept me a devoted listener. This CD is much more synthesized. The songs don't have the meaning to the average listener that they have before. Many seem to be about budding fame which is not something I can relate too. Guess it is hard to still be the average Joe when you become a big star."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Mayer does death metal","review":"This album is called 'Heavier Things' because its a death metal record. It is a little too heavy. His heaviest song ever was your 'Body Is A Wonderland' though. That definitely should have been on here. They could have at least included a B2K remix of it. That would rock. Maybe he should go touring with B2K. John Mayer stars in the movie 'You Got Served'. B2K should have though. Buy this cd for hardcore heaviness. B2K rocks too dudes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CANNOT IMPORT TO iTUNES!!!!!!!!!!","review":"PLEASE NOTE THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE A DVD-RW DRIVE AND KNOW THE WORKAROUND, YOU CANNOT CANNNOT IMPORT CD audio INTO iTUNES.NOTE 2: I dont know how to import the DVD audio, so I cant comment on that.Not Amazon's fault, but be forewarned - if you like your iPod, this disc does NOT.Amazon still rocks - but PLEASE put some sort of warning about this issue so that this doesn't happen to others!!--BB"},{"rating":"2","title":"New John","review":"This album is a new John from the old John songs that were are use to. He breaks away from the hopeless-romantic songs, to more songs about life. He also has a different sound, an even better sound with more emphasis and instruments like the horns, and different keyboard sounds. I love this album as much as \\"Room for Squares\\" or \\"Any given Thursday\\" and everyone that's a John Mayer fan will like it too. I even love the title, \\"Heavier things\\" is what this albums about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the \\"Coffee House\\" and onto Heavier Things","review":"I was the first to get this CD in my town, I was looking forward to September 9th all summer because I am a huge Mayer fan. I have heard buzz about it being heavier than the last album, but I had to have it. With that said, I have to say that I was a little disapointed. It's does not sound like John Mayer's style to me. It has more of a heavier feel to me which I guess is what he was going for, but I like the acoustic and more mellow stuff more. Room For Squares has been the soundtrack to my life for the last year and a half but this is just another cd. My advice is to give it a try, maybe it is more your style. But I feel that Mayer has branched from the mellow, \\"coffee house\\" style and is trying to grow musically, and I admire him for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavier Things","review":"This recent work by Mayer illustrates his growth as a musician, along with a new depth at songwriting. The lyrics ring true as his words reach out and grab your soul. Those personal things you long to say have now been said. Beyond the feeling and emotion of the lyrics lays a soundtrack of life's beauty. Although Mayer is long compared to Dave Matthews, he views the world from the inner soul as opposed to examining the outer core. Mayer far surpasses Howie Day, Jack Johnson and every other Matthews wanna be. Mayer's work is compatable to the best of Lennon, Robin Trower, with the flair of McCartney thrown in for good measure. You find your own personal meaning of his words, while remembering every moment of the track. How often do you find an artist that is equal in both lyrics and music? How often do you find an artist whose work never gets old, and is as refreshing as opening a new can of coffee?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid follow up Cd","review":"I once heard an interview with John Mayer after his song, No Such Thing, became a hit that he was terrified of becoming a one hit wonder. Well John can rest easy. The first track, Clarity, is a beautifully arranged song with an almost Van Morrison feel. Bigger Than My Body, Daughters, and Come Back to Bed, also seem likely to have long lives on radio. While this album is not as \\"acoustic\\" as Mayer's previous work, his clever lyrics and deft guitar playing make this a must have for any John Mayer fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garage-sale find","review":"What an interesting concept for an album. Buy an old keyboard from a garage sale and write a song for each \\"rhythm\\" available -- bassa nova, samba, slow rock, pops, etc. Throw in some hand claps, finger snaps, canned saxophone, and you've got a record that all of your adoring fans will waste their money on. This is the end to my defending the critiques of John's detractors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just More of a Good Thing","review":"The Heavier Things album by John Mayer is a great album no matter what anyone says about it being a disappointment. I thought it was every bit as good as Room For Squares. His lyrics are profound and moving, and even though I haven't yet heard his newest album, I am very excited because of what I have heard in Heavier Things. Definitely worth every penny you spend. As kind of a side note, another artist you might want to check out is Brian Clopton. He is an acoustic artist and elements in his music are similar to that of John Mayer. Check him out at www.myspace.com/brianclopton, or at www.brianclopton.com. He is really worth the listen and if you enjoy John Mayer, I'm sure you'll enjoy him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then before:)","review":"this cd is goodi know from having it that it is betterhis first couple were okaybut since he composed his own it has been betterthis is really good and i think that you should buy ityeah john mayer is greatif don't like this review i recommend something like jet or the strokes if you like this style of musichis song daughters is really good and stlinso i recommend this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Heavier here","review":"I was hoping John would go for something a little different with his second album, or at least that it would live up to it's title \\"Heavier Things\\", unfortunately this album does neither. I was hoping we would get at least one or two guitar heavy tracks (since John has been credited as being such an outstanding guitarist), but here we get enough samples and loops to qualify this CD as pop. If you're looking for a repeat of Room For Squares that's what you get here, for many that will be an excellent thing, for me it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the originals","review":"This album is clearly not classic John Mayer style. If you like very pop-like music, then you may enjoy it, but personally, I think it's very disappointing. If you like John Mayer because he sounds different from everyone else, then save your money on this one. There is way too much extra noise in the songs that takes away from his voice and guitar. I'd definitely stick to his old stuff. This album has no heart, and is very stereotypical pop sounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dumb as he looks on the album cover","review":"He sounds just like a cross between Hendrix and Jeff Beck...except he's the digital version whereas the other cats were the whole wave. Trying to sound like Jimi and J. Beck is such an old game.I've got total respect for those players but Mayer's about boring. SRV did the Hendrix thing SO much better than this turd. Mayer is clickety clackety. The notes are there but they've got NO soul in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage do not buy","review":"This cd is garbage. I did want my money back after I heard this. I only gave him one star because I guess he did try to make a good album, or i wouldn't have even given him a star.I don't know what columbia is doing to there artists, The same happened with pete yorn, his first album was awesome, the second was ok, but this second john mayer album is trash, complete trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I am a big John Mayer fan and his Room for Squares album was excellent and moving. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about his new release. There are a couple catchy songs like Clarity and Bigger Than my Body but all in all I was left relatively uninspired. I was expecting something really special but with the re-release of the song \\" something's missing\\" and a number of slow sleepy tunes I have to give this album a big thumbs down. Instead of wasting your money buy the new Stereophonics album, it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"John's CD is not good.

John Mayer is so ugly and his \\"great guitar playing\\" in no way makes up for the total lack of originality.

I can't even believe I have to be subjected to this music."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Mayer \\"Heavier Things\\"","review":"\\"Clarity\\" 3/5\\"Bigger Than My Body\\" 4/5\\"Something's Missing\\" 2/5\\"New Deep\\" 2/5\\"Come Back To Bed\\" 2/5\\"Home Life\\" 1/5\\"Split Screen Sadness\\" 2/5\\"Daughters\\" 1/5\\"Only Heart\\" 3/5\\"Wheel\\" 1/5John Mayer tries to distance himself from the Dave Matthews similarities with this release. This, however, doesn't really come off as a good idea. The album, in my opinion, is very boring in parts and many of the songs sound similar. \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" is really the only standout to me, maybe \\"Clarity\\" as well.Overall rating: Two stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Waste of Money EVER","review":"I loved John Mayer's first album, but \\"Heavier Things\\" is the biggest let down/waste of money ever.Every song sounds like the next. It's the most abrasive dribble I've heard in quite a while.LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT OURSELVES ANOTHER ONE-ALBUM-WONDER.My advice: spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy does not rock","review":"I saw John last night, June 5, 2007, in San Jose. I hadn't heard alot of his material, but did hear that he had alot of talent, so I was looking forward to the show and went with an open mind. I checked around the internet and saw stark differences in how people perceived him; some spoke of Jimi Hendrix, or Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others said he was sugar-coated. So here's the story: this guy does not rock. He is not a blues player. He is what I would call an adult contemporary artist, which to me is one step below soft rock. For example, he did a version of \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\". This has been done by many; my favorite is the Humble Pie version. His version was really bad. Not bad like good, but bad like lame. I could have left then, but stuck it out, and it did not improve. He's got some talent with the guitar, but no notion of what to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only ten songs but...","review":"I'm not a mainstream music type of fella, but there's something catchy about this guy's song writing. The lyrics are interesting and the tempo of his songs are mellow and yet so uplifting. I enjoyed almost every song on his \\"Room For Squares\\" CD, and this release is barely a step behind. The tracks 'Something's Missing' and 'Homelife' I feel are the standouts. As with his last CD, this one takes a couple of listenings to catch the melodies and to appreciate the lyrics. I was also pleased that Mayer didn't change the style of his music in some lame attempt to \\"grow\\" as an artist. If you liked his previous CD's, you'll definitely like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Columbia ruined this kid","review":"Having loved John's earlier work. I cannot tell you how disappointing this album is. It's not the soulful sound of his earlier stuff. The songs all sound the same. Musically lame, mixed for radio crap.It's sounds like a talented artist trapped in a recording contract with no creative control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome artist!!!!!","review":"I purchased this Cd when it was first released & broke it a couple months ago.

The album has a disco feel, especially with the cover, but it is definitely solid and well produced trance. Cd 1 is entitled Gigante and cd 2 is titled Megalounge. Cd 1 has the club feel where cd 2 has the lounge feel. Funkytek & Aria are great tracks on the first disc but every track is decent. The method of fading and then bringing the beat is used a lot on this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"return to form","review":"If you were disappointed with She Has No Strings Apollo, as I was, rest assured the band's not past it. On Cinder they've strayed from the formula of a few long instrumental tracks, but without losing their essence, i.e. emotional, often melancholy songs built around the violin, electric guitar and drums. This album features some more diverse instrumentation (bazouki, bagpipes(!), etc.), vocals on a couple tracks, and none of the songs are more than 4 or so minutes long. So while it does feel different from their previous LP's, it stands up with the best of their work, and, to my relief, bodes well for the future of this genius band."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"i thought this was gonna be the stuffy book of fancy words.... not so. it's really fun. i bought it for a friend, and read it first. enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 of the 6 Balls Were Defective","review":"I received all six balls ordered; however, upon inflating them, I lost 2 balls.

Sonny Fortune's saxophone playing is quite heated on \\"Rebirth\\" and \\"Ebony Queen\\", while Tyner's piano has the presence of an orchestra. But there is also time for reflective playing, as on the piano solo feature \\"A Prayer for My Family\\" and the dreamy \\"Valley of Life\\" (McCoy plays a koto here). The closing title suite really holds together and covers a lot of ground, just like its namesake. If you like this, get the live Enlightenment (also on Milestone); both are exceptional, innovative (!), and acoustic post-bop. (Sadly, Ken Burns hasn't heard them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the boat","review":"I have to tell you...who comes up with the design of this stuff? The nut that made this didn't have a clue.

This recording, while a nice enough piano instrument and fair audio, is played as if \\"Thins\\" is sight reading the music. All the notes are there, just not in the right time.

While I agree with most of the sentiments of the reviewers that gave it unstintingly glowing reviews, I'm finding it a little bit difficult to keep track of the dozens of players (cops, crooks, DAs etc). The author helpfully provides a list of characters at the beginning, but I think that he should throw into the paperback edition a diagram of the Wild Cowboys organization (with the names, aliases, and \\"jobs\\" written in) as well as a chronology of events.

Repentance yes, but not the way she says. Putting God first is a great message, that is why I give this one star. I do believe she has good intentions but does come across a bit legalistic.

The Logitech was hard to find - after going to three local electronics stores (all whose websites said the product was available) I could not find anyone in our town who had one. Amazon was about $15 cheaper anyway, even after shipping.The camera itself is nice and compact. Carrying case avoids it getting scratched and damaged. Video quality is good, even in low light although the low-light adjustment can make the picture a little washed out. Have had problems with static on the audio track - after having to pay a long distance call (no 1-800 number) to Logitech, found out that the speakers on the laptop are interfering with the mic. Have to mute the sound when recording. Kind of a pain if you forget and have to retake video, but an updated driver is supposed to come out soon.All in all, one of the better web cams I have ever purchased/used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"I really like this camera. The only drawback I found is that you can not tilt/move the camera sideways after it is fixed on the laptop screen. You can move it upside down (but not left to right or vice versa). There are several other cameras including some from Logitech which let you do that. You would be better off getting something which you can move sideways and/or upside down. Right now, I have to move the whole laptop left or right to adjust the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!!","review":"First of all I had to go onto the website for instructions on how to install the software and driver for Windows Vista users.

My built in laptop webcam was much better in that regard. It's good for someone who stays still and just speaks into the video.

It does not have a noise canceling device so quite often an echo can be heard. The video is small, grainy, and dark. Although the camera fits nicely on the top rim of my laptop screen, it is not very adjustable up or down/side to side and since the video window is so small, it often sets the subject off to one side or the other instead of centered. The only thing that I like about these 'Quickcam's' is that they are extremely easy and straightforward to use.I ended up purchasing the 'Pro' version of this camera at the same time and have been very pleased with it.

When using the cam with Microsoft's Live Messenger both my system and the other ends computer crashed. This did not result in any major damage and was probably caused by the Microsoft program but I mention it because Microsoft's Live Messenger is a popular program and folks should know that Logitech's webcam software and Microsoft's Live Messenger are evidently not compatible. Overall,I'm disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good webcam for laptop","review":"I bought this webcam to use with my laptop when I am away from home. I have owned several different webcams and my basic needs are a camera that can deliver 640x480 resolution at 30fps. This camera does a good job of delivering that level of service which is enough to provide a relatively smooth picture. The Logitech software for enhancing a picture in low light also works well as does their software that cancels sound loops that would lead to feedback. The one drawback I have found is the mount has insufficient spread to clamp onto my laptop's display frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Quickcam","review":"This camera works very well with my Toshiba computer.

So far, I really love it and the camera is very cute (a lot smaller than what I had imagined). Installing was very easy and very quick. I was concerned about the clip when I read the other reviews, but it fits my Dell XPS M170 laptop very well. I purchased this camera to use with Skype and the quality of the picture is great. Although it seems the picture is better on the receiving end. When I see the image on my screen, it seems grainy to me. I had planned on just using my Logitech mic that I use for gaming but when I called relatives, they said that the mic sounded good and didn't echo. The USB cord is the perfect length since I already have a jumble of wires behind my laptop so that was a plus. Only thing I really would like is auto focus but once you focus it the first time, you don't really need to adjust it anymore.

I am very happy and pleased with it.The microphone works well and it has functioned on all programs and on all connections (messenger, aol, skype, pictures).

I have several warnings for prospective buyers though, everything on this oven gets hot but the handle, the timer is just that a timer when your time is up the oven will not shut off it will keep cooking until you shut it off. The bottom tray cleanout pulls out from the back so you have to take it off the counter to clean it. The middle rack does not pull out when the door is opened like most ovens you will have to get a oven mitt every time to check your food and pull the rack out.

This one STILL has a gap on the right hand side of the door but it is about a sixteenth inch. I am not a professional cook but I think this has to cause uneven cooking and heat loss. This is the second oven I have purchased from Cuisinart; the first one had exactly the same functions but was a little smaller and the door closed fully.I won't buy another product from them but I will always make my purchases from Amazon.

The door has broken on both of them. The spring-loaded arm becomes out of alignment and the door won't close. I was able to fix it by bending the arm assembly for a while, but now it is shot. It also gets extremely hot to touch and the rack/tray does not extend out when the door is opened. You have to use a mitt or pot holder and the tray is awkward to remove as a result.

So I was a little hesitant to buy this unit being from the same people who allowed a toaster that couldn't toast become mass produced. However, this unit received good reviews from consumer reports and from consumers on amazon, and although not the cheapest out there, it wasn't as expensive as some of the other toaster ovens that received good reviews as well such as the Breville toasters. So I decided to get it and so far I haven't been disappointed. The controls are easy to use, it heats up quickly and bakes / toasts evenly. It takes a little longer to toast, but it comes out perfect. We've had it for a few weeks now and have had no problems. Time will tell how long it lasts, but at this point we love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart TOB 195 Exact Heat Toaster Oven Broiler","review":"I ordered this toaster/convection/broiler oven about a month ago and have used all of the features with success.

The end result was a delicious moist breast. i use the toast feature most every morning with various types of bread. I have not yet perfected the timing for these breads but feel that it will come with practice. So far, I have been very happy with this oven and since I mostly cook for only one, it is very useful indeed. It would be very helpful if the manual had more of a variety of recipes or if Cuisinart would provide a separate cookbook for this oven.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who routinely cooks for only one or two persons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart TOB-195","review":"This is an excellent product which does what it says it will.

I bought this oven based on the large number of rave reviews. I'm shocked by the 2 design flaws that seem obvious:1)The metal behind the handle gets extremely hot. If you open the door with your palm down, your knuckles will touch this metal and you will get burned. It seems simple enough to just open the door with palm up, but it took me a few burns to get into the habit of doing that.2) The crumb tray can only be removed from the back.

We bought it at Costco when we started our membership there. I was in love with the looks and the digital controls. The toast over prior to it was an old hand-me-down. I noticed early on that the toaster tray is not easy to remove or put back, and you can't cover it with foil very easily. A few weeks ago it started cooking really, really hot - much hotter than the temperature for which it was set. It would smoke and set off the fire alarm. A few days ago it stopped working. When you pressed Start, it would show 3 dashes and that was it. After several separate attempts, it would decide to work once, and then it would go back to the dashes the next time we tried it.

It is sorta my toy, but being male my own cooking is somewhat limited. Besides bagels, I have used the oven to make toasted cheese sandwiches, toast, warm up left overs such as pizza and hush puppy's, etc. The toaster settings and timer keep me from cremating anything.

It does not work at all if you follow the directions given. They indicate you need to place the toast on the rack at the top of the oven. This does not work!! Instead we place the toast in the middle rack and put the indicator of darkness of toast at its highest level - turn the toaster on and let it run for the full 5:03 minutes and then set it to run again. At about a total of 7:30 minutes we have great toast. We tried to broil chicken and were completely dissatisfied.

I was reading the reviews for Cuisinart and read some negative reviews. I feel that I need to put in my 2 cents. I've had my Cuisinart convection oven for more than 10 years. We always used a mitten to pull the rack out. We treated it as a regular oven. No one in the family ever got burned by the door or the rack. I enjoy the shorter pre-heat time and cooking time. It cost a lot more than a regular toaster oven. But it is well worth the money. It has been paid for by the savings in the electricity. I cannot comment on the durability of Breville Smart Oven because I don't own one. But I can vouch for the durability of the Cuisinart toaster oven.

You can feel the oven door close tight.CONS - None yet.Overall, I am very satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I really thought I would be getting something special. This oven is too small for the standard 9 x 13 baking dish, one shelf (all that comes with it) is not enough because of the drip pan needing to be in the oven when used. Something this expensive should have more design for ease of cleaning. The standard $69 job would do just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you reheat a slice of refrigerated, not frozen, pizza?","review":"We just got this oven. Toast is fine.How do you know what settigs to use to reheat food that has been refrigerated? Over half our toaster oven use is to reheat left-overs. I just burned the crust of a slice of last night's left over pizza. Not only is there no \\"reheat\\" button (except the 24 second one for a slice of toast) there are no instructions in the booklet for reheating. I wish the consumer reports people had taken note of all toaster ovens that do not automatically thrust the rack forward.

The top of the toast is done perfectly, but the bottom is not as toasted. The rack is in the right place, etc... but I notice visually that the elements on top get hotter/redder/brighter than the bottom. Is this normal? Does everyone who says it makes perfect toast have to turn the toast over? I'm trying to figure out if there's something wrong with my machine or if they all work this way. Cuisinart's customer service was completely unhelpful and kept just recommending I play with the toast darkness setting. Is my problem how this appliance works, or do I have a defective one? Any advice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter still likes it a year later","review":"I bought for daughter as a gift and have only used it once.

Even better, if I start it when I take the pizza out of the freezer, it is completely preheated by the time I can put some extra cheese and pepperoni on it.The buttons and digital readouts are easy to use and offer good precision for temperature setting. I haven't been able to find a way to make the timer turn off the oven and that is a minus. It does allow you to chain together button commands for complex cooking programs. This seems overly complicated to me, but I'm just a heat and eat kind of guy. Other folks may find them useful.Overall it exceeded my expectations, and at the price they were already pretty high.

The caution about the door being hot while baking is correct, and care is needed to grab the handle without extending your fingers to touch the door.

It would have ruined it!The main meat of the extras is the documentary \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" about the making and reaction to Timelash. It quite interesting as a bashing of JNT.

For those who are selective in their purchases of Dr. Who videos, this is one worth the money. The only other Colin Baker episode worth the money for selective buyers is Vengeance on Varos. The others are for hard core fans to complete their libraries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great punk/glam album","review":"Think of the B-52's mixed with the Rolling Stones and you have the Dolls.

I enjoy it a lot. Punk owes these guys. Even Johnny Lydon acknowledged that when he blew a kiss to New York on his landmark album. The songs are punchy and reckless. I get the impression that it is all going to fall apart before the cd is finished. Todd Rundgren produces. Why only 1 Star? I don't think the Dolls would want even one star from me. ;-) If you are interested in the nascent punk rock scene of New York of the early seventies, or if you enjoy adventure and risk in your rock 'n roll, this cd will be interesting to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glam Metal","review":"THIS IS NOT PUNK.

Frankly, they were amateurish at best; simply awful on a bad night. And time has changed nothing. This record is tedious bordering on unlistenable noise. What time HAS changed is the reverence and \\"importance\\" people have attached ot them. In reality they were and are at most a footnote on the glam and pre-punk scene. WIth other bands like the Miamis, they tried to be something that they simply wer enever competent or creative enough to be.

The second reason is the songs are amazing and Johnny Thunders is the best guitarist ever if you don't think so just check out his later work (LAMF, So Alone, Que Sera Sera, New Too Much Junkie Business). If you think The Ramones invented punk rock you are dead wrong it all started with MC5 and The Stooges and got really good at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN I SAY I'M IN LOVE, YOU BEST BELEIVE I'M IN LOVE...L-U-V","review":"This little gem introduced the world to the Dolls, too bad the world wasn't ready for them. I don't care how deep the Velvet Underground's songwriting was, or how violent and ludicrous the Stooges were. The New York Dolls were the definitive punk band. And this album stands to that testament. This is the band at it's best,before the drugs and Rundgren hit. Every song is mind blowing, so I won't single any out. If you like the Stones, buy this, if you like punk, buy this, if you like plain ol' good rock, buy this, and if you just like good music in general, buy this. It stands the test of time, and should be included in every music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Dolls - self-titled (Mercury)","review":"Review number 63.Originally unleashed to an unexpected public in summer of 1973,this was of course the glam rocker's very first record.If you think the Stooges were great,step aside,this CD reissue is ALSO a true Proto-Punk classic.

The diolauge goes from extrememly ignorant and childish to very deeply funny. I love the flexibility this movie has from a comedy sense. It covers just about every type of funny you can think of.PROS:extrememly funny, diverse comedy, unique, good actors (i was shocked to see ben stiller appear in this movie!)CONS:i wasn't a big fan of christina applegate, she just seemed annoying to me, some of her lines weren't funny at all, and kind of ruined the movie for me.OVERALL:overall if you like comedy movies and enjoy a good laugh buy this DVD. it is extrememly funny and after watching you will understand the strength of this film! very good, i don't rate 5 stars alot, but i give anchorman: the legend of ron burgundy 5 bright stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden treat","review":"I bought this hoping for an extra joke or two on the soundtrack but then it turns out its a whole comedy album with all new material not in the movie.

Horrible presentation.","review":"I tend to buy movie soundtracks for music that I can toss into an iPod mix and enjoy with other tunes. This soundtrack has some great music, but nearly every track has voice over from \\"Ron Burgundy\\" trying way too hard to be funny; making this soundtrack completely unlistenable after the first play through. It would be an awesome album if the vocal tracks were separate from the music and you never had to listen to \\"Ron\\" ever again (unless you really wanted to), but the character voice over bleeds into the music. You have to suffer the same tired jokes and decreasingly funny quips every time you try to listen to this collection.The songs are worthy of FIVE STARS, but the presentation absolutely destroys them. This may be the most disappointing soundtrack that I have ever purchased. DO NOT waste your money on this soundtrack; but buy these songs separately. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect way to ruin 12 good songs","review":"The movie, awful, the soundtrack GREAT! The CD awful.

I remember playing with it's quality predecessor as a child. These memories were dashed by the shoddy workmanship evident by the makers of this \\"product\\". The connectors were too short and were seperated by the slightest bump. There were not enough tube connectors to build a tower of any great height. Even the marbles were of different sizes and shapes which prevented a proper roll even if the tower managed to hold together. This toy is a total waste of money and I will be returning it shortly. The company should spend a few more cents and make a quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun (and educational, too)!","review":"I bought this marble run for classroom use, but I enjoy using it myself. I'm working on my teacher's certification and bought this as an activity for a unit I designed on the six simple machines. I think it's a wonderful hands-on way for students to learn about inclines and such. Truth be told, I'm infatuated with it. The colors are very eye-catching and it's great fun to work with. I can't wait to use it in the classroom. Another reviewer suggested buying two sets, which is a good idea. If you know a child who likes building toys (blocks, Legos, etc.), get them this marble run. I loved that stuff as a child (still do) and I truly enjoy this marble run."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Still (Secretly) Enjoy This","review":"I'm not certain that the product I own is the exact one advertised because my parents bought me the toy when I was four or five and that was well before the 90's. Anyhow, the set I had was quite similar, or at least the same concept. I have to admit, no toy thrilled me quite the way my marble run did. I spent hours building unique structures for rolling my marbles down. I'm not exactly sure what the appeal was, but it was very neat to build something yourself, drop the marble in at the top and then watch and listen to it roll all the way down. I guess it's appealing in the same way that those wacky gumball machines at malls are. Anyhow, it was a great toy, entertained me for hours, and seems to be timeless. Significantly more educational than watching television or playing video games and far more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are 40,000 things wrong with this album","review":"Steve won some talent show in Europe a couple of years ago.

It combines the stylus movements with the buttons without making it hard or complicated.The story is whole new and the gameplay is great.One of its downsides is that, unlike past Pokemon games, here you can't take pokemon with you through the game, they will only help you once and then they're gone.You will only have one Pokemon partner at all times, and you can't chose it its pluse for girls and minun for boys, those are the only downsides here.It'a a fun game to past free time and will entertain kids for hours, the downsides are minimal if you compare them to the good points. Overall a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks","review":"this is one of the worst video games ive ever played and i love pokemon games this game is retarded"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"I bought my DS & it came with the pokemon rangers game. I thought that it would be similar to the old blue & red versions but it was nothing like them. the game has you use your stylus & you move it around the pokemon a couple of times & you \\"catch\\" them. Now in this game you dont catch pokemon, you can only have one pokemon friend & all the others you catch get released back into the wild after they help you(if a water pokemon helps put out a fire he leaves). The game play was very boring and to my surprise the graphics are slightly better than the original games, which is surprising due to the system that it is made for. Essentially a small child, 8 or under, would probably have fun with this game(which is who this game is made for anyways) but if your looking for game play like the originals where you have to improve your pokemon & catch them, then stay with the GB Advance games."},{"rating":"1","title":"I broke my DS with this game!","review":"I rented this game from Blockbuster, and it seemed like a good game, until I started capturing Pokemon. You have to spin the stylus to capture the Pokemon, and that spinning motion broke my DS touchscreen. It wouldn't detect the touches right after that game, and calibrating wouldn't do anything. I ended up sending it back to Nintendo to get the touchscreen replaced. If you don't want to have a broken DS, don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exculde the Game!!","review":"My friend got this game for her birthday and she wouldn't stop playing it!!! I had saw it on tv and thought it looked really cool. But next week at school, she said you could save in only certain spots and that she just finished the intro! I imedentily took it off my christmas list. So this game I think is a WASTE OF MONEY! Use it on a better game like Mario Kart DS."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 9 year old's opinion...","review":"A lot of fun. Worth buying. Alittle confusing but that is the point of the game. I would recommend it. I have had it for awhile and I still enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy pokémon :)","review":"I've been told that the game is a bit too short, but I have not beat it yet, so I'm still enjoying it. It's a very interesting concept that you have to draw circles around the Pokémon until it's successfully befriended. In the other games I always thought \\"Isn't it kind of mean taking a Pokémon away from its wild home and making it listen to you?\\" I always put it off. But in this game, they get to go back to where they came from, so that there are no hard feelings. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"The graphics are great, however, it take almost an hours worth of playing before your past the instructional stage.I did not like it because the character is not independent and the whole game seems tightly structured so far. I love how in the older games you got to walk around wherever you pleased. In this game, that does not happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This isn't as good as the other Pokemon games on the market. Gameplay is a bit boring at times. Nice collection of Pokemon, but ultimately the only reason I spent so much time on the game is to get a Manaphy for my Pearl and Diamond games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely, Awesome!!!","review":"~I love using the touch screen when capturing the pokemon! It's way more different than the old Pokemon games...you don't get to keep the Pokemon. You catch and release them after they've helped you...I love it!!! This is a MUST-HAVE for your Christmas list, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, yet very dissapointing","review":"Being a huge fan of normal pokemon games I expecteed this one to be a lot of fun, it was a huge dissapointment. Once you get to the part where I am and you have to catch a stupid Salamence you'll never want to play again. I have put over 6 hours into trying to catch the dang thing and I have practicly broken my DS lite through anger. Just trust me If your buying this game because you like d p or and other pkmn games then dont! I want ppl 2 C this so plz say u thought it was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pokeman Ranger Review","review":"This game is not what mainstream gamers like, but this game was in good condition. Used, but it included a usable Club Nintendo points and USABLE Manaphy I can transfer to Pokemon Diamond/Pearl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, it isn't worth a cent and a minute of your time.","review":"Pokemon Ranger has to be one of the shittiest and most pointless editions to the Pokemon franchise ever. All you do is run around the world controlling pokemon by circling them time and time again. This could take you 40 hours to complete with constant stress and a story you will most likely forget in 2 days. The graphics are a piece of garbage, tutorials are a piece of shit. 47 bucks for a game that came out 4 YEARS AGO!!! Bioshock 2 is only 10 dollars and it was made in 2010. Seriously nintendo review your prices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This game is really good, from touch screen usage to capture pokemon to each pokemons special abilities. Personally, my favorite part is that you can get a Manaphy and send it to your Pokemon Diamond or Pearl.The storyline is good, and you still have things to do after the game is over. After you do that, then there is nothing to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, But Still Lots of Fun....and Manaphy Too!","review":"Ranger isn't your typical Pokemon game. Yes, you go around and capture Pokemon as usual, but you don't 'battle' like in games past. Instead you use your stylus to 'capture' your Pokemon friends. You don't keep them for the whole game either, you'll only use them to help you on missions and then they are released. It's a totally different Pokemon game than in the past, but it's still lots of fun! It's a little short though, only about 10 hours for the main story. You can still go back once you beat the game and do a few special missions or try to 'catch em all' and fill your browser if you're so inclined. There's also a special mission to unlock and capture a Manaphy egg once you beat the game. Once you have the egg, you'll be able to transfer it over to the new Pokemon Pearl or Diamond and hatch your very own Manaphy. It's going to be the only way to 'catch' Manaphy in Diamond and Pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think..","review":"Well, I'm getting this game, and I think it is going to be a blast. I'm a true pokemon fan. The reason to me why gamefreak made this is because of the Manaphy egg. Manaphy is one of those new pokemon in the soon upcoming game, Diamond and Pearl. Only some, or a lot, of people know about this, its been rumored that you have to put a special code to get the Manaphy egg. Note, you have to transfer the Manaphy egg to Diamond or Pearl to make it hatch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but needs better time-lines","review":"The reviews are ok, but they ALL need dates since you have NO idea when any of the comments were made or if they are in any kind of order. There are comments that say a particular place is open, closed, under new management, shut down for the season all for the same place and without any dates. You have NO idea what is going on. or if the comment is from 1996."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"The information contained appears to no longer be updated per the actual research of the author, but rather updated via input from emails submitted by readers. Thus alot of the information is severely outdated or wholly inaccurate. At least the restaraunts I visit regularly turned out to be when I looked them up. One had been closed for several years, but still showed up in the text. This could potentially result in a hundred dollar trip to a vending machine, if the pilot were to go on the information in the book without actually calling ahead. Would be better if the \\"Author\\" actually researched each locale, and submitted updating information and ratings. Pilots spend alot of time, money, and effort making sure all the information they have regarding a flight is up to date and accurate, and I imagine this would be as dissapointing to more pilots than myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite up to date","review":"This book is fun to read. Not sure that all the information is up to date. Think I would cross check the restaurants with Google's new global search engine before I left the ground just to be sure they still exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the library...","review":"This book has a brisk, no nonsense attitude to encourage positive training. I like the easy references (and cross references), so that you can go directly to the behavior you're interested in right away, and also the insightful explanations. A very useful addition to the shelf. They do often proceed from the starting point and may not be able to solve deeply ingrained problems (and of course I disagree with their assertion that shelter dogs are a bad bet; quite the opposite!), but I find it helpful to consult a variety of books when sizing up a situation, and these writers present some original ideas and creative solutions (without clickers or \\"training\\" collars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely even addressed a MAJOR dog problem - barking!","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in this book, and that the authors don't further address the problem of overzealous barking in dogs. Their advice? Walk the dog more so it's not bored. Yeah... that's great except my dog gets two hours of exercise daily along with tons of doggie puzzles and stimulation and STILL she barks at every noise she hears outside. She barks inside, outside, EVERYWHERE. It seems like she's trying to \\"alert\\" me to something. I don't reward the behavior and STILL SHE PERSISTS. And she's otherwise a very calm dog, and definitely not bored. They barely dedicate a paragraph to one of the MOST frustrating and hard-to-fix of all dog problems. I almost want my money back, I'm so irritated.
