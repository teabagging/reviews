Aaack! If we had a fridge for it all to stay on (which...I hate to day...would not thrill me...I thought I would miss all the pics on the old fridge but stuff always fell / knocked off, and now I have it all in a display area by the fridge, as easy to see but easier to keep neat), and our kid hadn't already learned the abc's prior to receiving as a gift, it might have been fine, we do like many of the other leap frog brand items. It took me 4 months to find 90% of the letters to donate, I hated to donate without all the letters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks!","review":"We were very excited by this toy -- or at least, by the idea of the toy. We have friends who bought a similar product from a different company and they love theirs. But when we got ours in the mail and set it up on the frig... it didn't work.

I used to supervise him during his play because he could fit the letters in his mouth. It was a great distraction when I was making dinner. He has always loved this toy and has been playing with it every day since then. He is now 18 months old and knows most of his letters by sight. He also knows the phonics of about half of the alphabet. I am amazed at this! I didn't know he was actually retaining any of the information from this toy but I guess I was wrong! I highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy is great; LeapFrog support is not. Check your product immediately after purchase.","review":"I'm being stingy with my stars for the review of this toy, not because it is a poor toy - it's not. My daughter loves it and plays with it often and, having just turned 2, loves singing along with the tunes.My problem is that our fridge phonics did not have all 26 letters; they had 2 G's and no S. My 4-year-old is bummed that he can't spell his name. But when I contacted LeapFrog support, their reply was \\"sorry, you'll have to return the whole thing, with the receipt, to the location at which it was purchased.\\" Well, it was a gift, purchased in another state, so that's not possible, and it's galling that we can't just get a replacement S.

As we took it out of the box and started putting in the letters the hand held toy would say the wrong letter. After putting in all 26 letters only a handful of the letters were identified correctly by the toy. My poor 3 year, old who knows his letters, was getting confused when he put in the letter E and the toy said \\"G\\". We just packed up the toy and returned it for a totally different new toy. I was told by several other Mom's that there Leap Frog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Set did the same thing. Buyer beware. Stick with the Phonics Radio by Leap Frog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if it worked...","review":"I have a friend whose child's Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Set works great. Ours refers to most letters as an E or an F any letter after L it just makes a digging sound. I have ensured that the buttons aren't stuck, so I know that isn't the problem. I know my son enjoys this toy as he has played with it before. I am just frustrated that I have to drive 30 minutes to exchange it.My advice is to test it before you leave the store even though you shouldn't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaching wrong letters","review":"I bought one of these for my two year old son thinking that it would be a great learning toy. He had about a week before I noticed that some of the letters were saying they were another letter. I wrapped it back up, brought it to the store for an exchange and when I got home and opened the second one the same thing happened. Out of the 11 letters I tried only 4 gave the correct letter. I do not recommened this toy for anyone and if you do make sure that you check all of the letters before letting your child play and be taught the wrong alphabet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jump away from this LeapFrog junk!!","review":"This is a big disappointment!! When we set it up, 16 of the letters give the wrong response. In example, my 3 year old put the letter \\"T\\" in and it said \\"L says...\\" So we tried the letter H. It said \\"I says...\\"It was so pathetic that my 3 year old said... \\"It is broken.\\" and then walked away. We tried new batteries and still it gave the wrog responses. Some letters had no response at all, just a beep.When you see this product from LeapFrog, jump to a different toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jen from NY","review":"Wonderful toy. I never write reviews, however I read some of the other reviews about people having trouble with the machine confusing the letters. My Firdge Phonics had the same problem. I knew that Leapfrog is too good of a company to make a toy that teaches the wrong letters. I called the 1-800 number and they corrected the problem immediately. There are 6 prongs on the part where you put the letters in. If any of them are stuck, it doesn't work properly. I simply ran my fingers over the prongs and it corrected the problem. Now, all 26 letters work perfectly!! Hopefully the other reviewers will come back and read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, but.....","review":"This toy is awesome, don't get me wrong. However, for a toddler just learning his phonics, it can be confusing. It gives you several sounds for some letters. (ie: the O says \\"Oh\\" and \\"ah\\") The long vowel sound can be very confusing for a little one who is just being introduced to phonics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Learning Product","review":"This product is wonderful for your child to learn there ABC's.

I recommend it, though. A great educational toy to have in the kitchen. Great idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GREAT GREAT!","review":"I saw this toy at a friend's house. My children loved it so I bought one. They still love it! In addition, children that come to my house love it too. The magnets are nice and big so they are easy to manipulate into the base. Also, they are big so they don't slide UNDER THE FRIDGE!!! Big bonus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my 2 1/2 year old loves the Scout toys!","review":"I love almost everything about this toy, if I could change one thing it would be to hide the volume control switch!

My 2-year old son got the toy for his 2nd birthday and played with it a lot the first day. He even figured out how to turn it on and off. By the 3rd day this toy's batteries were dead. We replaced them and a day later they were dead again. My son still likes to play with the magnetic letters and move them around our refrigerator, but keeping up the battery maintenance was impossible. We were replacing them several times a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design. Does not work well. Shame on Leapfrog.","review":"Go instead with the Leap Frog Phonics Radio which is a terrific toy.The magnetic letters on the Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Set don't make good contact with the \\"reader\\" and the sound is either absent, or it reads out the wrong sound for that letter!It was a good idea, but very poorly executed by Leap Frog. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"played letters incorrectly","review":"My 2 year old immediately starting playing with this set and has continued to do so over the next 4 months. The problem is that at least half of the letters played the incorrect sound. For example a \\"C\\" would say it was a \\"K\\" etc. I hid all the letters that played incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all","review":"I don't know if our local retailer got a bad batch of these or what, but we purchased 2 of these sets (and returned two) because the base was mixing up the letters.

Does anyone else have problems with Leapfrog?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with product!","review":"I bought this product for my 2 year old son...when I unpacked the set and began to use it we discovered that 15 of the letters made the wrong sounds!

This particular retailer is more than double other retailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WILL SCRATCH YOUR STAINLESS STEEL FRIDGE!!!","review":"We bought this for our two year old and after a couple days of playing I looked at one of our fridge doors and there are scratches ALL over it. If it's dark in the room you can't see the scratches but as soon as the light shines in the kitchen they stand out like a soar thumb. It's a fun toy but only for fridges that aren't stainless!! I'm so frustrated!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - doesn't anyone else find this toy annoying?","review":"I bought this for my kids and after an hour I couldn't take the noise this toy makes any longer! I feel that Fisher Price makes better toys that make more tolerable sounds - this toy has an annoying voice and song. I think the best method for learning the alphabet is sitting down and learning wit an actual person, not a loud, annoying toy. I am going to concentrate on buying wooden toys from this point on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Test in the store before you buy!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this after having several friends tell me that it was wonderful for their kids. I brought it home and opened it to find out that half the letters didn't work, and the ones that did work, made the wrong sound. ie. you put the \\"C\\" in and it says \\"F says fffff\\". I had to return it 4 times before I got one that worked properly.Now, since I JUST got one that worked, my daughter hasn't tried it. I have heard alot of good things about it so I will try it with her. Just be aware when you buy it that it might not work, and you might be teaching your child Leap Frog's new phonetical language!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN","review":"Too bad the lowest rating is 1 star, because it deserves no stars. One of every three letters was wrong. I wonder how many parents take the time to look at this learning toy. Do you want your child confusing 1/3 of the alphabet? When my son put the X into the thing, it said, \\"T\\". I was alarmed, so I put each of the letters in, finding a whopping 9 pieces that were wrong! I repeated the test with the same results. There are fresh batteries in the toy too. I'm appalled that this item is not recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uppercase Letters","review":"I guess I should have looked closer at all of the pictures, including the ones at the bottom of the description. I just saw the ones at the top in the main list of pictures and saw the lowercase letters. That's the whole reason I ordered it. The one I got is all uppercase. I guess that's what mean by \\"styles may vary\\"? Teaching uppercase letters only, or primarily, can cause serious reading delays and issues. Most letters in reading and writing are lowercase and lowercase letters should be the focus for teaching letters initially. Going to see if another store has this with the lowercase version that I can exchange, or I'll have to send it back to Amazon. Bummed."},{"rating":"1","title":"400% Price Increase","review":"WHAT IS UP WITH THIS PRICE!! I had this item in my cart for $14.99, then got a message 2 days ago it had gone up to $15.99 since placing it in my cart, now I see it is $76.00!!!! WHAT THE...???!!! I guess I should have hurried up and checked out before the 400% price increase. THANKS, BUT NO THANKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I bought this toy and was all excited. I grabbed my son and brought him to the fridge only to watch him put the \\"N\\" in and hear it say \\"Y\\". Safe to say I quickly boxed it up and returned it. It's hard enough trying to teach a child without confusing them. I also bought the other Leap Frog 3 word speller for the fridge but I didn't even bother opening it. They are the same principle and obviously I'm not the only person that's had this problem. I highly do not recommend this toy, but I do love most of Leap Frog's toys, just not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"educational for my grandson","review":"I am happy with my purchase. I bought it for my grandson who is a busy little guy....18 months old. Wanted to have something for him to play with, nearby me or my daughter, in the kitchen so we could keep our eye on him better while cooking/cleaning. Education while playing.... what's better than that? He quickly learned to put the letter in the cutout, and the button to push to play the ABC song. Wish there were a couple more songs though. He does get excited and pushes all the letters off the refrigerator, then picks them up one by one and puts them back on. They seem durable enough so far. The doghouse magnet seems a good strength. He hasn't tried to push that off yet. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 30 minutes","review":"We received this as an Easter gift, and it stopped working in 30 minutes after my toddler accidentally dropped it on the floor from 1.5 feet off the refridgerator. We called Leapfrog to see if they would replace it, but they would not due to the possibility of \\"abuse\\" on the toy. Well, anyone that has a toddler knows that they are not gentle with toys, so if the craftmenship is inadequate, the toy will break. We will not buy from Leapfrog in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but buy \\"Word Whammer\\" instead","review":"This is a great little toy that sings a song for each letter you place in the slot (B...B says Buh, B says Buh. Every letter makes a sound, and B says Buh). It will also sing the ABC song. It sounds great, and it has two volume settings which comes in handy from time to time. I really do love it. I loved it enough that I bought the Leapfrog Word Whammer set also. The Word Whammer eliminates the need for the Fridge Phonics set, and my son no longer plays with the plain phonics set. The Word Whammer will still sing songs for the individual letters, but it will also let you make 3-letter words. The Whammer also has a find-the-letter game and a spell-the-word game. My 18-month-old son loves playing with it even though he doesn't yet know his letters, and my friend's 4-year-old daughter also loves playing with it and showing off her skills. If you'll only buy one, buy the Word Whammer set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!!","review":"This was a gift given to my son before he turned 2. HE LOVES IT! He plays with it while I cook and it continutes to occupy his time, even though he's had it for several months. He LOVES singing along with the toy, and is now well ahead of other kids his age, recognizing ALL the letters and most of their sounds! He picks up packages and reads off the letters of words on the package! Unbelievable! Buy it! It's wonderful!! And it's never too early! The toy teaches the names of the letters, the sounds they make, names of numbers, counting to said number, and the alphabet song. A great, great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this toy!","review":"Excellent toy. My 24 month old has been playing with it since the first day! We are amazed how quickly he learned the alphabet. The toy is very durable. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"In the past I used this toy with my preschool children and the loved it. Now that I am a grandmother I purchased one for our grandson and he loves it too. The letters are easy for small hands to manipulate. The song is easy for him to remember and he enjoys learning the sounds the letters make too. I only wish that the upper and lower case letters came with these sets. I know they can be purchased seperately but I would pay more to have them all together. Children need to recognize both the upper and lower case letters before they go to school. It makes reading so much easier if they recognize both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My son likes to listen to the ABC song, and he already can prounance A after few days, it is a great product and hope my son can continue to learn more letters from this set...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Concept","review":"We received this as a gift, but unfortunately the \\"F\\" said \\"S\\", and the \\"D\\" said \\"A\\".

Very nice concept, I just wish it worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to know the trick.","review":"My son received this as a gift. We opened it and it didn't work. It said the wrong letters. After trying the alcohol trick (didn't work!)I exchanged it and the second one had the same problem. I read the reviews on here and one of them said to use tweezers to pull out the tabs. I looked and sure enough, one of them was stuck. After alot of poking and tweezing, I finally got it unstuck. It's been working fine this evening. Hopefully it will continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is defective","review":"I purchased this for my granddaughter. When she started playing with it, I quickly discovered about 10 of the letters played the wrong sound, for example, if you put the \\"A\\" in, it says the letter \\"C\\". I am returning this product as I think this will be very confusing to a toddler trying to learn the alphabet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts A Smile On My Son's Face Everytime!","review":"We just gave this to my son a couple of days ago and he can't get enough of it. At 22 months, he only knows about 10 of his letters. He is so eager to learn with this toy. It is very clear and simple what it is teaching you, which is the name of each letter and the sound(s) it makes. The short song that goes with each letter is catchy and not annoying. This toy also gives my son something to do while I'm cooking or doing the dishes. He can be near me, but not be underfoot. I've purchased other Leapfrog toys that are only so-so, but I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool!","review":"The kids love this toy! I run a daycare and it's a hit w/ all of them!!

He was playing with it this morning and enjoying searching for letters. I only wish that they had added some additional language to each letter. For example, instead of just saying \\"a\\" and the \\"ahh\\" sound, it would have been helpful to say \\"apple\\", etc.Other than that I think it is good, probably even better for slightly younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG HIT with ALL!","review":"I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas last year when she was 3 1/2. She LOVED it! And so did her 4 1/2 year old twin brother & sister! They played with it all the time, for months. It helped them learn their letters & colors. It made their mom happy that it kept them occupied while she was in the kitchen & they were learning something at the same time. Last week I just ordered another one for my other set of twin grandkids (boys) who will be 3 years old next week, but seeing that the price has dropped again, I think I might order another, so they will each have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for learning letters and sounds","review":"My son received this as a gift when he was barely two. He loved it then, and has played with it on a daily basis since. He is now walking around the house singing \\"the E says eh\\" and knows 90% of his letters, and is only 2 1/2. The base of the toy, which plays the music, is a very strong magnet, and will not fall off the refrigerator....it is sometimes hard to PULL it off, so there is little chance of it falling off and breaking. Also, the letters are large enough to pose little to no choking threat, unlike many other magnetic letters. They also stick stronger than most alphabet magnets, so they are not falling off and getting lost all of the time.This is a GREAT toy, fun, and educational. I can't wait to get the new product that allows children to put three letters together to spell words!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On the GO GO GO Boy LOVE THIS!!","review":"I just got this for my son two days ago and he plays with it all the time. He is very active and just runs around all day. The only toys he plays with are cars so the fact that he even gives this any attention at all has me thrilled!The letters are a great size for little hands to grab and it sounds amazing. The magnets are strong enough to stay on the fridge without falling off too which is a problem I had with other magnetic sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"We have both of the Fridge Phonics sets and they are a HUGE hit with out young children. My youngest knew the letter names and sounds by the time he was 2 years old. My 4 year old is spelling 3-letter words and my 6 year old uses the magnets alone to spell larger words. Even better - they think it's a BLAST! Thank you, LeapFrog!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a great toy. My son began to pronounce letters very soon after he started playing with it. Its great to keep him occupied in the kitchen while Im doing dishes or cooking too. Definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful entertainment for an 18 month old","review":"Actually a toy that can capture my 18 month old daughters attention and retain it for more than five minutes. She absolutely loves the Fridge Phonics letters - they are big enough for her hands to grasp off the fridge and manipulate into the base magnet. She actaully can sing the majority of the ABC song that the Fridge Magnet plays. I would highly recommend this toy for any age toddler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INVESTMENT","review":"My son got this for X-mas at 19 mo. old. He loves this toy! It's wonderful how it puts the letters into songs, he knows mostof his alphabet now and his set came with numbers also"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teaching letter sounds","review":"My daughter got this as a Christmas gift when she was 16 months old. Three months later, she can identify several letters and their sounds on a consistent basis.

It's very easy to use and teaches motor skills along with hand eye coordination. You have to put the blocks in a certain way for them to play..or should I say turn them the right way. The song is simple and the same for all letters so it's easy to learn all letters by just changing the sound of each different letter. The ABC song is very easy as well for young ones to learn. They do get a little messy and spread quickly through the house...but hey so would the plastic magnetic letters and number you buy for $5 bucks. This is a much better value for the lessons taught to little ones. Oh and it has volume control...all parents love volume control!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful learning tool!","review":"My four year old LOVES this thing!! We bought it when he was two and a half and still plays with it. Within a month of playing with it, he knew all of his ABC's by name. The only disadvantage to this toy is that it does not come with a bag for all of the letters--so either all of the letters are strewn ALL over the fridge or you find them under the couch, in the cupboards, etc. But a great learning toy and well worth this minute disadvantage. Has a catchy toon also, you too will be singing along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEPS UM BUSY WHILE MOMMY COOKS","review":"I purchased this toy for Christmas. My son was only 18 months at the time. Now, a month later, he still plays with it, especially while I am in the kitchen cooking. It keeps him very busy, and he is always nearby so I can still keep my eye on him. Since he is still young (I think the rec age is 2+), he does have difficulty putting the letter in the magnetic holder/unit, but once he or I get them in, he enjoys the song it plays. He already learned a few letters-I am very impressed with this toy. It has a medium and hi volume control which is also great. Also, the pieces are a good size, safe for his age, and can find the pieces easy if lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Instrumental and Vocal Combination Makes Head Spin","review":"After hearing Tommy Guererro's first album, I didn't think that there could be another like it. I was wrong! The follow up to his debut is incredible. The skateboarder turned songwriter absolutely kills it in this mixture of jazz and guitars. The lyrics to \\"Mechanisms\\" are mezmorizing.

His minimalist lounge affair \\"A Little Bit of Somethin'\\" done on his home 4-track as I understand was blissful and original. It was basically him and his guitar with a dimensional layering and the intricate melodies were hypnotizing. Don't mistake his other work with this. This is some trip-hop attempt at Acid Lounge. It is not creative or conceptual but very repetitive. It is dark and cold, but not in a good way. It is dark and cold like mold in the basement. The weakness of the breakbeats becomes quickly apparent as you scroll through the CD wishing you could jam to something but not quite finding it.

Where many of her novels have modern (for the time) heroines, fighting villains in the form of thieves, murderers, selfish relatives, whatever, Gillie has less obvious battles to fight. Set in post-World War II England, where rationing still held sway and everyone knew their neighbors, Thornyhold is much like it's heroine: deep, introspective, self-depreciating, and ultimately, quietly triumphant -- much like their author.If you are looking for excitement, battles, gunfights, and torrid love affairs, it isn't for you.

Gospel, especially Old-Time Gospel is music of the soul, sung from the heart. Neither heart nor soul can be found in these arrangements. I would compare the redition of these classics to fast food, but that wouldn't really be fair, since fast food has some nutritional value.

However, it's a baby bracelet, not childrens which it says in the title. Luckily, I'm a pretty experienced jeweler myself, so I was able to disassemble it and rebuild large enough to fit her (she's only 10 but it was waaaaay too small originally). She loved it, and I was able to make her a pair of matching earrings to go with it. All in all, we were very satisfied, but others might not be if they are expecting it to fit a child above the age of 1. I think it would be wise to change the title to \\"baby bracelet\\" though. Even the packaging that comes with it, states \\"baby bracelet\\" not children's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ALBUM","review":"This album is especially good because Coco exhibits a great talent. Track three is cool because it is R&B influenced--Destiny's Child-ish. It actually has the same plot a \\"Say My Name\\". Track 8 it a bit weird but its beats are good. The beats on track 8 resemble those of Jennifer Lopez's music--very complex. Track 10 is nice and relaxing--calm like \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" only she doesn't breathe after each little word as on \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Christina Augluilera's in for some BIG competition and Britney and Mandy are left in the dust! Coco is EXTREMELY SOULFUL. I like this album even though I speak English and the album is in Mandarin.

While I could calculate how my Mercury can be quincunx to my Saturn, it would have helped if I could see a picture of such planetary positions. In addition, I found the book to be helpful in a general sort of way, but it did not offer much practical advice. Still, it was nice to have women-oriented astrological interpretations, although they were rather weakly expressed.

They come 3 to a package so I am saving the other 2 in case he is reinfested. Cats get tapeworms from ingesting fleas, so now I have to figure out how to keep the fleas off once it gets warm again.

It worked immediately. By the next day, there were no tapeworms visible in her stool. I was thrilled, but wished I had ordered it from Amazon and waited for delivery. I paid twice as much as I would have with Amazon. I won't make that mistake again.The only issue is that, as others have mentioned, it is difficult to get the cat to take the pill.

They had the little rice looking worms which I think are the tape worms. Either way, these pills are good for tape as well as ring worms. Anyway, they worked. The vet is just going to give your cat one of these and then hand you a bill for 75 bucks. I'm not suggesting never bringing your cat to the vet. I bring both of mine all the time, but these are worth a shot.

The \\"tape worm tabs\\" required getting one tablet into each cat's mouth (a dangerous job but thankfully the tablets were small) and then within three days, the gross sesame-seeds were gone.

The book is about college kids on a road trip that run afoul of an ancient mummy or curse or something. It was really too short to be called a novel but the publisher did add a little novella at the end to keep us from feeling truly ripped off. They shouldn't of bothered. This was much worse than Attraction. Called Necromancer, it was just plain dull. Truth be told, I couldn't finish it.

In addition to this wonderful portrait of a family, the reader becomes acquainted with a voice not often heard in \\"mainstream\\" Western literature, the voice of the black African woman. Zenzele's mother tells her own story, that of a woman who, though not a foot soldier in the struggle against colonization, nevertheless plays a vital role in the fight for independence.

Believers and disbelievers alike will find no substantive information on the subject. What you will find are Roach's endless ramblings and anecdotes leading to no conclusion. Roach comes off sounding like a bad comedienne, spending her time meandering about here and there seeking out people that she can ridicule rather following any real research methods. Her overuse of \\"amusing\\" footnotes does nothing for her already weak manuscript. This is not to say that Roach does not have some talent as a writer. But her skills might be put to better use writing political satire or humorous essays. As someone who has done a fair amount of research on this subject, I found this book offensive in it's frivolity.

Spook is unquestioningly the too quickly researched and written book with the offensive and misrepresentative title. Ms.Roach is neither amusing nor wry or even especially skeptical in her treatment of other worldly matters and her crisp intelligence, so abundant in Stiff, is hardly present. She obsesses about irrelevancies like ectoplasm but happily skips through more meaningful subject matter such as reincarnation and serious, known psychics like Alison du Bois of whom Ms.Roach merely presents as being all too pretty. Ms.Roach is altogether too sneering to a variety of personages in Spook in a way that made me cringe on her behalf. Yikes! What gives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"This is the second Mary Roach book I started reading and could not finish. Not because the topics themselves were touchy, it was because of the way the topics were written. I was bored beyond belief!!

It's not even close. Yes, it's billed as that with the science tackles the afterlife subtitle but you probably need to think about Penn and Teller's Showtime series. It's more along those lines. It's not supposed to be serious but it's not funny either. So I'm not sure where Mary Roach wanted to go with this book. It's awful. She uses Google as her sources but yet she attempts to tackle a serious subject and speaks to serious people. Not sure. Just didn't enjoy this book. I doubt I try another one of her books even though friends have said that Stiff is better. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I found the book to be glib, superficial and wholly inadequate to the fascinating task of ascertaining the evidence or lack thereof of paranormal phenomena. It was more about Ms. Roach than the subject at hand which was primarily relegated to the status of prop to showcase her dry, sarcastic and ultimately dismissive humor.Anyone who is truly interested in this subject should read the truly superb \\"GhostHunters\\" by Deborah Blum which is a page turning and fascinating account of William James' attempt, in the company of several other prominent scientists, to establish the existence of life after death through scientific methods. Once you are introduced to the remarkable Leonora Piper, a 19th century medium, you will never be able to casually dismiss such phenomena again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor needed","review":"Spook is marred by the kind of humour we find in most college newspapers, to the point that it intrudes so far upon the subject, afterlife research, as to render the actual topic secondary to the attempted humour.

I applaud her for diving right in and experiencing ghost hunting adventures and talking to researchers, but Mary seems to have no respect for people of other cultures or beliefs. BTW I am not a believer, but she should \\"grow up\\" as another reviewer put it. These people are giving her their time, and seem honest and sincere about what they are doing. Mary is not as cute as she thinks she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Perhaps because it was a new york times bestseller, or because someone I know recommended her as an author, i came to the book with high expectations. The book is a fast, easy read, but it is too lightweight for my tastes. Sure, there are a few memorable episodes, and the author certainly went on a fun adventure, but I didn't walk away from the book feeling like I had really learned something. There are so many great science books out there that have similar scope -- picking an interesting topic and then delving in to detail -- but this one certainly doesn't fall into that category. For example, compared to a book such as Your Inner Fish, this book is more of a beach read.Of course, there are a huge number of folks that don't want more scientific depth, but for me I felt that the author could keep her breezy style but also deliver more \\"meat\\" so as to make it a more interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read even when I already knew the conclusion","review":"I skimmed through some of the 1-star reviews and they seem to centre on lack of conclusion or lack of substance. Well, if you are looking for confirmation of the soul in Mary Roach's (or anyone's, for that matter) book then you're in for a disappointment. That's not to say the book is no good. Quite the contrary!Roach approached the afterlife from several angles such as reincarnation, near-death experience and medium. I find it interesting and her arguments convincing. It's not hard science (can it actually be?) so I don't understand why some people criticised the book's \\"Science\\" label. She's as balanced and detailed as can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"I always enjoy reading Mary Roach","review":"Roach tries, in this book, to avoid reporting the fixed opinions of the believer and the skeptic. She uses 'skeptic' a bit differently than i usually do, but at least this isn't a whitewash for either side. Usually books on this topic either fully endorse the conclusions of the experience, or completely trash them.Mary holds out for some actual evidence that will stand up to objective scrutiny. She doesn't seem to find any, but does show us where such things have been in vogue, or grabbed headlines or pissed off researchers, and so on. I found it very interesting.I enjoyed the close of her chapter where she attended medium school. Basically, she feels, now, that believers and skeptics differ not in sincerity, but in how they differently evaluate a common set of facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring useless information","review":"Basically it was boring, useless information that never really seemed to come to a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewing the reader, not the material","review":"I'm going to switch from the audiobook to a hardcover.

Am I glad I didn't buy it.As soon as it came in I eagerly started reading. What a disappointment. The humor and writing style that made Stiff so readable are lost here. Instead we're presented with a writer who not only seems to have her mind firmly made up beforehand about the topic but also seems to be writing an essay, craming in way more than enough details and worthless facts. The result is a boring read that I had to force myself to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Science Writer","review":"Would somebody PLEASE tell all of the book stores to move this book out of the science and technology section. Mary Roach is NOT a scientist or science writer. This book is a major disappointment if you expect science or even an understanding of science from the author.

Ms Roach takes us on a very personal and humorous romp through various aspects of life after death. Reincarnation, spiritualism, psychics, and coginitive scientists all get breezily examined from a very personal perspective. What emerges, though is more of a comedy sketch than a critical examination of the issues. To be fair, she states her intent clearly in the introduction, so you get what she says she will deliver. Although Ms Roach is mostly skeptical (and justifiably so, given the laughable evidence for life after death propagated by many of the characters in the book) there is little in the way of rigorous analysis or comprehensive review of any of the many subjects touched upon. Certainly not what I was looking for in the book, but maybe that was my fault for not reading the intro in the book store.If there is a category somewhere in a book prize for funniest footnotes, this book should be a serious contender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"The first book I have read by Mary Roach. I really really liked her. The research was hardly new to me though, and I wanted something ELSE. I liked her skeptical but open minded approaches to it all. This was nice refresher for me because I used to be SO into the paranormal, I haven't been into it in recent years so I did like everything she covered. She was funny but some parts went on a little too long for me taste when I thought the evidence wasn't there.

First of all, the woman who reads the story evidently has never read an audio book before, she tries to make it seem very exciting, and it is not. The story doesn't really have much to do with the afterlife, it's just her story about her journey to speak with people who are supposedly afterlife experts, and they are not.

I wouldn't recommend for a reggae novice but if you follow the riddims, this is a very good history lesson. King Tubby appreciators may also want this, since he mixed all cuts and there is some nice subtle reverb and gain emphasis/de-emphasis work from the Dub Master (and listen for the piano -- it's proto-ambient). Note that though there are several instrumental tracks here, it is not a dub collection (there are two \\"versions\\" included, but for Glen Brown dub-wise, go for the Termination Dub release on Blood and Fire).

Where were 4 other NAVY CRNA's in that Company and I know of 3 that worked more than she did, preparied more the gear more and she, did more surgical cases, and carried the Anesthesia workload. She seemed more interested in walking off to the exchange than refilling the oxygen tanks. I really remember that time when she took her 9mm and waived it around at chest level saying \\"I need help opening it\\" as we all hit the deck hoping not to get shot. As other CRNA's did the work, and stepped up to the plate and saved he lives of Marines and solders; they were not off writing about it away from the surgical tents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokey Mountain Hymns, Vol 3","review":"This CD is a tremendous addition to Volumns 1 and 2. The musical arrangements of familiar songs is wonderful. The sounds of the handmade instruments are truly pleasing to the ear.

But, why did he have to include many of the annoying features of that musical period? Melody is sacrificed in favor of passionless keyboards and other gadgets.On the bright side: \\"European Legacy\\" is an excellent song. So, monster Jethro Tull fans might want the CD for that reason alone. \\"Later, That Same Evening\\" is almost as good. The rest of the songs have marginal entertainment value and are a bit hard on the ears. If you're new to Tull, don't buy this album first. Otherwise you might be scared away before you discover their good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome ballad with powerful lessons for the new \\"dark ages\\"","review":"G.K. Chesterton died in 1936 and The Ballad was written years before that, yet he could already foresee the bitter harvest that would come as a result of the growth of utilitarian humanism. The Ballad is the powerful retelling of the story of King Alfred's ultimate triumph over the invading Danes, despite repeated losses, decimated forces and overwhelming adversity. It's a great story of a significant moment in history, but in it Chesterton also teaches us much we can apply in our own cultural wars against the forces of the \\"New Dark Ages\\". He brings his prodigious intellect and wit to the task and in so doing offers hope to the \\"men signed of the cross of Christ (going) gaily in the dark\\".

Science fiction has, haltingly and with lots of recidivism, gotten a little bit beyond superheroes who can outgun/outguess/outfight everybody else in the universe. This book is a throwback. Our hero has no personality; the villain is scary, but of course the good guy drops him in one shot when they finally get together. It's pretty well written (hence the two stars) in between the cliches, but it's ultimately pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"too buried in tech","review":"One gets lost in the techno stuff, for this alternate reality.

If you're hunting for a fresher voice, read Richard Morgan instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb second wave cyberpunk","review":"Every line of this debut novel crackles with energy and ideas. The backdrop is a society enhanced by connectivity (the Grid of the title) and cross-galaxy travel made possible by runcible technology; the plot has all the kinetic force of a runaway bullet train.

Looking for a very cool main character well thought out action and plot as well? Looking for mystery and exotic locals? This is it my friend. Read this book it doe not disappoint and there are more after it. All of the Polity books are basically one big continuing story. I am currently on the 4th and it is going strong. The writting style of the author takes some time to get use to and there are times wher you are shaking your head saying \\"What the heck is going on?\\" but it's all part of the fun. Asher takes some common themes and combines them in new ways with likable characters, truely evil villians and a plot that just will not quit. If you loved Foundation, Ender, Gap Saga, Uplift, then trust me this is the next logical step. I suggest reading it with some hard rock or metal in the background during the action scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough around the edges, but well worth the read","review":"This is action sci-fi. Don't come into this expecting deep character exploration or clever commentary on humanity, and you'll find a lot to enjoy.

I bought it as soon as it reached this place, and have been playing very often since then. The first song, dedicated to his wife, is absolutely beautiful. I love the duet with Peter Cetera, and it was a bonus to find Barry Gibb's voice in \\"Do I love you\\". I enjoy \\"She's a lady\\" together with Tom Jones, and the new version of \\"Let me get to know you\\" is great. This is a CD you never get tired of.

Grunska's book is not worth reading, and \\"Confederates in the Attic\\" only deals with Civil War reenacting for a chapter or two. To be fair, I have not read Jay Anderson's Time Machines yet.Thompson's treatment is fair, honest, balanced, and accurate. If you are interested in the subject, it is a must read. If you are interested in reenacting as a study of history, get it.My only complaint is that Thompson was only able to meet East Coast reenactors. The Midwest and California both have active reenacting communities with a flavor all their own.

With only four band memmbers, they really know how to go hardcore. They are also really talented, like at Ozzfest 2001, I saw them performing on second stage, and man did they kick [bottom]. This is a band that I know will someday become famous, because of their talent, and they know how to put on a kick [bottom] show. Strictly Diesel, is an awsome Cd.

One is edited to death by the film's infamously possessive producer, the other liberally enlarged (and dramatically weakened) by the director. Together, the two \\"cuts\\" make a terrific case against any one person having total control of their creative output.This collection also features a so-so documentary called THE BATTLE OF BRAZIL, about the public war waged between the director and the producer over the film's content--frankly, THE HAMSTER FACTOR (a brief documentary on the 12 MONKEYS DVD) was much a more insightful look at Gilliam's unique brand of stubborn genius than what's featured here.So even if you're a real big Gilliam fan, I'd just rent this one--it's useful to see all of this stuff, but it doesn't garner repeat viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brazil","review":"I have heard and read many good reviews of this movie, so when I sat down to finally watch it I expected a true masterpiece. The bigging of the movie truly grabed my attention, with its great theme and brilliant visuals. The movie remains good for another half hour with its funny look on a demented society, although the movie is far from a comedy. The next 1.5 hours are pretty much a let down. The political satires virtualy stop the the movies plot becomes so unclear that it becomes almost umbearable to watch. The only exeption to this would be the last 3 minutes of the movie which are masterfuly filmed, and is definatly worth watching. I consider myself a fan of off-beat movies that are very though-provoking, but Brazil fell below my expectations and made virtually no impact on me. there are a few parts of the movie worth watch but it doesnt make up for the other 75% that suck. In conclusion i find the movie overlong and at times unintentionaly silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant, depressing","review":"The viewer can not avoid being struck by the incredible genius of the filmmaker. The lavish visuals are not only outstanding in their own right but also carefully support the plot of the story.That said, I found this movie deeply depressing and don't ever want to see it again. It is the blackest of black comedy and I really wasn't prepared for it when I sat down to watch it: now that I know what it's like, I'm quire sure I'm not prepared to see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought, and laughs (albeit some very grim ones...)","review":"One thing you can be sure of, when seeing a Terry Gilliam movie: beautiful art direction, complex and dark sets, tongue in cheek humour, often in the details. A bewildering strain of events in an ever more intrigueing story.See how Sam Lowry, a humble but efficient public servant, tries to find the woman he's fallen in love with in the maze of a Kafka-esque and 1984-like society. Deeply unsettling notions of Big Brother government style are mixed with hilarious scenes (\\"there was a slight complication of the complication\\"). And finally, it's a very moving story too: just like a modern Oedipus, Sam Lowry only wants to do good and thereby conjures up the demons of doom to ruin and destroy his own life and that of others.One of the best movies ever - because it's dramatic, hilarious, well shot, impressive, thought provoking. And still it's great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not your mother's Monty Python","review":"This is a very dark, very cynical look into the future from a couple of decades ago, which turned out to be relatively accurate.

I suppose I got the impression there would be features and a commentary by Terry Gilliam because the five star reviews spoke about a commentary, but if you look closely you will see that amazon has merely copied the five star reviews from the Criterion Collection 3 disc DVD version of Brazil and pasted them as reviews for the blue ray version. Shame on you, Amazon!If all you want is the best movies ever made on blue ray, then by all means get this disc. But don't assume that you will be getting commentary and special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating for the DVD, not the movie.","review":"Let's be clear on one thing: The movie Brazil gets SIX stars out of FIVE in my book. This review is not about the movie, but the DVD.I already owned the standard Brazil DVD but wanted the Criterion Edition because I'd heard good things about their releases. I am very disappointed because there isn't a dime's difference between the Criterion and the regular DVD. All I can see from the box cover is a slightly different widescreen aspect ratio and the time is a bit longer (perhaps some added scenes?). The sound is still in lame 2.1 stereo, not 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS . I see no excuse for this; Even the H.G. Wells' \\"First Men In The Moon\\" DVD, a movie filmed in 1964, is in 4.0 discrete surround.Brazil, excellent movie, but buy the regular release and a couple of other movies instead of the Criterion version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2nd best Gilliam film and you got to have brains to...","review":"watch this movie. You dumb folks who don't get it should watch it till you do. It was very dark compared to \\"The Baron\\" but the contrast made it all the more intriguing to me. Pryce is funnier than hell. And you'll have a hell of a time getting the catchy Brazil song out of your head. If you are a Terry Gilliam fan then you must purchase the 142 minute version. If you are a complete idiot buy the shorter version that Gilliam himself denounced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential DVD - flat out one of the best there is.","review":"Had the chance to go to a book signing of Gillaim's new book and got my copy of this DVD signed; he told me the Criterion version is undeniably the only authentic director's cut out there. A scene has even been added to this version not available in any other version; the sound was missing and had to be lifted from VHS. The supplemtary information is the richest available on any DVD, painstakingly covering every aspect of the production, editing, and subsequent battles in release. If you like DVDs that tell you how a movie was made, than this and the Alien Legacy set, with their oustanding transfer quality and supplements, are the best DVDs released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative but that's not enough","review":"It's interesting how the Amazon reviewers fall into two very opposite camps, those who found this movie boring and those who give it five stars.I like \\"arty\\" films. Take a look at Aguirre The Wrath of God. It's wonderful.I have to tell you the simple truth, though. Brazil was much too long for me, and in some places I was just saying \\"This is stupid\\". I have to agree with the naysayers on this one.It's not enough to be imaginative and different. It's not enough to satirize our bureaucratic society. There are just too many faults here. The film is all over the place, and not that funny. It disappointed me.Let me steer you to a far superior comedy that is also highly respected by arty people. Try \\"Closely Watched Trains\\". Try \\"Amelie\\". Try \\"Discreet Charm of the Bourgeouisie\\". All three are far superior to Brazil. Check them out. Try \\"The Lady Eve\\". It kills this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing movie -- but decide for yourself","review":"I put one star on this review to GET THE ATTENTION of people like myself, who find most movies bad. I always look for the worst reviews. To me, though, Brazil is the best.But, dammit, forget what I or anyone else says -- just like you have to forget idiotic rules about what the \\"stars\\" on a review mean -- and decide for yourself.I saw 'Brazil' first in 1986 or so. I thought it was good, but it was preaching to the choir ... I already knew how miserable modern life is.It's the end of 2003 and I just saw it again for the first time in 17 years, and I'm shocked at how hilarious it is! Much funnier, and much more from the heart, than the serious young man thought.See it. And if you're an old geek like me, you'll love the set design. The old equipmnent is aging really well!

The movie does have a couple of upsides (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) namely Michael Palin and the stunning visuals. The rest is dismal at best. The movie is way too long and I felt no connection to the characters whatsoever. I also don't think that Gilliam is some sort of visionary for creating this movie...does the # \\"1984\\" ring a bell? Now that was a visionary book while this is a halfhearted attempt to copy it (along with some personal additions here and there).And don't be fooled by people telling you that it's a black comedy either. There are some midly amusing scenes in it, most of them involving Michael Palin in one way or another, but even those don't deserve much more than a casual smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"not imaginative","review":"despite the fact that this film maybe thinks it's very imaginative, it strikes me as being much more about the \\"look\\". i really think it substitutes an aesthetic (which is cool, but only gets you so far) for genuine imagination, and runs out of inventiveness before it comes up with anything interesting in the way of characters, relationships, plot developments, changes in tone, novel cultural critique...what's good about the movie is simply some of the cool images (black typewriters and magnifying glasses etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much loved, but I never got it ...","review":"This is a cult classic, but I find it over-rated. It delivers the zaniness, surreality and crazy camera work, but the film has no interest in its characters -- you'll feel nothing for them, and for me that leaves a big hole in the center of the movie.For a movie with a similar feel but considerably more heart, try Barton Fink instead. Or even Amelie."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much promise...","review":"After watching the first 45 minutes of this movie I thought I was in for a truly wonderful treat, after all, I had heard all the hype so I figured I'd probably love it. But unfortunately, this movie totally falls apart. It becomes very boring and drags on for hours. I know Brazil fans out there will disregard my statements but really, this film could have accomplished more with at least 30 minutes less movie. There are both standout performances and standout scenes, but by the end of the movie I had lost all emotional connection with the characters and the story. Honestly this movie just turned into a big mess. You want an amazing story in the spirit of 1984, read \\"Darkness at Noon.\\" What a disapointment. De Nero was great though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brazil","review":"There is a reason for this film's relative obscurity...IT IS AWFUL. I thought I had discovered an overlooked gem starring Robert DeNiro, but was unable to sit through this \\"retro-futuristic\\" farce in my first and so far only attempt at viewing. DeNiro's character shows up somewhat late in the film with neither plot nor character development up that point. I usually like films of this genre, such as the Omega Man or Soylent Green.

I thought 12 monkeys was good but what the crap was this. The environment was pretty cool but jeez. Watch this film when your high and it might be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazil is botha great movie and a fabulous dvd","review":"This is a fabulous film that has not just a great story and a great feel to the world presented here but every single thing. To try to explain Brazil without confusing people or ruining great scenes in the movie is impossible so i'll just review the special features for all the Brazil fans who still are wondering should I pay that much for a dvd? And the answer is yes with Gilliam's commentary to the battle of brazil and the \\"comercial\\" version universal wanted for its american release (which both show how dumb studio execs are and how they couldn't find the real story behind Brazil which is about our own society and not some farce rommance film set in the future) will make you laugh, cry (maybe) and most of all hating the studio system. This is a must for any Terry Gilliam/Brazil Fan (or buff or obbsesed fan) to buy and that is what I say Mr. Acid docter."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark","review":"My rating reflects how much I would like to see this film again, not the quality of the writing or production. This is the gloomiest of the Terry Gilliam films. The production values are high, but the story is poignantly cynical. If you can put aside the weight of the dismal, hopeless shadow cast on humanity by this film (which I can't), you'll find the story tightly written and the details meticulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad...","review":"It seemed like this film was going to be pretty good, and though there are some undeniably briliant and funny moments (resteraunt scene, constant forms), it simply did not need to be it's own film. Perhaps it would work better as an SNL sketch? It also seems to be an obvious rip-off of George Orwell's book \\"1984\\", exept \\"1984\\" actually delivers. Pretty much what I'm trying to say is that just getting a vague summary is much more appropriate than sitting through this overdone waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie...way overpayed for this edition","review":"If there is one thing I hate it is idle promises, especially when they come in the form of two extra disks of material that were supposed to give us great insight into the making of a film like Brazil. It is unfortunate that the regular edition of this film is now out of print. $59 dollars is a lot of pay for a movie with a slide show attached. I lost my criterion copy to hurricane Katrina and would not buy it again. There was nothing on the other two disks that were useful or interesting. By the way, I teach film and wanted this collection because the description indicated that it might give my students some insight into the creative process...it didn't. Hopefully the publisher of the standard copy will reconsider taking that version off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Bentley in 1984 England","review":"The only thing that I liked about this movie is the creative set and the imagery.The movie drags on and on, and is just another example of how weird the British are.I would categorize this as more of a weird British musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Into It...","review":"I saw most of this movie years ago, and I just tried to watch it entire to see the first part I missed. Quit half-way through.This movie has fantastic art direction, and is filled with small bits of good comedy, but it basically has one or two jokes told over and over again: jibes at the petty status-seeking of bureacratic society; satire of technological utopianism, as shown by the constantly screwing up duct systems, robots, anachronistic typing machines, etc.The story is a simple and tiresome one about a poor guy who dreams of a girl, both from the opposite sides of the bureacratic tracks, etc...The \\"romantic\\" aspect is hackneyed, and of course, it's way too long.Better to read 1984, Zamayatin's We, Brave New World than to watch this film. They're more clever, more disturbing, and more funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself two and a half hours","review":"If you like never ending and story less tales that inspire only the hope that this movie has more to offer than confusion alone, than this tale is for you. This movie was meant to be visually stunning but for 1985 you will be fairly disappointed-Back to the future came out the same year and was far more stunning in my opinion, although maybe not \\"artistically stunning\\" like some say. I don't know what classifies as science fiction in 1985 but this is definitely not it, this should be classified as science crap that is incredibly uninteresting. I already wasted my time with this lengthy movie, please, save yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nominated for \\"Most Overrated Cult Film\\"","review":"I am sorry, I have seen this movie three times, including recently in it's \\"restored glory\\" (mostly because I have been subjected to pressure from friends who keep claiming this is one of the greatest films ever made). I can see and appriciate a uniquiness in the visuals and story that this film has, but it completely fails to grip me. This movie seems to be too long, too redundant/monotonous, to bill this as a De Niro movie is a false advertising, and Pryce is more compelling selling luxury cars. Maybe because I am a huge Monty Python and Robert De Niro fan I have never been able to look at this movie properly. Sorry, but this movie just doesn't cut it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get it","review":"I am a BIG fan of British humor, but I found this movie to be a muddled, totally unfunny mess.

I wouldn't watch it again on a bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something like Doctor Who meets Franz Kafka??","review":"Hearing that Brazil is a dystopian film, I decided to watch it. Well. . . .it's, um, different. . .and confusing. . .and exceedingly stupid. . .and British, very British. Brazil is definitely of more interest to Monty Python enthusiasts than to dystopiaphiles. Fellow devotees of this genre, you are better off to stay with the novels, but if you must watch a movie, The Truman Show, while not technically a dystopia, might be of interest. As for Brazil, it has is risible moments--indeed, theentire movie is laughable, but this is exclusively due to its almost unimaginable crappiness. Mom agrees. Another reviewer, play4bux, has remarked that \\"this film shows sparks of creativity here and there, but will ultimately just deprive you of 2 1/2 hours you could have put to better use.\\" Amen!pythia"},{"rating":"1","title":"A triumph for pseudo-intellectuals everywhere","review":"Bleak, disjointed, full of throw-away performances and embarrassingly bad attempts at humor and romance.Gilliam flipped off the Hollywood Power Machine and won, thereby forever culling favor with critics and the art crowd. It's too bad the rallying cry was this miserable, depressing, migraine-inducing exercise in cinematic vomit.Brazil is a misguided and pretentious joke, a crude, gas-passing Emperor with no clothes.

It isn't. It's such a simplistic and random retelling of \\"1984\\" it makes even videogames like Half Life 2 look sophisticated by comparison, and that's not saying much. I realize now when people call a film classic you have to ask if they mean a \\"nerd\\" classic like The Matrix, or Brazil, or something that's of genuine cultural value. This is definitely a nerd classic, and not the latter. Be warned, unless you have an uncommon love of mechanical things and little emotional resonance within you, this movie is just long, boring, and cheesy as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"1984\\" in 1985...","review":"Just brilliant work...look like new \\"1984\\",but made by Monty Pyton,withinfluence of \\"Wall\\"Pink Floyd(specally,masks )plus exellent work JonathanPryce(soon his swansong\\"Tomorrow never dies\\"),cameo of Bob Hoskins(o,yes,\\"Who framed Roger Rabbit\\"),and short but impressive cameo Myrtle Devenishas a typist in Jack's office-you remember her in\\"Meaninig of life\\" in pirate's ship of insurance company serving tea..so-it's a movie for yourecollection-and you can see happy end(dvd#3)plus..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, yet Depressing","review":"*Not the Criterion Collection version*Whenever one takes a look into the future of our society, it's never one of peaches and cream, but always a dystopia, filled with dark shadows, oppressive government, and gargantuan buildings. Brazil is no exception. Sure, many of the visuals created by Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam are striking and quite creative. The story produces many laughs yet never quite hits its mark. Its not that its a bad movie, but one much too busy and dark for its own good. The plot twists and turns until its last depressing slump, complete with the main character humming that oh so famous song."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I have probably seen this movie some forty-seven times or so. It is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Brazil was a mystery to most people and one of those movies you watched late at night, lights turned out. I liked the film that played on video way back when, so seeing the 'real' movie was an eye opener. It is amazing what a studio can do with someone's film but the studio may have had a point. This version is overly long, muddled and not as precise as Terry Gilliam normally is. Maybe he was hurried, maybe he was running out of money... whatever. It is still good and this original version doesn't leave you feeling that \\"What was that?\\" which used to accompany many first time viewers. Gilliam is a masterful movie maker. The Criterion Collection of 3 DVD's is very good too, I particularly like the fact that they include the one released in the US plus a great disc that gives all the background behind how it was made and released. You can't go wrong if you like Gilliam's movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeNiro in an Art Film!","review":"Where else could you see Robert De-Niro as a revolutionary/heating repair technician in a Monty-Python member's masterwork.

The reason it didn't get the last fifth star is simply the awful \\"Love conquers all\\" version (with a happy ending) on disc 3. Cineatics will of course find even that part interesting. I recommend anyone to buy this box, you deserve it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever.","review":"Brazil is Terry Gilliam's greatest achievement. In many ways it is like Orwell's 1984 and Kafka's The Trial. It is a cynical and dystopic view at a possible future. A future that is bleak and oppressive, except in Sam Lowry's dreams. In his dreams he is a silver-winged hero. He swoops in from the clouds and rescues his damsel in distress, Jill. But the real world won't let him escape to his blissful fantasy. The two worlds conflict with each other until they finally collide head on.Brazil is the ultimate tale of man versus the state. It is loaded with hilarious satire. But it also contains very deep and important messages about society. If you want an unconventional and very creative tale of a man's struggle to be free, then Brazil is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Watch While Sleepy or Intoxicated.","review":"Great concept and acting. A true spectacle of a Cult Classic, yet so much more. Wickedly funny in a depressing way. If you watch this movie, every philosophy teacher from high school through graduate school will love you 'till the day you watch Rambo IV."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best films ever made.","review":"Brazil is the film that many consider the highlight of director Terry Gilliam's carreer. It is about an average joe named Sam Lowery who is lost in a drab world of buisness and proceedures. To escape this world he often dreams. In his dreams he seeks the woman of his dreams, whom he later discovers is a real person. He persues her but runs into constant setbacks. This version is especially worth having because, even though unadvertised and unmarked on the case, this is the original version released in Europe. The version released in the U.S. was about ten minutes shorter (so is the home video.) For a fan, the extra ten minutes are a real plus if you don't feel like shelling out the $200 for the Critereon Laderdisc version. The tranlation is also visulally excellent. The picture is incredibly clear (especially compared to my old video version.) I'm glad this one came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Virtually the same story as Star Wars: good vs evil, or more accurately, democracy vs. bureaucracy. The stiff metal layer of Darth Vader as the executive of a rule-bound \\"system\\" defending the organization against those who would expose its subversive structure is very similar to this movie and its overly organized system. The ending is pure genius and reminisent of Plato's cave imagery. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like taking a film course!","review":"Watching the \\"Criterion Collection\\" version of \\"Brazil\\" is like taking a fascinating film course. Gilliam's running commentary during the \\"Director's Cut\\", the documentary disc, and even the edited version (with commentary) provide hours of thought-provoking viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is not for everyone","review":"I saw this film when it was first released in the U.S. and it left me feeling stuned. The visuals were overwhelming, the plot was dark and depressing and the satire cut like a razor. Exactly my kind of movie! In order for one to truly enjoy this film one has to be able to identify with its main character of Sam Lowry and this is where, I think, the film succeeds with its many fans. Those who fail to appreciate this film are those who fail to understand Sam's posistion, his delima and his ultimate solution to dealing with the true horrors of the world in which he lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breathtaking, Overlooked, Original Fantasy Worth Six Stars","review":"Cast aside what you have come to expect from a full length major motion picture, and sit back and enjoy one of the most fascinating, completely off the wall science-fiction/fanstasy ever to grace the industry...well, almost. \\"Brazil\\" may not satisfy the typical film goer, but I found it fresh and clever, and enjoyably dark and gritty. Few movies in recent years have come close to the dark drama \\"Blade Runner\\", with Harrison Ford, and though \\"Brazil\\" is a humorous spin on a dreadful future, it certainly deserves to share the same creative umbrella. If you enjoyed \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"Gattica\\", then \\"Brazil\\" is certainly for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"Pretty much the weirdest movie I've probably ever seen. Some goodstuff in it, but, well, it's just weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"A negative trade-off","review":"This movie is loved by just about every art director I know. They loved it because it looks great. No argument there. No surprises either as Gilliam is art-based. But the price you pay for a visual feast is that the story is an indulgent, non-involving fantasy which just goes on forever. If you're into a fairy tale that uses more and more detail in an attempt to make itself real, and constantly rewards the eyes then it will all come together magically for you. Seems like a lot of reviewers feel like this. But for me, the trade-off between how the film looks versus pretty much everything else about it ends up in the negative. None of the performances stood out. It did not hold my interest. I could not watch this movie to the end after two attempts. Enough, already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This film is silly, and the plot is incoherent. Some people actually take this film seriously, but if anything it's a comedy.

They did not enjoy it, but they do not want to be alone in their suffering; therefore, they have given it multiple stars to trick you. Don't let them win. I AM your friend.

This movie along with Bladerunner and visually noteworthy due to their incorporation of old and new to create a futuristic environment rather than just new(although I think Gilliam didn't intend this to necessarily be in the future). At times, and Gilliam sort of admits this during the voice over, there is a lot of pure 'stream of consciousness' themes added that, for me, don't necessarily tie in well with the rest of the movie.

At the time I new nothing of the wrangling behind the scences by the director and the studio which wanted to edit the film against the strong protest by Mr. Gilliam. After a recent viewing I have to agree with the studio to cut this film down to something that resembles a story and not the \\"look how creative I am\\" film Gilliam wanted. Once I saw the flights of fancy, the endless symbolism and in your face \\"isn't this terrible\\" scenes for the second or third time I was not enlightened but just bored by the directors heavy hand. The Special edition box set has some embarrassingly pretentious scenes with the director defending his \\"artistic virtue\\" and wallowing in his artistic excesses.

I disliked it not because I didn't understand it, it's becuase this film makes you wonder if the director simply took bits and pieces of shots here and there and inserted them at random places and use Sam Lowry's \\"dream\\" as an excuse for silly scenes.

I love this book, and it was one of the first to make an indelible impression about changing one's philosophy of how to possibly go about organic farming (I was an organic farmer later on). Poses searching questions (and one man's answers) that every gardener and farmer should look for the answers to, regarding how much we need to interfere with natural processes to produce food.

He gropes around with the cane of scientific knowledge, depending on yin and yang to set his course.\\" Now, the sentiment may very well be true-- but lighten up, Francis. That's the tone of the entire book, and it never lets up.If you're already an adherent of real food, permaculture, and no-till, you won't learn anything new here.

The rest of the book is one continuous rant about the modern world, it's methods, and it's way of thinking. In large I agree with his rants but I don't need a whole book, chapter after chapter, covering the same thing again and again.

My copy arrived new, sealed in clear plastic wrap, but it has major quality issues. There are creases in the cover near the spine consistent with the book being placed under far too much weight at some point after binding. (This did not occur in shipping from Amazon - the outer shipping box arrived to me in perfect shape and the contents were properly packed and protected.) The pages of the book are not all cut to the same size, which makes for awkward page turning, and there is discoloration along the page outer edges.Also, be advised that despite the Amazon listing being \\"One-straw Revolution: Introduction to Natural Farming (English and Japanese Edition)\\" the text is English only. There is no Japanese text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Future with The One-Straw Revolution","review":"After a lifetime of farming, Masanobu Fukuoka presents us with techniques which probably harken back to prehistory and hunter-gatherer societies. It is very timely, however, given our current crises in supplying food for growing populations. An easy read, One-Straw Revolution is full of buddhist insights, autobiography as well as Fukuoka-san's methods to achieve successful crop yields with a minimum of interference to nature and less work for the farmer. I would recommend this book to anyone who gardens, manages a farm, or plans to do either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched by the sound!","review":"As a pastor I find it difficult to focus on sermon preparation during those busy times when I've spent two-thirds of the day at the hospital with the family of a member who's near death, visited a shut in(s), prayed and counseled a mother who's dealing with a gay son, etc. As I listen to this CD, I can empty my mind of the things that have just happened and focus on God in this moment!

Great selections though and very uplifting!","review":"I see some negative reviews for the 3rd and 4th volumes of this series but these are openly described as choruses and so they will naturally be short. However, as I only have this first volume, all I can say is that I'm very pleased with the track selections which are among my favorite worship songs.The recording quality is also quite good and I find this cd to be very uplifting. The shortest track is 1 minute and 7 seconds long (\\"Awesome God\\")while the longest track is 3 minutes 34 seconds long (\\"Give Thanks\\"). Looking at the selections in the other volumes though, it appears to me that the best tracks are here.A great compilation of my favorite choruses with reasonably good sound quality and so 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, but not \\"lost\\".

Not many errors were found on this CD, and the background vocals do the song recreations justice.However, this CDG also tells us that Sybersound has some more ground to cover before it can join karaoke giant Sound Choice, who has mastered the karaoke CDG market, at the top of the pack. The music found are not recreated with as much precision and as much perfection as SC has had, and sometimes, background vocals don't show up where they should (\\"Higher\\" is a prime example in this). Sybersound's only two advatages over Sound Choice is that they are easier to be found, and they are cheaper to buy than SC's CD-G's are.Flaws notwithstanding, this is a cheap way to get some fun, and possibly learn how to sing.

At first I loved it, it was a state-of-the-art 17\\" LCD when I got it new, no dead pixels, just great. But after six months it started having random fritzing-out issues. Very likely a bad capacitor in the internal power supply. I was never satisfied with dealing with ViewSonic warranty service, and I have since moved on, but I just happened across the reviews here and wanted to give my two cents as another very disillusioned ViewSonic customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing contrast and sharpness","review":"This monitor has an amazing contrast, very bright (almost too bright !!!). I use it with my ATI Radeon 9800 and it gives fantastic results with the DVI-D connection. I'm also using the the dual screen feature of my ATI. As a second screen, I use a 15\\" TFT Dell screen. The difference between both screens is really striking... but the price is obviously well different.The monitor is delivered with the Pivot Pro driver. I was sceptical before actually using this feature but that's really great while reading PDF's.The base is stable and the height adjustment uses sort of springs which allows to change the height easily.The screen size is, according to me, satisfactory. I don't think a bigger would help more (especially since I use 2 screens).I just had 1 lonely dead pixel which looks red but it's almost not noticeable.This is a strong choice and I don't regret the expanse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Make The Beeping Stop!","review":"Well, I purchased this monitor based on rave reviews for gaming purposes. Truly the monitor has been great with one exception: The bloody thing beeps whenever it on standby or turned off but plugged into an outlet.I have sent the unit in for repair twice and have been without the monitor for over 2 months and still the unit is broken. The Viewsonic service team is just plain non-communicative and apparently incapable of fixing an easy unterminated signal issue. When I ask them how they repaired the unit they have no information as the repair site is in California and the customer service office is overseas.So...roll the dice if you like. The monitor is good if you don't mind crawling under your workspace everyday to plug/unplug the unit.Hex/Curse/Call to Demons: May the Viewsonic company go under."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Warranty service...BEWARE","review":"Beware of Viewsonic Customer Service.

It was my first experience using an LCD monitor on a daily basis, and after few weeks, I wanted to purchase one for myself. I decided on the model VP171B mostly for the DVI connector. After receiving it, I noticed bad pixels on the screen. I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement. The new one arrived in three days (thank you Amazon, you rule!), and guess what? Bad pixels again.I may not be the luckiest person but, what are the odds of getting two bad monitors in a row? The only explanation I can find is poor quality control. Even though I liked the design and functionality of the monitor, I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dificult Install","review":"The install was awful. It installed 600mb of stuff onto my hard drive and it still needed an internet connection to install. Just to launch the thing requires an internet connection. So forget this if you want to travel with it on a laptop. Why do they do this? I think it's so they can sell you more modules. Turns out what you buy only contains two modules, the other 10 you can purchase. Once installed it would constantly hang as soon as we went into the arcade. I ended up returning it. I also think, but can't verify because it didn't work right, that they show you the other 10 modules as places you can go, but are roped off inside the game. So your kids see these other 10 modules dangling in front of them. Meaning your kid will see these and put pressure on you to buy the other 10 so they can go there. Honestly, I think the game you buy is a ploy to get you to buy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you have less than 420MB on your C drive!","review":"I couldn't install this on my PC which had less than 420MB on the C drive.

I have watched it countless times and both my kids (age 6 and age 4) love it. As such, I had high hopes for this particular movie, but should have followed my instincts when I saw that it was a fully animated film. After only 10 minutes, my daughter kept asking me if/when the movie was over, and I had to painfully sit through the next hour and 13 minutes to see it through the end.

I can't tell you how it ends, but I hope it ends with Casper failing and all of the characters in this film suffering a horrible fate.The computer animation is so poor and so outdated it looks like it was rendered on an IBM Pentium I. There are actual instances of slow-down and frame loss and all other kinds of video artifacts that I never see in any other video I stream.

Finally my daughter just got so tired of trying to mess with it that she basically stopped playing with it after a couple weeks & now just plays with the bears without the castle.

None of the pieces stay on. The tops of the castle, the swing, the slide and the bridge. It's all over the place! No fun at all for my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the new Little People Castle by Fisher-Price!","review":"My 2.5 daughter received this for Christmas from her Grammy. She had been talking about it for months and was so excited to open it. The tops come off for easy access to the castle, and she was able to put them back on okay by herself. But any little touch made them fall over, and I almost broke my hand trying to get the swing back on! The balloon's basket was way too small to put a bear in, and this is just made very cheap compared to her smaller Care Bear sets. So, we exchanged it for the Care Bears Ferris Wheel, which is much more fun for her. However, she kept asking where her castle was, so when I came across the new Lil' Kingdom Castle for Little People by Fisher-Price, we got that. It was HALF the price of the C.B. castle, and is 100% more fun and durable. Plus, she can find a place for all 16 members of her growing Care Bear family on the F-P castle! Hope this helps you all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas - she was 4 1/2. I took it back to the store. I had to fix it every 2 minutes. All the parts kept coming off and she did not like playing with it that way. For her it had to all be together. I could have \\"hot glued the pieces on\\" but that instructions actually said to \\"snap\\" the towers into place. Once it was gone, she didn't even ask for it again. She also got the ferris wheel, which she still plays with. But the pieces for that fall off all the time too. With that though, she can at least just hook them back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves her Care Bear Castle!!","review":"We just received the Care Bear Castle and my daughter is 35 months old. (1 month shy of 3) She loves the castle! She loves Care Bears. Yes, the castle tops fall off easily. But, this is not a problem for my daughter since she is almost 3, and she enjoys rebuilding the castle. I think if she received this toy a year ago it would have been not as much fun, but at almost 3 she can easily rebuild the castle. The only trouble we have had is the attached swing. The swing falls off easily, but we solved that problem by adding the larger swing offered seperatly. The castle is really cute. It makes fun sounds. The bears are easy to place in the openings and activities. The care bear figures are really nice too. We think overall it is a great toy for a 3 year old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Toy Is Junk","review":"If I were the manufacturer/designer of this toy, I would be sooooo ashamed. I spent most of Christmas morning 2003 explaining to my 4 year old that it was not broke, it just comes this way. Every part of it just falls apart, none of it even snaps together so it will stay for awhile. The heart door on the middle section would not stay shut after two days of minimal play, and the swing never stays on at all. The turrets (pink roofs) on the castles fall off if you touch the toy at all. I dislike that I have to give this toy one star, they need to include 0 stars as an option for junk like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I recently bought this toy for my daughter's third birthday. The overall quality is very poor. The castle requires adult assistance in order for the child to attatch the care bears to their different \\"posts\\" on the castle. The size of the castle was also disappointing (too small). My daughter lost interest within 10 minutes and hasn't played with it since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"i also don't see why all the complaints. My daughter loved it from 3.5 to 5. She would sit and play with it and the care bears for quite a while. Her friends came over and they'd play with it together. The care bears went in the bath with her. This has been a great toy for her. Yes, the swing comes off. Put it back on or glue it. It actually never bothered us that it kept coming off, so they just didn't play with it much. There were other parts of the castle to play with. Now, after many years (I initially bought it off craigslist), it stopped making sound and lighting up. Not sure why - maybe a loose connection inside or something. But my daughter has outgrown it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Scent - Awful!","review":"Beware!

The songs range from boring and inane to irritating. Regardless of the classical music artificially infused into the background, this CD is nothing more than half an hour of filler material. Trite lyrics and uninteresting rhymes are beaten to death in a repetitious cycle that doesn't seem to end.Nothing lifts this singer's talent out of the current cesspool of R&B artists except for her somewhat smooth rapping ability. Her rapping skill is fairly well-developed and interesting. With obvious influences of L.L. Cool J and Salt & Pepa, Sweetbox's rapping persona of a woman in love comes across powerfully. However this is all marred by the complete lack of lyrical ingenuity. Her delivery is good, but what she is saying is filled with cliches and rhymes that are fit for a 4th grade poetry contest.Stay away from this one, it isn't worth 15 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Hank really not do it this way?","review":"I like these kinds of albums, because they always turn me on to some artist I'd been previously unfamiliar with. In this case, it's Lefty Frizzell via Trace Adkins.Randy Travis does a great job on Haggard's \\"Mama Tried,\\" as does Mary Chapin Plumber on Hank Williams'/Don Gibson's \\"Oh, Lonesome Me.\\"I also like Collin Raye's interpretation of \\"Cold, Cold, Heart,\\" where his approach and phrasing is sort of a combination of Lucinda Williams and Glenn Frey.A reprise would be nice, with Dwight Yoakam (Buck Owens), George Strait (Bob Wills), Brad Paisley (Jimmie Rodgers or Johnny Cash), and Clint Black (Merle Haggard) making appearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional songs done well by the artists of today.","review":"Please bring back the traditional country sound.

As is typical, the humor is often juvenile but the nudity is far better that you would ever see in it's American counterparts. People rarely buy these for the subtle humor, right? With that being said, I was highly disappointed in the transfer quality. I am not looking for anything perfect, with these films not exactly deserving of the full shine and polish, but some effort should have been made to reduce the skips and jumps. There are three or four times that you can see tracking errors from the original shoddy VHS that these were pulled from. These actually obscure the picture in several places and some jumps can be seen. I am guessing that the studio never watched the final product....Otherwise these are fun and sexy, (if not particularly memorable) films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible picture quality","review":"Picture quality is worse than any review has mentioned.Like watching a film through thick fog.You dont get to see much nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah back to the 80's late night skinamax","review":"These are the movies I grew up with staying up late watching skinamax after dark, really fun set and I love it for the nostalgia factor, they are fun sexy comical movies with a real nice amount of softcore skin and for me a good deal of replay value.

If Hasbro would have been willing to pay some royalties they could have used actual movie and video clips which would have made this game fun. Instead they use horrible graphics with still photos or Scrabble type words to get you to guess the answer. Meanwhile they flash the answer too quickly for any kind of team play and you cannot pause the DVD at all.If you still want to buy this, I will sell you mine since I will not be using it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faulty DVD","review":"My husband and I played this game for the first time this week. We had a couple of problems with the DVD - on some of the questions it seemed to not give enough time to even read the question before the answer was given and at other times - the answer was NEVER given - just popped back to the main screen. I do think the game is a great idea/concept - but the DVD definately needs work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition, Repetition, Repetition","review":"The game itself is pretty fun, but the DVD has some problems. We played the game twice and ended up with the same questions popping up on the dvd within the same game. There is only one box of cards to play with and we repeated on these also. Needs more variety, more cards, and a better system with the DVD. The concept is good, just needs some work. I'll stick with Genus IV or 20th Anniversary Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This game is really lame. We couldn't even use the DVD because after the first question in each category, it just kept repeating the same questions. So we just played it the old-fashioned way, using the cards. But why pay extra for the DVD edition, then? (Someone said that if you're playing on a cheaper DVD player, that might happen. But I don't think I should have to go out and buy a new DVD player just to play this game.)Not only that, but the questions we did get to see on the DVD weren't all that great. At least a couple of them were just questions, no video clips, no musical hints, nothing that would require them to be on a DVD as opposed to on a card. For example, \\"What two words make up the word modem?\\" and \\"What musical instrument does Lucy Liu play?\\" I expected to see things on the DVD that you wouldn't get in the regular version.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Awesome game...but at times a bit tough.

The first time through was great - we especially enjoyed the fact that after a point, all players could jump in on the \\"wedge\\" questions. HOWEVER, we did see shades of the problem that would become truly TIRESOME by the second time we played it - the repetition of the questions on the DVD. Honestly, by the second time we played it, there were so many questions we'd seen before that we never even finished the game and swore to never play it again. I am in the process of returning it to Hasbro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with some major problems","review":"The idea of the DVD is a great idea. The first game we played we had a blast. You use the DVD in place of the cards when you are trying to get your piece of pie. The game pieces are really fun. They are 3d pieces of a lava lamp, cassette, joystick, and cell phone. After only two games we found the the dvd started to repeat itself and ask the same questions over and over. The instructions say to go back to the menu on the dvd and select the catagory again to get a new question. We found ourselves having to do this five times in order to get a new question. It is a great idea but $40 dollars is pretty steep for only two to three games of original questions. Also, they only give you one box of questions. On a positive note, the game pieces are really fun and novell."},{"rating":"2","title":"**not suitable for age 12yo**","review":"I bought this game for an after dinner game on thanksgiving since my neice & nephew are coming. i looked at some of it last night and the questions and answers are just not answerable for children that age. i would put it at least 16-17 and basically for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooooooooo boring","review":"this game is no fun at all. the dvd is very disappointing, cheap graphics and not very inviting to even play the game. the same questions pop up on the dvd so many times... no fun at all. we played it once and put it away... awful game, don't buy it. \\"scene it\\" is supposed to be better but we haven't tried it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for whole family","review":"Members of my husbands family and I played this game and loved it.

Believe me, I cannot overstate enough the waste of time this cheaply made DVD is.

It's these \\"things normal people don't know or couldn't care less about\\" questions they ask in easy, fun sounding categories like \\"Sports\\" and \\"Fads\\" that kill this game for me.Congrats, Hasbro, for sucking more money out of people by rehashing the same game."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun!","review":"this color-changing light bulb is awesome!

If it weren't for him we may not have the fashions that we have today. In the edition that I have read there is a page that says that Charles Worth's grandson helped get the facts straight. I read this book at least 5 times a year. The way that Ms. Laker intertwined the other peoples lives together makes you feel like you are really there with them.

There are more butts here than you could imagine. The color, lighting, and positions of these male erotic images is fascinating. It's hard to believe that some of these images weren't computer enhanced, instead of just images multiplied, and duplicated from videos images. Again, if you are expecting full body shots, or facials, forget it. There is just butts, butts, butts. I couldn't resist that.Between \\"Penissimo\\" and this second volume \\"Buttissimo\\" (limited edition) Mr. Zett has showed what a unique mind and talent he has.

The movie is nowhere near the quality of the show. The way the movie has been written is much different from the show, especially the narration which doesn't have the same creative insights Carrie usually has. On top of this its not that funny, mainly because Samantha doesn't act like a slut in the show (she sleeps with only 1 guy, very unSamantha-like). Everything in the movie was very unoriginal to me and unrealistic so I can't recommend this film at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable","review":"I loved every single episode of the series and really could not watch the movie until the end. it was so boring and disappointing.i just had the impression that it was made by someone else like the original wit, sense of humor and story lines had disappeared.the same characters seem like they are missing their original essence and the whole story drags and drags for ever.what a disaster!it's the first time i ever write a review about a movie i saw but i just felt i had to share my utmost disappointment and anger with others.don't bother getting this movie, just buy the series if you don't have it, it is so much better.Adel"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed the series, I was very much looking forward to the movie. It was a terrible disappointment. The characters, who through the series had developed into complex characters, seem to have forgotten everything they learned, and were once again flat characartures. The first hour moved very slowly. There was also a LOT of very explicit sex, to the point that I was embarassed. This was not supposed to be pornography, but it may as well have been.In short, stick with your fond memories of the series, and imagine your own ending; seeing this will only disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd doesn't work","review":"Okay, maybe it's my dvd player, but all my other dvd's play just fine, including the special disc 2 of this dvd. So disc 1 played once, and now refuses to play again in my dvd player. It will play on my I-Mac. I then went down to Longs and bought another \\"Sex & the City\\" widescreen dvd, not the special edition, and this dvd won't play either. I'm out $45 and my wife isn't happy. I suspect they put some heavy duty Non-Copying code on this dvd and it's messing things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful","review":"Lets see, there's Charlotte the Vacuous Cream Puff, Carrie the Empty Dress, Miranda the Walking Bucket of Toxic Waste and Samantha the Narcissistic Black Hole. Let's sit thru 2 hours (OUCH!!!!) of listening to them blaming other people for their misery. The male characters were completely without personality. The whole movie seemed to be about 1) Clothes, 2)an idiotic wedding ruined by the bride attempting to show off and ignoring the effect on her fiance, and 3) A woman with a completely toxic personality that absolutely NO ONE would love, let alone like. I wasn't a fan of the TV show but it was a 1000 times better than this gruesome drivel. The only funny moment was when Big called off the wedding. There isn't a person on earth I'd recommend this too. Are there REALLY women like this in the world? I hope I never meet any."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"I loved this movie. It was great. I loved how they continued the movie from the show instead of doing something totally off the wall. and I watched the movie twice in the theaters and. Oh did I mentioned that I loved this movie. It has it all love, heart-ache, joy, sadness. I recommend this movie to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Froth of nothing","review":"I really didn't like this movie. Chris Noth wasn't as good as in the show and it was really empty. Carrie had gotten a simple dress for her wedding to Big and Candace Bergen had talked her into becoming the Last Single Woman in Manhattan. With the photo ops and such came a gorgeous dress that Carrie decided to wear and the wedding got way out of hand. She wore a green feather in her veil. I'm not sure what that was about. Miranda was whining about Steve being unfaithful. No surprise there. Charlotte FINALLY got a child. Samantha was the same self-centered woman she always was.If you want to see it, rent it from Netflix like I did. Don't waste your money. It isn't worth it to own it. This is a one time viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex & The City The Movie","review":"If you were a fan of the series you have to see The Movie!

I am a huge fan of the series, I own the entire series, and thought that the finale of the series was fantastic! So why did they feel that they had to make a movie? First of all, they crammed way too much into the movie. It was like they were trying to do a whole season in the span of one movie. I don't want to give too much away, and if you haven't seen it don't read any further...The whole wedding bothered me so much! Carrie deserved the big fancy wedding! Also, do you really think that Steve would have ever cheated on Miranda? Give me a break! The whole Mexico/Honeymoon was a complete waste of time, and come on, Carrie's \\"depression\\" was way overdone. I wish this movie was never made, I want to remember the fantastic series, not this mess of a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS IN THE CITY!!!!","review":"This movie was horrible. I mean it, bad writing, bad forced acting, completly predictable I was embarassed for them all. This should have been a great film but they rushed it out..anyone who liked it is blinded by the series (which was great) but I ask all don't by this DVD and support idiotic filmmaking in the US anymore. Hollywood thinks they can take a dump in a box and write special edition on it and we will buy it. This was made realitivly cheap and fast thinking who cares the public will buy it and we will get PAID on the backend...so if you want better films made dont buy the bad ones!!!

All the characters are the same sexy, feisty and hilarious girls we've all come to know. Only this time our beloved Carrie is getting married to Mr. Big. But as with all SATC episodes it's full of drama, sex and humor. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It makes you laugh, makes you cry and gives you the overwhelming feeling of love.

Can be enjoyed by viewers even if you don't know the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"As shallow as a saucer....","review":"Make no mistake about it, this is a horrible movie. Odd, since I was a fan of the series. So here we are 4 years later in their lives, and the four girls have been reduced to caricatures of themselves that make it impossible to care about them. Charlottes's wide-eyed innocence has grown into an immature stupidity, Miranda has gone from being driven to being old, tired, and bitchy. Meanwhile, Samantha has become an over the hill tramp that will grate on you like fingernails on a blackboard. But worst of all is Carrie, whose witty and insightful observations from the series have been replaced by a totally self absorbed whiner who deserves the heartbreak she must endure from her faux fashion accessory Big.Do your self a favor and avoid this movie, particularly if you are a fan of the series...leave well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Promised Digital Copy","review":"This DVD, even today, is billed as coming with a digital copy.

All original cast involved, all questions are answered and true \\"sisterhood\\" fulfilled. SJP and cast definitely get my vote. Girls, this movie is good for the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Not sure what I didn't like the most - the bathroom \\"humor\\" - what was that all about? Huh?? or the Jennifer Hudson addition - could have lost that entire character. So Carrie has these treasured friends but finds \\"the answer\\" about love with somebody she has known for a minute? And then gives her this tacky handbag as a measure of her self worth . . . oh please! I would rather watched more of Mario Cantone and Willie Garson - they were in the movie mere seconds. This could have been done SO much better and really I expected it to be from SJP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck in the City","review":"Over acted, actresses too old to play their parts. Please, Samantha can get over herself anytime. Fifty years old and still playing the I'm hot and horny teenage tramp role? I just didn't buy it. Those STUPID hats that Carrie wears? Forget it. It's like they are little girls playing dressup. I wish I had saved my money. Live and learn. The people I let borrow it said it was a waste of their time also. SJParker has made enough money. She looked haggerd, and her hair always looks oily for some reason. Time to retire, sweetie and retire to the good life. People are already talking about you. Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis Still have a lot to give. They are beautiful, and act very well. They aren't older trying to act like they are still in their twenties. Kim...If it were not for Sex, you would only , maybe be remembered for a ditzy cop, and a manniquin, and it doesn't take much acting for either role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I really loved this movie and any fan of the series will love it too.

I actually dozed off about halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Escapism Overdose","review":"This movie is like a Sex and the City marathon, and the experience makes you appreciate why Sex and the City was just a half hour show. It's best to watch this movie in small doses, a bit each evening to avoid a coma. Carrie Bradshaw and her pals can get tiresome after the first forty or fifty minutes - the characters are too ME, ME, ME. We may love them, but even old friends can wear out their welcome. Jennifer Hudson is a breath of fresh air as Carrie's assistant; I found myself wishing she had more screen time.Without a doubt, the fashions and NYC glamour are fun, but who can really afford those Manolo Blahnik shoes? Or wear them and walk at the same time??Although worth seeing just to say been there, done that, there isn't much reason to actually purchase this movie unless you're a big fan of the series. I've noticed that there are always multiple copies available for free at the local public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chick Flick!","review":"I am a big fan of the show, so I had to purchase this dvd. I have to admit, though, that my expectations were pretty low. I thought the movie would be overly glamourized, and not have much substance to it. However, when I saw the movie, I was so pleasantly surprised. It was like the icing on the cake. The storylines were much deeper than I would have thought they would have been. This was a really emotional movie. I loved it, and can't think of how it could have been a better conclusion to the story of the show. And every character had a lot going on -- it wasn't just about Carrie. It was pure perfection! Highly recommend. Definitely an very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed","review":"Even if you didn't watch the tv series, you will really enjoy this movie.

Just plan to enjoy the movie a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm so glad I didn't stand in long lines waiting to see SATC when it premiered in movie theaters. This film was a gigantic let down, after too much hype to begin with. Basically the film was another vehicle for SJP to wear some hideous designer clothes. Other than that, the film lacked substance and I can't imagine them planning on yet ANOTHER SATC movie! I think I'll pass on that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT!!!","review":"THESE ARE THE ONLY 2 WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE, SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT. I AM A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW AND CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DISORGANIZED THIS PLOT WAS. IT WAS LIKE A BIG POINTLESS RUNAROUND. IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING, NOTHING GAINED, NOTHING LEARNED, NO INSIGHT, NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO PROGRESSION IN THEIR LIVES. THEY ACTUALLY DID THE OPPOSITE AND REGRESSED.

If you liked the televison show you will love this movie. It was not one of those badly scripted, hack job some movies seem to be that try to play off a succesful tv series. This was a wonderful movie with twist and turns and the wedding scene was fantastic and showed the real depth of Carrie. I also have to admit I loved the ending. I don't want to give it away but lets just say that the closet scene with Carrie and Mr. Big is more romantic and real than Casablanca and I watched it over and over and it did not get old. This is well worth buying, it should be a classic keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and the City: The Move (Two-Disc Special Edition)","review":"Loved the movie.

I would think it would show the continuing lives of the characters as they got older in a positive way. Instead it was a doom and gloom movie. Everything seeemed to go wrong. This was supprising after the end of the series that showed things going so well and open hearts. They seemed to lack compassion. I was sorry that I went to the movie theatre and actually paid to see this movie. Everyone is different but I cannot for the life of me see why more positive things were not in the movie and the growing lives of the characters.

Machine worked very well. Occasionally it would mis-sort a penny into the nickel stack. The only real problem was that I had a few dollar coins that I accidently dumped in the sorter. They were too large to come out through any of the sort portals so they just banged around inside the machine. I had to take it apart to get them out (remove 4 screws).

I plugged in the unit and put mostly pennies and some quarters, dimes and nickels in the bin. The pennies went in the penny and nickel slots, the dimes went in the dime and penny slots. I emptied the sorter and started over with just a handful of coins since I thought that I may have put too many coins in the machine. The same thing happened and some of the coins disappeared in the machine. The users manual did not help.

However, after using it for 2 weeks, the penny counter doesn't work and jams up causing pennies to fly into all sorting tubes. At this point, I have to sort out the pennies and use it only for silver coins. As pennies are the most common coin dropped into the charity container, it has taken some of the quickness of getting this project done.

The hopper holds a fair amount of coins and the sorting is fast; sometimes too fast to keep up with. I bought the Royal Sovereign coin wrappers with this but it uses the standard round coin wrappers that you can get in any office supply stores. The documentation says you can use flat but that round works better. I haven't tested the flat. You'll probably want to buy extra penny wrappers too; I used upwards of 3 or 4 penny wrappers for every one of anything else.The only problems I had were that some pennies ended up in the dime wrapper and vice versa. I've had this same problem with other cheaper sorters but the problem I didn't have with this one were jams. Of the $103 in change I sorted, I had 0 jams.I wouldn't consider this a \\"premium\\" coin sorter but it is definitely an improvement over the chintzy versions that come out around Christmas time and I am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy to Use","review":"I bought this product as a present for my parents as they have a lot of loose change that they keep around the house. Out of all the products, this one seemed to be the best fit and indeed, for a reasonable price, it was easy to use. My parents really enjoyed it. My only concern is that my parents still feel the need to count the coins to make sure they are the right amount given that even when the coins are filled to the top, there are sometimes still one or two missing. It kind of defeats the purpose in a way, but I'm not sure if it's because they are meticulous or if it is a product defect. Nonetheless, they have enjoyed the product and it has served a purpose of them being more organized about their change."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BEAUTY!","review":"Hey It does it's job very Well...

I had debated about getting the regular LeapPad instead, but the My First LeapPad is perfect for her.

When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money!

I like an auto shutoff but the kids quickly get frustrated and walk away.Cartridges... ugg. I would say about 25% of the time I can not get this unit to recognize the cartridge \\"That's Not a LeapPad Cartridge\\" is a frequent error. So often it is reverting to the non-cartridge game even when my kids think they have gotten another book installed. Another source of frustration.My kids want to play with it... but it is sadly on the shelf waiting for the next garage sale.FYI - my kids are 2.5 and 4.5yr old.

Her favorite by far is Dora to the rescue, and second favorite is Jay Jay. The system in itself is easy for her to carry (built in handle), sometimes she forgets to press the green go circle when she turns the pages and she comes to tell me it's not working mami, most of the time she does because I remind her. The volume is adjustable which is great when I'm trying to watch TV and she's playing with the leap frog.

The sound is much rounder and heavier than the first album. Adding Travis Bracht on vocals was a pure masterstroke and his combination with Dudley Taft is inspirational. Many people have said that the music is Creed / Alice In Chains like but my view is that this record may surpass anything that these bands have released. Second Coming are certainly more powerful than Creed, happier than Alice In Chains. There are virtually no throw-away tracks on this album but particular highlights include Soft, Vintage Eyes, The Song, The War Look forward to their 3rd release later this year depsite the fact that Dudley Taft the guitarist has now parted company with the band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Blew me away!","review":"I was turned onto Second Coming by a friend by the name of Matthew.

They have evolved abit since their first record but they did not take a departure from their sound on the first record. For those who don't know about this band they come from the grunge/post grunge genre and are some good well written and executed rock.

Second Comming then handed out demo tapes that I wore out listening to in my car until the CD finally came out in stores.

Lee had cavalry with him and failed to use them. That is Lee's fault. End of story. These people that feel the need to keep the blame from Lee and continually find \\"scapegoats\\" need to get over it. This was an excellent book that I will recommend to anyone who wants the real truth of the battle of Gettysburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"Having read and studied the author's book carefully, the most accurate way I know how to describe it is simply as \\"factually challenged history.\\" That there are many omitted facts from Nesbitt's book one wonders why the attempt was made in the first place. If someone is looking for a well reasoned treatise on the Lee-Stuart issues at play in the Gettysburg campaign, they need look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different III","review":"There are now several \\"period instruement\\" versions of this symphony, the most lauded being John Eliot Gardiner's.

His tempos are more deliberate, and he doesn't give you the \\"crash crash\\" that Michael Tilson Thomas does, or Beecham. This is a more measured reading...like Boulez's, with less opulence. I wouldn't recommend this as a first pick (go with the classic recommendations: Munch, Davis), but if you find yourself wanting to hear a very interesting reading indeed, this is what you should get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick it Up","review":"Well this is one of those tight west coast rappers that didnt get his props better get this one cause its rare and hard to find now days"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"This dvd is funny as all get out!

It contains a fascinating array of material - from Leonardo Da Vinci's design for a spinning wheel onwards. It gives projects for 5 (I think) different kinds of loom - but not the type I own (a rigid heddle) but they're adaptable. It contains a lot of material really only relevant to US readers (for instance a HUGE list of suppliers, discussion of US plants to dye wool with, typical US laws if you're thinking of setting up your own business.) Not something I'd have bought for myself - it's encyclopaedic and immensely interesting rather than immediately useful (but, in my opinion, that's one of the things that makes it a good present)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for a surprise, a new look at organisations","review":"Dupuy has managed to shed a new light on organisations, away from the wires and boxes of the formal organisation to the actual activities of the people in the organisation. He describes how customers haved won from bureaucracies who have tried to specialise so that they would not have to face the customer or cooperate with other departments. Changing organisations requires careful listening to the players in the organisation; finding what is their problem to solve and what are strategies they adopt to reach that goal. Dupuy uses a sociological tool that can be applied directly in business. He writes in a humoristic way and does not suffer from the syndrom of needing way too many pages to get across the message. An easy read, funny, and surely a surprise even to those people who have read many business books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still gives me shivers....","review":"The cold, the lonely wind, and the atmosphere of this movie still gives me shivers.

Gripping poverty is the subject of most of the book's chapters. For instance, in the first chapter, Chris's mother tells him that they do not have enough money to buy a new pencil for the start of school. Chris is initially not allowed to get Tiger because the family cannot afford their rent or grocery bills. In the latter chapters, the family's financial prospects brighten in anticipation of an upcoming photo shoot that is to take place in their house. For one brief moment, it appears as though everything will work out for the better, until SURPRISE, the cat ruins the photo shoot by eating the negatives and the family is poor again. That is how the book ends.

This is true of the Glide brand 5 years ago, but they've fixed the problem! This stays sturdy while flossing3. EASY MOVEMENT. It moves between teeth with ease.

There are some classic rhymes, of course, e.g., \\"Three blind mice,\\" \\"Hickory, Dickory,\\" but many of the rhymes would hardly make sense to children outside of the United Kingdom.

The song is annoying but that is the only real complaint i have. It has never tipped over, fallen apart or anything like that and my daughter plays pretty rough with it. I would say this is a pretty good toy, not a bad price either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Customer Service","review":"Well, I dont usually do reviews but this needs to be addressed.

When I recieved it, it was the 7553. I called and they were very helpful about exchanging it for the 9985. I was a little disappointed about having to take the time and do this instead of having the right one the first time. The material looks great on this cover. It is heavier duty than I was expecting. The vents are just in the wrong place. Very poor design. I look forward to getting the 9985 with the vent in the back. It is definately wise to save some time and call the seller to make sure they will send you the right model cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a glove!","review":"Fits the Genesis E-320 like a glove!

Grady's Hardware sent me 7553 instead, which is not what most people are looking for (it has side vents that let water all over your BBQ to sit on the stainless steel side tables for weeks). Weber really messed up the 7553, and I recommend you avoid making the same mistake as myself and call ahead for 9985!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent different cover","review":"I purposely purchased from Grady because I wanted the 9985 cover. They sent the 7553 cover with vents over the shelves, which lets rain in on the starter and gas knobs and on the side burner. I could have gotten the 7553 for less money, but felt the 9985 was worth spending more. I tried to call them to see about getting the correct cover, and only the owner can handle Amazon sales and he won't be in until Monday. I am displeased with this transaction , and with Grady's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real happy with this one","review":"This cover has the vents over the side tables(don't believe the picture on the box or in the ads) which makes it a little silly if you live where it rains, or snows, or dust blows.

I would not purchase this cover again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the 9985 - Call Grady's to confirm","review":"Like everyone above suggested, give Grady's a call. I contacted the store via their website and spoke with a very nice lady who confirmed that this is the 9985 cover (in fact she said that they don't even carry the 7553 cover - maybe they stopped carrying it?)The cover is great, but 4 stars because Grady's does charge for shipping and it is a little on the slow side (just basic UPS ground). I don't normally let the company impact my review of the product, but it seems in this case that Grady's is the only store that actually has the 9985 cover in stock and shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"Very high quality cover that does a great job of protecting my investment (Genesis E-320 gas grill)."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly great","review":"I have a large collection of bellydance videos, and the minute I turned this Kassar video on it shot to the top of my list.

Many of the film's shocks still hold up well today, thanks to Linda Blair's unnerving performance of 12-year-old girl who overnight turns into a grotesque, obscene, inhuman monster. A mild complaint: the film makes it clear that she is possessed by the Devil, although the original novel doesn't commit to that theory; keeping it ambiguous would have achieved greater suspense and mystery.DVD buyers beware; the DVD version only has Dolby Digital 5.1 audio on one side of the disc (the pan & scan side), not the other side. I would recommend buying the \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD of the film, or the more expensive \\"Limited Collector's Edition\\" DVD that has supplementary material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Island DVD","review":"The DVD reproduction is excellent! The video and audio are both crisp and clean due to an outstanding remastering effort--all DVDs should have this much care given to them in the digital transfer process! The story of course remains the same, but what will really enlighten all of you who have been haunted by this film since it debuted in the early 70s, is that the 70 minute documentary adds context and perspective that is both edifying and exceedingly entertaining...kind of brings you down from the andrenaline surge after the film is over. If you haven't seen the film yet, this will be an added treat, and will help realize that the monster is not the little girl with the revolving head, but the man who's lost his faith. This is not a story meant to proselytize folks to Christianity (as the director is not a Christian), but illuminates deeper truths that plague humans of all walks and creeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exorcist versus Omen","review":"We are talking about a movie which is 26 years old now but I think Omen which is from 1976 contains more serious horrors. First of all we see an evil or maybe the devil himself capture the body of a teenager girl and makes fun of it while he is scaring them and of course us. I think seeing her vomiting a disgusting green crap or turning her head 360 degrees are nothing when they are considered the diaglos of the thing and the priest. Because imagining a talk with a satanistic creature is already a horrible action. Therefore the convarsations between devil and person has been extended in the third part which I enjoyed only those dialogs in the movie. Anyway,The Exorcist has always been the number one favourite of all horror movie addicteds and also the great supporter of nightmares for others. But I still keep my vote for Omen."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't get better than this","review":"I hadn't seen The Exorcist in years, and bought it on DVD since it was a classic. Turns out, this is the best DVD in my small but growing collection! The picture is beautiful, and the sound is awesome. Besides the brilliant movie itself, the extras go above and beyond with this set. TWO commentary tracks (one by the director, and one by the author/screenwriter), interviews, The Making Of which is very insightful, storyboards,... there is so much it takes both sides of the disc! You will not be disappointed by this title - especially for the price! You will get many hours of enjoyment from this; especially if it scares you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but immature!","review":"Im an average 13 year old kid, and ive read facts that when this film came out, it caused \\"mass hysteria\\", i dont know what those hysterical weirdos were thinking, this movie was utterly disturbing, but not scary enough to faint! but the movie was pretty disgusting, and the language was way too explict.

They all do an excellent job of portraying humans the way they'd probably act if a demonic possession did actually happen. Some say this film's boring, I say it's a roller coaster ride of a movie.

The Exorcism of Emily Rose(2005) has much more feel than this Exorcist. Oh, in the end, both Preachers die but the young girl lives, and her demons leave her body due to the exorcism that is performed on her.If you want to see a really scary film; the only one i recommend which i think is very nice and highly worth it is a movie titled, \\"Carrie\\" with actress Sissy Spacek. That is a Classic! A beautiful story with a Tragic ending. The final parts are sad but what a movie. Even the flute music is beautiful, very touching to the soul.

Who in the 21st century believes in devils and demons, and who would actually be scared by such nonsense? Why has the devil decided to possess this little girl? Why doesn't the devil possess somebody powerful so he can influence other people and take over the world? What is the devil trying to achieve by taking over the little girl? The movie doesn't answer such important questions.A lot of the movie is just shock value. There is no substance underneath. In 1973 this may have been scary, but now it looks ridiculous. Hopefully, trash like this can disappear and be forgotten over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"crazy movie one of the worst","review":"Horror movies have many purpopes the directer of this film must of thought it is just to gross and disturb you it actually is sopposed to scare entertain excite you and let you have fun i really do not like movies that disturb you. this movie is not a classic at all the specail effects are out dated the whole movie was basicly a cheezy but disturbing movie that is not a horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"OK, I would say this is the worst movie ever, but Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange and In The Name of the King have those titles. There is no background for the old guy in the beginning. We don't know why the demon selected this particular child. The younger priest that first meets the possessed chick doesn't even try to do it himself first before bringing in the other guy (again, no real explanation). The self sacrifice at the end is empty and really didn't have any value (they left nothing behind as far as we know). The detective is a joke, provides absolutely no value to the story. Only watch if you enjoy movies that provide absolutely no entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly. Silly. Silly.","review":"A modestly entertaining, well-made thriller that has somehow managed to tap into the collective unconscious in a way that few movies ever have.I found the film to be occasionally disturbing (never once actually frightening) and generally convinced that it had something serious to say about GOOD and EVIL. What exactly it is that the film has to say about GOOD and EVIL is never exactly made clear. The anniversary edition of the DVD features interviews with William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty, who speak in hushed tones about the conception/execution of the film, as if they were discussing the creation of some deep and profound work of art. However, all of their best intentions/pretensions cannot disguise the fact that The Exorcist is, in the final analysis, a deeply silly little horror movie, with nothing really important or especially very interesting to say.Still, there are a couple of good jolts, though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a car wreak","review":"Fat too many people slow down for a car wreck. What is it that they want to see? Mangled bodies and blood? Here we have a young girl masturbating with a crucifix and shouting, \\"F*** me! F*** me!\\" to a priest.

After watching \\"The Exorcist\\" you may have a desire to take a shower to get clean again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but not as scary as some say.","review":"Let me just say that i loved this movie. Although made 9 years before i was born, i enjoyed it greatly.However, there is no way that i thought it was the scariest movie of all time. It might have been because of all the \\"shock/startle\\" horror movie out these days, or possibly because i had read the book before seeing it. I made sure that i watched it after dark alone for maximum effect, but it failed to scare me at all. If any thing, i found some of the scenes rather humerous (such as the \\"walking\\" down the steps) but that might just be my strange sense of humour.Aside from this though, it is a great movie. My best advice is watch it yourself and make up your own mind on it. After all, its been nearly 30 years since it was first released and for it to survive that long, it surely must be considered a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying","review":"If you are new to the horror movie watching genre, I'd skip this one until you've watched a couple others. This movie will give even the most hard watched horror fan nightmares. Centering on a young girl who becomes posessed by a demon(s)and a priest whose faith is fading away, you will become caught up in the changes the girl goes through when the demon fully takes over. Although the movie was made in the seventies, it does not take take away from the scare factor. This movie is best watched with the lights on and definately not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this to anyone","review":"I thought this movie was great. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to be scared. I remember like 2 days before I watched it my mom was at her friend's house & we were all talking about scary movies & I said how I had seen all thses horror movies & hadn't gotten scared. And her friend goes have you ever seen the exorcist & I said no, why? And my mom started laughing, & I said what's so funny? And she goes you think you can watch ANY horror movie & not get scared? And I replied with yeah, So she said we'll stop at blockbuster on the way home and I'll rent the exorcist for you & then we'll see if you can watch ANY horror movie. So I got through maybe half of it & I couldn't watch anymore. but even though it scared me half-to-death I still loved it, I thought it was brillant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go up there.","review":"It's hard to believe that this movie is twenty five years old. It stands up to the test of time very well and sets a standard for a much maligned genre. The story of a possessed child and the exercise to roust the devil from within is actually done with a bit of class. The movie has been so imitated and misappropriated throughout the last quarter century that it's difficult not to know the plot and outcome already, that said, the film still scares the bejesus out of ya'. In the anniversary edition you get a new scene that is quite possibly the scariest part of the movie, I skipped back to check it out again after the flick was done. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exorcist","review":"A film which was banned - was there any reason? Looking at this film again (superbly made for DVD)I find it a mixed bag. On one hand I think it is a great film about relationships with some brilliant performances - the only thing is that I don't find it very scary. Perhaps it is that I am not religious in any way so the shocks that are implied through the demonic imagery now just look dated. The Exorcist is not as scary as the Omen, or indeed the Blair Witch Project - but watch the Flash trailer on DVD - it's scarier than the entire film. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film, but it is not for the reasons why I usually like horror films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey little girl, what are you doing with that cross?","review":"Of all horror flicks made to date, this has to be one of the all time classics. The graphic horror scenes and profanity certainly don't make this a movie for the faint-of-heart, but it presents the full chilling effect of William Peter Blatty's novel. Linda Blair is precociously talented in her role of Reagan McNeill. There are so many scenes in this film that will be indelibly etched in the memories of anyone who watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a very scary movie!","review":"In 1973, this movie was reportedly the most graphically horrifying film ever in wide release. For todays' teen-gorefest set, it may prove to be a disappointment, however. \\"The Exorcist\\" is far more cerebral than most contemporary horror films, relying on suspense to shock its audience rather than visual effects. Even after seeing this movie countless times, the part that still spooks me the most is in the beginning, when Fr. Marron is examining an ancient artifact.....and the clock on the wall stops!!

I didn't think it was horrible, but I thought it was really slow, and totally based around shock, vulgarity, and disgust, and not around an interesting plot. To each their own I guess, but I don't see what all of the hype is about.

It features make it what is. This anniversary edition is a must in your dvd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic film loaded with great features","review":"This is undeniably one of the most intense and personal works ever created. Regardless of whether the viewer \\"believes\\", Friedkin's continuous use of quick shifts in mood set the viewer on edge before delivering its most powerful and shocking blows.The DVD features are amazing, featuring an extensive and interesting documentary about the film's conception and execution, which contains interviews with all (*all*) of the primary players, including make-up, lighting and effects technicians. My favorite DVD so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, but you already knew that, didn't you?","review":"The film that stirred up so much controversy with its release did so with good reason: this movie delivers, in every sense of the word. If you can suffer through the oh-so-boring 1st 30 minutes, you're in for a treat. I saw this for the 1st time when I was 17. Already a horror movie veteran, I watched it by myself with the lights off (what other way is there?) and must admit I was glad when mommy came home. Geez this film messes with you! Good performances and plenty of nightmares in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb horror flick!","review":"I brought the special edition on video just because it might scare me and I thought half of the movie wasn't scary. There were just a bit few scenes that were scary and those scenes are the Spiderwalk scene and the scene were the girl's head is twisting. I thought this horror movie was dumb and it didn't even scare me. I thought it was kind of funny actually because in the movie Scary Movie 2 they make fun of this movie and that's why it didn't scare me. It does have good acting, best special effects. But the whole movie wasn't scary and it didn't give me nightmares. So if you plan on seeing this movie you won't get scared. I guess back in the old days in the late 70's everybody was scared when they saw this movie but it didn't scare me. If you want to see a good horror flick go see The Others."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"I've never seen the original Exorcist movie. But I am into scary movies. So hubby bought this movie for me. It is interesting to watch in the beginning. But it goes on for ever with the boring talking. Hubby said that's all add on.

The film is supposedly based on a True Story about a young boy, whom in 1949, became posessed. That is unconfirmed.MY REVIEW:\\"I hate this movie with a passion because it is so evil, and only a devil worshiper would love this movie and want to watch again and again. It is the ultimate evil you can find in this world. The scary thing about it is, is that this movie is based on a true story. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG: This movie is VERY scary, but is just a gross out devil movie. No one in this whole world should see something so terrible. IT IS BAD- plain and simple, and I mean BAD as in it isn't a good movie for anyone to see. So all of you people who say this is a great movie, you just make evil seem so good.\\"- MJV & the Movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Stupid!Stupid!Stupid!

I wasn't even born yet for the orginal movie but when I heard they were coming out with the director's cut I told myself I must have this movie for my horror collection. It lives up to the hype of the scariest film of all time and the bonus scenes really added to the movie pace and endurence. So if your like me and love classic movies of all types of collections then pick this movie up and keep it in your horror collection as a collector's item because the Director's cut of the Exorcist is defently worth the price of having this copy in your movie collection. I never get tired of watching this version time and time again. So don't listen to other reviews just make up your own mind and come buy a classic horror movie that you wont be sorry watching again with the added scenes and material left out of the orginal movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scare the Devil Out of You","review":"THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER. EVER. Gruesome imagery with f-bombs galore is for starters. Do not ever watch this movie at night or alone. I MEAN IT. The thing that makes this even more scary(if that's possible!) is that it actually happens and is making a comeback! Rated R is an understatement! Test your faith. Prove your supernatural strength. That is what this movie was made for. Literally. Ever fight a demon-possessed person? Ever try to get rid of the demon in them?

Nah!!! Almost everything that could be said about this cinematic milestone has long come to pass. I've just dropped by to impress upon all the prospective buyers of this masterpiece to stick with the original. For the lucky ones out there who have yet to experience this film, STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. The New Director's Cut, while having a superior sound mix, falters in comparison. With the exception of the now famous SPIDER WALK, the re-edit takes away the mystique. For the uninitiated, Mr. Friedkin doesn't let the experience creep up on you, instead(& I would guess it's aimed at the ever-shortening attention span of the younger film-going public)he bashes you over the head with it.

This motion picture was made at a time when the film industry still made horror for mature, thinking audiences. Gripping, overwhelming. To this day few films have matched it in being able to intelligently shock and disturb the viewer.There are many people who refuse to watch THE EXORCIST for religious reasons. They are cheating themselves. This film does not glorify evil. Rather it shows the Devil and his demons as prideful and arrogantly foolish (after all, wouldn't anyone or anything in rebellion against an omnipotent, omniscient God be arrogantly foolish?). The priests, Fr. Merrin and Fr. Karras, symbolize the Christian virtue of Faith triumphing over doubt and the ultimate expression of Faith, self-sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Stars","review":"I like this movie a lot. It had some great scenes and a good story line. I reccomend watching this BEFORE reading the book (if you do plan on reading it) because then you can't tell what will come next, and it just comes out a whole lot scarier. And the book goes into more detail so you will still have more to look forward to.If you are athiest or don't believe in possesion this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you like any kind of monster flick you should like this. It was very unique, I hadn't seen a movie like this before.Remember though, just because a lot of other people say it is the scariest movie doesn't mean you will think it is. Even still, I would give it a shot. If you do end up liking it you will have found a great horror story, if you don't you will have something to make fun of later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Von Sydow is fun to see....","review":"I am probably not the greatest authority on the genre of horror movies - but this one, while it is certainly one of the best, falls short of the excellent reviews and attention it is given. The theme is interesting - possession is something that has fascinated people throughout the history of human beings - and the movie is filmed pretty well - nothing much to complain about. For some reason I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars though - maybe if I was religous I would find the film more intriguing - as it is I do not find it very frightening - but well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most terrifying film of all time","review":"I have no doubt that this is the scariest movie ever made. No stone was left unturned when William Freidken and team wanted to make this a film that would burn itself into you memory.

There's just one seen added and a remasterd sound and color job. Some hated the virsion. I say that it adds to the experince a bit. The experince in frightining bliss.

Take the scene where ellen burstyn is coming home from the doctor's and walks into her daughter's room. in the original there was no music. in the new version there is music that creeps up on you and i think makes the scene better not to mention the flashing demon faces. and the spiderwalk scene is very wild. i have seen this many times and it is one of my favorite horror movies. Linda Blair and Ellen Burtsyn both should have won academy awards for this. Watch this in the dark by yourself with the lights out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"Brilliant movie...

My mother and my friend told me that it was really scary and I was like ok lets see how it goes. It was completely pathetic. I didn't find one shred of scary in that movie at all. There were some cool parts like the spider thing down the stairs but not scary. It was probably one of the most disappointing scary movies. It may have been scary back then but frankly its as childish as a Disney film now."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and boring, therefore not scary...","review":"This is one of those rare instances where I actually read the book before I saw the movie. Blatty's novel is plenty scary but it is especially great because its uncomplicated and not very long, so impatient hotheads such as myself can actually enjoy reading it. All of the scenes from the book are in the movie, but they're a lot weaker in comparison. My girlfriend told me it was really long, and I totally agree. just too many long streches. This is yet another horror movie that actually looks worse on dvd. The transfer is to crystal clear. These movies look so much better when there being shown in dark, murky, worn out TV transfers.

The whole film is spent thinking...........is this going to be the scary part, is this going to be the scary part etc. In several parts of this film I found myself in tears laughing, especially whenthe kid is doing some sit-ups on the bed even Big Arnie would be proud of.

Never had I, nor any of my friends, been impacted so greatly by a movie. Luckily, I was wearing a strong shirt - without realizing it, I had a death grip on my shirt as my sweaty right hand gripped and pulled throughout most of the movie.The flashes of evil cast an eerie spell on everyone who dared watch. College atheletes, who weren't afraid of anything, were afraid to open shower curtains as their imaginations got the best of them. There weren't even any shower scenes, ala Psycho.If you've never seen the full, uncut version of this flick, you owe it to yourself to buy it (or rent it) and get the scare of your life.I own my version, but it's not for sale.GKS: Syracuse University Class of 1975"},{"rating":"2","title":"That guy was a moron who can't spell!","review":"If any of you are looking to buy this movie, don't listen to Jonathan Taylor. First of all, he can't spell. Second, this movie is a cult classic. It paved the way for every modern day horror movie. I'll admit, the 'effects' are a little cheesy, but it was the 70's for pete's sake. Some of the scariest moments are those you only see for a split second. I watched this movie at a cast party, and we ended up pausing it on the face of 'the evil one.' The effects do not have to be computer-generated to be scary. There doesn't need to be all blood and gore. This religous freak-out more than makes up for any lack of effects.

It wasn't because of the special effects nor the idea of the little girl being enslaved by a demon, but because they seemed to go WELL beyond the limits.Growing up, I'd only seen the TV version until recently. Watching the ... scene along with what was being said gave me chills! I had to cut it off. It disturbs me because of all the things that they dared to do in the film. If you are religious in the slightest and believe in God and Satan, you'll understand after watching this.Some people laugh at this movie not realizing that this movie is almost 30 years old.

This film is also shear genius and an art onto itself. The green pea soup and head spinning has become synonymous in our every day vocabulary that is associated with this masterpiece of a horror film.The underlying theme is a vulnerable Meghan, a tortured soul that internally wrestles between the forces of goodness and evil.

Also, the idea that Regan's mom was an actress (in a movie) didn't fly with me...but other than that, the film works--all the way. Cobb, Burstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair...et al...make for a solid cast.I think William Friedkin is one of the finest directors around, if not the best, when it comes to creating atmosphere and using extras.Lastly, if you're the religious type and believe in demons...you just may want to stay clear of this fright classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will scare the wits out of you","review":"This is the most frightening movie ever!

The film contained odd scenes and things of freakish nature, but it was not terrifying. I will admit that it was disturbing at some places. A young girl possesed, well that in itself is disturbing, but if you are looking for a scare, don't look here. The movie was great though, a little less than I expected, but still it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Jesus [....] you.","review":"Why has The Exorcist become one of the most well known, influential, and important horror films of all time? I'll tell you why......because it had a very healthy budget and pushed the envelope. Two things that usually don't co-exist together in film. When The Exorcist was screened in the seventies people were literally throwing up at the theatre. How many films can you say that about that come out now? None! Coincidence? I think not! People in the film business now have this notion that you cant be professional and have extreme elements at the same time, and that's exactly the problem. Nobody will finance films like this anymore, that's why the 70's kicked a** and why horror films stink now. The Exorcist is disturbing, evil, dark, extreme, and professional. It's everything a horror film should be, and nothing like the films made nowadays. The main theme here is good vs. evil, and even if you dont normally have any religous beliefs......you will while watching The Exorcist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest Movie Ever Made","review":"This movie is so scary that when I watch it during the day I still get scared.

This is surely one of the most horrifying movies ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never watch it again .","review":"I saw The Exorcist the year it was released. I was so terrified after watching it I could never watch it again. Whenever they have specials on about it and show parts of the movie, I have to cover my eyes & ears. I'd be spooked for months if I didn't. ( Even 26 years later) That means it was a great movie and did it's job... scarying people. I believe that it could happen in real life & that's the scary part. If you love to be scared, this will do it. Keep in the back of your mind that this sort of thing HAS happened to people before. Enjoy the movie ! I also want to add that Linda Blair did an excellent job and no one could top her performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In the not so distant past Linda Blair indicated that a certain addition of The Exorcist also had a special feature regarding how they did some of the scenes.

Hats off for a spooky movie well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best and Original","review":"This is probably the best horror film to date, still an excellent movies even though the effects are dated.

She was only 15 when she made the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 Minutes Over The Editted Version","review":"Being that the editted version found a way into my permanent memory, I found those eleven minutes of editted scenes plus some subliminal scenes as well.

This is how reality horror should be done. Yes this is based on a true story. Buy this and the biographey about it. The ultimate scary movie. Don't have your expectations to high, like most movie you go see. Use your imagination as well, and put yourself in the characters shoes.

This movie is classic. I enjoy the added scenes and can't figure out why they werent in the original version. I particularly like the quick flashing ghoulish faces and the highlighted devil/statue scene in the dark bedroom. I very much enjoyed the directors commentary.

An ominous mood is established at the outset that quickly escalates to bone-chilling terror. Burstyn embodies the frantic mother, while Miller is the film's emotional heart as the tortured Karras. And young Blair would never match her outing as the possessed child. Look for a solid late-career turn by Lee J. Cobb as a curious detective. To the uninitiated, beware-this is still strong stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing with Some Interesting Scenes, But Real Tacky as Well!","review":"We all know the plot. A 12 year old normal girl slowly turns into a raving, supergirl agent of the devil, a freak so outrageous that she , and the movie, are really more science fiction than horror! If anyone really believes this stuff happens, well that is up to the viewer, not to mention the ideas of Roman Catholicism. Ellen Burstyn does a great job as the very bewildered, near celebrity actress/mother /recent divorcee thrown into this very ugly vortex of surreal primitivism. Also note the very antiquated medical equipment in the hospital. Definitely, 2000's medical procedures have improved in 33 years! The special effects are excellent, if you don't mind some rather disgusting bodily excretions! Also some interesting Georgetown,DC scenes. Worth a look if you can hold your nose, and forget reality for about 90 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still sleeping with all the lights on!!!","review":"This movie still holds up as the scariest movie I've ever seen!

They did a great job remastering the picture and sound. But I think the film lost something, something small but very important. It's like coloring black-and-white pictures, a kind of sacrilege. And the segments they added, added nothing new to the movie. So I will keep the old tape, the original release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old","review":"I was surprised when Warner Bros. actually re-released this movie. I 'd already seen it, but thought I would see it again to find out what was so different. Big deal, there we're a few different scenes in the movie that the original did not have. This should tell you how outdated this movie is-when I saw it in the theater, There we're only two other people In there with me. In my opinion, Warner Bros. should have thought twice before re-releasing this one, cause It obviously didn't make any money, the second time around. If you have never seen this movie, it will probably scare you. If you have seen this movie already, don't bother seeing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SCARY AT ALL. EXTREMELY OVERRATED","review":"All my life I have heard about \\"The Exorcist\\" and how terrifying it was. I recently bought it on dvd and was very disappointed. There were only a couple of interesting scenes involving Linda Blair. The rest was very boring. This movie was probably seen as scary when it first came out, but anyone my age who is 18-24 and grew up watching \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\", \\"Hellraiser\\", \\"Phantasm\\", etc, will not like this movie. Im not saying that a horror movie has to be very graphic, because I do like the lesss graphic movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula and the original Frankenstein, but The Exorcist is not worth your money if you are looking for a good scare. The Exorcist is honestly the most boring movie I have ever seen. If you really want to be scared, check out the Phantasm series- particularly part 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype No substance","review":"I bought this movie thinking this must be hella scary since i've read so many people ranting about it. When it was done i've never wanted my money back so quickly. Not only did it plod along at a snail's pace, but the visual's were NOT scary. \\"The Shining\\" and \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" were both 10 times better then this sorry excuse for a movie. the story was barely there and the conflict with the priest and his mother was just a worthless side story. in fact this movie feels like just a bunch of side stories without any link or merit. Avoid at ALL costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this scared you please seek help!","review":"Being a TRUE horror fan this piece of crap always rubs me the wrong way. What do you sad saps find so scary. Is it the little wanna be devil voices or Pea soup being spewed. Go see a real horror film with real atmosphere. What is there to be scared of anyways a demonic possessed little girl. That's a pathetic vilian at best. Not only that but She isn't even convincing there is no suspension of disblief. I wanted to like this movie I really did but I can't forget all I know about horror and just Conform. For real Scares see a Dario Argento directed movie or just see Henry: Portait of a Serial Killer both are superb in atmosphere and suspension of disblief."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are people raving about? This movie was bad","review":"Classic? Horror? I don't think so. I consider myself to be a film buff but I could hardly pay attention to this movie. The effects were comical, I would have laughed if I wouldn't had been so bored to tears. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were anemic. The most disappointing aspect was its failure to meet the hype. Every time the music began playing and practically nothing would happen, I'd get angry at the director for wasting the music, which could have been this movie's only saving grace. I was sorely disappointed. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary to be enjoyable","review":"\\"The Exorcist\\" scared me so mucht that it was hard to sleep at night. The movie was too scary to be enjoyable. It is fun to watch movies that are scary, but have some comical or entertaining moments. This movie was just plain horrific violence. What was the point of this film? To prove that devils can get inside peoples' bodies and turn them into evil, dispicable, deplorable, and gory half human half demon beings? I'm a Catholic, and I have read in the Bible that this has happened. But, what is the point of watching this movie, just to make you sleepless at night and worrying if the devil will enter your body? I didn't watch the whole film. Maybe there was something in there that explained more detail about it. If so, then I apologize for being so critical of the movie. But if not, I say stick with films that are scary, but still have meaning, like \\"Cape Fear\\" or \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" or \\"Misery\\". Or, if you're a horror fan, stick with \\"The Shining\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormous Letdown","review":"I don't see what's so scary about this movie. Maybe it's because I'm an athiest that this doesn't scare me like I was assured it would. Everyone I know and countless reviews have said that this was the scariest movie ever, and I was really letdown when it was just a long, boring, and frankly silly Christian flick. I also read that it might offend you if it didn't scare you. This movie didn't bother me in any way, aside from making me sleepy. It was the same story with Rosemary's Baby, another big letdown for me. I almost don't want to see The Omen for fear of another dissappointment. Once again, I'm an athiest, so this might be scarier for a religous person. That's all I have to say about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the DEVIL were they thinking?????","review":"\\"The Exorcist\\" was the scariest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a bit. Now, I love to watch fun horror films, the kind that scare you but also give you quite a bit of entertainment, and even some humor. But, \\"The Exorcist\\" did no such thing. The film was way too scary to even entertain. All of the disgusting blood and the nonsensical devil spirit made the movie far too gross and horrific. Plus, the story didn't seem to be going anywhere. I admit I could be wrong. Maybe the story begins to get better. I only saw a little bit of it. Alas, the little bit I saw left me so frightened and disgusted that I didn't want to see anymore. For those of you who love scary movies, even if they aren't intellectually stimulating and entertaining, see this movie. But, for those of you who enjoy fun, suspenseful, intellectually stimulating and yet still horrific films, see something like \\"Cape Fear\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and silly","review":"This is one of the most overrated horror films (beside Night Of The Living Dead).It's dull and silly, and not scary at all.If you want to see real essential horror films, then watch The Evil Dead, Phantasm, Basket Case or The Thing, they are MUCH BETTER than this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"very stupid","review":"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS VERY STUPID I EVEN SAW THE DIRECTORS CUT I SAW IT LAST YEAR IT WASNT EVEN SCARY COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER HORROR MOVIES I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE DONT WATCH IT DONT WAYSTE YOUR MONEY AND I WAS ONLY 12 WHEN I SAW IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Horror Film...","review":"I've seen quite a number of Horror films in my past. The majority I found quite cheesy or extremely too bloody and gruesome. However, when I saw the Exorcist I was truly scared. It had the impact that a true Horror film should. First, it left me scared to walk around the house and I remained scared for a couple days everywhere I went. Secondy, is caused me to look more into the subject of exorcism. For these reasons I say this is the greatest Horror movie of all time. I don't think there are many good horror films that are in a way believable or thought provoking as this one was. If anyone knows of anymore that do this, please e-mail me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still packs a punch","review":"It is easy to banter around a movie as being the scariest ever made. Buy this movie actually lives up to the billing and should give shivers up one's spine unless one is already dead. The soundtrack is outstanding in setting the mood of the scenes. I saw the original movie when it first came out (amidst the tremendous controversy) and found it gripping. Of the added scenes, I will agree that the change to the ending was unnecessary. In the years since it was made, it has lost none of it's punch and is a very powerful and well crafted movie. My first DVD had to be replaced (it contained blank portions while the sound continued)and the replacement sometimes did not want to load. But once the movie started, it is one of the best to put one on edge. Sometimes, the medical scenes were more chilling than the possession scenes.The cardboard DVD case, however, merits a thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, not-so-great DVD","review":"Okay, this film deserves 5 stars. It is, after all, still the most shockingly frightening film EVER. That's saying a lot considering there are hundreds of horror films out there. This one still gives me the chills. But, the DVD (although digitally restored to perfection) has been released before. Of course, there are new scenes--yes, yes, yes, the famous \\"spider-walk\\" scene is fantastic (and chilling)--and the DVD still holds the director's commentary. It totally missed the Documentary which came with the first DVD release. It's a disappointment, not a big one, but one that would have made this DVD the absolute copy to own. I'm afraid the director's commentary isn't enough to keep me satisfied, but this is still worthy of your money . . . and a place in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2000 version is the best compared to the 1973 version.","review":"I recently had seen The Exorcist in its newly rereleased theatrical form with additional footage not seen in the 1973 version.I was glued to the screen.I wouldn't dare move from the seat I was sitting on.Just to watch this classic on the big screen was a special treat for me.I love horror films so watching this film,I knew that I would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful tool for Quality","review":"I have used this book as a reference tool on many occasions in my quality engineering work."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"If your looking for a christmas album about the true meaning of christmas..this is a great album ..full of songs about the true christian meaning of christmas. ..ive listened to it everyday since I purchased it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"America's 25 Favoritye Chrismas Song is not sung by various artist that you know.

Usually this isn't necessarily a good thing; the energy and originality seeps out over extended efforts. (See Mannheim Steamroller. First one, superior, then flatter and flatter.) Grant, however, continually mines new material and somehow brings a high level of inspiration to each new effort. But her first is, in my opinion, unquestionably her best. The arrangements of the classics are brilliantly original, providing great accompaniment to Amy's soulful enthusiasm. The fun songs are fun with verve--her \\"Sleigh Ride\\" is the definitive version for me--but when she slows down for \\"Tennessee Christmas\\" and \\"Heirlooms,\\" they are infused with real depth, giving especially the latter a unique power. And that's coming from a lifelong agnostic. This is a superb album which deserves to be a mainstay of any Christmas collection, particularly those of deep faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Christmas Classic","review":"Amy Grant's first Christmas release has become a classic in it's own right. It features just the right balance between original and traditional songs to feel Christmassy right away but new at the same time. Of course, \\"Tennessee Christmas\\" and \\"Emmanuel\\" have become classics in their own right. Her version of \\"Little Town\\" is fun, but possibly my favorite from the new songs is the lesser known \\"Love Has Come.\\" It captures the feeling of the modern holiday while reminding us of the true reason we celebrate.I tend to pull favorite Christmas CD's out and listen to them during the year. This one and her second, Home for Christmas, get listen to regularly.If you don't have this in your Christmas collection, you need to add it today. It will become a favorite for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful Christmas album from a talented singer","review":"Grant's first Christmas album is a perennial favorite.

Called and they sent another switch, free but i paid shipping. a few months later it was once again not uaseable.

Our son is a true and rough and tuff little 2 year old. He drives it in second gear all the time he loves to go fast and spin out...

But it is not well made. We have had it for 3 weeks. The trailer cracked when we put things in it. When our son backs up, the tractor runs the trailer over. The tailgate won't stay shut. The main front cover has already broken and will no longer stay on. Instructions said you could put a 12 volt battery in it (instead of the 8 volt that comes with it)but when we do this the front covers won't shut tight. We have bought power wheel products in the past. Our 2 children have used them for 3 summers with absolutely no problems. I will not buy any more products from the company that made this tractor. We are getting ready to purchase a kids ATV and we will definitely buy a power wheels because they are made to last. This tractor will not last! Even though my son loves it - it is made poorly!

Ian's voice here reminds me of a dried-up, raspy piece of rawhide. Maybe not necessarily a bad thing, but sad to hear compared to what it once was. The songs are not too great anyway. \\"Steel Monkey\\" is about the worst, in my opinion. The overall sound is maybe not so bad, if only I was born to some other language. The lyrics seem so sophomoric that I feel embarrassed when I listen to it, even while alone. \\"Budapest\\" is supposed to be really great -- Ian himself seems to regard it especially highly -- but it did not appeal to me at all. Kind of weird, I thought, and as a Tull fan I'm used to a bit of weirdness. \\"She Said She Was a Dancer\\" is better, in my opinion. \\"Mountain Men\\" was the one song on here I really did like.

It is very important to let the ALL of the water out of the hose before you roll it back up.

When I hear people take an interest in the job, I'm proud, it gives me the spark I need to continue pursuing my goal. When I read Schneiderman's book, i felt repulsed and almost disgraced. What is presented in this book is nothing more then a short briefing on select firehouses. It is not a comprehensive guide as some may think. The photos in the book are hardly anything worthy of print. The one good thing this book shows is that literally anyone could put garbage on paper and get a publishing deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's billed to be...","review":"If you want the Joe Schneiderman guide to buffing NYC, than this is it. If you want an in-depth primer for the department or city in general, this is not it. I thought this book would be more of a reference or handbook given the title, but it is not.

Joe, if you are reading this, please stop writing books and find another interest.

I can say that it has very good storage, like the front pocket the inside music holder and little compartments but for me, being short as i am and having to carry books and stuff around school was going to be very hard.

Why not, since our library has recently stocked their shelves with dvds? It sure beats the price of a rental.This is also an only-for-hard-core-sci-fi-fans flick, and nothing else. The element of a hi-tech robot gone awry just doesn't work anymore, ever since the Lost in Space TV series. The well-seasoned actors can't save this production, making one fast foward certain scenes (you got to figure maybe that's why Terrance Stamp was to be the first to go).It's disappointing to say the least. The only good space flicks ever made are the ALIEN series. Like Mission to Mars, I can't recommend Red Planet to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but boring and desperate for attention.","review":"At least \\"Mission to Mars\\" had an interesting ending and gave us something to think about. Not to say that \\"Red Planet\\" was a total waste. The special effects were good and the idea was inticing, but overall, director Anthony Hoffman didn't make much of the material he was given. The film drags and desperatly searches for ideas to keep us interested. It doens't know who the bad guy is or what's going on half the time. First the robot is trying to kill Val Kilmer and his crew, then little aliens are jumping out at them. If the film could make up its mind, then maybe we would care (or know) what the heck was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSION TO THE RED PLANET(Mars?)","review":"When I think of this movie as a sci-fi movie, I get a CGI headache. I even understood MISSION TO MARS, but all I could tell is that when Val met Carrie, it was love at the next first mission to space, everyone else probably signed off to do other more intelligent movies. One of the more suprising elements of this movie was the addition of Terrance Stamp. His appearance was almost as awesome as Robert Forrester in Supernova, but like supernova his character died almost halfway through the plot too. As far as the plot goes, I could tell what was going to happen, from start to finish, which I think makes the movie so disappointing, especailly with the old \\"the escape ship will only support two\\" routine. So, I guess all-and-all the rest of the movie was fine, just pretend, I'm serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it...","review":"The basics of redundant system design and standard safety protocols have been ignored to create a well-acted, good looking flick that I can't believe for more than a few minutes straight.

What is it about? Two hours of Val Kilmer, no thanks. That one guy from \\"Law & Order\\" fell off of a mountain on Mars. Is that possible? Then a robot comes to life and tries to kill the rest of the team. Too bad the robot lost the fight. Trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of last year's worst.","review":"Red Planet does something amazing. It manages to have almost non-stop action and yet still bore you at the same time. Why is that? Probably because of the lack of a real threat or the fact that you can't see a thing due to the poor lighting, or because of the blatant predictability as to who'll live or who won't.As for cliches, the movie has an abundance of them. Not only in dialogue (\\"If you won't do it for him, do it for me\\") but in the way all the situations are played out. So many scenes are trite and banal, especially in the end when the girl saves the boy, and the boy gets the girl. This is the kind of romance that's rather perfunctory because it's hard to believe it could even formulate in the first place.As I think of it now, not only is Mission to Mars 100 times better than this movie, but I also thought Battlefield Earth was even better. At least that film could be enjoyed in a campy manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, am I glad I rented it first","review":"Compared to Mission to Mars and Pitchblack this movie \\"bites\\" !!The plot is allright at first, but the execution is plain awful.

That she can act is a fortunate addition.The storyline is fairly decent, if you can forgive the cliches and science-class lapses.

Reading the reviews would have really put me off the Red Planet . Just so you can get a gauge of what I like: I switched off Space Cowboys after fifteen minutes because it was junk and looked like it was a 'formula movie', Mission to Mars was equally iffy, but the Red Planet really captured my attention. If was an excellent sci-fi with the right blend of ingredients mixed together in the right order. If you want kick-boxing action from start to finish don't get this, if you want a good blend of action, suspense, impressive and well thought out special effects and even some philosophy then go for the Red Planet. It is a step above most of stuff out there today. But everyone should remember that rating movies is a subjective rather than objective activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much too underrated!","review":"I would agree with anyone who says this movie is not \\"great\\", but it definitely borders on \\"very good\\". The acting is NOT bad, it's just subtle, and I didn't get the impression that anyone here was just working for a paycheck. Although I have seen way too many movies that try to compensate for poor writing with great special effects (and fail miserably in the attempt), RED PLANET's script isn't that bad and the special effects DO make up for it, especially if you love robotics. I also love the whole feel of this movie; if you badly want to see humanity go to Mars, this movie will just get you revved up more! Val Kilmer and Terence Stamp are wonderful (as usual) and Carrie Anne Moss depicts just the right amount of angst considering that she's the captain (although just about anyone could have played that role). I was very glad to add this to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD Movie","review":"Space Janitor Pat and Thomas do a GREAT movie! And it gets exciting when...

Things happen that are unexpected and keep the viewer wondering what is going to happen next. The overall ambience is good as is the acting; the mars landscape looks formidable, alien and a long way from home.A very smooth journey to Mars is interrupted by a nasty surprise that puts the whole thing at risk; the movie focuses on the efforts of the crew to correct the problem and get back home.

You gotta throw some [bad ones] in there too.This movie is by no means a great science fiction movie. It is, however, fun. What would happen if we were able to go to Mars?

That film was a magical experience, inspiring a sense of awe that I thought would never be achieved after Robert Zemeckis' even more wonderful sci-fi drama, Contact.Now we have Red Planet, a similarly plotted film that's admirable in its simplicity and lack of flash, but it's dull, uninteresting, and unexciting. The visuals are good, but none of it is compelling, the story is basic and predictable, and except for an interesting little subplot about life on Mars, this film fails to do anything different. True, it does harken to the style of 80's sci-fi thrillers, something I do enjoy, but when we've got a movie as boring as this one, what difference does it make?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"This is a good sci-fi for anyone with a love for Mars. Yes, it may be a bit far fetched...but isn't that the whole idea behind sci-fi?

The entire premise revolves around a disaster to the Mars mother ship caused by a solar flare. That's right, an ordinary occurrence that barely effects objects orbiting Earth, all but destroys this magnificent ship of the future, which is a lot farther from the sun than Earth, and results in the ensuing events that take up the rest of the movie. Everything breaks, everything burns (they never explain what is burning, or how), everything that can go wrong does. You see, we need to populate Mars because by the year 2000, there is no room left here. Have you ever looked out the window of an airplane, and noticed how much empty land you see? But we have run out of it in this movie, thus the mission. Ridiculous premise, implausible events, banking on the scientific ignorance of the viewing public.

It has a decent cast, some impressive visuals, but little of anything else is worth even slightly mentioning.Let's go over the acting. Val Kilmer is okay, Tom Sizemore is actually pretty good, but Carrie-Ann Moss is lifeless. Not only that, I have yet to see what the hype over her is.

The audience for this kind of movie isn't that stupid!

Hoffman and his scriptwriters (Chuck Pfarrer and Jonathan Lemkin) pull few surprises out of the hat, and some of the computer-generated visual effects are too fake-looking to make much of an impact, though performances and production values are uniformly fine.

The acting was pretty decent, although of course none of the characters are Royal Shakespearian quality...The plot was compelling, the special effects first rate. Music score blended in very well with the scenes and the charaters. Character developement occured right away and gave enough insight into their minds.

If you like B movies, and like to laugh at silly ones, then this is right up your alley.The story is absurd, the science nonexistent, and the most interesting character gets abandoned early on, never to be seen agian.That said, I had a good laugh, although I am quite sure the directors never intended this as a comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luthor and Superman","review":"You know, I don't know if I'd call this a masterpiece.

But who cares, the sleeve must be in every serious JOS collection. The solo organ works on \\"All the things you are\\" and \\"Zing\\" are surprisingly modern and display the JOS mastery on controlling both manuals and pedals and modern approach to the tunes. Art Blakey sitting in with an organ trio on a few tracks is probably the only recording ever made with Art with organ (no organists in his official discography). Eddie McFadden on guitar delivers like many of his supporting role with organists. This session is classic for the '56 - '59 period at Blue Note but it's not the highlight from the same period even when you get approx. 20min with bonus tracks from the original LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work","review":"I purchased this item with high hopes of being able to open jars e.g. pickles, mayo even without my husband around.

I am so sorry I purhcased this set. Unfortunately, when I received the package, I immediately threw away the box so I cannot send them back b/c I do not have a small box to send them back to Amazon/sender.

One of the reasons I purchased these was the top...I'm so tired of filling shakers from the bottom while salt and pepper pour out the holes. However, the inside of the salt top rusted horribly after just a couple months. I have since scrubbed them and poked thru all the holes, had them rust up again, scrubbed them/poked thru all the holes, had them rust up again...you get the idea. The pepper shaker has less of a rust problem, but it still rusts inside also. I love the look of them and if the tops didn't rust (or if I could figure out a way to stop them from rusting) I'd give them 5 stars! I'm currently shopping Amazon for new S&P shakers that don't have any metal...I'll have to fill from the bottom, but I've discovered that's a lesser pain in my butt than the rusted tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Look - Unuseable!","review":"These are big and beautiful but unfortunately the lids just spin and spin making them unuseable - if you want them purely for looks, then go for it.

We first came across another brand of soynut butter at a health food store and thought it was an OK alternative, but we like the I.M. Healthy varieties much better--less separation, more peanut-buttery texture, and excellent flavor. My wife is partial to the crunchy variety, but to me the soynuts don't quite have the same texture as peanut butter. My kids and I love this creamy variety--it's really hard to tell the difference from peanut butter. We haven't tried the sweetened variety, but I can't imagine a need for it, since this tastes fine. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for me as I am allergic to peanuts BUT","review":"This tastes great. I am allergic to peanuts and have missed peanut butter.

The material feels relatively nice and not real cheap.... only complaint is about the clip itself, which was mentioned in some other reviews- it can be hard to get on over some belts - for example I have a leather weaved belt which is a little thicker than a standard belt, and it is a bit difficult to get the clip on that belt. My other belts which are thinner, there is no problem.Overall though I have been fairly satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be Better","review":"the case is decent but lacks the ability to not jack up your belt torning it up with everytime you clip it on........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This is the Palm OEM version and fits great and looks as good.

The younger dude had no redeeming qualities and the older one --- well, he had none either. All they did for the entire movie was TAKE and RUN. Literally!They took advantage of nice people; I especially felt sorry for the (possibly) mentally impaired guy whom they forced their way into his car. He was on his way to a peaceful day of fishing. He was very nice to them. These idiots pushed their way into his car and the nice man drove them to his fishing spot.

People were lined up around the block to see the horror flick, and the path was set as to the type of music they would pursue. This three-disc set follows the beginning of the career of that first iteration of Sabbath. Everything that appears in this box set is a hit, and a great listen. All the major hits are here, as well as great songs that never got the airplay they deserved.

The instructions for each recipe are clear and concise. I had problems with just one of several recipes and I think it was the amount of beeswax used. This book is a good starting point for creativity and gives you ideas for using ingredients that you might not have considered. I appreciated the chapter divisions, but wished there were more recipes for using all the basic soaps in hand-milled recipes.

I wanted to make the goats milk soap, but the goats milk must have been a little too warm and the batch curdled. I also wanted to make the camouflage soap for the hunter's in my family. Here is the issue, it may seem like a dumb question, but, the recipe calls for 16 ounces of water boiling and poured over the tree bark. I did that, but I only got 9 ounces back after straining. Should you add more water so you have 16 oz. to mix with the lye, or use only the 9 oz you get after straining? Other than that it is all fairly clear. Good luck soap makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous typo","review":"This book has a potentially dangerous typo! The recipe on page 101 calls for 15.9 ounces of lye when it should be 5.9.

Little details like that would really help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the beginning soapmaker (and advanced, too)","review":"This is the book that taught me to make cold process soap. It contains enough information to be instructional without being intimidating. The text is well-written and the pictures are lovely, and there are brief instructions for melt & pour soaps and some other toiletries as well. I have made several batches of cold process soap using the recipes from this book, and all have turned out wonderfully. This book should be in every soapmaker's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of the Series","review":"This is probably my favorite of Mike Murray's Navy SEALs series. There's a lot more action than the \\"Blacklight\\" book, more SEALs, a very tense climax, and a nice twist at the end.The only kind of downside I had with it was the romantic subplot with the Princess. Granted, it was a very very small portion of the book and it wasn't sappy or melodramatic like a romance novel or anything, but it seemed just a little out of place.The other bad part about it is that it's the last of the series. :( I really really wish Mike Murray would write more books featuring Getts and/or Peach. Granted, the guys are getting a little older now, but go back in time to some of their earlier missions, I don't care!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It work both ways...","review":"First let me say, I admire Mr. Murray's books.I have only one nitpick. With food poioning, the body tries expelling the contents of the stomach and intestines from both ends. Therefore, Peach would have been cleaning more than the Princess' hands and face.Otherwise, I was kept guessing as to who the \\"insider\\" was and how he/she would be dealt with.I'm not ready to have Peach enter retirement.

While I am not fluent in Spanish, it doesn't make any difference, the music is so captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Let me start off by saying that I love Alejandro Sanz' music. His last album, No Es Lo Mismo, is still heavily played on my ipod. When I first heard the first track off of this new album, \\"A La Primera Persona\\", I was amazed at the passion behind the lyrics and the beautiful score that accompanied them.So on its first day of release, I went off to buy his brand new album, El Tren de Los Momentos. How dissapointing!The few highlights off this album \\"A la Primera Persona\\", \\"En la Planta de Tus Pies\\", and \\"Te Quiero y Te Temo\\" do not warrant the purchase of this album. I should have just downloaded \\"A la Primera Persona\\" which was the reason for my buying this album. The rest of the album is full of uninspired songs (including his collaboration with Shakira \\"Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No\\")and awkward, fast paced rapping (\\"Se Molestan\\", \\"El Tren de los Momentos\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"El Maestro Sanz\\"","review":"Alejandro Sanz is still the greatest composer in Spanish music today. This artist's music has definitely evolved throughout the years and in this latest compilation, Alejandro has expanded his music genres and attempted to mix several rhythms creating various styles of music. The simple ballads he once composed are no longer found; however, there are still some that remind you of his stylized thought provoking ballads. There are several songs Sanz decided to experiment with, which some people who loved his music may not enjoy; however if you are a true Alejandro sanz fan you can appreciate his genius in developing his music and lyrics. There are some very powerful songs and the lyrics are genius; however others are a little too experimental for my tastes. I recommend this compilation, probably not one of my favorite CD's from him but if you are still wondering about getting this CD, maybe just download a couple of his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great come back","review":"Nice music. Sanz returned to his roots and included excellent duets with Residente (Calle 13), Shakira and Juanes. Highly recommended CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bueno, No Excelente","review":"Estoy de acuerdo con los comentarios anteriores, realmente el disco, en mi humilde opinion, no es el mejor de Sanz. Estamos bastante acostumbrados ya a un estilo de musica, liricas, y ritmos y al escuchar este CD de Sanz nos descepciona un poco. SIn embargo, como bien lo dijo alguien antes, al que le gusta mas el hip hop y lo mas moderno pues creo que le encantara este CD. Al resto de nosotros, que esperabamos algo un poco mas de aquellas hermosas baladas de \\"Mas\\", \\"El Alma Al Aire\\", \\"Viviendo de Prisa\\" o aun las mas modernitas de \\"No Es Lo Mismo\\", para ese pues encontrara que no sera lo que espera. De todos modos, me gusta en general pues entiendo que el artista evoluciona. Pero espero que Sanz no evolucione tanto como para desviarse demasiado de sus raices - LO ROMANTICO.

I tried it anyways thinking that okay the plastic will be inside and metal on the outside and bam...my nose had a reaction.

The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because Body Candy takes at least two days from the date you make your order to ship stuff (even if you order directly from their site - so it's not an Amazon issue) - but otherwise, great piece of jewelry. I also like the fact that you don't have to mess around with removing the screw to get a new look; you can just pop out the jewel and replace it with a new one of a different color/shape.

The opening chapter even acknowledges this.Also, this book has some outdated information in it. In 1997 when the author was writing his first version, renting a pager from a hospital was probably worth mentioning. With 2012 around the corner and with the ubiquitousness of modern cell phones, this chapter should have been deleted from the 2008 printed version.Even though this book takes no time to read, it is not worth the effort.

We were instructed to send the camera to them for evaluation. We received a phone call from them indicating the camera could not be repaired as they didn't have the parts. They couldn't even offer a replacement of the same camera. What they did offer was the 150U model for $88 with only a 6 month warranty. Based on the reviews here, it sounds like the 150 is not altogether great either.

It's about an Irish artist and mother who needs to fulfill herself by abandoning her husband and child to experience hardships and harrassments with an anarchist-lover in the aftermath of Franco's Spanish Civil War victory. With the support of another (self?)-exiled Irish artist, she has success as an artist, despite the nonchalant loss of an infant daughter. She ends up returning to Ireland to visit the son abandoned decades ago and basically remains a totally self-centered individual.

This is the beginning of the light jazz movement, the beginning of GRP records in the early '80's, where people like Grusin tried to make jazz palatable to the general public. It is palatable, but it isn't jazz. If you wanted to categorize this in the context of easy listening, then it's listenable. It's totally frustrating, because you are waiting for the players to play something, and they keep playing the theme over and over. I could never understand how this music didn't put them to sleep and bore them to tears. Also, the tunes are totally forgetable. If you want to hear jazz stay away from this.

Once more it didn't break from a hard drop, or massive hit. It simply broke after I set it down on a table. Even though I've had the camera for two years, I'd say I've only gone through less than two dozen rolls of film. So it can't have broken from excessive use either.Luckily I bought an extended warranty and will not be out $300, but now I think I may make the move to digital.

There are no flaws in the glass, as I noted with certain other 'name-brand' items I viewed in the shops. As I only decant wine every so often, it will spend a lot of its time being ornamental, and serves this purpose equally as well as its designed function of aerating my favourite wine. My husband also commented that the decanter far surpasses any he viewed when looking for one to give me.

The fashions are fabulous, thanks to Givenchy and a Paris backdrop. Fred Astaire's dance numbers are not as crisp as his earlier films, but are classic Astaire none-the-less and thoroughly enjoyable. Audrey Hepburn, playing a beatnik-type intellectual turned fashion model, sings in this film. Her voice is not always strong, but the wonderful songs help her carry this off. Astaire's role, based on photographer Richard Avedon, provides a whimsical glimpse into the world of production of a glossy fashion magazine at the time.

I just got a second copy of the film in recent \\"Audrey\\" edition and it's the same poor master.

Sleek, bold and brash, she is bursting commanding singing and dancing, and with truly enviable comic timing. She is a master class for every character actor. I wish she made more films. Astaire is too old for Hepburn in this, but he is still a great presence at the top of his form. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE and impressionistic at times. The score is superb, and the orchestrations are some of the best I have ever heard. This is an underrated film, and I am so happy to have it in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty before Age","review":"Funny Face is not a great film, but it is such a slice of the 1950s that one forgives it. What makes it work of course is Audrey Hepburn -- the amusing thing is that when she is dowdy she is contemporary, and when she is made up she is 1950s. Everyone else looks hopeless and old. That is the reason why Fred Astaire's age does matter in the film: he is a constant reminder that Audrey is the epitome of the oncoming cult of adolescence/childism which is just about to doom the whole \\"older is better\\" enterprise. But he is amazing: the best dance scene is the one in the bookshop, so subtle.The wisest person in the film is the director, Stanley Donen, who takes every opportunity to photograph Hepburn in closeup, as if he will never get another chance (though he will). She never really looked more beautiful than in the early scenes before the adults get to her.....I do wonder how they trained the swans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Face is a classic.","review":"Audrey Hepburn has always amazed me with the movies she had made, and this one is one of the movies I really enjoyed along with all others.

Good shots of Paris, and the widescreen technicolor look in general. Givenchy fashion show, figuratively and literally in this movie. Fun to see Audrey Hepburn really dance, (and I don't mean the scenes with Fred Astaire), best part of her dancing was from a scene where she dances on her own, and shows her former training and abilities. Usual implausible romance where Audrey falls for a man more than old enough to be her father, in this case Fred Astaire. Astaire's dancing here not amoung his greatest work in my opinion, although there was one scene towards the end with Kay Thompson where some of the old magic happens.

There are so few Astaire musicals in this format--(when are the Ginger/Fred movies going to be considered for DVD?!)This movie is a delight from start to finish, from the outrageous Think Pink number to the last wistful dance (on a raft floating down a silvery lake, no less). Hepburn was such a natural performer and even if she was not the most technically accomplished dancer, she was still shown off to great advantage by the legendary Astaire- watch his ease and attentiveness in parntering Hepburn during the Funny Face dance in the darkroom to see what I mean. That scene and the hysterical Clap Yo' Hands number with Thompson are worth the price of this DVD.Do yourself a favor: Turn off the news and escape to this world of elegance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Face is a hit","review":"I love this movie.

As it is, the first half of the movie is remarkably dull and stodgy and fails to entertain. Things start to pick up thereafter, from about the point of Astaire and Hepburn's photoshoot around Paris (with some nice location filming), but still the results are somewhat mediocre by comparison with the stars' other movies. By 1957 movie musicals were moving beyond the kind of lyrics that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but the writers of 'Funny Face' seem to have missed out on the trend, and most of the songs belong to an earlier era of movie-making. The star presence and a few memorable moments save the day, but otherwise the whole thing is rather a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maaaarvellous Mouth!","review":"\\"Please! I can't hear myself think and I'm trying to think in French!\\" One of the funniest lines in this great, stylish, movie. To this day my sister and I quote from it.'Hitsibutchi, hmmm?'The only problem I have with this film is Fred Astaire; the man is hundreds of years old and he's making the moves on the angelic Audrey Hepburn (yeck!). Kay Thompson is a hoot and unrelentless in her pursuit to find 'the quality woman'.The songs are alright, I guess, but they aren't the reason to watch this film. It's the funny dialogue, charming setting, and Audrey Hepburn flowing down some stairs in a fab red dress exclaiming, 'Take the picture! Take the picture!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unmemorable musical","review":"I should have known this musical was going to be bad when I had to fast forward through the first two songs. I ended up fast forwarding through all of them accept \\"S'wonderful\\" and \\" Clap yo hands.\\" And really, how believable is a romance between 28 year old Hepburn and 58 year old Astaire? I couldn't get past the obvious fact that he was old enough to be her father and looked like he could have been her grandfather! Audrey was as gorgeous and endearing as ever and her gowns were fabulous. Astaire's dance numbers were totally flat and the whole beatnik scene was like totally square man. Don't waste your time on this stinker, but if you decide to, fast forward through the songs.

Somehow all three of these attempts fail utterly. Audrey Hepburn alone shines here, but her light is fogged by steam from trains, cigarette smoke, and other actors who get in her way. I particularly refer to Kay Thompson's character, who was downright annoying, and the guru with the beard that Audrey's character loved so much until she realised he was human. All throughout I kept thinking, When are the songs going to stop and the real dialogue begin? It didn't. And, When is this going to end? It finally did. I don't think I'll ever bother to watch it again, or to spend any more time reviewing it here.

Where older CD's like \\"New Forms\\" showed a certain creative genious in the choices of beats, vocals, and Jazz tracks; \\"In the Mode\\" comes off as soulless and manufactured. Many of the songs, like \\"Who Told You?\\", were almost overrun with vocals that became really annoying after only a few seconds. They also seemed to lack the same thought shown in earlier works. It was almost as if he were asked to sit down with a drum machine and make things up off the top of his head.

Lyrics, whether sung or spoken, are more boisterous, and may sound fun and enjoyable at times. One thing I really have to marvel is the way lyrics are wrapped in Roni Size's D&B context. Be they sung or spoken, there are always sudden stop-gap-'gasp!' sequences between words, all in sync with the beatz! 'Who told you' is a terrific example that challenges the basic 'flow' characteristic of rap. This album nevertheless embodies the Reprazent identity. More for Reprazent fans, but I also recommend this to D&B beginners, that is, if they can sustain their listening attention to the typically frantic beatz at album length (otherwise they may start to yawn)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step to the rythm","review":"This is a good alblum, but it could have been better.

I think the Swarm kit may be good for adding a scoop to revitalize an existing sea monkey tank, but on its own it just seems unstable (and the weak instructions definitely make this a bad choice for children).

This book by co-authors Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally fills in the gaps on Vlad the Impaler's upbringing, his history, his family, and his place in the world of Eastern Europe and the Carpathian mountains. The narrative is clear and well written, and it is not too academic in tone. It can be used strictly as a background source on Eastern European 15th century history, but I found it very entertaining to read simply on its own.

Very important for me was also that it is very good for self-education."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book on physics","review":"I don't understand why my instructor chooses this book for 3 quarters continously. This book gives you nothing. I have a feeling like the author doesn't know anything, so he uses lots of words to describe some thing that are soo obvious. With other difficult concepts, he doesn't say anything, or just a few words. Some one compared this book with Lev Landau's one. Please give me a break. Lev Landau is a great physicist, while this guy is nothing at all. I still wonder why this kind of textbook is still around. I feel frustrated with this book. My conclusion is: if you really understand physics, this book is not for you. This book is only for kids. I hope that some one could pass my message to the authors, and hope that they could write better books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good physics book","review":"If you're a beginner or not interested in physics stay away from this book.

I was a math major, and had never heard my subject decribed so well.The 12yrold son of friend of mine watched the six hours of videotape from which this book was transcribed in a single sitting, utterly refusing to stop.This is Feynman at his absolute best, sharing his unique insights into the most fascinating subjects of all.I wish Amazon would offer every reviewer the opportunity to give one book six stars, meaning 'better than the best'. For me, this book would get the six."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any scientist","review":"The character of physical law is the character of any law. This lecture is a must for any scientist and anyone who wishes to become one. Professor Feynman tells you exactly how the process of developing and testing theories works. As he pointed out ' you can never be sure to be right, you can only be sure to be wrong', I'd say you cannot be wrong by listening to this tape. The book is superbly read by Jeff Riggenbach."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool and fun","review":"When I heard matt pond pa on sirius, I ran to 3 music stores to find it. Finally, I did!

They opened for Liz and totally got my attention - they rocked and they were very likeable! As is usually the case with a quality band, I liked them live more than the album, but thought enough of them to remember their name and order the album three months later! They remind me of very, very early REM (who also used to frequent the Vic in those days) and other similar indie bands (okay, I'm dating myself, so what?). I think they have a great future if they continue to put out a unique sound and the great quality work that I saw in person and I enjoy on this album. Several Arrows Later is easy to listen to and is well worthy to add to your in-dash CD player or I-Pod. If you can, catch them live - these songs rock in person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, horribly quality vinyl","review":"This is one of my favorite albums, but the quality of the vinyl is god awful.

We returned the set and exchanged it for a new set.We inspected each disc before playing and they looked okay, except for a few minor scratches on disc 4 from being loose in the case. After playing the discs, however, we saw new scratches in certain areas only and consistently, that indicated the discs were warped and were dragging in the player in the same spots each time around. This has not happened with any of our other DVDs. After one viewing that was the end of them, as the discs were too scratched to play again.We loved Bonanza the episodes we got to see (the Wagon Train bonus episodes were not really watchable, since the quality was so poor).

Yes, these are single-sided, so you can image the compression that was required.And yet, for the price I would glady endure all that, if the silly discs would actually play. I've tried three separate copies, Discs 1 and 3 won't play properly in any of them. (The ones stored above another disc in the overlapping clamshell box. Coincidence? Maybe, since no scratches are visible.)

I LIKED the music they put on the DVD, and don't miss the theme song at all. The cost of using the theme song probably are more than the shows cost themselves, so I'll take a low-priced collection of shows alone anyday.

The story is about Neil Page(Martin)that desperately tries to get back to his family for Thanksgiving, but somehow keep bumping in to showercurtainring-salesman Del Griffith(Candy), and even though Page tries to keep his loathing up he slowly begins to like the cheery Del.

It's in the top 5 comedies in my opinion. The scene where Martin stumbles back into the airport rental car area to confront the receptionist is one of the classic (and in many instances) the most realistic and identifiable scenes that viewers can relate to when traveling. This scene is definitely not for children. We can certainly understand the frustrations of Martin when it comes to dealing with airports and rental car companies. Also, the pick-up truck scene is another classic scene. Yet, with all the laughter, the ending grabbed my throat and just makes us appreciate the basic things we want and need during the holidays and throughout the year.A truly enjoyable film that you can never tire of watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Movie I've Seen in a Long Time","review":"I saw this movie last night on Cinemax and I laughed continually.

I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite comedies!","review":"Steve Martin playes a businessman trying to get home for Thanksgiving, John Candy is along for the ride.

Still a holiday classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute holiday fare and plenty of laughs","review":"Okay, it doesn't matter when you watch this; it's still funny. You might like it better, though, around Thanksgiving. Steve Martin and John Candy play unlikely fellow travelers when a series of mishaps force them together via various modes of transportation, hence the title.I could have lived without the cheesy synth music at a few points during the film, but other than that, it is humorous and filled with one disaster after another.Be forewarned that there are several uses of the F bomb between Martin and Edie McClurg. Otherwise, okay for those old enough to handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are your hands?","review":"This is a classic comedy movie. This is by far my favorite comedy of all time. John Candy as Del Griffith and Steve Martin as Neil Page make a great pair.I find that the movie is always funny, no matter how many times you watch it. It's a great movie to watch with friends. It does have some swearing in it so not great for the young kids.Great quote: Where are your hands?

Two leads work so well together.So may funny scenes but the killer is Steve Martin and the car rental clerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best comedy ever","review":"Not much to say here.

It has got so much better with age. I loved John Candy - this and Stripes and his SCTV skits are my favorites.This movie is a bit more than just funny and good. It is Frank Capra like great - a celebration of the common American man who is in the end, a noble soul. John Candy plays the American everyman who takes a lot of abuse but has a heart of gold that eventually wins over the most cynical folks.God bless John Hughes, John Candy and Dell Griffiths throughout all those Red States."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thanksgiving tradition with my family","review":"This is a must watch around Thanksgiving time for almost everyone I know. There are so many laughs along the way, but also a whole lot of heart. Steve Martin is good as the serious straight man, but John Candy is what elevates this film to classic level. Nobody can get on your nerves and yet be likeable like he can. The first time I saw it the emotional aspect of the ending caught me off guard. It's rare when a comedy can be very funny and manage to make you wipe away tears. Okay, I didn't cry, but I'm man enough to admit I was darn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corny all the way, but heart-warming","review":"I watched this 1987 flick for the first time today. Maybe it's because it was made 25 years ago and I personally have little memories of the 80s (or the decade before that), everything in the film seems corny, including the part where Del reveals what's up with his wife Marie! But the two actors do a fantatic job acting their respective parts, and the film turns out bigger than the sum of its parts! I liked the movie, to my own surprise. And it helps that it brings back memories of both NY and Chicago back in the 80s. How I miss those days, no cell phones, no in-flight entertainment, just people, even if rude people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much profanity!","review":"Good story line but way too much profanity.

In fact, it is our family tradition to watch \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\\" every Thanksgiving evening. During the first decade of this tradition, the viewing was \\"G-rated\\" and accompanied by popcorn. During the second decade (now that the children are adults), the viewing has evolved into a brandy and cigar event. Of course, by the second showing of \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\\" Steve Martin and John Candy are even more hysterical. Our favorite scene is the one with an irate Steve Martin and the smiling, matronly worker at the car rental booth at the airport. My family believes that this is the funniest movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good movie filled with laughter and heart break.","review":"This movie was great I love the character that Steve Martin played in the film, he was very good John Candy also was a very good character he was funny and annoying just like the part called for. I also loved the part were Del says \\"I'v never seen a guy get lifted up by his testicles before\\" and then Niel started to talk in that high voice I almaost pissed in my pance it was hilarious.

It's so incredibly funny, yet touches everyone in a certain way. The title is pretty self-explanatory. A man (Steve Martin) desperetly tries to get home in time for Thanksgiving with the \\"help\\" of bumbling yet funny Del (John Candy in his best role). One of my favorite lines is when Martin tries to get a room, and says \\"Have mercy!

It was worth the wait. This is a very funny, yet heart warming movie. I wish this was in 2:40:1 aspect ratio {I prefer this} but I suppose this is one of those movies that 1:85:1 is o.k. The Blu-Ray quality is really nice throughout this film. One of the better quality Blu-Rays I've seen. I can't comment on the audio too much as I listen with external speakers hooked up to my stereo.

If you like John Candy & or Steve Martin you will probably like this in Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious tale of [forced] friendship - excellent movie","review":"I have seen this over 100 times - I pop it in whenever I need a good laugh. Steve Martin and the late John Candy were perfect for their respective roles as an over-conservative-and-too-clean businessman and a trying-too-hard-to-make-friends anecdotal inconsiderate wanderer; both just trying to get from New York to Chicago in time for Thanksgiving. And the way these two end up struggling to get where they're going, and how they grow to become friends, makes for a hilarious heart-warming movie that I love to watch over and over. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time Favorite....","review":"Having worked in the travel industry for the last 20 years; this movie rocks. It really gives an up close and personal look at one can happen if there is just one mishap. The matchup of Candy and Martin is first rate; they meshed so well together. Too bad John Candy died before he could ever work with Steve Martin Again. The writing and story line are written perfectly and the gags come across on screen first rate. This is my 2nd favorite John Hughes movie behind 16 candles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a ploy by the DVD company to get $30 with nothing extra to offer.","review":"Where is the supposed 3 hours of material that is on the cutting room floor that John Hughes said \\"deteriorated?\\" Maybe someone could actually check and use the footage. I hate to trample on John Hughes grave, but it was widely noted in many interviews that Hughes knew there was a lot of footage from this movie, and why he didn't even try to go after it is a mystery to me. This movie had one of the biggest followings for any comedy in the late 80's, and while other Hughes movies from this era are still shown to give a few chuckles, this movie is still regarded as being hilarious, even some 25 years later! Could they not have interviewed Steve Martin, or maybe even included some old interviews from Candy or Martin from around the time this came out? Now the price is over $40 as of today (3/15/12), and it seems like the Blu Ray release of this movie was a total joke, especially with nothing new to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles","review":"I love this movie.

Steve Martin and the late John Candy team up for nonstop, knee-slapping misadventures as two businessmen chaotically thrown together with one objective: make it to Chicago by Thanksgiving. Their oddyssey is punctuated by one mishap after another--most unfortunate for the characters, but utter comidic delight for the audience. (The scene on the highway, when Martin and Candy's rental car is sandwiched between two barreling 18-wheelers, is hysterical.)Yet director John Hughes does more than give us a side-splitting comedy; we also get a glimpse of the fragility and goodness of both characters, which makes the viewer like them all the more. The film's tender, lump-in-the-throat ending is poignant and compelling, leaving the viewer totally satisfied and entertained.PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES is mandatory viewing at our house each Thanksgiving, an annual tradition I eagerly anticipate."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 for the movie, 1 for falsely advertising a deleted scene","review":"LOVE this movie!

Throughout the whole thing you remain painfully aware that it's a movie, and everything looks contrived. They try too hard to be funny and it doesn't work. What it feels like is they take these two guys and put them in a variety of predicaments that are supposed to be funny and cause you to emit uproarous sounds of hilarity. Sadly, it falls far short of the goal. (About three miles in fact.) I don't think I laughed even once. The afore mentioned predicaments are not necessarily related to each other, and the order in which they are portrayed seems of no particular significance. My advice?

In fact, this is sort of a TV film, with very poor direction, extremely slow and outdated (just check the horrible music: is very early nineties).

And Candy is there the whole way to add to his \\"misery\\"! This is one of those \\"classic comedies\\" that you can watch over and over and over again - and NEVER grow tired of! Plus the characters are really likable, underneath it all, which separates this comedy from other, 2 dimensional \\"slapsticks\\"!

But they are excellent! Azam Ali's vocals are sweet, melodious, and pure, and easily transcend 90% of the \\"ethereal\\" music out there today. Greg Ellis' percussion is commendable, although his variance is more in his instruments than in his tempo. There is not enough variance to christen this a masterpiece - upon the first few listens, you'll have difficulty distinguishing between songs, which keeps each from having a unique identity. And Azam Ali does not have the range of emotion or inflection you may be hoping for. All in all, this is a fine, beautiful release by a strong up-and-coming ensemble, who will undoubtedly impress us for years to come. Due to the repetitive nature of the music, it doesn't quite live up to all the hype - but it does come close! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as \\"Sunyata\\"?

However, after giving it a few listens I warmed up to it. \\"The Promise\\" is perhaps Vas' best song on either CD, I wish they'd do it in concert. Azam's voice and Ellis' percussion are as strong as on the first album. I'd say that if you liked \\"Sunyata\\", you'll probably like \\"Offerings\\" too. They're supposed to be adding a lot more strings on the next album, I'll be interested to see how that works out.I guess my ratings would be Sunyata: Radiant, Offerings: Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"spelndid combination of Middle Eastern and medieval European music","review":"This review is valid for all albums of VAS as well as the solo albums of Azam Ali. First her voice is really remarkable. It is calm and soft i.e. soothing, to express it with one word simply memorable.

Through their prayers they receive the miracles they are seeking however, these same miracles bring new challenges that continue to test their faith in God and ultimately in each other.

The only thing of interest here is the insight into this particular brand of orthodox Judaism, and a scary sight it is. Unless you have bought into this, it's a story about two simple-minded ninnies who think God is monitoring their every thought. God must be embarrassed to find himself so trivialized and so fanatically yoked to the self-serving delusions of his creations. This film is a sad (but inadvertant) commentary on the gullibility of people and their need to justify themselves to a higher power. It's also an eye-opening window on the lengths people will go to ritualize every aspect of their lives--as if the supreme intelligence of the universe cares whether you grow a beard or not, wear a certain kind of cap, or eat a certain kind of food. In all of this, the film is profoundly depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for those who like films about aspects of Jewish life","review":"This story focuses on an Orthodox couple who are so poor that they can't even afford a succah for the Succoth festival. Luckily, a donation helps them through that immediate crisis. Unfortunately, an even larger problem looms on the horizon. According to tradition, they aren't supposed to turn away guests who have no other place to turn. But what if the \\"guests\\" are willing to abuse the hospitality offered them? What if they are annoying and possibly even dangerous?I was entranced by this situation, watching a couple's faith being testing, as well as getting a glimpse into the Orthodox Jewish world. This is a film that anyone (of whatever religious belief or tradition) can watch. It is heartwarming, uplifting and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not What You Think","review":"Ushpizin is already famous as the first general release ultra-orthodox Jewish movie. During the intermediate days of Passover I finally had a chance to see it with my family.Most would tell you it's about a chassidic Jewish couple living in a religious Jerusalem neighborhood who are visited by some unsavory characters from the husband's past, during the religious holiday of Succot. And it is that.But for those who are looking, what this movie really is, is a chassidic lesson from Breslov chassidus, from the teachings of the grand rabbi, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov. The lesson is hidden in the opening music, the lesson presented during the yeshiva scene, the climactic event, the result and the closing music.It's a beautiful and touching movie, in Hebrew with English subtitles, displaying a rich religious life, and some challenges and conflicts of the life, as well as some of the conflict between 'religious' Israel and 'secular' Israel.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ushpizin","review":"I recommend this movie to anyone looking to understand better some of the practices, and traditions of our brothers in the jewish faith. I thought the movie to be tender, very insperational, informative.

I also plan on making a point of watching it on a yearly basis during lent. As a person of a different faith i saw alot of beautiful things i can incorporate in my own practices of my faith. I truly recommend this movie especially if you are wishing for a miracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this from Amazon","review":"This is an excellent film which I highly recommend, but don't buy it from Amazon.

Tragically, his defense of O.J. Simpson was as unethical and morally reprehensible as could be and thus his legacy is a mixed one at best. Christopher Darden said (in his book \\"In Contempt\\") that he had long considered Cochran both a mentor and role model but that his actions during the \\"Trial of The Century\\" undermined and shattered his (Darden's) respect and admiration for him (Cochran). Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT HISTORICAL SYNOPSIS OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPT","review":"I couldn't put it down! It is very well written and the 'story' flows well which results in easy reading. It gives a blazing historical persepctiveof the LAPD as well as a heart-warming autobiography of Johnnie L. Cochran the 'family man'. It also reveals some 'behind the scenes' events of theO. J. Simpson 'Trial of the Century' unknown by most. While it is not a blow by blow characterization of the so called 'dream team', it opens your eyesto some glaring facts and forces you to take off the blinders and get a well focused panoramic view.

He has gone pretty far out there, and is really now pushing the limits of his own style. Some of the songs are almost unrecognizable from previous recordings, which does show just how much he's playing around within the formats he has set up.The recording quality is quite remarkable; everything sounds as though its right in your face, even if the song played is more subtle in nature. One really cannot compare this set with anything else he's done, since it shows us that Bruce has made some remarkable shifts in his creative process - this is completely set apart from the rest of the pack.You really cannot listen to this CD without just being with it, with nothing else going on.

I like to get my information from a variety of sources however, so I think this book is a worthy addition to any small library on bipolar disorder, even though it doesn't provide the level of detail or expertise that the other two books bring to the table.

Elliot does not see that the illness is a biological one resulting in mood disturbances. If Elliot could rid himself of bipolar symptoms through therapy, he DID NOT HAVE BIPOLAR DISORDER, but had symptoms from other origins.This bipolar book has the answers and they are backed up by countless people who have a bipolar disorder.

I didn't connect to the characters in this book as much as I do in other books, but all the characters were unique and very interesting. The book was highly unpredictable and not scary at all.

I watched once--probably won't watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"The video itself is good...I like the instructor...however, if you are looking for a routine, this aint it. She spends about 10-15 minutes stretching and warming up which is actually a good thing for me because I take about that long to get warm. However, as opposed to teaching a few short routines and repeating them, she spends over 30 minutes teaching one very long routine which you perform for about 10 minutes at the end. Again, decent routine and she is really entertaining, but if you are looking for a good workout...this isn't really it.Great examples of some samba moves though if you're just looking for some tips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I bought this DVD based on the video review I saw on it.. I love it! It is tough, but the work is really worth it. Every muscle in my body is feeling it right now..I like how she cues the moves and the workout builds as you go along. I don't believe that this is for a true beginner in dance. I have been dancing off and on for 25 years now and have studied Brazilian samba before and I was challanged doing this DVD!

I love the instructor for her energy and spirit, loved the live music, loved the dancing but was majorly disappointed by two things: 1. There are basically only 2 combinations on the entire DVD and they are the same combinations just at different speeds (very slow, very fast). The combination is a good one and the fast version IS a good workout but there's no variety beyond that. 2. There is no cool down. If you do the fast version, you need a cool down involving stretching.

She leads you through the entire routine no instructions, just move it!

I bought this dvd because i was sick of all of my other workout dvds and wanted something similar to zumba. first of all the sound quality was really bad. You could barely understand or hear the instructor. the whole workout is like learning a dance. you slowly add in each section and periodically run thru the dance, until you've learned the whole thing.

The only downside with the Sprite Slimline system is that it's sort of hard to install--it's somewhat hard to get secure enough a grip on the housing when you're screwing the two halves back together to get a good seal.The only problem I would note with this specific item (possibly why Amazon currently has it marked as 'unavailable because we're fixing a problem') is that it appears not to be a two-pack; it's just a single-pack.

I figured you can't beat the price so I bought it and I'm really sorry I wasted my money. The first thing that hit me when I opened the box was the sickeningly strong fragrance. The scent is called Spring Burst but it smells more like overly perfumed detergent. If you have any sensitivity to fragrance, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! Not only was the smell unbearable but the detergent does not get out stains. Not even new stains. Apparently this product has a large fan base in the UK and Australia but don't ask me why.

It is this type of elementary subject material discussed in the book. As for breeding, the author recommends live cover as AI for mini's is almost non-existent.

Though I love the color (Toffee), the fabric, the comfort of the cups (which are molded), and the flattering cut of the cups, the straps on this have a terrible design. The adjustable feature stops right at the top of the shoulders, and there the fabric is sewn together so that underneath the straps, directly against your skin, are scratchy bumps where the fabric is stitched together. These leave my skin red and irritated. I'm not sure why the straps on this bra are designed this way because it is very uncomfortable. Very disappointing because the reviews on many sites made this bra sound like an excellent choice for everyday comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"bandwagon material","review":"Having followed miss Rebecca since her first album, I was disappointed in this one. She was just getting established into the light rock alternative scene, but Transform jumped head-first onto the current pop-dance bandwagon. At times I thought I was listening to the typical uncreative Britney album. The production of the album and it's attention to detail was good, which has only been getting better each album. Unfortunately Transform seemed too limited vocally and musically. Many of the songs tended to blend together and sound alike. Lyrically the album was solid, but the music did little to accent the song's mood. I was disappointed to see Rebecca jumping on the secular bandwagon of current trends. Perhaps that is why this album was called Transform?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what can I say?","review":"I was expecting a lot from this CD: I'd heard a lot of RSJ's music and really liked it so when I went ahead and bought this I just couldn't wait for it to land in my mailbox. Unfortunetely I can't say I was pleased. The lyrics are great, don't get me wrong but the melodies were just...strange. On the 2nd track we get some funky techno music, and on the last track a very calm tune, on the 7th track a more ''popish'' one. I guess there just isn't any harmony in it all. Too bad because there are some really good messages in there but they're clouded by attempted post modern music.the 2 stars are for the very pleasant songs ''wait for me'' and ''my hope''"},{"rating":"2","title":"More High Quality Christian Pop Music From RSJ","review":"This album is good as Rebecca's last two albums (which were Grreat!).She still has lots of catchy melodies, terrifically faithful lyrics, and an ear for staying contemporary. There is still the usual amount of random electric noises and cool sound effects, but this time they are balanced out with a real live symphony orchestra in the mix. The biggest difference on this album is the emphasis on electronic disco dance beats. But fear not, if you liked Rebecca's last two albums, then you will eventually love this one as much.This album upholds Rebecca's reputation as a musical artist who is (most) successfully pushing at the boundaries of Christian music, while never watering down the Christian message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her target demographic?","review":"At 38, neither am I, but this is the real deal: rhythms that start deep inside you, melodies that pull you out of yourself, Scripture-inspired lyrics...all set in beautifully textured arrangements.

What a great resource for worship music!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD, Best yet from Becca.","review":"CD is by far the best that Rebecca St. James has put forth so far. Music is incredible, very creative, she has moved a bit from her traditional sound from the prior 2 albums and has moved more toward a faster rythym sound that will make you want to move your feet. But the beyond that, the real treat is her incredible lyrics. The lyrics defentily show her devotion and love for her savior, Jesus Christ. The songs are powerful. A quote from Universe, > > Like the river that runs to the sea > > The oceans speak of Your love for me > > It's wider than I can imagine > > Higher than the sky is Your love for me > > Like the river that runs to the sea > > The sky it speaks of Your love for me > > It's wider than I can imagine > > And don't have to ever be afraid > > Nothing in the universe could take this love away.This is a must buy CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest . . .","review":"This CD was OK . . .

My only favorites were . . .- Reborn- Wait for Me- StandThose were the only good ones . . . if you like songs that are not boring and have wonderful tunes. The rest of the songs weren't that great. I LOVE Rebecca St. James' music, but I didn't find most of these tracks enjoyable. But you could have a different \\"music outlook\\" than I, and may instead actually enjoy this CD. Though in my opinion, I think there are better RSJ CDs. I would suggest \\"Wait For Me\\" (the best of) CD - it's absolutely her very best (I'm sure you would agree if you bought it)! So if you just want to collect every RSJ CD there is - just ignore my complaining and get this one. But if you would like to get just one of her CDs . . . this shouldn't be the one! Check out WAIT FOR ME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good, but PRAY Rebecca returns to her old sound!","review":"This CD is really powerful in its message, as one would expect from a committed Christian like Rebecca, but the sound is a little over-produced. If we did not hear the lyrics, one might think that the insturmentals were from the latest Brittney Spears album! Rebecca's voice is driving and passionate, as it was with that masterpiece, PRAY, but she sounds too \\"handled\\" by the people helping her put out her music. One gets this sense right away with even the cover photo of her in snakeskin pants!Don't get me wrong -- snakeskin pants aren't sinful, but are they really Rebecca St. James? Or did some record executive or manager decide that in the interest of crossover marketing, they were going to gild this Christian lily?I enjoyed this album, but I hope that there is better stuff to come from this young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs","review":"I truly appreciate the thought that goes into the lyrics.

It was a great experience and it was then that i got her cd, Transform. It's my favorite of all of her cd's thus far. It has more of a techno blend to it than her previous albums. My favorite songs were Wait for Me (a love song written to her future husband), Reborn (which has a very catchy beat and message) and For the Love of God (which is mostly taken from 1 Corinthians 13, the Love Chapter.) She has a magnigicent voice, truly a gift from God. I would reccomend this mainly for teenagers and young adults.

They were definitely smaller than the chairs I had before, but the style was what I wanted and the price was good. The main problem that all four chairs are having is with the legs as they attach to the base of the seat. The whole construction of the chair down there is less than ideal and now after 6 months they are really quite unusable.

Why didn't the \\"cameraman\\",for want of a better word,have the commonsense to pull the shot back? The average amateur could do a better job with his homemade videos. What is it with Paramount that they aren't doing a professional job on the extras? The same thing happened with the interviews on ST2 and now we have pitifully amateurish camera work on this DVD. This is not good enough.The DVD also does have some good photos but no deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than \\"Wrath of Khan\\"","review":"This third Star Trek film had the difficult task of following a modern day classic. \\"The Search for Spock\\" not only matches \\"Khan\\" in quality but surpasses it as well. Picking up where the last picture left off, the Enterprise and it's crew are battered and Spock is gone. What follows is a thrilling adventure as Kirk and his crew discover Spock's true condition and what must be done to help him. They risk their professional careers and lives to rescue their vulcan friend as they face off with a nasty band of Klingons.These characters haven't been portrayed with such nobility since the \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\" episode in 1967. While the first two Trek films were entertaining entrys, this film has more faith in what Star Trek is about; the noble human spirit, friendship and confronting the unknown with a healty dose of action and humor for good measure.

My only complaint about this movie are that Kirsty Alley was replaced by Robin Curtis. They should have paid Kirsty Alley the money she wanted because Robin Curtis was not very good at all. I'm sorry she was very bad and it is painful to look at her act when she is on the screen. Now on the other hand Christoper Lloyd is the best Klingon I have ever seen and plays the role very very well. This film is in no way near the best of the Star Trek films but it is a decent one and worth watching and having in your collection. There are some very memorible moments in this film like Uhura dealing with the young ensign in the transporter room, and Kirk's fight with the Klingon. Add this one to your collection it is enjoyable to watch from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Star Trek Movie!","review":"People are always complaining that Star Trek V The Final Frontier is the worst of the Star Trek movies and I know I'll probably be blasted for saying it but I think the worst is actually Star Trek III The Search For Spock. This movie has it's moments but it's mostly boring and was just not as good without Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and I think the character of Saavik was just not the same without Kirstie Alley playing her, Kirstie made the character so interesting in The Wrath of Khan but even though Robin Curtis is not a bad actress she was just kind of bland in the role of Saavik, just didn't have the oomph that Kirstie Alley had!

But I have one question to ask. Where's the director's edition? Afterall, this is a great movie, and the clean up and 5.1 sound is awsome. But why is this only a special edition? The extra features are great, but where are the deleated scenes? Espically the one where Kirk confronts Bones in the elevator. It's little scene's like this that made ST II:TWOK(directors edition) awsome.This is a must buy for any Trek fan, but I hope Paramount give the rest of the movies a director's edition(espically ST:Generations, put back the lost opening). But all in all this is still a great movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spock In the Director's Chair","review":"Leonard Nimoy at the helm creates great and memorable interaction between the original cast, but the action scenes are a bit weak.I just watched this film for the first time and found it to be a very enjoyable adventure and continuation from the outstanding Wrath of Khan with even greater bits of comedy and comraderie amongst the cast.Unfortunately the fight scenes are very rushed and important deaths are just glossed over with little or no attentioned paid to them. Christopher Lloyd as the villain is serviceable but his motives are not always clear throughout the film.Overall this was a satisfying film from a non-trekker perspective and I'm curious to see what happens to the now disintegrated enterprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trek Classic, definitely worth the $","review":"I bought this DVD for my father, who, at 76 years of age, is a new Trekker.

Disobeying orders, stealing the Enterprise, a Vulcan aging with a planet, Klingons killing everybody, Spocks mind in McCoy's - need I go on. This movie's got a lot goin on the entire time that keeps you watching.

This is common with all Paramount Releases that I have rented or purchased. Big on hoopla light on content, No behind the scenes, No commentary, No Story boards, No nothing except for a trailer, and foreign language support (isn't this on all DVDs? What so special about this?). Now I would expect this with a smaller release but this is Star Trek the mother of all Sci-fi Flicks. I really can't recommend buying, unless you don't already own it. Except for a little better picture quality than VHS, your not getting anything else. I think that maybe Paramount is saving real special features for a special edition, of course you'll have to pay 30% more for it. What a fleecing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated Star Trek chapter.","review":"First, here's what I didn't like: Kirk's son dies, and the Enterprise is destroyed. I know they wanted gripping drama, but still, doing ether one of the two seemed a bit too much. The Enterprise has been home to it's crew (and, in a way, to the fans) since the first T.V. episode, and the death of Kirk's son, well...it's his _son_. Otherwise, why does everyone concider this one of the weaker episodes? SPOCK LIVES. His ressurection should have been enough to make any true fan stand up and cheer. There's also enough action to satisfy anyone. Kirk and crew (minus Spock) must face off against not only the dastardly Klingons, but also against their own superiors at Starfleet. This is also the first film where we see the Excellcior, my favorite Star Trek ship. Check this film out."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know what this is.","review":"III isn't my personal favorite Star Trek, but obviously it is a must have for any Trek Fan.

She seems to be a near-saint, possibly undergoing a stigmata, and this endears her to some nuns and separates her from others. The events of the novel explore the mysterious nature of mystical experience and of faith. It also explores the ways in which individual motives effect the perceptions of faith.This is one of those books that you read in a single sitting and then immediately begin reading it again. This is certainly a novel I will continually return to. Simply reading this gorgeous prose and the mysterious, iradescent images creates an almost numinous experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"An incredible novel by one of America's finest. Beautifully written - sparse and lucid. It is written so objectively each reader tends to form a different opinion and explanation for what is happening - similar to what many do who choose to believe or not believe.

It's a poignant work, and so descriptive that I feel like I'm not even reading, but am there! I'm no longer just 'reading a book' but really present, almost like a ghost shadow following Mariette.

Smith, and \\"Was,\\" by Geoff Ryman."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the service of the Church?","review":"I was so disappointed with this book.The style is too precious, almost painful. In parts, it feels like a take-off from the many books written on the life of the Little Flower (including the character of an indulgent father). So Mariette's story is hardly surprising and not as inspiring as that of the original Saint Therese.I'm not so much bothered by the novel's hanging ending as by the lack of worth of the alleged mystical experiences. Charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit - whether mystical, contemplative, prophetic, or active charitable works - are given for the good and service of the Church. There is no hint of that whatsoever in this novel. This is a soft erotic novel dressed in a contemplative habit."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"That Ron Hansen has a career as a writer is beyond my comprehension. The only thing worse than this book is the B movie based on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nun in 1906 Upstate New York...","review":"I was quite surprised at this book after reading it in a single day. It's not a long book (only 179 pages) but it wasn't what I expected. I wanted a more intricate story with sub-plots and more controversy. It's clear that Catholic convents had strict rules in the early 20th Century. It took me into a loop when Mariette has a stigmatic experience that no one took seriously; whereby, she was dismissed from becoming a nun. The story really lacked a good plot and there were too many SISTERS in the story. One is better off finding the excellent film, THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (which is based on a true story). The writing by author Ron Hansen cannot be overlooked as he does have a special style. This was a National Bestseller in 1991. I think a lot of readers were intriged and 'let down' by the title alone. Oh well...it added a completely new subject as a follow-up to my last book (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN--Haha)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic spirituality makes for an interesting, if confusing, read","review":"Mariette in Ecstasy is a beautiful read. The short, poetic descriptions dispersed throughout add character and mystery to the story. The plot itself is interesting and engaging, although Hansen's choice in how to present it is personally a little problematic. It wasn't until I was a third of the way through the novel that I began to understand what was going on, and not until I reached the last section that the plot was made clear.However, the book was an easy read, which provided interesting criticism on life in a convent as well as a relationship with God in an engaging, creative manner. I found the book edifying, and led me into contemplations of my own spiritual life and the Christian life in general. I would recommend it to anyone interested in convent life, God, or simply beautiful language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believeable!","review":"Who am I to say whether Mariette's stigmata was indeed real? Self-sacrifice and a longing toward selfless service could have been her calling. As Mother Superior suggested, we may need only be willing to serve in cloistered life; not necessarily be expected to carry out that willingness. Thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritually manipulative","review":"The book is well written and engrossing, but the author uses his Catholic religious knowledge to build a ruse. The reader may involve themselves spiritually in the happenings, the Scriptures and prayers, to be let down in a manipulative ending. What a shame. I'm not interested in reading more of Ron Hansen's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"A book so vividly written -- on a subject so removed from most of us -- that I alternated between being astonished by the story, and astonished that it could have been written in modern times and by a man.

A unique and innovative treatment of a rare story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL Book","review":"A BEAUTIFULLY written, stirring book. At times gentle, at times reflective, at times so full of humanity these characters seem alive. For those buying this book for a spiritual read, I found it absolutely inspiring.

I love Humphrey Bogart...he is probably the greatest actor of all time, but I was a little disapointed in him in this particular part.

If you have heard Ras Kass before you know he doesn't water down,or have hooks to sell records. He is a raw underground rapper with intellegent lyrics and one liners you might not get the first time hearing it. Rassaniation really shows his true technique and skills. The title track is my personal favorite, but the entire album is very entertaining. To see what true rap is about I'd say to get this album as quick as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocked Out Like Deebo","review":"Now that Van Gogh is in the stores and Ras is off Priority, it's a great time to check his first good album. The title track thumps and features the superior rappin' he is world famous for. I approve of Lap Dance, because it has the same groove as an old Prince tune and I like lap dancers, good folks. Easy Mo B has worked with Craig Mack and Miles Davis now he blesses Ras with a cool thump-thump beat on Grindin' , which closes the album out well. He does'nt drink Sprite but he knows how to change the game.

Our Junkaroo is only about two years old and is falling apart. And it's not from overuse or misuse. The legs fold for storage/transportation. They are supposed to be held in the open position when in use by little metal nipples that fit into plastic dentents. Yeah...plastic....that's gonna last. As one might expect, the nipple/detent system ultimately has failed and the legs won't stay in the open position. The whole thing is wobbly, dangerous and is basically going to wind up being more plastic junk clogging up our landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby LOVES it!","review":"My son spends hours on this jumperoo!

But, it is totally not worth $170. I fail to see why it is so expensive, and no toy for an infant should cost that much. It only really plays one song. For $170 it should offer many more features. I bought mine at a consignment store and paid next to nothing. I say it's worth $75 at most brand new, which is about the price of the Rainforest Jumparoo It is a great toy, though it is big and rather cumbersome to lug around. However, to us it was a much better option than a door jamb jumper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumperoo","review":"My daughter loves to play in her Jumperoo.

I like that it is free standing, so it can be used anywhere including outside. The only complaint I have is that the seat is a little annoying to adjust the height on. It is not possible to adjust the height with the child in it. Other than that GREAT product, would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"Me & Baby love this! The only problem i have is that you can't change out any toys & she gets bored easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for a while","review":"I bought this when my daughter was 4 months and able to hold her head steady while sitting. She jumped a lot then and got a blast from it. Now at 7 months she will sit in it for a short while, but only if she'd entertained by something else, like watching her Baby Einstein Video. The little musical light show in front doesn't hold her attention much. But its nice how it adjusts to a babies height with the 4 straps on each corner. She's gone from (1) when she was 4 mos, to (2) now. She may make it to (3) by the time she's almost too big for it. She's starting to crawl and I doubt she'll want to be confined to that then. Easy to assemble. Seat cushion removes easily to throw in the washer. Tricky folding it flat enough to keep it up and out of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order this from Amazon","review":"Spend the money at a store for this jumperoo. I had bought one several years ago that was much sturdier and smaller. The store bought one has the height adjustments on the bars itself and is not so flimsy. If it weren't for the cost of shipping, I would return this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, turn off the sound!","review":"I have had my Jumperoo now for 4 years. It is now used by our third child, who is 4 months old. I put him in it about a 2 weeks ago, and he just loved standing there handling the toys. Just a few days ago, he figured out how to jump, and he can be in it for upwards 30 minutes and be happy. While my first 2 kids enjoyed the sound on, I am so glad that the batteries are now dead and so is the sound. My baby is enjoying the toy just as much without the sound, and won't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Our baby hated it. Get a Jolly Jumper instead.","review":"I initially picked this one up because we don't have a door frame to hang the regular Jolly Jumper from, and the stand alone Jolly Jumper looked too big for our small apartment.Big mistake. The height adjustment only had 4 levels. Not very good for a baby that grows. The seat didn't hold our son well, so he kinda flopped around in it as he tried to bounce. Two minutes in the thing, and he would get frustrated with it. The flashing lights and toys just got in his way - he wants to look at the world around him.I returned it after a week, and got the stand alone Jolly Jumper. Our son LOVES it. The first day we had it, he was in there three times, jumping like crazy, laughing, having a great ol' time.Get the Jolly Jumper before the over-rated Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo. Your baby will thank you.Jolly Jumper with Stand"},{"rating":"2","title":"Son's Favorite Toy","review":"My son loved the jumperoo from the time he was about 4 months to a little over a year. Just like someone else on here, we called it the poop-e - roo too. Everytime he was in it, it made him go. Fortunately, it was easy to clean. My son is 2 and 1/2 now and still wants to go in it! I loved how stable it was and that it didn't attach to a door frame. Would recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"No wonder all the customer pictures above are of sleeping babies! This thing bored the poor things to sleep! It only has 3 toys for baby to play with. Not to mention it is hard to store and takes up alot of storage. Hard to move from room to room if you have narrow hallways (although I wouldn't have minded the storage problem if it could keep baby interested for even a half of a second!). Not to mention the one and only button that activates music and lights is kind of hard for baby to push. I even had to push it a couple of times to get it to start. Spend your money on the rainforrest, precious planet, or the laugh and learn. They have better reviews and tons more toys on them to stimulate baby. FYI: the laugh and learn on Amazon is around $300.00 new. If you are interested and don't like the price (I didn't!) try Babies R Us it is only $99.99 Hope this review helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICE ??!?","review":"May I ask please why is this item 65 dollars as recommended on fisher price website and it is 169 sold here?

It's also perfect because we can take it outside. While our older children play in the backyard, she can play in the jumper."},{"rating":"2","title":"great baby bouncer!","review":"I bought this for my grand-daughter a couple of months ago. She gets lots of bouncing in it now at 6mos. I gave it 4 stars because she doesn't seem too interested in the toys and it is kinda awkward to carry in from the truck when she comes over to my house. Her parents love it since she's lost interest in her swing. It's great that you can turn off the music and/or the lights. I definitely think it was worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought one","review":"I bought this after seeing my cousin's baby entertain himself for almost an hour in his! He screamed when you took him out of it! Well, my little guy likes it, but not as much. He's more of an exersaucer kid. If you're baby likes to jump and rock...then this one is definately for you though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver!","review":"I can't praise the jumperoo highly enough. My daughter was very clingy - we tried swings and the vibrating bouncer seat (the one they can't jump in) and she'd stay in them for at most 15 minutes before wanting to be held again.The first time we put her in the Jumperoo, she stayed in it for an hour. SHe loves it! She jumps and jumps, then takes a break to play with the toys, then jumps some more.I wish it didn't take up quite so much floor space (we have a 1 bedroom apt), but its worth it to have my hands back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy for the Price!","review":"I LOVED this jumper. Our floorplan is very open, so we don't have doorways in which to hang a jumper. Also, that idea has always made me very antsy, so the idea of a free-standing jumper made me feel much safer. I love the 5 height adjustments, the washable pad and removable front toys. I love that almost every piece can be easily washed and the others just take a little more time. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the amount of space it takes up. It is very wide and even when folded, requires quite a bit of space. It does make some noise when your baby jumps, but nothing unbearable. All in all, I loved this product and so did both of our boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter Loves it","review":"My daughter loves the jumperoo we got her. Its not bulky and it folds away easy.

My granddaughter immediately figured out what she was supposed to do, and will spend all the time in it that I will allow. It's good exercise for her and makes us both happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GREAT.","review":"This was not that great. it took up to much room even when it was folded for easy storage. My daughter couldnt really get enough bounce out of it when she jumped and would only last about 5-10 min in it before she had had enough, so i sold it at a second hand kid store (lost alot of money on it) and i picked up the fisher price doorway bouncer with the tray and bumper around it. MUCH MORE FUN AND EASY TO STORE!!!!! My daughter had a BLAST in it from about 7 mos. to 13 mos. she got far more bounce out of it (catching a little air occasionally) and she would sit there spinning like a ballerina in it cooing and laughing. This product was in my opinion a waste of space and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumperoo - I bet your child will love this too","review":"This is a great toy for babies. It's a little pricey, but well worth it, considering how much your child will be in it. My son loves it so much. It is very safe, and works well in our house where doorway jumpers really wouldn't. I would give it five stars except for 2 things:1. The music it plays (2 songs) are shrill and annoying. We took the batteries out.2. The box says it is collapse-able and you can move it room to room. You can, but it is still pretty big to be moving around all the time.Neither of these things should keep you from buying this, however. It is a great investment, and will grow with your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumperoo is great.........!","review":"I bought this for my daughter who is 4 1/2 months old. She LOVES it. She wasn't feeling too well the first day I had it, but I thought I'd give it a try anyways. Is was the first smile I'd seen from her all day. She was actually smiling and laughing, and stayed in it for about 20 minutes!!! It's wonderful to strengthen their legs and let them burn some energy. My only reccomedation is to buy this early, my daughter is already 20 pounds and the weight limit is 25, so buy this when they're about two months old and you'll get a long life out of it!!!

A much better choice for the same music, in far superior sound would be \\"The Very Best Of Benny Goodman\\" on RCA. A generic search on Amazon for Benny Goodman will put it near the top.

First the battery life went from lasting me about three days to lasting just a few hours, then the phone stopped accepting the charger (I usually have to hold it in, so the phone is useless when out and about), and now almost every call gets dropped at least once.

It was the first toy he got out of the box after all the gifts were opened on X-mas eve, and everyone played with it all night . It is well made and works great, very easy to set up and start shooting. You can set the air flows to different heights and the balls float in the air perfectly. It comes with extra balls and the \\"arrows\\" have suction cup tips for shooting at targets. All the kids from ages forty down to four had a great time with it. Cats also find it highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good but at least it's expensive.","review":"Doesn't come with everything it says it does and is not worth the price.

Umm, boring?) and guitar-heavy jams make it come alive. Langton's lead guitar is mostly quite solid, compared to the earlier wankings of Brock etc, and all in all this is good humor on the headphones for pure space metal escape.Too bad these guys didn't have a really good singer, or melodic songwriter. Despite the hype, and their unique niche, they never once approach Floyd etc for true musicality. Still, it's good fun, comic book rock at its best, for what that's worth.

I work in a bookstore and always get comments from customers wanting to know who this band is they never heard of. While the tone is largely a soulful alt-country (\\"Tall Pines,\\" \\"Hills of Caroline\\"), there are some wonderful \\"out of the box\\" tunes that nevertheless fit the album perfectly. Gina Blaber takes the lead vocals on these departures, such as \\"The Speed of Light\\" and the amazing \\"Whether I Call You,\\" which I usually repeat a time or two as I play the CD. Gina and the other main vocalist, Kevin Russell (also the lead guitar player), have obviously worked together for a long time and understand each other perfectly, and the band is egalitarian, with everybody taking a tune or two.This CD has legs to spare and is a part of my permanent collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look before you buy!","review":"Good news and bad news here.First the bad. The big named songs here, Roomfull of Roses, Almost, and Candy Kisses are all remakes done for Starday and Stop records in the 1970's.Now the good. This cd is the only available collection of his Stop and Starday recordings. \\"Lilacs and Fire, and Sounds of Goodbye\\" were all chart hits for Morgan.

This man's life experiences have created a new african-american male voice. As a current Chicago dweller, it is uncanny how he describes the sites and scenes so vividly.

The lives of 4 friends and how they shared the harsh realities of life was the bases for this story. The characters were believable and the storyline was good. I did not know Basil from Harris' other works, but I started to understand his dilema as the book progressed. And, I felt his suffering more than the other characters. Harris allowed us to see people as just human beings, opposed to 'straight, gay or bisexual' people. I must confess, this book will make me take a different look at men. Not in a negative or sterotypical way, just with more scrutiny. I do like Harris' writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"If This World Were Mine what magic would I do!","review":"This book kept coming into view & I finally took it home to read.

It is that good. The book focuses on the lives of four individuals from very different backgrounds and perspectives and how their lives come together to form a bond that violance, feelings of being deceived or even bad siniging can not break.It is a book that as a man I can assure you it will make you laugh, think, cry (not that I did mind you), and simply smile.

Well, here I am. And let me tell you E. Lynn Harris is not worth your time. He is, unfortuantely, a marginal writer with little to say. The only redeeming factor of this book, which I read while on vacation in St. Maarten, is that it gives a human face and voice to black gay men. But that was not enough. The characters and plot are superficial, trite, predictable and soap opera-esque. I felt my mind was turning to mush while I read this; eerily similar to the feeling of watching too much TV or eating too many potato chips. If you like Terry McMillan, you'll love this drivel. If not, read authors that challenge, teach and inspire.

Pick up Perfect Timing and Save Yourself, which are vastly superior albums, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I know there were a number of videos of this band from the old days on MTV but I had thought this record was better. Oh Michael's guitar playing is as phenomenal as ever and the riffs are quite heavy but for some reason, Michael cannot seem to find a quality singer since Graham Bonnet's debut on \\"Assault Attack\\". McAualey's vocals are lackluster and the lyrics are lame like there's no passion. The songs themselves are only lively due to Michael's guitar expertise with a good bass & drum accompanying him.

Robin McCauley's voice fits the music very well. The best song on the album as far as i'm concerned is \\"When I'm Gone\\", which is a very emotional love story.

It was great to hear Schenker riffs to bring me back to when I was young, first love, and heart ache. For fans of Ratt and of course Scorpions, even a few Cinderella Fans. McAuley's vocals are a little touch of Ted Poley (Danger Danger) and Poison's Bret Michaels. For a good mix of Power Ballads (What happens to me, When I'm Gone) to partying with your freinds.(Eve, Lonely Nights).A must have for Fans of 80s glory days.

My personal feeling is that all reviewers including book's author are wrong. String theory is not wrong. Any formal mathematical construct that can be proved is correct. Does it serve any practical purpose because of that? Not necessarily. Same with string theory, it describes what the laws of physics would be if the world just happened to function as string constructs specify. Does it? To the latest evidence it does not, but if there existed somewhere a world formed by tiny strings, perhaps string theory would describe it much better than any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Positives: Great band, great show, and while some complain about the camera work, it's a band whose members spend their time onstage standing in one spot.

A lot of it has to do with the amateur quality of it - the shaky cameras, the relentless jump cutting, the poor dubbing. It's kind of offensive, really, that the Trio would release something so low-quality when they obviously have the means to put together a top-shelf concert DVD (or at least one where the sound and the picture even come close to matching). There are also problems with the sound that become apparent within the first two songs; \\"Hell Yes\\" and \\"Madam Me\\" are at completely different volumes. For a DVD that got delayed so many times, it sure feels like a rush job. If you're a Trio fan, you're going to buy it, but you'd be better off spending your fifteen dollars on a concert ticket next time the boys roll into your town.

Although Thunders, Kane, Nolan and Murcia were important to the original Dolls, I have always argued that David Johansen and Sylvain were the heart of the group.

The Dolls trademard dueling left speaker/right speaker half-lead-half-rhythm guitars is sorely missed. David Jo's voice sounds kind of shot. I don't know. This sounds like OK rock and roll.

Amazing live as well...","review":"I bought this CD. I listened to this CD. I listened to it again. And again. I saw them live 3 times. This band can dish it out live like none I've ever seen. THE BEST LIVE BAND EVER. Period. The CD is absolutely amazing and anyone who likes The Who, The Kinks, The Beatles, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Squeeze, GBV, and The Byrds absolutely needs to own this. I can't say enough about it. Even my daughter who's 15 likes this! And the live show is like The Who and The Attractions and The Kinks all rolled into one!! Very powerful stuff. I'm glad this band exisits. With all the c**p out there, its wonderful to see that these 4 guys still care about melody and quality songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"You shoulda heard 'em in the beginning","review":"Kon Tiki is indeed brilliant, but to put this record on the same tier as \\"Sgt Pepper\\" would probably even embarrass the Mather lads. Personally, I like their first (\\"Crafty Flower Arranger\\"), and second cd (Cotton Is King\\") a little better, if just for the slightly rougher edge and slightly less self-conscious lyrics. Songs like \\"Ivanhoe\\" and \\"Payday\\" make me want to rebuild Liberty Lunch and The Electric Lounge by hand, brick-by-brick, just to put Cotton Mather inside and watch them perform, back when it was the original line-up (okay, maybe not with Wendy on drums, but then again, why the hell not?) Let's just say that if you're a \\"pop tart,\\" you really ought to have at least one CM record in your collection. Kon Tiki will certainly do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!","review":"This band is to the Beatles what Elvis impersonators are to Elvis. For a variety of reasons, Cotton Mather doesn't cut it. 1.) Can't sing. 2.) College-boy precocity. 3.) They just don't get it. There ARE some great Merseybeat revisionists out there. Myracle Brah comes to mind. The \\"Shake Some Action\\" era Flamin' Groovies, for another.

This movie was just too unbelievable for me to get into. The biggest things I couldn't get past were 1) how CPS never got involved, especially after the oldest daughter told the principal that her mom's boyfriend gave her drugs to sell, and 2) how her friends could be so unnaccepting of Monty while setting her up with a trashy unemployed rapper. Julia's rapid change of snotty feelings and ability to drop her standards were too sudden to be believable as well.The characters were 2 dimensional and cliched.

The DVD release was scheduled in time for Father's Day, but the plot seemed to be centered (more) around a love-sick lady attorney who was looking for an excuse to hop into bed with the first man that she felt comfortable with, than the manner in which the father of the girls actually interacted with his daughters in times, other than dramatic-moments. I have one other Tyler Perry Movie, and the evidence from my viewing, is that althought his work center around family, it does not represent true African American Culture. It only reflects the thoughts that people of other races view African Americans. Those of different pursuasions no longer have to voice their opinions of us, because you can see it when you pop the DVD into the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"Horrible movie of dad who looses custody that he never had.

I must say watching Idris was the highlight. I'm not sure what happened with Gabrielle, I've seen her do good work but her acting was horrible. The storyline was predicatble and cliche.If using the boy from the wrong side of the tracks gets with the rich girl storyliine it should have atleast been a few twists thrown in.

It's been easier to keep track of the little things between the flashbacks and what is currently going on with the survivors and the others. This season is a really big deal for the series and sees some major changes and shifts.There is also the introduction of flash forwards which means you really have to pay extra attention to what's going on. Of course, the season flows with the same suspense as the previous two. Of course, they still don't tell you what the smoke monster is.Again, this show is like crack and of course Season 3 ends with you yelling at the TV to see season 4.

This season is of course nothing short of excellent, the first six episodes are almost like a Lost mini-series, with the ending being one of the best climatic cliffhangers ever, and the seventh episode comes back with a vengeance which blasts off the rest of the season. If season one was survival and season two was the hatch then season three is exploration. And if you thought the season opener for season two was insane you haven't seen anything yet! You haven't already watched Lost on TV and are planning on waiting for the DVD and watching it straight through you are really lucky, thats the way to do it, personally I'm too addicted to do it.Favorite episodes includeEnter 77Not in PortlandFlashes Before My EyesOne Of UsThe Brig"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaky start, glorious ending.","review":"Lost - The Complete Third Season started off so-so but finished with a bang! I think Matthew Fox should've received an Emmy nomination for his riveting and heartbreaking performance in the season finale, how good is he?! Although we the fans have to wait 'til next February to see what happened, I can't wait because I think the fourth season will probably be the best, more twist and turns just ahead for the passengers of Oceanic Flight 815. Of course there were some casualties this season, we lost some great cast members, and what's with Juliet's face? The muscles in her face don't move? Can you say botox junkie!

I especially liked the back stories of this fascinating cast of characters as they cope with their mysterious new 'home'. Characters we grow to like meet untimely deaths and in season three, one of those will be sadly missed. (Methinks it's back to Hobbitland for him.) Lost third season is most entertaining as we get to know 'the others' who continue to torment the castaways. This season's finale is a knockout with a cliffhanger to top 'who shot JR'. Were the 'survivors' really rescued? Will I have to wait until Dec 2008 for season 4 to appear on DVD? It seems ABC sees fit to bombard us with commercials every 8 minutes and this really bugs me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I could have imagined!","review":"This is an amazing season, and watching it on blu-ray is quite a treat. If you think that it couldn't look any better than it's dvd counterpart (upscaled), then think again. The colors are very vibrant, and the environment is lush and alive. The sound is top notch also you feel as though you are on the island with them.As far as the season itself goes, I really enjoyed it. Lost is a very mysterious show and this season raises more questions, although it does answer a few questions viewers were waiting for. It has a very awesome ending too.In conclusion, if you love Lost and have a blu-ray player, please get this it's worth the extra money. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD collection!","review":"I really enjoyed this season of Lost.

We are stationed in Korea and were spared what must have been an excruciating week to week season. The season is pathetic. It moves at a snails pace up until the last two disks where apparently the writers and directors realized they had squandered away nearly the whole season and something had to be done quickly. One of the few good episodes features a dejected Hurly rising to the challenge and saving the day.Far too much time is spent on \\"Jack\\" and \\"Freckles\\" who are the least interesting characters on the show. One entire episode is devoted to people not previously main characters and who are dead in the end. A virtually wasted show.For Lost fans like my family you have to have this set but be warned.

The author gives no evidence that she even new jim no photos, just some copy of a paper that she says jim gave her. Some of the stuff this lady claims is just so outrageous that it's incredible. For example, Morrison showed up at her house. So bottom line the author gives no credible evidence that she even new jim so don't waste your time reading this. Read \\"Angels dance and Angels Die.\\" or \\"No one here gets out alive.\\" Linda Ashcroft go sell your lies somewhere [else!!!]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Fiction","review":"An overblown romance novel masquerading as fact. If Linda Ashcroft (and her truly colossal ego) ever set eyes on Jim Morrison it was in concert. She and the equally mendacious Patricia Kennealy (\\"Strange Days\\") ought to be horsewhipped for painting Pamela Courson as a murderess and themselves as the inspirations for or even co-authors of virtually all Morrison's songs and poetry.Anyone interested in discovering the truth about these two fantasists should go to the Doors Collectors Magazine website and click on the appropriate links."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Liar","review":"Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will the real truth please stand up?","review":"A beautifully told story of love, trust, sensuality and creativity between two kindred souls. I enjoyed Ms. Ashcroft's writing style. The book read with a languid pace that held and absorbed. It painted such an intimate portrait of Mr. Morrison, that at times it was painful to read. But, is it the truth? You will have to read and come to your own conclusions. Truth has many sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"This book does NOT read like a memoir. It reads like fan fiction. It is a beautifully written love story, but, so obviously NOT based on any relationship with the real Jim Morrison. If this book was published as fiction, I would give it five stars. That being said, I'm giving it one star for being well written, and one star for having Jim Morrison as the hero/romantic lead. I'm not saying this book isn't worth reading. If you have ever listened to the doors, or listened to an interview with Jim Morrison, and longed to know what it would be like to have the amazing artist/poet treat you as his muse, this book is for you. If you are looking for a factual biography and insight into what life with the REAL Jim Morrison was like, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Romantic Novel","review":"Linda Ashcroft writes acceptable prose and spins an interesting novel concerning her relationship with Jim Morrison. Obviously, there is no possible logistical way that the events could have transpired as written, given The Doors' very hectic travel schedules in those years. And too, there is scant or no collaborative evidence, not to mention that other Doors' biographers, very close to the events, have omitted her named entirely. Given that, and understanding that this work is fiction, I can recommend the book be enjoyed for its insights to muriad possibilities of partial truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIAR, LIAR, PATNS ON FIRE","review":"Ms. Ashcroft has a wonderful grasp on the English language, and is a talented writer. Too bad she wasted all this talent on a load of hog wash. How convenient that everyone who can corroborate her story is gone.

If read as a fictional love story, it's okay. If you really want to take it as truth, that's your choice, but I happen to know that it never happened. In fact, Jim Morrison's parents stopped the book from being sold in the UK because it contained so many untruths. (She claims that she tried to have sex with him at the age of 15. Was Jim capable of statutory rape?)You can decide. If you want an okay love story, read this book. If you want something that's more about what Jim Morrison was like, read Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's Strange Days."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very bad fiction book","review":"I can't believe People actually believe anything this so called \\"Linda ashcroft\\" wrote. This is just as bad as Patricia K's book. I mean, where did Jim really fine these women, who are now, making money off of his good soul. These two ladies(can we actually call them ladies) are only out there for the money. How can they claim they own Jim's heart, when everyone knows he only Loved Pamela Courson.Don't buy this book, if you need to read it, just borrow it somewhere. Don't let these ladies make more money off of Jim Morrison. Buy Instead \\"the Lords and The New Creature's\\" instead. All dedicated to his real wife Pamela Courson Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't buy it","review":"Sorry, I just don't buy it. She just sounds WAY too intellectual and sophisticated for a 15 year old. No one ever heard of her. She has nothing to back this up. Her box full of Jim's letters and keepsakes were conveniently the only things stolen when she was supposedly burglarized. Other people who are knowledgeable about the Doors say her dates don't match up with when he was on tour. I believe this is wishful thinking, a waste of time and way too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"Sorry, I don't believe this author had a four year relationship with Jim Morrison of Doors fame. It's doubtful that she even KNEW him.I believe Patricia K's story when it comes to bare facts, though her interpretations of Morrison's intent, feelings, and motivation might be questionable.But Linda's story, nope, I don't buy it.Save your money, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wishing it were true","review":"I feel this a really good book for anyone who likes a good romantic story. In the end as I'd like to think it is true, I just can't believe it is so. There are so many things that prove otherwise. Such as the only people (friends) of Morrison that she met, had died before she wrote this book. Also if it were true she would probably have at least have a couple pictures to show for it, oh wait I forgot about that stuff stolen out of her closet. And you would also think if he'd introduce her to his girlfriend that he would also introduce her to the other band members, but that wouldn't work out because they are all still alive and well. It makes for a good read and left me wishing so much that it was true, but all I can sum it up as, is some teenage girl who ran into Jim Morrison a couple times and decided to fan it up a bit into a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Child???????","review":"I can't believe that someone who had such fleeting liasons with Mr Morrison could churn out 500 pages. The 1 photo of the author in the book, is the day before she went to a Doors concert??? Where are the photos of them together??? As fiction it is a sweet tale....but there are better books out there by people who really knew the man, and have the facts and evidence to back up their claims. If you want a book abut Jim and his women, get Angels Dance and Angels Die instead. Now that is a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"True or not? Who really knows? Morrison seemed to be here, there, and everywhere. Each writer has his/her own take on his life.Wild Child is an excellent read. I thoroughly enjoyed it, reading long after my lights should have been out.Ashcroft shows many sides of Morrison, not just the good. Had he slowed down and settled down with Ginger, perhaps his tragic story might have had a different end."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS----naive readers beware","review":"I'd give this book ZERO stars, because it's a work of pure fiction... Before dishing out money for this book, Doors fans should try finding and reading the article by Salli Stevenson. Stevenson compared Ashcroft's claims to Jim's actual schedule, using Greg Shaw's book, \\"The Doors on the Road\\". If you can't find Stevenson's article, try reading \\"The Doors on the Road\\" by Greg Shaw if you want to know what Jim Morrison was REALLY doing, when he was supposed to be spending time with Ms. Ashcroft (hint...he wasn't flying kites with Linda, he was busy touring!!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Child: Arthur Rimbaud","review":"Arthur Rimbaud was known as the \\"Enfant Terrible\\" or terrible child, as referenced in wild child.Do you remember when we were in Africa is a reference to Rimbaud's time spent in Africa and the fact that Morrison felt he knew him.

This women has NO hard evidence to support her claims. Everyone that can substantiate her story are all...well,dead...all evidence to support her relationship with Morrison have all been...well, stolen and no one in Morrison's intimate circle (that are still alive) have ever heard of her.I would never say she never met Morrison, it is possible...but it is clear this \\"true\\" love story is more or all imagination and no reality. The reader will begin to doubt from very early on when the author clearly uses specific dialogue as if writing a play...Memory is one thing but to remember word for word dialogue from 30 years before seems ridiculous to say the least..I could have made a similiar claim and built a whole story around a love affair even though I was born AFTER he died..after all I have just as much \\"evidence\\" as the author does..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"I've just finished reading \\"Wild Child\\" and am quite disappointed. It's not as well written as I'd anticipated from reading other reviews, and although I see myself as a romantic, her story was too saccharine even for my tastes.I will withhold my personal thoughts as to the validity of her account, not having known any of the parties involved, but it would seem odd that a brilliant, chivalrous, needy, tortured alcoholic could be as one sided as he is portrayed in this book. I'm more likely to recommend Patricia Kennealy- Morrison's memoir to those interested in learning more about Jim Morrison. It was infinately more readable and leaves the reader with more insight into who Jim Morrison really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a travesty.","review":"This book is a ludicrous travesty. The only people mentioned in this book who could substantiate this sick woman's ridiculous story are dead - Bill Graham, Brandon De Wilde and Jimi Hendrix for starters and, of course, the woman who actually murdered Morrison. The Ginger/Linda Ashcroft person is never mentioned in any other material about Jim Morrison or the Doors. This book doesn't even SOUND like the truth. Wild Child is a sick attempt to capitalize on a talented and tortured dead man.And ye harm none be the whole of the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Be In Late 60s San Francisco Via Kansas","review":"West Coast styled US 60s from Lawrence Kansas with complex melodic vocal harmonies, spaced out guitars and good original dreamy and melodic songs.

I've used the small white block feeders in the past without problems, and didn't understand how this one could turn anything orange. Now that it has arrived, I see that the picture of a white squid shaped feeding block is misleading. The thing is actually dyed an orange color.

Detailed, accurate, and filled with many useful diagrams. It is a significant improvement over the regular edition in terms of topic depth and scope.The hard covers are nice and the elastic tie to keep the book closed (and any loose notes you've accumulated inside) is a really nice addition. I'm not a big fan of spiral binding -- I'm sure it's the only way to make a thick reference that will lay flat on the workbench, but the spiral binding makes the pages difficult to turn.If you're a jewelry professional, the pro edition is definitely the way to go. If you're a beginner, the regular edition is probably sufficient (and $15 less)."},{"rating":"2","title":"super book","review":"This book is a wonderful overview of most of the techniques of metalsmithing. The professional edition is sturdier for the most part than the older edition the book is designed to lat flat on the bench it is obvious it was designed by someone who designs functional objects for a living. It is the first book I recommend to anyone getting into metal work, from blacksmithing to jewelry making. It is a definite must-have and a classic of its kind. This said, if you get into any one technique more, specialty books are helpful, but this is the best overview out there. I don't give five stars often but this was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","review":"The Good: Complete Metalsmith by Tim McCreight is an excellent basic text for the beginner jewelry maker. Overall it should probably be purchased by every hobbyist with an interest in working with metal in jewelry making.The Bad: Too much subject matter is condensed to a single page or even a single paragraph. Topics such as gold leaf and its application and enameling are much more complex than the single page definitions Mr. McCreight offers his readers.The Ugly: Because metal smithing goes beyond the simple jewelry making techniques and methods described in this book, Mr. McCreight chose a very misleading title for this book. Additionally many of the methods and techniques described fit better in a basement crafter's arsenal than in a professional metal smith's shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners","review":"The book took a little while to get here, other than that, was in great condition.

The high point of the CD is song number 6, \\"Dieu que pour toi\\". ( I think it might be called \\"Au Diable Nos adieux\\" on the North American release. This song is absolutely beautiful.

Even if you don't, though, it's still worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard on the ears","review":"The first half of this CD is hard to listen to. Although music is a matter of personal taste, I find this music to be extremely irritating and grinding on the ears.

In NYPD Blue we emphatize with the squad when we see the frustration in the faces and even in the gestures of the Detectives when a perp is giving them the run around or a when an incompetent squad sergeant is appointed ( Eddie Gibson )or when a fellow detective screws up a case.

Besides its obsolence, The Hite Report on Male Sexuality is statistically inaccurate, for it was proved that the choice of those 7000 men had a flawed criteria. The author based the research upon forms published in magazines she received. The result is that there's an abnormal concentration of men with sexual problems, causing a distortion in the result. Its historical importance, nevertheless, still remains, and that should be one's only reason to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing and Informative","review":"Sex researcher Shere Hite brings the same style from her earlier look at female sexuality.

I make large batches of mashed potatoes over the holidays and mash them in a deep pot, so the fact that this masher would be two inches longer than any that I could find in the store was the deciding issue. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package to find that it is actually shorter than the cheap one with the loose handle that it was bought to replace!for anyone interested in actually getting a large masher, please be advised that this masher is not, as stated under Product Details:Product Dimensions: 12.9 x 4.6 x 3.5 inchesIn fact it is about 10.9 x 3.75 x 3.6 inchesSort of makes me wonder what they actually measured, if anything.I am so disappointed and angry that I feel like giving this the lowest possible rating, but in fact it is a well designed implement, and is larger than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite masher","review":"I was starting to get a bit unhappy with the old masher - it was one with a flat nylon plate with 1/2 inch holes in it, and since we like potatoes mashed with a certain amount of the peel, the old masher would clog with skins, and was a bear to clean afterwards. The Zyliss is much nicer; mashes easily, no clogs, cleans up without having 1/2 a potato stuck in the holes. We like the result chunky; if you like super-creamy mashed potatoes this may not be your cup of tea, really haven't tried to mash them that far, though. Lately we've been enjoying what the British apparently call \\"mashes\\", which is two or more root veggies mushed together (turnip-potato, rutabaga+carrot, parsnip+potato, ...) and this does a bang-up job on those, leaving it chunky enough to identify which bit came from where.

I use mine frequently enough that I wanted something durable, and many felt like they'd bend with any real force. The Zyliss fit the bill - it's heavy duty, doesn't bend under pressure, and mashes up potatoes, yams, and winter squash with ease.The handle is long enough that my hand isn't too close to the hot food or steam, a problem I had with the OXO masher when mashing a big pot of food.I've been using it for about 6 months and made a HUGE batch of mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving with this masher. My old one would have had me knuckle deep in potatoes, but I could mash them right in the deep pot with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite utensil!","review":"Feels so good in your hand!

Havel's essays are published in several other works, but I haven't found the letters to and about him in any other book. This is an interesting book about a dissident who, while once challenging authority, had the courage to assume it and with it all of its moral complexities.I also recommend James Sire's book \\"Vaclav Havel: The International Conscience of International Politics\\" for a concise and readable introduction to the man and his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at best","review":"This is very geared to the process and structure.

It won't play cd's with any surface imperfections AT ALL, including dust. It is also unable to cope with being moved at all when it is playing (that is assuming you can find a pristine cd to play in it), and stops for several minutes before starting the cd over.

He also is clearly a pro-2nd amendment guy. However, he has been the victim of leftist California editors, who opted to slip in some historical revisionism and apologist opinions into the early pages of the book. If you skip over the civil war description and irrelevant photos and references to the USS Olympia in 1898, captioned as \\"the symbol of America's imperialist ambitions\\", it's a pretty good book.If Poyer had stood up to the extreme left editors, I'd have given this book five stars.

Instead, this book is not more than a detailed report of attacks made by several submarines on Japanese ships.

Shortly after that Boney capitulates and the 6th Light Dragoons are shipped back to Blighty and then on to Ireland to help serve warrants and evict tenants. Hervey finds his future mate and then the unit is rushed to Belgium. Anchoring Wellington's right flank their job is to stay in place and prevent the French from turning the British right flank.

If it were real life, I think someone may called Child Services on Uncle Neal. If he had been a little more reluctant to take these kids on his rescues it would have added some tension between the characters. Instead of Shannon and Cody being sugary-sweet, they could have blackmailed their uncle. (\\"We'll tell our parents your secret unless you let us come with you!\\") Shannon and Tyler could have been \\"troubled youth\\" together.

The \\"music\\" is pathetic as are the lyrics. As for the singers, Anthony Rapp does the best he can with the weak material. The rest of the singers' voices are as bad as the \\"songs\\" they are singing. I finished watching it because I had invested in it (my mistake) but it was actually hard to get through it.

Of course, not all the singing voices are 'fantabulous' but I do have to say I'm in love with Rapp's and Sally Kellerman's vocals. The film has a great humor to it, and a fun tone. The songs are extremely catchy -- you can find me singing Fantabulous all over the place.

The game arrived in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book, based on the five issue miniseries starts off promising, with great Templesmith (30 days of Night) art and an intelligent story about a therapist and a disturbed patient who travel to the town of Silent Hill.However, at chapter three, the story and Templesmith are both abruptly discarded. New artist Salman takes over. He has an interesting artistic style, but the difference in the artistic style is jarring. It is also hard to follow the story from the artwork. Moreover the direction the new story takes, about a biker chick who practices witchcraft, doesn't make sense with what came before it.Why didn't this book stay with the same artist and the same story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close...","review":"I can tell that these authors are hot hardcore fans of the great Silent Hill videogames by Konami because if they were, they wouldn't publish something that's more of an insult than interesting. It has very little potential and the pictures and art may be liked by graphic novel fans, but I certainly despised it. If you're not a Silent Hill gamer, you may like this but I am one, and I felt it insulted and really made Silent Hill look bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's already dead,","review":"I can't really say much for this book. It rehashed and reused monsters from previous games; having a head doctor in the story should have created far more interesting monsters. It seemed like the story started out with nothing more then an idea, and the writed decided to just see where the story led him. Stories should always be on a leash, guided and molded into what they are. otherwise you get this story. The only person EVER to have gotten away with letting the story walk itself is the creator of Bob and George of www.bobadgeorge.com .The art (both styles) are unaatractive, yet somehow fit. I liked the idea of having the riddles on the wall, and I felt like taking notes. But I didn't; the story was more like what a non-Silent Hill player viewed Silent Hill as.Nothing to see here, move along, move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dying Inside? I Know I Was","review":"As a fan of the Silent Hill series and its twisted mythos, I was hoping that the comics would expand on that. That the one shot stories with original characters would be worth picking up. While Dying Inside is not as bad as the others, it wasn't that great either.The artwork may have worked if you could actually see what was going on. There were times when the scene was so muddled that I couldn't tell the difference from one of the living human characters or a piece of rancid flesh.The story isn't that strong either. I've seen fanfiction writers do better jobs with the Silent Hill story and create a greater sense of dread in me.Dying Inside does not capture the essence of Silent Hill. That's just my opinion though. I leave it up to others to make their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, best remembered as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, produced an excellent historical drama with The Refugee, a story about the Huguenots. Although Doyle wasn't a Christian, he writes with a great deal of sympathy as he describes the plight of French Protestants in the late 17th century.The courage and resolution of the Hugenots was legendary as the majority went into exile rather than recant their evangelical faith in Christ. Consequently, they lost family, friends, property, and employment. It's a cruel chapter in France's history.The novel begins in France but finishes in Canada. Along the way we visit the inner sanctum of King Louis' palace, travel through the ice-berg infested waters of the north Atlantic sea, and journey in the wilderness of New France.Doyle also wroteThe Tragedy of the Korosko,: And the Green Flag, and Other Stories of War and Sport,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality","review":"Not well put together, should have spend more money on quality. Started to fall apart at installation. Mesh pockets have ripped apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their 2nd best effort","review":"Not as great as Out Of Bounds, but better than No Straight Angles (and IMHO better than their final album, State Of Flow, which puzzles me to this day.) The cream of the crop is basically heard in the first half-dozen or so tracks on the CD. The rest falls into that same-sounding skatepunk that doomed the movement from the very beginning. You might like the latter half of the CD if you are a fan of the genre, but if not the first 6 songs are plenty. Most of the material here is faster & harder than Out Of Bounds, but unfortunately leaves out the melodic aspect which ultimately cripples any long term listening aspirations. The 2nd best CD by a highly underrated (and sadly now defunct) pop-punk band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Melodic Punk","review":"This is my first No Fun At All album, and I like it enough to probably check out a bit more of what they have to offer. It's better than your average melodic skatepunk, mainly due to the impressive songwriting. A lot of melodic skatepunk is seriously lacking in that department, and just tries to make up for it with speed... these guys have the speed AND the songs, and it's a great combo. Although lyrics can be a bit odd at times, it just adds to the band's charm... for example \\"I am the greatest suicide machine, come watch me take my own life.\\" The greatest suicide machine?!? It only confuses rational thought to figure out what that is supposed to mean, but it's oddly lovable. It reminds me a bit of listening to early Rammstein, because you often wonder if these guys are really serious... I mean, they certainly do SOUND extremely serious about what they are doing, but how could they be with these goofy lyrics? I find that incredibly humorous, but that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betterr Problem Solving","review":"Have you ever wondered how people have creative ideas? This books tells you step by step how. Using anecdote after anecdote from the past and the present May builds a montage portrait of creativity that convinces. Even the prophetesses at the Oracle of Delphi turn out to be relevant.How exactly can we be more creative? The first step is to spend an extended period of time concentrating on the ins and outs of your problem. The next time you have a difficulty to solve spend all morning on it 'hot-housing' the question.This book is probably May's most readable and entertaining work. It is ideal for students, academics, and managers. It will also suit those with every day living problems that never seem to get solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"being wrong -- committing to something","review":"Referenced in the great book Being Wrong, by Kathryn Schulz, regarding being fully committed to something.

Mrs. Tuba works in a factory and struggles to hold her household together while everyone else around her - family, neighbors, coworkers,- are caught up in some kind of scheme or personal crisis. A hard-hitting, fast-moving film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Scenes","review":"Having lived in this part of the world for some time, I was able to appreciate most of the cultural details that perhaps others in an American audience might miss. Still, the plot confused me in places. But the film is worthwhile for a couple of particularly good scenes. The first is when Abbas finally gets up the courage to declare his feelings for the young woman at the office - he overflows with happiness, cheering himself on in the elevator, and dancing around his mother's home with his sister's wedding dress as a partner. For a moment, he captures the bliss felt in Gene Kelly's \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\" The second powerful scene is the ending, which turns the spotlight onto the viewer of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"a eye-opening must-read!!","review":"I bought this book recently and read it from cover to cover in 2 sittings.I highly recommend it. If I knew anyone who wanted to be a theatre performer, I would definitely BUY him/her this book.As a theatre fan, the book was an eye-opener and left me somewhat sad. It was especially interesting reading the contributions of Jason Alexander and Antonio Banderas.Most of the shows mentioned were musicals. Very little mention of straight plays. Thus the 4 stars instead of 5. But that's just a minor quibble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead-on accurate","review":"No punches pulled here, no fluff.

But I will defy anyone who doesn't think that this book should have a semester of coursework based on it at every notable conservatory and theater school in the country.There are many books that aspiring actors can read to learn the craft and skill needed to perform onstage.This is the only one I know of that can prepare young actors for life ahead of them OFFstage."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"As some of the other reviewers have said, it seemed like just a collection of complaints, rather than any positive information. I was looking for something that told the process of how one auditions, is chosen and begins the rehearsal process. (I have read this is other books, so that is what I was expecting.)And, the book is not really written, as much as simply a compilation of quotes.At first, I was thinking about donating it to my library. But, it was so depressing, I just threw it away.I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Case","review":"This case is pretty high quality compared to other laptop cases I've came across before.

Within a week, the top lid sides did not meet properly so that you had to spend a few minutes fiddling with it. Then, three weeks ago, one of the locking clasps fell off between leaving my plane and leaving the airport. So far the manufacturer has not stepped up with a new one or an offer to repair it FOC.

The brothers timing was all off and the material was just lacking. You'd a thought Marx Brothers at the circus HAD to be great but the boys just don't seem into it as if their minds were elsewhere. Lines were not delivered with passion, especially Groucho. Just for reference, my fav's are Cocoanuts, Duck Soup and HorseFeathers. I even got a pretty big kick out of Go West(TIM-BER). I didn't really care for Monkey Business, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Marx Bros.

It's worth a look, but don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"At the Circus\\" Is Mostly Sawdust","review":"Though it has a few classic moments, notably Groucho's rendition of \\"Lydia the Tattooed Lady,\\" the lackluster \\"At the Circus\\" (1939) ranks among the Marxes' worst films. A contributing factor to the depressing atmosphere is the annoying presence of romantic lead Kenny Baker, whose terrible songs and insipid \\"Oh, boy!\\" cheerfulness have no place in a Marx Brothers film. It's sad to see Groucho, Harpo and Chico brought down by poor material as well as a lack of creative input. Harpo, in particular, is diminished by the MGM gloss. Not even Margaret Dumont's presence can salvage this half-hearted attempt at comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Clownin' Around","review":"An above average Marx Brothers film...not in the likes of their best works like \\"A Day At The Races\\", \\"Duck Soup\\" or \\"A Night At The Opera\\"...but certainly better then the likes of \\"Room Service\\".

This being said, I have purchased a number of these in different configurations. The problem is the mating surface of the male end is not always molded properly leaving an irregular surface which will not seal against the hose washer which is inside the mating female connection. My experience is you have a 1 in 3 chance of having an end which does not properly seal.

Maxand doesn't bother with the cliches that define the female voice in rock-and-roll, she just writes sharp, sugary rockers and sings them beautifully, and Mr. Death Cab For Cutie's production job, full of earthily overdriven guitars immaculately recorded, makes a wall-of-sound from a three-piece. Two extra songs from miscellaneous sessions feel superfluous, but as a four-song EP this is just about perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pentagon Putting America's Defense Last!","review":"James Stevenson does an excellent job of not only showing how the Pentagon is just another government bureaucracy which squanders taxpayers money but also shows how the US Navy deliberately chose to procure an aircraft they knew was inferior mainly because they didn't want the hated US Air Force dictating what aircraft the Navy should fly. Shows the ugly corruption that places interservice rivalry and favored defense contractors ahead of America's security. Every elected official and concerned taxpayer should read this and see the dark underbelly of America's military."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a case for light fighters. This isn't it.","review":"The author argues forcibly for the case of lightweight fighters, and tells the story of the development of the F/A-18 and F/A-18E. His work would be far more convincing if it was not extremely rich in factual errors, misrepresentations of the facts, and twisted logic. Read it because it gives the views of some insiders; but don't trust it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High energy Ella in top form","review":"DVDs featuring Ella Fitzgerald are extremely rare and this is why this DVD is a \\"must buy\\" for all who consider her as the greatest jazz vocalist of all time as I do! All tracks are a nice mixture of classics or standards in either the jazz or pop music genres. While many of the songs feature Ella with the fabulous Basie band, some are with her usual trio comprising Paul Smith on piano, Mickey Roker on drums and Keeter Betts on bass.Ella is in top form throughout the performance particularly in \\"Please Dont'Talk About me When I'm Gone\\", \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" and the show stopping \\"B&E; (Basella)/Tisket A-tasket\\" all of which highlights her incomparable 'scat' vocalizing. The latter has Ella 'scatting' duets first with a trumpeter and then a trombonist. While this DVD focuses on Ella, one has to mention the outstanding performances by Count Basie on piano and his swinging band.I also enjoyed Nat hentoff's introduction and sleeve notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minolta Dimage 7Hi waste of money","review":"I purchased my Minolta two years ago.

The story itself was nothing extraordinary, but it embodied the lovely sensitivity of French cinema. I liked it because it gave me a glance of French or European film industry that was so different from the glittery Hollywood. The actress in the film was portrayed as a real, sensible and normal person. I also realized after watching the film that the main characters were a real life couple and the husband was the director, which added another interesting layer to it. They did not even change their names in the film! I really liked the human qualities of this kind of production in comparison to the manufactured qualities of many commercial films. I felt that it was a collaboration of a group of young people whom were working with a modest budget.

I guess that's the whole point. However the majority of the kitchens in this book require custom cabinetry. If you can do that yourself, you're in luck and this book is for you. However if you do not have a $30k budget for cabinetry to store your food and dishes then this book will do little to help you design your kitchen. The kitchens shown are mostly huge with a few exceptions and even the exceptions are using tens of thousands of dollars of custom cabinetry. If all you need are ideas of what is possible, browse through this book in a library or bookstore. If you need real life examples of what can be done with a small to medium size kitchen on the same size budget, forget this book. It won't help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable & durable","review":"I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter, and of course she loves it. She will be wearing it to ballet class next week.

Would totally recommend to any toddler girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"This product ran small but is so cheap its okay. I mean my daughter is only two, no need to spend so much on something she will wear once. I got it for holloween and the wings are limp. They do not puff out like the picture shows.

After 2 weeks, I woundered where they were. Even though Collegiate Pacific states on their Amazon ad that they ship USPS, they shipped the bases to my P.O. box via UPS! What a mess. There is no phone number to call. When I emailed them, they told me they had to wait until the bases were returned to resend them USPS. After another week, I contacted them again just to find-out that they DO NOT ship USPS, even though their website still gives the option of USPS vs. UPS. So, I canceled my order, and they Could Not Have Cared Less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Those songs are NOT Vallenato","review":"Sorry to say this but the only vallenato I know is played in Colombia.

I had to cut a big hole in my backdoor and sandwich the penetration with the plastic frame. It actually installed pretty easily.Flash forward 5 years: The flap has been replaced twice. The in/out traffic eventually tears away the plastic from the frame. It's easy to replace, but irritating. Also the insert that is used to seal off the door (for when you don't want your pup to leave the house) is mangled to shreds. It is cardboard so if you use it regularly, the corners start to fray and in-climate weather will warp the face.Not good for a long-term solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW never thought amazon will sell a bad product...","review":"First off this is my first review of hundreds of orders I made with amazon in my years.

I had planned to create a gift basket for my grandson's school auction/fund raiser. I took them out of the package and could hardly believe what I was seeing.

Therefore, I can only imagine how a family of four would react to towels remaining wet/moist throughout the day after each hand washing cycle.Avoid these towels at all cost.

They are very plush, but almost right after I bought them they started to fray along the edges. I have had to re-stitch the two large bath ones several times. It's as if they didn't allow enough fabric tucked underneath the topstitching. The ones I bought from Walmart (Pike Street didn't have the complementary color for my bathroom that I wanted), while not nearly as plush, have held up fine, even two years later.

It's not a deal breaker but they and the hand towels fold different than the rest of my linens and make my stack inside my closet unstable (yeah, I know, a domestic crisis, right?).

After washing a noticeable defect in the weave about 5\\" long showed up on one of the bath towels. For $ 20.00 not worth the headache of returning them.

THEN I decided to order a second set in Taupe (this listing) when I saw them on black Friday sale. I'm pretty disappointed with this set. First time through the wash (I have a front loading top of the line washer/dryer) a few of the towels came out with the sides totally frayed off.

Unfortunately the company must have changed something in the manufacturing process because I purchased two sets of these towels and washed them in cold water on the gentle cycle and dried on low to get any lint out and the edges are coming undone. There is thread hanging off all but one of the six piece set. In addition, after two washes they still leave lint all over me after drying and tend to just push the water around. Save your money and buy a nice Ralph Lauren towel on sale at Macy's - they are only $10, last forever, retain their color, and dry wonderfully.

I will pay more attention to reviews next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disappointed after first wash","review":"I read all the reviews about shreds, figured, oh, it's a cheap price, maybe it'll work out, right? Wrong. I washed these immediately upon receipt, and in the first wash, one hand towel is already shredding. A couple of other towels have a thread here and there coming off, but maybe those will be ok? The shredded one, obviously won't. I am still optimistic that the remaining towels of the set will be ok, but the other reviews on here tell me that I should not get my hopes up. Well, meanwhile they are the softest towels that I own. I bought the brick towels, if that matters to anyone.UPDATE 5/23/2012: All of the towels have pretty much shredded. I want to like the towels but when you have it falling apart and snagging on you as you use them, it makes them unusuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"For under $20 that's what these are worth.

The problem is the edging on one bath towel already started shredding the first time I washed them. Second time they were washed more towels started to shred and of course the first got worse. The edges get very ragged looking after a while.I was very unhappy about what I consider a large defect in a new product after seeing a lot of 4-5 ratings. Funnily enough after re-reading some of those people mentioned this defect.If you don't care about the shredded side edging and are looking for something cheap, absorbent and soft go ahead and buy these for cheap towels.

I have been using these towels since July (it is October) very lightly. First day I got it there was red stuff falling off throughout my room, and I didn't mind it because it was new so then I had washed it a few times and now its falling apart. Threads are coming off, covered my room in red thread balls, turned my other towels red, when I use this in the shower I come out covered red.Please look for better towels even it is $5-10 more expensive. I gave it 2 stars because it's cheap and you get a lot of junk.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft but certainly not durable","review":"The towels certainly are soft, but they are thin and are extremely frayed after ONE wash. Also...as another mentioned, they do not absorb water very well. That may change with additional washing...but I'm afraid the towel might disintegrate given the results after the first wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Towels","review":"The first set of towels that Amazon sent completely shredded on the edges during the FIRST washing! I wrote an email and Amazon replaced the set. Well maybe I got a bad set the first time, I thought, give them another try. The second set didn't start shredding until the SECOND washing. I actually felt guilty about returning the second set and thought maybe I would just use them for the dog, but in addition to shredded edges, they are not absorbant! So these are going back too. Maybe this brand used to be good, but my experience with two sets (taupe) was terrible. And really, even though the price was good, these towels are so bad that they are not worth it. You could get much better towels at Target for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft but not absorbant","review":"My wife and I really like Egyptian cotton towels. We were excited by Amazon's sale and took a chance. These towels are very soft. A huge plus! Unfortunately they lack absorbency qualities. The towel feels cold as we dry off and the water does not feel like it is being absorbed. Wet and cold is not a good feeling in the morning! We do not use dryer sheets or any type of detergent product that would coat the towels. As for pricing, we did NOT get a super saver discount as promised in Amazon's advertising but were attracted to the initial sale price. All in all, we will not buy this towel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost color immediately!","review":"These are beautiful, soft towels at a great price. Unfortunately, they lost color in splotches immediately after being used a few times. I washed the towels in warm water with Cheer detergent, and the pale green color had a tinge of orange in places. I have never had this problem with other towels. I was planning to use these as special towels for the guest bathroom, but now they will \\"hide\\" in our bathroom, since they are still wonderfully absorbent and nice to touch, but they look awful. I was quite disappointed, but at least they were cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Towels","review":"They faded which didn't really bother me. What DID bother me is that it's impossible to wash out the smell of the dye.

The problem is that they aren't very absorbant. They just don't dry my body like other towels do. I thought maybe that would change after a few washings, but no such luck. Theyv'e been through six washings now and still no improvement.I'm disappointed. I bought four sets but now I find myself reaching for old towels from the back of the linen closet.Also, be careful washing them. The colors will definitely run in the first two or three washings. Don't wash with other towels (as I did). The old towels will come out the color of your new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes but disappointed","review":"I bought the blue color of these towels for our guest bathroom. They would not be used regularly and I thought that I had gotten a great deal. After the first washing, as per the washing instructions, the edges were shredded. I also noticed that there are orange and white splotches on the towels and now attempt to creatively hide all the damage. These are not very soft either, so don't be fooled by the description. I love Amazon but regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad towel","review":"It's like wiping off with polyester instead of cotton. The water stays on the surface and feels really cold. The Bianca towels are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"EH...","review":"They're ok. I can't say I was impressed. The price, of course, was great, but these towels certainly are not worth the quoted regular price of $130. They had a lot of loose threads and are not particularly absorbant. They feel nice, but you can buy better quality towels at any housewares store that do not cost $130 for a set. I would say they are probably worth their sale price, clearly it is worth it for a 6 towel set, but they are a fairly low quality towel, so don't think you are getting a great deal. I would suggest going to a discount housewares store and finding something there if you are looking for a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egyptian Cotton Towels","review":"My husband and I truly enjoy these towels.

Bad mistake, I might as well not be using them when i get out of the shower. As a girl, I need a good absorbent towel to dry my hair and these continue to fail every time. I've washed them a couple times hoping to \\"break them in\\" but to no avail.

Sometimes it takes a dozen or more washes to get Egyptian cotton towels more absorbent. They are nice looking. Too bad the quality sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Zero Stars Available?!","review":"My wife & I just bought these towels and received them quickly from Amazon. That's the end of the good news right there. We immediately washed them. When we went to put them in the dryer we noticed all the edges had frayed and the stitching had come undone... in ONE wash!

DO NOT BUY THESE TOWELS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst towels ever purchased","review":"These towels when first used are like using wax paper.

I purchased 2 sets of these towels since they seemed to be a good price. They looked nice when they arrived - thick and cushy and they come in a variety of popular colors. I washed them 1 time before using and they shed so much that my dryter filter was clogged about 2 inches thick! Several of the towels now had threadbare spots and the edges of several others were so shredded that they were separating into strings and totally coming away from the body of the towels. I am returning these and will never purchase a Pike Street product again. Walmart towels are so much better than these it's hard to believe. I am sure that if Amazon was aware of the quality of these towels they would not allow them to be sold on their site, giving Amazon a bad reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Towels","review":"Not sure how absorbent they are as they have not been tested yet.

These reviews range from \\"best towels I've ever bought\\" and \\"large, soft, and luxurious\\" to descriptions that almost defy possibility they're so bad.

Fine for me, but my girlfriend will complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"the good news is: Amazon makes returns easy!","review":"The bad news is: this product is absolute junk. When these came up on a Gold Box deal last month, I read all the reviews and decided that since I wanted to buy white towels, it didn't matter about the fading colors and funky dye smells. The towels arrived and looked nice...I washed them before use, of course, and one of the bath towels fell apart! Warm wash, normal cycle...and the hem came completely unravelled, and a long \\"run\\" showed up down the middle of the towel.

You wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Fibers","review":"Just two points.. the fibers come out and not as absorbent.

Hems on two of the four towels came undone. By second washing all had begun to turn ragged.

Obviously, you can't use bleach either, though it's not clear why you'd want to. (If you use them long enough, the discolorations even out, giving a totally different solid color - but sometimes it's cool too.) The towels are reasonably soft, not especially absorbent, but they work well enough. Can't speak to durability, but given they're not color-fast, they are not first-line towels for me. Given the competitive price and comforting feel (if not amazing drying efficacy), they are a plausible choice for the guest bath, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing I bought these on sale","review":"I'm happy I bought these on sale because after one washing the wash cloths started fraying at the seams.

After 20 washes in hot water they are marginally better, but beware, something is being used on the fibers to make the towels soft and it is preventing the cotton from holding the moisture.I would suggest that these make great show pieces in a guest bathroom that never get used, but I wouldn't want my guests to feel like they couldn't get dry after bathing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft towels, but I'm finding bits & pieces everywhere","review":"I bought these towels in brick (red) for my guest bathroom. Out of the package they were soft and beautiful. I did a first washing before my guests arrived and found that although the towels didn't bleed, there was a lot of red lint in my washer and dryer filters. This didn't bother me because a lot of times towels need a first washing to get them ready for use. When my guests used them, they got red lint all over the shower, their bodies and the bathroom rugs. I washed these towels several times while my guests were here and the towels still shed. My guests are gone and I'm still picking up red lint all over the house because people tracked it in from the bathroom. One of the hand towels is already raveling at the side. I bought these towels because of the price and, as my husband says, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"Received a set of the towels- liked how they looked.

I am retuning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unraveling","review":"Soft towels, bright colors. But, after the first wash more than one of them started unraveling at the edges, and I have towel-lint coming off, even after 5 washes or so. Low price, but not worth it really... Color stayed good, but I can't use these as guest towels, as intended. So price being low doesn't really help - I have to go buy another set that doesn't shred at the edges or shed lint."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 of 12 towels frayed 1 to 6 inches on first washing! Rating=0","review":"Towels were washed before using, 4 of each of the 3 sizes. On 3 towels of each size, there was a serious fraying on one side of each towel, most about 1 inch long, but one a full 6 inches! Instead of cloth, there are only strings! I could not believe it. They look worse than my inexpensive towels which have been washed scores of times over 5 or more years. I hope to be able to return them. They are nearly worthless. I am not known for having high quality towels, but I would not let guests even see them.

Little did I know, they wouldn't even make it out of the dryer in one piece. The hand towels were completely frayed on one side and the rest of the towels were starting to fray. It's so sad that we didn't even get to use any of these and they are already trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, soft, absorbent and covered with pills!","review":"Probably one of the nicest towel sets I've ever purchased in terms of texture, color and absorbancy. But what a disaster when it comes to shedding! I washed the towel set alone the first time and went to use it and it was covered with pills. Not hard nubs but lightweight, clingy and annoying. They were everywhere. So, if you've the patience to deal with the lint coverage, get these towels. If not, I recommend you find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. After she opened the gift, I offered to wash the towel sets for her before she returned home, and when they came out of the dryer, the edges were all fraying.

I find myself with two sets of towels that do not even qualify as rags."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I purchased these, expecting fluffy towels at an affordable price. What I got, were towels that became frayed around the edges after 1 wash, and constant shedding. Every time I used them, washed them, etc., little bits of fabric came off.

A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap is as cheap does","review":"Not crazy about these towels, I liked the price, but was expecting thicker towels than this.

I was quite pleased with the first two towel sets (which I purchased over the last couple of years), but this set is not of the same quality. Possibly, I just received a \\"bad set\\", but many of the edge seams came undone after just a couple of washes! The older towels are still holding up very well, but not this set. I can't explain the difference. I only hope this is not a trend for this brand. Personally, I can no longer recommend these towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rags","review":"These towels did not hold up to use. When I got them, they had frayed ends.

I bought two sets, one of which I used and disliked very much but decided to keep as a guest bathroom set. I am returning the other set. When I opened the package they were already falling apart, ie the threads were coming undone but it felt soft so I thought I'd give it a try and see what they'd look like after I washed them. The thread situation was even worse, non the less I tried to use them and all I can say is that if you like still being wet after a shower then these are the towels for you. The dont soak up any water. Yes they are very soft, but are not functional as towels. I am very let down that amazon.com would sell these as their own product."},{"rating":"1","title":"These towels bleed color in every wash cycle","review":"I purchased 3 sets of these towels approximately 3 months ago, and every single piece has bled a significant amount of its color.

However, now I see that the negative reviews were the most accurate.After one normal fabric-softener-free washing, these towels were already unraveling. Not only that, but they are the least absorbent towels I've ever used. They are super soft, which is nice, but they literally do not absorb. I usually leave my long hair wrapped in the towel for a few minutes while I moisturize, etc. With my usual towel, it's damp when I remove the towel. With this towel, when I removed the towel after 5-10 minutes, my hair was still soaking/dripping wet.I honestly would not even feel good using these as guest towels. Now I'm thinking about giving them to Goodwill, because it seems like a shame to throw them out after 1 (or 0) uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pike Street towels","review":"This set of towels was not the quality that I expect from Amazon. I purchased a blue set and a brown set. For whatever reason, the brown set may have been slightly better, but that's not saying much. I washed and dried them before monogramming and already, there were spots along the towel edges that were starting to become unraveled. Since these were a gift, I reinforced the stitching with a blanket stitch along all of the towel and hand towel edges to prolong the life of the product. But this is something a buyer should not have to do with a new product.I will not purchase any other Pike Street products."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst towels ever","review":"bad quality.

Sure they're soft and cozy when they're dry but they don't suck up water off of your skin, nor do they suck water out of your hair. They leave a short haired miniature pinscher almost wet even after 5 minutes of non stop rubbing. As for your skin, you'd be better off drying off using a bucket and a sponge or a water hose.Buy them to wrap up in on a cold night but only after you run them thru the dryer a dozen times to get the god awful amount of fuzz out of them.TERRIBLE TOWELS and I didn't even pay full price for them, I won them on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Towels fell apart with first wash","review":"This is a first at Amazon.

Just now, while trying to dry my hair, water actually rolled down my face. They are soft, but do not take up water as I think a towel should do. The wash cloth is much the same way. And, when placed on the towel rack to dry, they take forever. In fact, when I took them out of the box, I immediately washed them, and it took forever to get them dry enough to take out of the dryer. I've never seen material like these towels. I bought three sets and can't really use them unless by some miracle they begin to absorb better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap- you get what you pay for!","review":"The fabric is of moderate quality, but the fabrication is horrible!

I opened the lint trap and it was about 1/2 inch of lint. That evening, I used the towel to dry my face and there bits of towel fuzz on my face. I washed and dried them AGAIN.

After using the wash cloth and bath towel one time each began unraveling on one side. The towels appeared very thin upon arrival until I laundered them which \\"plumped\\" them up and that was a pleasant surprise but when drying myself off they weren't absorbent, it felt like the water was being pushed off me.

In addition to being soft and coming in a large array of fashion colors, they seem to have been treated with a very effective water retardant. Marvel in wonder as they leave puddles completely undisturbed! Watch in awe as water actually beads up on the fibers! Pass them over your wet body and you would almost believe you just stepped fresh from the tub if not for the fine coat of lint covering your still-wet skin, your still-wet hair and your formerly clean bathroom floor. I highly recommend these towels as show pieces in your for-display-only bathroom or as extra padding for your garbage. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shred after first wash","review":"The first time we washed these towels, they shredded on all sides.

Cotton 725-gram 6pc Towel Set","review":"Bought set (Bluestone color) at 19.99 figured, can't be all that bad (after reading reviews.) Well, wrong again. I didn't expect a luxurious set, half-way decent would be good. Just rec'd it, washed the set by itself because experience has been that new towels usually shed & throw a lot of lint around especially the first wash. Dried it on medium so it wouldn't be shrink dried :-), pulled it out of the dryer. Lot of loose cotton on towels. Both bath towels are unraveling on one side -- selvage edge not sewn well or poor quality threads or ? Poor quality period. Too much trouble to return them, but I will not buy another product mfg by Pike Street again. I'll use the hand & wash towels. And by the way, this is my first fully negative review of any product.

I've never regretted an Amazon purchase more! I washed them the day they came in the mail (following the directions on the packaging), and they looked and felt great when they came out of the dryer. However, the taupe towels were covered in orange splotches and the blue ones in white splotches before they even went in the washer for the second time! What the heck?! As a woman I use a wide array of cleansers and lotions, but nothing was ever applied directly to the towel, and I've never had this \\"staining\\" problem with any of my other towels before!

That is just poor quality, either the towel is already unraveleing or the manufacturer did not cut off any stray strings. The towel is extremely thin. My husband and I decided not to use the towels ourselves and I wanted to return them but it would have cost me $15 to return them. I did not want to pay $15 for something I do not have.

I will buy Pike Street sheets in the future, but I will never buy any more of their towels. Because of the pulled threads on the towels, I can't even put them in the guest bathroom to just look nice--because they don't.

But, don't let their appearance fool you...or the positive ratings. They do not absorb the water. Instead, you dry yourself with a \\"wet\\" towel. The water droplets stay on the fabric, as though there is something in the dye or cotton that repels water. They are a great buy if you only intend to hang them in a spare bathroom for appearance.

Unfortunately, when I received these towels, the quality does not match the average rating (in my not so humble opinion).Right out of the package (and after the first washing), there are lots of loose threads - the towel looks \\"sloppy.\\"As many other reviewers have written, these towels do not do what a towel is supposed to do. The DO NOT absorb water as you're trying to dry off after a bath or shower. As you wipe yourself dry, the towels feel cold & wet, rather than leaving you warm & dry. I'm sorry, but in terms of performance, these towels are very poor when compared with years-old, ratty cotton towels with holes in them. At east the ratty towels leave you warm & dry after a shower.Very disappointing - not at all recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rags","review":"As is my custom, I did a short wash of these towels as soon as they arrived.

In fact, I have shop rags which are of a much better quality than these towels. My advice, avoid these towels. Spend a little more money for a better quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not absorbent towels","review":"These towels have absolutely no absorbancy. I have never had this problem before with any towel. They are beautiful looking, but are not towels!

They came packaged well, and we washed them (without softener) before using them. Upon their first use they just moved the water around, they didn't absorb anything. So we washed them and tried them again, and got the same results. They don't seem to dry us at all, and even after the first wash they left little red fibers all over us.Check out my other reviews, I don't tend to give bad reviews, but this was a terrible purchase, no wonder they were listed on the Deal of the Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Very Poor","review":"Not even worth the sale price of $30!

Yes, it doesn't sound very similar to Rick's early solos, but hey, the 70th have gone!The disk sounds \\"modern\\" and thick with some heavy guitars. However, there are plenty of Risk's signature keyboard's passages to please his old fans. Production and sound quality is also very good. Damian Wilson is resposible for the great vocal parts on the album.Anyway, this is classic/progressive rock album of the year, and the forse is still with Rick, so don't hesitate to buy it! In my opinion, this album is Rick's most solid one sinse 1984!It's pity this work wasn't promoted very well and was unavailable in US as for import only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes On Too Much","review":"I found KINGS AND QUEEN to be long and tedious. I think the film attempts to be too many things at once and its scattered focus is not as avant garde as it is irritating. It would have been a stronger film had it narrowed in on only a few core characters and become deeply introspective. Instead, the length, the melodrama and the would-be comic edge dilute the impact of the overall film even if it is riveting to hear a father posthumously tell a daughter that he couldn't love her. This is at the center of the movie, and more should have been built around this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why French Cinema Rules","review":"This is a brilliant, unusual, tragic, funny, and complex film that delineates characters and family dynamics we've encountered in real life, that I've never seen portrayed on film before.

It would have been much more fun if the instructions were simply written out, and the players control the game, as in Pictionary, Charade, etc. Here, the electronic \\"hosts\\" give instructions in a tiny voice that is drowned out if the players don't stop their talking and listen. And if you miss a word in the instruction (e.g., which color/player is going next), then the game is thrown off.We bought this game as a present for our father, but after we played it as a family for about 15 minutes and ran into the problems mentioned above, we decided that it's not much fun if you can't talk and laugh during a game.

The other couples specifically call us to remind us to bring it (as though we would forget). Each card has two words on it, you select one word from the card and the other team has to guess what the word is. But the game tells you whether you have to draw the topic (like pictionary) or act (like gestures) or speak. But sometimes it tells you that you have to do the other word on the card. It also keeps track of who's turn it is to play and who should guess. It adds up each person's points and tells you who the winner is at the end. It's lot's of fun.

I was excited to find out about this book. And so disappointed after reading it. There was little if any character development - I didn't really care about anybody in the story. The stilted manner in which the dialog was written was silly - were we supposed to believe that this is the way they spoke? And I can't even count the times the author mentioned something in the story and then wrote \\"but I am not going to go into that here\\". How annoying was that? I could say that I couldn't put this down - but in truth I stuck it out to the end hoping that it would get good.

It also fails to recognize the various mental development stages that children go through such as concrete thinking.

In chapter nine the author answers the question, what do you do when your child calls you from jail along these lines: You let him/her know that you support him/her, but you leave everything up to him/her, including paying for the lawyer, exercise your backbone, etc. Correct answer: You ask first, what happened! She makes it appear any child that is arrested is arrested for good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons for Business as well as for Families","review":"A good friend of mine who is, among other things, a psychiatrist and corporate coach, told me that some of the best management advice can be found in books about raising children. It's true! It's a lot of the same issues. In both cases, it's about authority figures that are trying to find the right way to mentor junior versions of themselves. And it's about how we authority figures react when we don't get what we expect. I'm a big believer that very complex issues can be broken down to small, simple actions. Coloroso's book is simple straightforward and very \\"action-able\\". It's clear, concise and a great read; I highly recommend it for managers and for parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids are Worth It is a must-read for all parents!!!","review":"This is an excellent book that I highly recommend for any and all parents or parents-to-be. It is clearly written and helps to shed light on the emotional baggage and negative learned responses that often pass down from generation to generation. The book gives practical techniques and guidelines with examples of how to break the chain of negative parenting, offering thoughtful alternatives that empower children and young people to be who they truly are and express self discipline.All parents should re-read it every 6 months so as not to fall back into destructive family patterns. It is a refreshing look into loving and supportive parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for anyone who Parent's!","review":"This book is by far the best parenting book I've ever read. The author provides concrete examples comparing parenting styles including the \\"jellyfish parent\\" in contrast to the \\"brickwall,\\" ever encouraging parent's to strike that middle of the road or \\"Backbone\\" parent. As a Special Ed teacher who has spent 23 years working with kids with behavioral and emotional disorders, I have come to the realization that so much havoc is wreaked by bad parenting. This book should be part of the package that hospital's provide when they pack you away with your new baby! A godsend for parent's who are determined to do a good job at teaching their children reasonable boundaries!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas!","review":"I bought this book before I was ever pregnant.

My 4 and 3 year olds hit each other significantly less now that I have told them that the rule in this house is \\"we don't hit\\". But boy, it can be seriously exhausting with 2 very stubborn children to carry out her theories. We're carrying on with it because I seriously believe she is right and the children learn to think for themselves - go for it, take the plunge too and learn how to treat your children how you were probably not treated yourself!

Many of the words are netisms and acronyms. Its lack of organization makes finding a particular word difficult.I was expecting words used in car commercials and medication adverts to be defined (words like \\"customer cash\\" and \\"APR\\" that are real doublespeak words), but they were not.This self-purported \\"dictionary\\" is nothing doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain food","review":"Great food to provoke thought.

I found the free Kindle edition to be an easy read and fairly error/typo free.For a brief summary:4 children (the fifth is their baby brother) stumble upon a sand fairy that has the power to grant wishes. They naturally don't really think through their wishes and so all kinds of mayhem, trouble, and sometimes fun comes out of each day.

I couldn't even get it in vey far without getting scraped. When I looked closer I saw that there was some scratchy plastic poking up out of the end. I even tried filing it down but it didn't help.

As another reviewer has said, the symphonic movement is definitely worth hearing (just like it's fun to hear Pictures at an Exhibition on piano as well as orchestrated). The other pieces are fun to hear, but not all that memorable. Sadly, (as a commenter has mentioned) you can only get the symphony by purchasing the entire album.

I would emphasize that the book model the market more from an empirical point of view. The author gives a good description of the GARCH model as well as PCA analysis. Being a fixed income derivatives trading, I find both sections particularly useful for real world trading. The risk modeling section should expand into topics other than VAR such as coherent risk measures which are more useful. The co-integration section is a must for any traders who want to trade mean-reversion or stats arbitrage.Overall, I think that the book covers all basic to intermediate mathematics, econometrics and finance necessary for anyone who wants to model market data. The book explains how to use such model for trading, risk management as well as market data visualization / understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive, lack in depth and poor organization","review":"For a starter, this book does offer a broad spectrum of subjects, volatility/variance measurement, PCAs, Factor Models, Time Series analysis, high frequency data modeling, etc, at the expense of rigor and depth.Desipite the academic pedigree the author enjoys and the educational career she had, the book is rather poorly organized from a pedagogical point of view. She seems to have a tendency to refer to expressions, notions, ideas, data which appear much later than where the reference takes place. This makes first-timers cringe as they go through the chapters as they are laid out. It reads much like some published papers got dumbed down, and bundled together.If you are looking for comprehensive introduction, without the gory details of mathematical mumblejumble, this book might be of help. But it may not be used as a reference book, for its organization and for its lack of rigor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy","review":"Pricing/hedging and risk modelers in banks and in universities are going to find this book really useful.

They recommended it. I knew some of the actors and was familiar with Robinson's work in the comics (some of those books I like and some I didn't). Given I'm a comic reader for 30 years, I figured I'd give it a shot.It is a very dark comedy. The humor comes from the extremes these two collectors will go through to try to latch onto an ultimate collection. The shop owners are very sterotypical extremes of the industry, but any person who has been buying comics for many years will recognize the traits.Robinson also makes a statement on the comic industry as it has gotten into through the 90's and into the new millenium. It also takes shots at some traits of fans.

I kind of wish that there was a bit more stuory in this book but it was a still a good read. i was having some issues with the stories after dark possesion i believe it was because all of a sudden the stories were not sexy they were actually quite vulgar and I really do not feel her stories need to be so vulgar. It is not necessary to bescribe every single thing that happens when they have sex in the stories. to me it kind of takes away from the story.

Unfortunately, Lucian and Jaxon's story is a major disappointment, especially when compared to its great predecessor, Dark Legend. In Legend, Lucian is a complex, even menacing character. In Guardian, he definitely pales but I must give him major brownie points for putting up with Jaxon's whining. The chemistry between Jaxon and Lucian is tepid, the plot is thin and the redundant dialogue quickly grows tiresome. Even the villain is weak. His maniacal behavior isn't adequately explained. This was a great opportunity to have an evil, frightening character which never materialized, and the final confrontation was a major letdown.Feehan usually hits the mark. Dark Guardian definitely needs a transfusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"I would have to say that Dark Gaurdian is definately my favorite so far in the carpathian series.

A true romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many repetitive sex scenes","review":"I had only read one of the Dark Guardian series (Dark Desire) and kind of liked it--it was a good summer read. Since the reviews indicated that Feehan tended to use the same plot device over and over, I read the descriptions about the other books and bought Dark Guardian since it sounded interesting.It was vaguely interesting although I found the part about her stepfather killing everyone she loves over the years a little far fetched. However Ms. Feehan was either unable or unwilling to develop the plot more fully so she added lots of sex scenes between the two leading characters. And I mean a lot. She writes in great detail about them making love, and then afterwards they have a short conversation and then go at it again.

After all she is supposed to have a very independent nature!The other complaint I have about this book is the use of the word 'honey'Come on, Lucian is 2000yrs old, with Old World manners. So, wouldn't he use terms of endearment he learnt eons ago before he lost all emotion, and since his speech tends to reflect this, instead of the modern day endearments?Except for those 2 objections, I enjoyed the book and found I couldn't put it down, till I reached the end.

This is not Helmut after he embarked on his Classics venture. This is the young Lotti. Perhaps still inexperienced but still an amazing, fun singer. The tracks are bright, melodic and catchy. As you may or may not know, Helmut Lotti began his career after being runner-up in a music sound show, impersonating Elvis. He had copied Elvis's singing style since he was five years old and does sound remarkably like him. This is Helmut when he was a Flemish pop star, and a very successful Flemish pop star at that. I love all Helmut's work, and in my opinion he is one of the most versatile cross-over artists of our time. So if you want to take a trip back in time to the beginnings of the Lotti phenomenon, than this cd offers a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspenseful, intelligent, provocative mystery.","review":"NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN involves unpleasant goings-on in Cambridge (England), beautiful sunny summer days on the river, a breathtaking description of Piccadilly Circus, and a chance to know more about private investigator Laura Principal. Michelle Spring's language is vivid, sensuous, and suspenseful, and it really brought the city of Cambridge to life. Laura Principal is a wonderfully complex character, and I look forward to reading more about her. By the way, this is fourth in the series; I've not read the first two, but I do recommend the third, STANDING IN THE SHADOWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I'm not much of a mystery, but was taking a class on the mystery novel at school and this was one of the books assigned. Maybe it's me, but it's always seemed to me that the detective should be responsible for the resolution of the case. Not here. Everything turns out nicely without the detective actually having solved the case. Furthermore, Spring's prose didn't do much for me. Her paratactic sentences felt forced, rather than displaying natural speech rhythms.Not a satisfying read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unbelievable","review":"Many mysteries depend to a certain extent on coincidence, but this one seems to do so because it's too lazy to do anything else. There is little tension, little excitement, little reason to care about any of the people in the book. The main character muses on this and that as she makes her way around Cambridge, but her observations seem shallow and obvious. The one piece of real history that is discussed touches tangentially on the plot but without adding any depth. Motivations for various actions are plopped onto the page, stirred for a bit, and then left half baked.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-written, totally lacking in suspense","review":"This book was SUCH a disappointment to me. I couldn't wait to finish it, and when I did I had to groan out loud. There is NO mystery here - just a stupid, boring story where the author spends endless, mind-numbing pages describing completely non-sensical \\"tidbits\\" about the heroine. Why must I read for 2 paragraphs about a bike ride she took as a child, or why she hates squirrels, or how her uncle kissed her? I skipped entire pages of this book because they were nothing but bizarre descriptions of things that were COMPLETELY irrelevant to the story. And, the story was so bad, it didn't make up for it.

The only movies it will pay are AMV, which is some obscure format that hardly anyone knows about. The manual says there is an AMV converter to play your movies on it but it is not on the CD. The AMV converter I downloaded for free does not format the video correctly, therefore, the video just stops playing or the sound is garbled. MP3 sound is noisy and unclear. They tried to do too much with this little player and none of it works well. The only good thing I can say is that it is inexpensive.

This book is obviously written a few years back since two of the stories in the book talk about kids smoking, but the storyline still keeps them reading.

Each story has a mystery to solve and then at the back of the book it shows why Encyclopedia Brown came to the conclusion he did. We had a great time reading them all together.I would recommend this series to anyone who has children 2nd-5th grade level.

Williams has mixed Taoism, I-Ching and Buddhism with a twist of Zen in all of his thoughts in this book. The Energi he talks about it is Ch'i, the original breathe of the universe. He talks about the Receptive and Creative in terms of heaven and earth, which are I Ching trigrams.

There is no consistensy of quality within the season compared to it's predecessors and it feels like there is little chance it can revive itself (pardon the pun) after such a dismal final episode.

If you are a big fan of the show then I would definitely buy this season too.. The one thing I did not like about this season was Meredith at the end.

And Cristina is so hard to look at, how can such an unattractive woman being on a popular show. I think Izzy is a good actress...but her relationship with the patient and stealing an organ...and the hospital and friends understanding her behavior...bad, bad bad.

Unfortunately, while the writers were crafting these superb episodes, they apparently decided to wait to the last minute to write practically the rest of the season.Story arcs seem to drag on forever, like someone realized they needed nine episodes and decided to pad out three. Also, it always seems that with a large cast, you're always wanting the focus to be on certain characters and all that happens is that the focus is on the other ones. Sometimes Christina's mind games with Burke could get to be a little too much and all the time I'm wondering \\"What about everyone else?\\"And don't even get me started on the \\"finding a new chief\\" plot.

Intelligent dialog, witty storylines, interesting characters - all of this got ruined in season three.Instead of interactions between humans we get near death experience, ghosts and lots of gore. For me personally, one of the show's strengths used to be its concentration on individual characters - in season three I was treated to a boat disaster claiming tons of casualties.. More and bigger is not always better. After that came Gizzie..I hope the show is going to return to its former self in season four, as its creator recently promised in one of interviews. Until I am sure it is so, season three DVD box is going to stay in Amazon's warehouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful, the box is NOT digipack anymore","review":"My box arrived broken.

For the most part, all it contains is a bunch of detailed plot information (yes Virginia, including key plot twists and endings) and very little information as to if the movies were any good! Yes, he has some special lists (\\"movies that rip\\"), but just not enough. I wanted this book as a reference to all of the HK movies out there, so I could see what was good before plunking down my cash on them - after reading about a few movies, I felt I no longer needed to buy them because I had already seen them. There are much better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless guide","review":"This has got to be the most useless movie guide on the planet. Basically, all it is a bunch of plot synopses of HK movies. They are not reviews, just summaries of all the plots, BEGINNING TO END. Half of the them don't even tell you if they are good or not! What on earth could possibly be the use for this? If I haven't seen the movie, I don't want to know EVERY SINGLE THING that happens in it before I see it. And if I have seen it, just reading the plot over is pretty useless too. Basically, the authors watched a ton of HK movies and decided that they should get paid for it, so they whipped up a book as fast as they could, without any consideration for how useful it might be, and put it on the market. Make them earn their dough like everyone else. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better on DVD!!!!!","review":"I received this DVD when I got my player and it was the first movie I watched.

And with Bill Paxon - well, you just know there's going to be a lot of hurt and angry looks, and a lot of running around, and no character development.

The action and special effects are spectacular and the acting and character development are great. From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. This isn't a documentary, so there are plenty of scenes presented for dramatic effect. That's ok by me. This is a fun, intense, emotional movie full of everything a disaster movie needs. Right up there with The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, Twister will keep you in your seat, following every chase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mighty Bag of Duh","review":"Just to prepare anyone who might accidentally watch this: roughly 50% of the dialogue consists of the word \\"hurry\\" or the phrase \\"come on\\", combined in all their possible permutations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one star is for the tornado","review":"It would've gotten two stars if it had killed Helen Hunt and Bill Paxon when it had the chance. Look, the gist of this movie is that some intern in an effects studio was screwing around and created a very tornado-like image. Next thing you know, we have a movie. I sat through this train wreck of a film until I just couldn't stand it anymore. The acting is like an off night at a middle school production of \\"Oklahoma\\".

You wanna' see spectacular, get Blade Runner special edition in Blue Ray...OMG...now that's something to see and WORTH!!!!! my dollars. I've yet to see anything made more than ten years ago come even close to that title. Twister is one of my all time favs that can be watched at least twice a year. I may get this in BR; but, that's an exception. As far as I'm concerned, the movie industry is only porting most of their products in to BR, without much concern about quality, to get more money in their pocket, knowing full well that the end result could be much...much better if they took the time to remaster each and EVERY title to maximize the end result. For what they are charging we fans, this should be standard practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the intelligence","review":"Another lousy summer flick, with lots of special effects and no script. Deeply offensive, and even plagiaristic. The movie steals elements from a National Geographic special about tornadoes. There is one scene in which the good guys vilify the bad guy (we know he is the villain because he drives a black shiny van -- so much for character development) because he sold out for money. He has left the true faith of tornado chasing and works for a big company for lots of money. Think about that. A film produced by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay by Michael Crichton, that includes the most blatant example of Pepsi product-placement yet seen, explicitly condemns people who do things for money. Is this Self-Flagellating Guilt, or Sheer Hypocrisy? Three guesses, and the first two don't count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie on Earth","review":"Bad acting, bad script, and such an unrealistic concept that I can't believe anyone would like it.

Will Smith and Jeff Goldbloom make a super team. \\"Independence Day\\" keeps you glued to you seat even if you have seen it several times.

The story is great, acting is good, and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best. The force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would love to go on a Tornado hunt. The special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie. I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars.

Still, I think it's the best tornado movie to date.....but do we really need one? Too bad the technology doesn't exist to more accurately predict the path of a tornado. I can remember, growing up in Kansas, how we all piled into the family car to escape what we knew was certain death, only to wonder which way to go.BD music is very good and exceedingly ominus when played in a decent home theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twister","review":"I am a disaster movie lover and this is one of the best. I lived in the tornado belt growing up and this movie gives a good depiction of tornados, the fear, the fascination, the anger, the losses and the wonder. Helen Hunt is a very good actor, her protrayal of a women who lost her dad to tornados shows both the child's determination and woman's anger. I especially enjoyed the financee' of Helen's ex. Her part was priceless and she played it perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BIG LIE","review":"Well, it's a nice wide-screen version but my DVD has NO behind the scenes documentary, NO audio commentary, and NO music video. Well, I don't careabout the video but I bought the thing for the commentary and it isn't there. This disc is mis-packaged. Ofcourse it's impossible to even contact Warner Bros. about it.

This plotless wonder is definetly in the running for worst film ever...What sort of underdeveloped troglodite thinks that watching a cg tornado for two hours is enough premise for a feature film? Did I mention that this film has no plot to speak of? Some tacked on failed romance between two 2 dimensional characters (ironic in a film that exits for its 3d elements.. ha) does not constitute a plot...Now that CG has advanced far beyond what was possible at the time of making, this film's always tenuous hold to the world of the living is irreparably broken - so down into the abyss of oblivion it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Nature Flick","review":"Twister is a film that relies mainly on special effects than plot. The usually good Michael Crichton seemed to mess somewhere along the way, adding to many stupid subplots. The special effects in this movie are great, but the stale acting is horrible and you just wish this movie would end. I thought Dante's Peak was a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so transfer to Blu-Ray","review":"Having waited eagerly for this to be released on Blu-ray, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of the transfer. Not only is the Blu-ray not particularly crisp compared to the better transfers such as, say, Road Warrior, I established by A/B-ing the Blu-ray and previous non-HD version in my Sony PS3 that the Blu-ray is actually softer looking in some respects than the previous version. So you might save your money and just stick with the version you probably already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This mocie was great...It had action and special effects thru the whole thing not just parts of it.

I think this movie is a must get for anyone who likes disaster movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Blu-Ray","review":"Lets see, where do I start? Color banding, poor contrast, heavy film grain, soft focus and a lackluster True HD soundtrack. Warner Brothers should have never put this out like this. I remember the original SD DVD as looking pretty darn good. Not the usual quality we expect from Warner Bros. I'm thinking they are in a hurry to rush this stuff out so keep an eye on reviews before buying. What irritates me is that this Blu-Ray release received decent reviews from trusted sources on the internet. I don't see how they could have possibly missed these serious flaws. After reading some of these reviews here, I see the consumers obviously have not missed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Chose this rating because it is one of my all time favorite movies.

TWISTER was about as silly and corny as my joke. Great effects, but by time they had the tractor-trailer caught up in the tornado, they may as well have thrown in Yankee Stadium. The dopey romance (Duh, will they get back together? Duh, I dunno.) interrupts the tension that may have been able to build.

Stupid characters, junk plot, moronic dialogue, I really couldn't wait for it to end. I got dragged to see it, and I just remember, is this the best film that they can make? I remember Philip Seymour Hoffman was in this, and I wanted to belt his character with a shovel (or equally heavy instrument). All of the stormchasers are kinda idiotic, and if these people were real, they would probably be killed. The performances simply consist of Bill Paxton and crew getting debris thrown at them for 2 hours. People scream a lot in the film, too. It's just wretched.

This movie is simply pathetic - save for the \\"flying cow\\" scene, there isn't even anything to laugh at.Total rubbish.

Whoever says the plot is great, stop and think: was there a plot? It played out like a soap opera. The interplay between the characters is stupid treacle, the \\"script\\" was probably written on the back of a napkin. They finally get the DOROTHY up in the tornado, becuase jeez, I didn't see that one coming. And the bad guys got what they deserved- death. Come on, they're doing it to earn a living instead for the \\"love\\" of weather. Watch it for the effects, like you watch Jerry Springer for the fights. Next time there's a thunderstorm, talk to someone while standing out in the rain and you can make a sequel....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth only to watch the visual effects...","review":"This movie a couple of years ago was the first one that set the path for BIG NATURE CATASTROPHY movies with DARN EXPENSIVE special effects and MINIMAL common sense and TEPID actor performances. The visual effects send shivers down your spine, but unfortunately they make up only max. 30 minutes of the movie, so meanwhile you can take a nap, because sluggish romance between main characters is not persuasive, but there is nothing else in the movie, besides counting scenes that in real life would have killed our heroes: Well, if you don't know that NOTHING can survive after being crushed into the core of a tornado (yes, even if Ms. Hunt clutches the buttress of a bridge VERY TIGHTLY), you should watch CNN or DISCOVERY channel more often. From the point of view of true-to-life movie, \\"Volcanoe\\" was much better.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twister had great sound and effects-period.","review":"Twister gets a star for the best sound in a movie I have ever heard.

That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I always loved Twister on video but it is incredible on DVD! The sound was wonderful and we only have a stereo TV.

Anyway, I would highly recommend this on DVD if you like action movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the \\"Star Wars\\" of natural disaster films","review":"Like Star Wars, this movie has a simple plot and basic characters, yet has a good message, as shown through the characters played by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. And, like Star Wars, there are awesome special effects, my personal favourite being the whole sequence with the twin tornadoes and the cow. On a different note, this movie also is quite different from other natural disaster films, in that it is neither preachy nor especially violent (Armageddon, Hard Rain). This is definitely a must-see movie, especially if you have surround sound or a good quality stereo television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Out For The Twister !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I admit that some of the story lines are not true when it comes defining some of the events that occur in the movie, since I work with the NWS. But it's NOT a documentary ! It's a movie !....and should be viewed as such. This is a very good movie because no one has been able to put together a movie as this one was with the excellent special effects. Do not watch any other movie that has been copycated on TV movies or cable...none of those even measure up. Although sequels never measure up to the original, I'm looking forward to 'Twister II' eventually coming to theaters in the next few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD DVD TWISTER!!!

Watch a documentary on tornadoes: I assure you, it's a lot more interesting than this garbage film.Other than some brief moments of special effects, this movie has absolutely no creativity or imagination whatsoever. The script and story line formulas are so generic that they were probably taken out of a textbook. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play two white trash tornado chasers engaged in a shouting contest of stupid one-liners such as \\"Now!\\", \\"Let's go!\\", \\"Move!\\", \\"Yeah!\\" to the point you'd actually think you're with a drunken crowd at a football game.As for the suspension of disbelief in this film, the other reviews have already described it ad nauseam. Save your money and don't pay Hollywood to see such garbage: they may eventually produce more good movies worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"There are movies that can be carried by special effects or star power in the absence of good direction/script/SUBSTANCE. Twister wasn't one of them. Star Wars Episode 1 and Final Fantasy at least had great eye candy to distract you from the fact that the movie itself was really weak. Twister had... CG flying dirt. That combined with one of the most obstinately dumb scripts I've seen outside of MST3K adds up to a movie that I'd sooner drink sour milk than see again.Unless Mike/Joel and the 'bots were sitting in the front row."},{"rating":"1","title":"These twisters ...","review":"I had probably forgotten the story line of this movie before reaching the parking lot of the theater where I watched it. What I can still recall are the Hollywood-ized, utterly fake encounters with the \\"tornadoes\\". Absolutely everything about the storms themselves and the science of storm chasing was grossly inaccurate. From the Kenmore ice cube tray hailstorm to the \\"green sky\\" nowhere near an active thunderstorm, to the individual plucking of fence posts (how does wind impinge such an upward force on a paralell-aligned object fixed to the ground?) to the moment-by-moment predictions that the tornado is going to turn left or right, to the chasers riding alongside a tornado in an effort to have intercourse with it, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. Nothing was even close to reality.Tornadoes are a fascinating subject. There are plenty of videos featuring REAL storm chases. Start (and end) your search with those types of videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"the suck zone","review":"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a remake of The Wizard of Oz. Boy what a letdown. Come to think of it I had the same experience watching Zardoz.While watching this movie, it became clear to me that \\"actors\\" are people who have been randomly selected to get in front of a camera and pretend to do things. The characters say things like, \\"these satellite readings have increased in the last ten minutes\\" \\"Keep monitoring this pattern\\" \\"Ok\\" Then there is a tossing aside of sodas and a melee of excited, riot-like running toward vehicles. Then there is more dialog, like \\"We're not going to be able to intercept!\\" \\"No, we will. Hang on!\\" \\"Are you out of your mind?\\"\\"We gotta get outta here!\\" \\"I know!\\" This last dialog is screamed over the sound of lots of wind. The movie appears to be about a weather phenomenon wherein lots of wind causes a general sucking effect: the script sucks, the acting sucks, the effects even pretty much suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Out Your TV Room After This One","review":"Lord love you, what a lousy film! This must be on the short list of the worst American films of the 1990's; and the more money and special effects they threw at the moronic script the worse it got. Helen Hunt was so great in her TV show \\"Mad About You\\" that the public was apparently ready to cut her a lot of slack, and she used it all in this stinker. A production of Steven Spielberg's dim-witted associates, it's basically \\"Jaws,\\" only with a tornado instead of a shark. Not a single believable scene, word of dialogue, or point of contact with the real world of meteorology. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people will watch anything","review":"Just goes to show how utterly vapid a movie can be. Bunch of tornado chasing mental midgets led by the otherwise marvelous Helen Hunt traipse about the countryside (in chase scenes that smacked of a b-version of \\"Smokey and the Bandit II\\") trying to get themselves killed as often as possible. Sadly, they fail. Scene where Hunt's character's father gets sucked up by a tornado is eerily... no, EXACTLY like the opening scene in The Wizard of Oz.

But how can you be terrified by a villain who is a Jerry Lewis \\"Nutty Professor\\" clone? I suspect that Hyde turned out so unwittingly like a grotesque doofus because of the recent success of \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\"; so some priggish makeup man, left to his own devices, recreated a corrupt image of his taskmaster tutor. I'm sorry, but I am now convinced that the famous novel has never approached success on the Hollywood screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Excellent writing, directing, and especially acting by Spencer Tracy. The story clearly illustrates what can happen when we use chemical means to change our nature from humane to bestial. Although the good Dr. wanted to only temporarily taste what it was like to live uninhibitedly, i.e., allow his lower nature to predominate over his higher, the pleasure he felt in being a brute made him want to repeat the experience until it became habit. After a while, the habit became so ingrained that he became a brute without having to imbibe the chemical, ultimately destroying his sanity and his life.Shows us that there is danger in playing with or stimulating our lower nature, and we would do better to improve our higher nature, not only for our own sake but for the sake of all persons we have to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"March Version is Best; Hopkins Sizzles","review":"Even though this does not have the wit of the James Whale/Universal horror films, it is still a great piece. March is outstanding as J/H--his transformation and sinister/goofy portrayal of an apeish Hyde is great acting. This movie is worth watching if only for Miriam Hopkins. Think of her as a pre-code Cameron Diaz. She certainly seduced me. One of the most disturbing things about this film is the violence of Hyde with respect to the Hopkin's character.

It had a enormous impact in 1953 and is still very respected. In my opinion it's overrated. The book is dull; Kirks style is uninviting. He keeps repeating the same slogans over and over again: religion is the basis of all society, there must be order and the left is demolishing the world. I advise you just to read the introduction with its famous canon of conservative tought. That will do. Kirk is only interested in explaining his own philosophy and that's why every conservative seems the same in this book. Take for example Edmund Burke. No word about the liberal part of his political philosophy or the inconsistency between his common sense epistemology and his christian metaphysics.

I am trying to think of one positive thing I took away from all the time I spent reading this. But my dog leaves better works of art in tightly coiled packages on the front lawn.It is a snooze fest from the time you open the book until you decide, unlike me, to just abandon it.

However, at least it tries to understand 'conservative' reactions to the changes following Vatican II. Further, the 'liberal' side isn't served by its main champion, the insufferable Sister Catherine.Sadly, the changes we see the sisters excitedly adopting in the late 1960's were the end of convents like Sancto Spiritu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brides Of Christ Review","review":"I have serched for this film since i was 12 years old(when i saw it on A&E), im now going on 21.

Gladys was a gifted writer who shared warm personal anecdotes of home and family and friends, making you feel like you're right there with her. She wasn't a pollyanna, however; she wrote about difficult times, too, all with grace and humor. She has always seemed to me to be a gentle soul, someone I would have loved to have known in person - but since that wasn't and isn't possible, her Stillmeadow books are the next best thing. I highly recommend them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very nobel author","review":"Most people these days are reading peskin and schroeder, weinberg, ryder...etc. They are hard. Schwinger's books (3 vols) departs from most treatments; except for some similarity I think with weinberg (who i havent read). Here is what I like: 1) he wrote it to include everything but kept students in mind. 2) he wrote to counteract ''frustration with mathematical ambiguities and physical remoteness...'' 3) it is 'written by sure hands'' I would not recommend this as a first book or you might not see what he's doing; so do sakurai/bjorken and drell/ryder first, then deepen your knowledge on your second pass at the subject. In that context is it superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"I purchased two of these chairs for my living room. Visually, I found them very attractive and they look quite nice in the room. Sitting in them is another story. These chairs are very uncomfortable! First the seat cushion are hard, like concrete. You might as well be sitting on the floor. So I went to the expense of refilling them with new, custom padding. Cost me $50 each. That problem was solved, but the backs of these chairs are too upright. You almost have the feeling of falling forward when sitting in them. So I changed out the back cushions and replaced them with something softer, with a bit more \\"give\\". It helped, but I'm still not thrilled with how the chairs feel.I contacted the seller to see if I could return them (prior to replacing the cushions) and never received a reply. So I'm stuck with them and although they look nice, I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This chair is the worst!!!","review":"So UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!!!

Until she flips over a car in the snow and walks back through the snow, THROUGH THE SNOW (this is tough going, and she's wearing a mink coat and that's the end of that; it's Crawford, no need for police and all), and the besotted Fonda and Dana whats-his-name comfort her. She's torn. I think somewhere in the film she drinks a cup of tea.

She was too old to play Daisy and she knew it, but she saw a chance to give a controlled, sincere performance. She fought for and got two of the hottest male stars of the time, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda. Andrews was just off of LAURA and Fonda had just returned from the War. They both excel in their roles. Of course a key light does follow Joan highlighted her expressive eyes in many scenes, but other than that, the whole production is top drawer. Otto Preminger directs with a sure, professional hand. Ruth Warrick is also a plus as Andrew's neurotic wife. Production values are great. A super scene at The Stork Club, full of atmosphere and famous personalities making cameo appearances. Look for John Garfield seated at the bar sipping a drink! This is a MUST for Crawford fans. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film whether or not film noir","review":"There has been previous discussion whether or not this is truly Film Noir. It is hard to define film noir, so I will not argue whether it is, or is not. But film noir has a certain MOOD. If YOU feel the mood, it is film noir. If YOU don't, it's not. I don't feel the mood of how I personally define film noir in this particular movie. However, I think it's a great film. You can see Daisy struggle with her feelings throughout the entire film. And we see the two men who want her go through their own processes. I recommend it, whether it's film noir or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bland","review":"I read this book with the hope of getting some insight into Astaire's personality and non-showbiz life, but was disappointed. I found nothing other than a Wikipedia-type recreating of the highpoints (and occasional lowpoints) of his career. Perhaps this was not a suprise, given that it was an autobiography. However, some autobiographies provide this material. Try reading Oscar Levant's Memoirs of an Amnesiac for a better read. Hopefully, a more complete book on Astaire's life and career will follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read!","review":"This is a really wonderful auto-biography, by Fred Astaire.

Astaire's style in enjoyable, quick-witted and an overall delight.

Lazer Guided Melodies is one of my all-time favorites. Pure Phase ranks up there very high, as well. Ladies and Gentlemen definitely has its moments of brilliance as does Royal Albert Hall, but this very long awaited and anticipated release is a disappointment. I really want to like it but Spaceman is apparently heading in a direction that I'm not willing to follow. \\"Out of Sight\\" is the only song that resembles the Spiritualized that I love. \\"Stop Your Crying\\" becomes downright annoying. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe it's unfair to expect Spaceman to continue recording more of the same majestic beauty of the earlier years... Thank God for Sigur Ros."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will infect your very soul! (4.5 stars)","review":"Spiritualized make it 2 releases in a row to make it to my annual best of list.Let It Come Down, much like 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen..., has all the beauty and deep passion Mr. Pierce can muster. It floats through the air with rousing gospel choir choruses, thunderous horns and big guitars, all set against his familar dreamy backdrop of orchestration and melodies.The first single, Stop your crying, can almost trick you into thinking this is a far more simple release. But as with all of the Spiritualized catalog, good things come to those who wait... 4 or 5 minutes. Each track is as haunting as the one before, as gripping as a drugged man yearning for a companion.Achingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"Not worth the four year wait. The production is brittle and overwrought, and some of the songs are downright sappy.Jason should have chopped this down to about four songs and released it as an e.p. Stick with Lazer Guided Melodies or Pure Phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Buy or Not To Buy?","review":"Well I still haven't bought this album because I just started listening to Spiritualized after a long time. A long time ago I had decided I disliked them, but my mind is more open now, so I decided to listen to them, and I liked what I heard. Let It Come Down is a good CD, but the question is if It'll end up in the top or bottom of my CD collection. The CDs on here are a mixture of loud and soft, sad and joyful, and all with an element of gospel. I'd like a little more space rock in here, but I still love the album. The lyrics are really good, and I love \\"Stop Your Crying.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko","review":"Simply awful...overblown, pretentious, totally lacking in merit. Combining the worst elements of 70's prog rock (Emerson, Lake and Palmer springs to mind) and 00's digital noodling, this aimless, meandering mess is nothing short of painful to listen to. It's quite apparent that The Man had no idea what to do with all the srings, horns and classical claptrap to which he had access, and the result is a musical train wreck: sound and fury, signifying nothing. After \\"Ladies and Gentlemen...\\", this is a huge disappointment. It has been described as \\"challenging\\", but unlistenable is more like it. After repeated spins, there is not a single track that sticks in my mind; the whole sloppy concoction bogs down under its own weight, like a herd of epileptic elephants in a tar pit. Shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointed fan","review":"I guess my problem is I keep waiting for another effort on par with LAZER GUIDED MELODIES, which is one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately for me, each release of J.Spaceman's gets farther and farther away from my desire. For all the pomp and hype, like the album's warning \\"Prepare to be blown away,\\" you'd think LET IT COME DOWN would be a bit more trancendant. I find it boring, and almost tedious at times. Many of the tracks have an almost childish rhythm to them which quickly grows painful.I think it's sad that the best track on the disc is the SPACEMEN 3 cover of \\"Lord Can You Hear Me?\\"I could probably like this disc more if I forced myself to, but I shouldn't have to. It should just be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unimpressed","review":"Spiritualized was recommended to me as being better than Radiohead. When I listened to Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space I was impressed. However, this album just ruined it for me. I thought I stepped into a christian rock concert and have to admit this album lacks much of what the previous Spiritualized albums had, a good sound. I recommend LAGWFIS, but stay away from this one. They have a long way to go be as good as radiohead, they might be able to open for them i concert though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth checking out","review":"This is the \\"headphones\\" album of the year. Its kind of like listening to ok computer on headphones. I am certainly not compairing the musicianship or song writing of the two albums, only the the production. There is nothing on this album that sounds raw and that is probably both its greatest asset and its worst flaw. It goes too far into the epic and calculated side of rock and that takes off the edge that I was hoping for when I bought the album. I still don't regret the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a trip!","review":"An unexpected turn of events that the Spaceman has taken! He's pretty much flying solo in this effort and it shows. The album is richer and a lot cleaner than his previous efforts. As well, some of the songs are very gospel influenced and might catch some diehard Spiritualized fans by surprise (myself included). But it's still a completely dazzling piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude!","review":"This album sounds like some bad second coming of the Moody Blues. I'm not sure how much further Jason can sink. Maybe Celine Dion or Meat Loaf will appear on his next album. The use of strings and gospel here creates a patchwork of conventional forms used with the kind of overt manipulativeness of the worst kind of commercialism. This isn't a bunch of musical elements working organically together to build up the architecture of songs: it's a bunch of canned cliches laid over dull riffing and juvenile lyrics; it's taking a short cut to affecting music through the cynical use of accepted registers of seriousness (this is \\"orchestral,\\" \\"orchestral\\" equals high art; this is \\"gospel,\\" \\"gospel\\" equals jubilant spiritualism). Attention Jason: you've hit a wall. Or saturation level. Your influences used to be in your music; now they're on the surface with nothing much to speak of beneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Much Polish doesnt improve the sound","review":"Unfortunately my hopes for this album have not risen. DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN and DON'T JUST DO SOMETHING send chills down my spine but everything else sounds too smooth and shiny. I expected something more to happen during WON'T GET TO HEAVEN but it just drags on like many of the other songs.I like the original sparser sounding Spacemen 3 version of LORD CAN YOU HEAR ME too, it captures the sense of alienation better.Plus where is Ray Dickaty's...tenor sax?! You can barely hear it in the mix with the overblown orchestra.The arangements are nowhere near COOL WAVES or SPREAD YOUR WINGS 2 of my favorite songs.To be fair the new B-sides ROCK AND ROLL, GOING DOWN SLOW, and AMAZING GRACE make up for the actual bland album.I definately hope Jason reinvents the sound of the next album when it comes out in 3 years.Oh yeah the live show makes the album unneccessary anyway!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prescription Filled","review":"Once again, Jason delivers the goods. Wonderful string arrangements and great production. Lets not forget the songs either. Encompassing the best of both worlds Spiritualized has to offer - Cinematic, pastoral melodies using gospel choir & brass to blistering rock songs, this record covers the gamut - right where \\"Floating In Space\\" left off. Another great limited edition packaging with a plastic \\"face-mold\\" slip case. Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of sight is always out of mind...","review":"It seems that Jason Pierce has decided that bigger is better on this album. And with few exceptions, this concept works. The use of an orchestra and gospel choir, either together or on separate tracks, along with Pierce's fragile vocals makes for a magical experience.The music is often deceptively simple, and not as repetitive as a first listen would make you believe. For you musicians reading, for example, a song might sound in 3/4, but actually be in 6/8. A soft song with strings might morph or segue into a hard rock ballad. This schizophrenic melding of styles has become the wonder that is Spiritualized.Although this is an excellent album in my eyes, fans of earlier Spiritualized albums (ie \\"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space\\") might find more fault than faith in this album. But I would say that this album is a sure bet and a safe buy.Dream on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaft broke","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my adult brother who just got a new dartboard.

But one year from the time of the repair (only 2 years from purchase), the iron suddenly went hot, burned through a new shirt and started on fire.

On one end the red rubber that holds the bristles looks torn. I am a amazon weekly customer and Prime member. All items i purchase are the right-competitive price. Sorry to say not this one. Looks like something from the \\"99cent\\" store. Unfortunately the packaging was thrown out, I would have returned it. I threw the brush out too.

It's just what I've been looking for, one with stiff bristles without the little balls on the ends of the bristles (they come off eventually.) The 7 rows are perfect for my short hair. Some people have complained about the handle being too short. It could be longer, but it's long enough for me. I don't have a problem with it. The total length of the brush is 8 inches. It arrived much sooner that expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!","review":"I have been buying Denman D-4 brushes since the '80's, and was VERY disappointed when I received this one. I can't tell it from a knock-off brand. The brush is light weight, and the bristles are stiff and hard. Not such a good deal when you don't get what you expect. Since they can no longer be found in stores, I guess I'll have to try another brand.

It was made to look that way, no doubt. However, it is nothing like those old brushes so if that is what you are looking for, don't bother. The bristles are hard as a rock, it rips your hair and hurts your scalp. Ir also has a funky smell - agaain not the smell the old ones had, which is a truly particular smell of that orange rubber base-not that I liked it before but I was expecting the old smell, if any smell at all. Instead I got a funky strong chemical smell. YUK.2 stars is solely because it is a solidly made brush, and most of the problem is my subjective dislike of a brush so hard is is bad for my hair and hurts my scalp, and because I was expecting a specific brush that looks just like this one. Other people might like it, if they need rock hard bristles to gdt through super thick pr sup curly hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle too short, brush hurts","review":"Im sure this is a great brush for some people, but the handle is too short to provide sufficient leverage for Me, and the bristles are so hard it sort of hurts the scalp.

Black handle, orange cushion, white teeth.I received one with a white cushion and black teeth. I didn't feel right in my hand but It's been a while since my last one. Also the white cushion slips easily out of the handle when used. It feels like a knock off.Soon afterward I was at my hairdresser's and for just a few dollars more bought what I wanted. I see the difference now as described on the web page. I'm just annoyed that a picture of what I was actually buying was not presented to alert me to the different brushes available. It's not worth the trouble to send it back since postage to return it will just end up costing me the price of the brush anyway.No hard feelings. I know I should have read it more carefully. I just think it should have been more clear.Love my Denman brush.Margaret Cranor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all :(","review":"Was so disappointed in this brush. It felt like it was pulling my hair out and not getting the tangles out of my hair correctly. I even modified the brush like so many blogs I saw about the denman brush. But still did not like it.

I have pretty thick, long hair to mid back and it goes through just fine with it's dry, but a little harder when it's wet.

It's thin and about mid-back length, and he's very particular about what kind of brushes he uses. In the last few years these have been increasingly difficult to find. You can find a brush that looks very similar at the grocery store, but it's not the same brush at all. The high quality rubber base holds the pins well, and the pins are made from a nice nylon. So this brush doesn't build up static in his hair when he brushes it, and the pins are very smooth, no tugging or scratching.It's worth the extra cost, as other reviewers have said, this is a brush that will last years. When you break it down, it's a better deal to have a brush you really like that you can use for years then to buy a similar brush that will only last for a few months that costs half as much.I'm very happy with this brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a major hair ripper/destroyer for many curlies !!","review":"I'm African American with short-medium length fine textured thick 4a( little penspring curls)type hair.I've tried 2 models of Denmans & they rip out my hair no matter how I use them & I get major split ends. I've read numerous messages on youtube & natural hair message boards telling the same hair ripping story,with some saying they'll never use it again. I've even removed a few rows of teeth & cut off every other tooth. It does make it work better...meaning it just rips out a bit less hair!! I ALWAYS get ripped hair left in the bristles.

This is another example, although not a wide margin. The first was good; this is a little better.Despite being almost two hours which is long for a comedy, this moves very fast. That's the selling point of the movie: it's entertaining. Not only do you get a comedy with a lot of laughs, you get brilliant Western scenery enhanced by the widescreen DVD.The negatives, at least for me, was the all-too-secular outlook on life and an obsession with sex espoused by lead actor Billy Crystal and his clueless buddies Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz and the unnecessary profanity by Jack Palance.All the characters, however, are definitely fun to watch and there is a good message in the end about sacrificing for friends and relatives.

The Impostors lacks the sensitive development of character that turned the original into such an unexpected pleasure. That may not be surprising since the first film was a comedy-drama and the second a screwball comedy, but it's still badly missed since Tucci's screenplay affords lots of movement, but little in the way of comic timing (or lines).

When I look back upon my life, the two hours I want back first are the 120 interminable minutes I spent watching 'The Imposters.' It is neither funny, clever, enjoyable or insightful. Its vaunted 'tribute' aspect - the take that it is a riff on the golden age of Hollywood - is highfalutin nonsense.Tucci did well and showed promise with 'Big Night.' How he got from there to 'The Imposters' (in one film!) is beyond comprehension. Maybe 'Big Night' was just the equivalent of a career .235 hitter suddenly hitting .320. Maybe 'The Imposters' was an anomaly and he can get his mojo back for the next one. Either way, there's a sense of career momentum stalled and opportunity squandered.I urge you not to waste your hard-earned dollars on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing","review":"That basically is what describes this movie, it's just nothing, its a dull stupid, a mediocre plot, overacted characters, well, i might have laughed once or twice but that is all, and not a cuckle or a big laugh, just a small one, anyhow, there is no reason why anyone should pay to endure this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just About Died Laughing","review":"Spoof? Farce? Homage? I don't quite know what to call this film, except simply Comedy. But what fun it is! The plot is second to the leads (Tucci and Platt) proving that comedy duos still work.

Tucci's best work since Undercover Blues, another hysterical film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few perfect screenplays in film history","review":"I have been watching this movie with my family since it came out in 1998, and it never fails to make us laugh.

The opening was compelling, but I kept wondering where Platt and Tucci were going with it. Things kick into gear once the action moves to the ship. I'd see it again for the performances of Lili Taylor and...of course!...Steve Buscemi. I appreciate the dark humor of Buscemi's character Happy Franks trying to off himself and failing at every turn (one of the attempts was with a magician's prop). Oliver Platt is sublime in the ballroom scene, as he tries frantically to warn would-be victims of the various plots and they just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Impostors, Stan & Ollie (Tucci & Platt), old style.","review":"I understand that the professional critics did not value this one highly.

The descriptions were vague and often downright incorrect. Luquillo beach, which the authors described as one of the best beaches in the Carribean, had dingy grey water and was filled with garbage. This is only one example of many many misrepresentations. The guide leaned almost exclusively to very expensive restaurants, and even these were nothing to write home about. We had more luck after we ditched the guide and started exploring on our own. Its one good point was some interesting background on the history of Puerto Rico. However, this was not enough to make me buy another Frommer's guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerto Rico","review":"I keep forgetting how much I don't care for Frommer's guides and wind up buying another one.1. Frommer's has next to no pictures.2. I think somebody went to a couple of random restaurants and beaches and decided to call them the \\"Best of\\".For example, Frommer's says there is snorkeling at Luqillo beach, but there is none (unless all you want to see is sand). Luquillo is a great beach for swimming, but the snorkeling sucks.Another example is the restaurant in the southeast part of the island called Tulio's. While it is a nice restaurant and our food was good, it is not cheap. At least I don't consider $20 a plate cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map Problems","review":"Some maps in the guide don't reflect current reality eg the pull out map shows a major highway on the SE coast.

Luquillo Beach is very comfortable for swimming, but, like most (or may be all) public beaches in PR closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Parador Guajataca is a terrible place, except for the view. Some beaches described as \\"one of the best\\" are hardly accessible by 4WD. Many restaurants mentioned in the book are overpriced and many hotels overrated. The book does not mention that El Yunque forest is awfully crowded at the height of the season. I was surprised to find out that the book has been written by someone who lives in PR. The book seems to escape any editing, some sentences are repeated twice on the same pages. Unfortunately, I can't recommend anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"I was very disappointed in the amount of detail offered in this travel guide. We stayed in Luquillo Beach and the review offered a description of two local restaurants but omitted an entire mall of about twenty restaurants. We didn't \\"discover\\" them until the lasts night of our trip. The pull out map is so vague in detail that it adds to a traveler's confusion. It offers a nice perspective before you go but it should not be used for actual navigation. I also found the layout of the area description non-intuitive. I often read a description of an activity or restaurant only to find that it was two hours away.

That's the only good thing that I can say. I have had this soup many times while living on Long Island. Been to Chinatown in NYC many times andI can tell you this mix absolutely does not taste anything like Hot & Sour soup. I currently live in Orlando and have been here for about 10 years. I find this soup is inconsistent among the various Chinese restaurants here, so that is why I tried this product. After making one package worth of soup(?) and trying it, I threw out the remaining 5 packages of mix. Talk about false advertising. I need to find a book that will provide a correct recipe for this delicious soup so that I can make the soup from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is pretty nasty","review":"It's pretty gross. Too bad you have to buy such a large quantity to try it. First of all, \\"Hearty\\" no way. it's plain and gross. Nothing hot and nothing sour about it. I added lots of chili oil and vinegar to make it more like what you get in the restaurant, but it's no good. I was looking for an alternative to what you can get at the supermarket, but this is not it. Also... it has NOODLES. I've NEVER had hot and sour soup with noodles EVER. Weird. Noodles must be cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as I expected","review":"The hot and sour soup was good.

The author is using the old Ann Coulter formula: Shocking title, artwork that screams, and then bash the left with circumstantial evidence, red herrings, and logical leaps. If you don't believe me, try something simple. Grab a dictionary or get on to wikipedia. Look up \\"liberalism,\\" then look up \\"fascism.\\" The 2 terms are mutually exclusive. The title of this book is contradictory. If you enjoy this book, I am willing to bet you voted for W...twice, and you have trouble spelling any word that contains more than one syllable. This author is banking on the fact that his audience is uninformed and gullible. Seeing that this book is averaging 4 stars, I would say \\"spot on!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"A very well researched but poorly reasoned \\"argument\\". I use the term argument loosely because it reads more like one big infomercial trying to sell you on the idea that Liberalism = Fascism. In reality it's just propaganda disguised as an argument. It looks like a book, it reads like a book, but it not a book. The logic was so tortured and the reasoning so infantile, that I had to put it down after the first few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neocon Doublespeak","review":"This book is at best neocon rhetoric and at its worst, a shameless misrepresentation of the truth.The irony of it all turns my stomach! I consider myself a true conservative, but these neocons like Goldberg that have overrun the Republican Party are the real fascists (authoritarianism + corporatism). If Goldberg had wanted to slander the Democratic Party, he could have just called them socialist (state ownership of industry + forced redistribution of wealth), but he chose to try and confuse the American people with disinformation and propaganda.If you were unfortunate enough to buy the book, as I did, don't forget to recycle it! Maybe all of that wood pulp can be put to good use by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"If you want a vision of the future, imagine a daycare worker giving a toddler a sugarfree bran muffin -- forever.\\"","review":"Goldberg's weird definition of fascism was customized to make it possible to say things like this:\\"The quintessential Liberal Fascist isn't an SS storm trooper; it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from Brown or Swarthmore.\\"But that's just loony. If Goldberg had written \\"1984\\", at the end he'd have O'Brien saying:\\"If you want a vision of the future, imagine a daycare worker giving a toddler a sugarfree bran muffin -- forever.\\"Or how about this:\\"A hug is liberal fascism's equivalent of a pistol shot to the back of the head.\\"You can have infinite fun with Goldberg.

However, having read Goldberg's columns on-line, he is really sort of a joke: recycling the same old imperialist arguments, supporting the Iraq war...then reversing opinion and again blaming liberals.He tries to dress up his follow-the-pack conservatism with historical references, but I found the attempt half-hearted and really by shifting a few words around you could make the opposite case.So, Jonah....sorry dude, your reinforce the fact that your mother got you where you are...you add nothing new to an already tiresome debate leaving moderates like myself to scratch my head and wonder what all your Chicken-Little ranting is about....you're as bad as Dinesh and Ann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylistically agonizing","review":"I was very excited to read this book. Here are the positives: Goldberg is obviously intelligent, the material is well-researched, and the topic is relevant.Negatives: I have read piles of political\\\\historical non-fiction books. If they compare to jogging barefoot on a beach, this book is a slog through a chest-high tar pit in a suit of armor. He is presenting an insane amount of information here. Long-winded, overwritten, excruciating sentences in a stream-of-consciousness organization make for a maddening and frustrating experience. There is no relief from it. I can't believe the publisher intended this book for mass consumption. I had college textbooks that were easier to take than this book.

In my own ignroance, I never bothered to dispute the notion as it was the accepted norm.However as I became more interested in Politics, it began to really concern me as to why the supposed link to Fascism was there. As I read more and more about Fascism, I could see not a single link to conservatives or anything \\"right wing\\". In fact, it was the opposite and I saw much of the modern day DNC party positions aligned with that of Nazi Germany.This book built on what I was learning with far more details than I had dug up. It also helped explain more into WHY the Fascist were labeled as \\"right wing\\" to really help me put Fascism in context with Socialism and Communism.If you are not convinced that Fascism is on the far left, then please take a look at the policy. In fact just look at Obama and the plans he has... it is almost mirrored of Nazi Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into Current American Domestic Affairs","review":"I got my copy of \\"Liberal Fascism\\" after hearing interviews with the author on talk radio. There was more than one interview and I bought more than one copy, as I wanted to compare my findings with a close friend's, after reding the book.Neither one of us has finished the book as yet, but that we will finish it is absolutely assured. The holdup? -checking out all the references mentioned in the first two chapters. Our conclusion so far? This author has finally been able to link for me a whole series of events and trends that have occurred in my 68 year lifespan that were heretofore disconnected and seemed random. Now, I can easily ascertain that they are connected as steps toward goals of seemingly random groups of self-interested people, all of which are measurable progress toward the intensifying of government control over minute aspects of individual lives.Write on!,Jonah. And I shall read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality hurts","review":"Liberals will hate this book. That alone means it is grounded in the reality of history. It clearly delineates the origins of progressive/liberal thought and their need for control as long as they are the ones writing the rules. Liberal totalitarianism is good while conservative totalitarianism is bad. Liberal have the judgment to do the right thing while conservatives never would be trusted with such power. Only the liberal, enlightened mind can know what is best for humanity and we should be thankful they will share it with us. I am sure it is no accident that this book was published in an election year or that it targets Clinton specifically. However, it is clear that Obama is the Fascist through and through and only he can save us from destruction.Wake up America and kick this would be dictator to the curb where he belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book solves a lot of questions.","review":"This book might put liberals to the defensive, but it does clarify a lot of issues revolving around the rise of fascism in Europe and how its ideals are still alive in today's most powerful democracy. The role of the State, the need for unity, the permanent need for a crisis are questions still present in today's politics and liberal views sometimes do not go too far away from those exposed by European fascists in the early 20th century. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Libs hate it, it must be great","review":"I've read about 70% of the book so far. Excellent. It really helps you see the political and social environment that Planned Parenthood could begin in. This book should be used as a textbook in schools.Oh, you'll notice that all the one star reviews focus on Hitler and fascism. That's because they haven't read the book. In fact they prove a point of Goldberg's when he says that today fascism is mainly identifed with Nazism. And so it proves true with these government educated libs. Doesn't matter that Nazism is only a very small part of this book. The lying reviewers aren't aware of this since they haven't read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent insight into the origins of mordern-day liberalism!","review":"This book is an amazingly articulated book showing the clear connection between modern liberalism and fascist ideologies and rhetoric.

He describes the origins of fascism, starting with the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror, to the Marxist and socialist roots Mussolini ardently stood for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"Too many of us have lost sight of what government is supposed to be and are being sucked into the ideas of the media.

If you enjoy history and detailed facts to back up the writing, then you Must Read this book.Jonah Goldberg has meticulously written an extremely compelling and great book. He has given facts and proof to our current problems. This book gives one pause at the same time raises the hair on the back of your neck. It not only is a Must Read, but one that needs to be highlighted and kept as a reference at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate history","review":"Liberal Fascism should be required reading for every high school or political science student. Mr. Goldberg relates political history in the US as well as abroad in an easy to read manner. More importantly, his facts for the first half of the 20th century are as I remember being taught 60 or so years ago when schools still taught history as it was. The last half of the 20th century, I knew from living it, and he's correct there too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening Read","review":"Mr. Goldberg really did his homework here. He shows, as concisely as possible, the direct link between the ideas that birthed Fascism, Nazism, and Progressivism (the parent to modern Liberalism). When \\"fascist\\" ideals are examined honestly, and in their entirety, you can clearly see the direct relationship those ideals have to modern day liberal thought.Excellent job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A casual read that will change your view on modern day politics","review":"I enjoyed the history lesson in the beginning, got bored with the Hilary Clinton part, and was impressed with the analysis of Woodrow Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"History that needs telling...","review":"Goldberg does a fantastic job of examining the roots of modern liberalism's \\"smiley face\\" fascism. He outlines in detail the leftist origins of fascism, tracing them historically through the rise and fall of European totalitarian regimes and the socialist policies of Woodrow Wilson and FDR. The chapter on Wilson's press censorship, jailing of political opponents and dedicated propaganda machine should be a wake-up call to all those who think Bush is a \\"fascist\\". There is certainly a case to be made that today's liberalism is just a softer, nicer fascism and Goldberg makes it.

It is a bit like saying up is down. I'm sorry but I don't agree with this twisted view of history.

He is a male clone of Ann Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"This book is full of unfounded claims that uses unrooted sources.This is Jonah Goldberg's contribution to the new wave of last-ditch efforts to redeem the republican party in Bush's failed presidency. Spoiler alert: This book says Liberal Fascism is a \\"secret\\" and then says it's a secret primarily because \\"liberal\\" and \\"fascism\\" don't ever exist together in history (book's claim).A helpful tag for this book would be \\"propaganda\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The opposite of the truth","review":"The fact is that Hitler and Mussolini were on the far right. Rather than try to distance their far right from today's far right, Goldberg tries to make them mainstream left.

It only solidified the views that I came to by reading David Horowitz's website FrontpageMag.

If these fascists ever get their way the Bible will become a hate crime. Don't believe me? You can already see this happening in Canada, England, and Europe. The Democrat party has become a party of extremists and who are becoming more extreme every day and are, by all of their hate-talk, breading extremism. Their extremism could very well lead this country to civil war. But these cowards would be wise to not start a a war that they can't possibly hope to win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book ever","review":"I love this book.

How very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You people insane","review":"If I could have I would have gave this book 0 stars. This book is at best misguided and at worst propaganda.

I find Goldberg's sourcing to be abundant and his argument to be cogent. He effectively wends through history while staying on message--that there is a dominant system of political thought today that promotes and perpetuates the institutionalization of state dominance over the organic communities of family and Church. Without getting preachy, Goldberg presents a case that is at the same time humorous and maddening in its meaning for American and European society. I hope every Catholic home schooling family reads this book and dovetails its lessons with the assault on the principle of subsidiarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Liberal Fascism is a meticulously researched and thoughtful work on the history of this often misused word and its current implications for American politics today. Tracing both fascism's European roots and history, as well as its \\"friendly\\" version in the United States during World War I, the 1920s, and the 1960s, Goldberg's treatise makes for compelling reading, especially the chapters dealing with Hillary Clinton and the drive of today's left to reinvigorate the policies of the past in a new form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history","review":"I have know for decades that the predominant political trend in this country (as in most western countries) was toward fascism. While all my peers were calling those on the left socialists, I always understood them to be fascists. Mr. Goldberg has provided a wealth of historical detail to support that view. This is one of the most important books to be published in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry picking history and ignoring facts","review":"This book is a major disappointment.

Hitler and the Nazis were allied from the beginning with the right and with nationalists, who were represented by several different political parties at the time. They fought against the left, especially the SPD, which was the leading political party on the left. The author ignores that, because it doesn't agree with his thesis. Goebbels would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Sophistry","review":"With this book Goldberg is engaging in rather pointless sophistry and using rethoric to \\"prove\\" that liberals are really fascists. This is akin to saying that dog lovers are Nazis because Hitler liked dogs. He's obviously preaching for the choir here since those who are most likely to pick up and read this book are those who are out to find \\"proof\\" for their conviction that liberals are evil conspirators out to brainwash us and take away our rights and property and sell them to the United Nations. That being said, in spite of its dramatic title -- in itself worth millions in sales to the true believers, no doubt -- the content book is actually rather interesting and well written too, so that warrants two stars rather than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for Stevie","review":"Yes, I have perused Jonah's wail.Bill Buckley's eternally rolling eyes would roll right outta his head if he could but read 20 wds. of this tragically stupid laughing-stock.

At best his arguments are eye-rolling. More disgracefully, he completely discounts general historic attitudes that were pervasive across party lines.All in all, rather than being an informative piece, he just comes across as a condescending jerk who only loves the sound of his voice.

Having been drawn,out of curiosity, by the ridiculous title while visiting my local bookstore, and thinking it was a work of humor and sarcasm, I promptly browsed through this book and after meticulously thumbing through and reading a number of pages, I arrived at the conclusion that, sadly nowadays, any idiot can get a book published.

As an undergrad I majored in Russian and East European Studies, specializing in 20th century Soviet history, and was always befuddled why people considered Stalinist Russia to be left-wing, while Hilter's Germany was right wing. To me they both seemed the same.Goldberg expounds on this observation and writes a comprehensive history of why fascism is in fact a left-wing, modern day liberal philosophy, and not right-wing or conversative. While some of his arguments, such as those attacking the film Dead Poets Society, are a bit stretched, it is definitely worth reading, and thinking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I feel this book has opened my eyes to the political warfare in this country. I now understand how \\"progressive\\" can sound so forward thinking, but at the same time be a very old idea that has been tried and failed everywhere.

Instead, it turned out to the most instructive book I've ever read on the Left from Marx to Obama.

This book is pure revisionism backed up by distorted facts to fit the author's ideology. Individualism pushed to the extreme recognizes no public good or common goals among a people. It fails to recognize that the free market individuals who benefited most from economics based on individual self-interest hurt the most responsible individuals by destroying our faith in a free financial system. Enough already. The Reagan era is over. Quit your frenzy and find a new ideology. Or at least a new practicality. Your ideological extremism is what brought the right to its knees -- hopefully to stay for the remainder of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some simple questions for your consideration","review":"First, for a lengthy and balanced review, check out the Washington Post's analysis.Second, we can cut through a lot of this mumbo jumbo by looking at the attitudes of conservatives vs. liberals.So, how do conservatives feel about gays?

No excuses.How do conservatives feel about legislating \\"morality\\" (their version)?How do conservatives feel about corporate interests vs. those of the individual? Not rhetorically, but in terms of voting behavior time and time again.How do conservatives feel about the seperation of church and state?

It's absurd.","review":"I did read this book; and I have read many, many others about fascism. The author obviously hasn't read much about his subject and even more obviously does not understand the textbook definition and description, as well as history, of fascism. For a real book about fascism, readers should read Chris Hedges' American Fascists - Hedges is so intellectually superior to this author as to make this book laughable. I'm glad I didn't buy this book (got it from the library) so as to help support this guy who, I am sure, is making a mint off right-wing hysteria. I am so sorry that a major publisher would have anything to do with this venture - which obviously is just a money-maker for the author. Whatever sells, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who takes this drivel seriously does not understand fascism or American liberalism!","review":"My title should explain it all.

He cherry picks facts to fit his needs instead of trying to see the true picture of lineage in the political spectrum. It is specious to think that modern progressive movement has any lineage to Mussolini. Goldberg tortures facts to get them to fit his fantasy.The reality is fascism makes Goldberg uncomfortable. And thats because it's true home is in the close neighborhood of his own neocon ideology.If there was a thread of interesting conjecture, I'd pass on criticism. But I only see a polemical tract dressed up like a small college term paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This book is a must read for every political science major, political activist, and politically active American. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trendy, cute, and fundamentally dishonest ..","review":"Goldberg's straw man is Statist Liberalism, not to be mistaken for the Statist (alleged) Conservatism he advocates. Although he reacts to the \\"nanny state\\" with horror, he believes strongly in a sort of neo-Jacobin global revolution (in true Trotskyite fashion) that promises to shake up the lives of persons living far beyond America's borders. Is this not a sort of \\"nanny state\\" on steroids? As for his association with National Review, it is something of a sick joke: 20 years ago Robespierre was the *bad* guy. Today? He is the archetype for Michael Ledeen and numerous other National Review contributors. Goldberg's position on Woodrow Wilson is especially puzzling, as Neoconservative, Scoop Jackson Democrat, and Wilsonian Democrat are practically interchangeable (think Joe Lieberman or Charles Krauthammer / liberals for the most part, albeit liberals who never met a war they didn't like)."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Target","review":"Truth can hurt, but needs to be told.

The purpose of this book is not fascism, it is division; to pit citizen against citizen. Fascist ideology opposes liberalism, conservatism, Marxism, communism, and socialism. This author should be ashamed of his motives for writing such a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Submission to authorities are the problem","review":"The problem with Goldberg's book is that it ignores the fact that fascism isn't a product of liberalism, but those of an authoritarian bent. Those who wish to submit themselves to authorites and say the government cannot be wrong and that to criticize one's leaders or government is unamerican have been fascist or communists or in betwen. The point being, they believed that the government and authorities must be followed. There is an excellent book by John Dean on this very subject. Unfortunately those on the right are much more likely to fit this criteria then those on the left though they don't have a 100% monopoly.

To link liberalism and nazism just trivializes the holocaust, especially when Hitler killed liberals and leftistI can find simularities in two unrelated things too....take Hitler and Jesus.....Jesus was a great talker and so was Hitler...both were influencial and both still have a lot of people today looking up to them....so that must mean Hitler was a great leader then right? lolthis book is written by and for fools, anti-intellectuals, and people who hate america."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Old World","review":"In the fifties there were many attempts to link Communism and Fascism with phrases such as 'Red Fascism' gaining traction in the US but not really anywhere else in the English speaking world. It seems Goldberg is into a form of revivalism with his arguments. There is no proper research under-pinning this book in the sense that he has found anything new, rather everything is de-contexualised and compared directly. The type of flawed logic at work reminds me of the examples of bad syllogisms given to us in high school : Communists are in favour of chjld labour laws, the Pope is in favour of child labour laws, therefore the Pope is a communist. . Try it yourself: Fascists believe in strong State Power, Liberals believe in strong State Power, therefore Liberals are Fascists\\"This is a totally worthless book by a cynical, worthless writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's typical...","review":"It's typical, and not the first time the loony right has described any leanings leftward of their own insanity as something it's not.

You can title your regime anything, Peanutbutter...or Democracy, it doesn't make it so."},{"rating":"2","title":"History we've never been taught","review":"Goldberg creates and easy to follow history of the true roots of fascism that is contrary to popular notions. It traces its history, not to rightwing extremists, but to left-wing socialism and the progressive movement. So, if you are tired of hearing that you are a Nazi or Fascist because of your conservative views, this book will give you a whole different true understanding of their meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, fascinating - great read!","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. I found it very fascinating. Of course, it has never made sense to equate conservatives with fascists, as today's liberals are much closer in ideology, but it is great to read a thorough, scholarly treatment of the subject, which does a great job of dispelling the confusing myths surrounding left-wing / right-wing ideologies. Modern liberals will have a hard time with this book, as it clearly shows what I would think would be a very uncomfortable pedigree for their ideology. The truth really hurts sometimes!I think the book's most valuable contribution is in identifying the kind of thinking that led to the last century's horrible crimes against humanity. If history does indeed repeat itself, we should all be scared to death of where modern liberalism will take us if it is allowed to take us much further down its deadly road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspicions Confirmed","review":"Goldberg confirms in exquisite detail what I have thought since I became mature enough to actually think for myself and not let the so-called pundits guide my thinking.

Speaking as a european, in no country - Italy, Germany - included would the assertion of this book be taken half seriously. In fact many would be insulted by its premise that facism is a left wing phenomenon.Which beggars the question - if Jonah Goldberg thinks everything evil is left wing and everything good is right wing then as a person, what kind of mental state must this man have?Shoddy.

Instead, I found an exhaustive history of fascism throughout Europe and the United States. Although Goldberg is an admitted conservative, I felt he presented his case fairly objectively. Early on, he makes several references to fascist ideals during the Wilson and Roosevelt administrations. Not living during this period, (and frankly, finding some of his assertions hard to believe) I checked the references myself and found them to be indeed factual, which led credibility to the remainder of the book. At times, it does read like a dull history text, but after a while I detected a wry, understated humor that added life to the pages.

Fascism and its brethren aren't left wing in the slightest and the fallacy put forth that Mussolini was a stealth socialist because of his affiliations in his early years is just ludicrous and ignores the reality that he later went and smashed the presses at his old paper and had socialists, communists and liberals rounded up en masse.Horrible book unless you like being told you're right regardless of the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke Screen","review":"A sure way to make money and get air time on FoxNews is to write a book that tells the rabid right just what they want to hear.

I would recommend buying High Society by itself, which, ironically, was my initial intention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Customer Support","review":"We enjoyed this iron for about a month. It fell off the ironing board and landed on a vinyl floor. The base cracked across the entire width of the iron underneath the handle. Rowenta's response? 'Even if it fell three inches the wrong way, it can crack. It's not a defect, so it's your problem.' My response was... if this were a 19.99 Sunbeam Wal-Mart special, I would agree. But for a 90 dollar Rowenta? That's unacceptable. I was told to send it in at my expense and pay to have it repaired. I told them forget it, I'll just let everyone know about their wonderful product and customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to use, difficult to store, now it leaks, difficult to contact Rowenta","review":"Don't bother getting this iron. It has always been difficult to use because my knuckles would touch the heat control knob, causing it to change temp. Water level goes down fast and the surface of the iron has taken on stains. Now the thing leaks when not in use. I tried to write Rowenta about it on-line, but the menus for their site move the text area down further and further, so you can't hit the \\"send\\" button. So I called.... talked to Rowenta, asked if this model has any recall or history of problems. They won't provide any help if the unit is over one year, in this case it's under two years old. Too bad really, our first Rowenta lasted at least a dozen years. Guess we'll find another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, Fabulous!","review":"I bought this through a local retailer. I love it so far. The steam is amazing, and I was able to iron a stack of clothes much quicker. I did notice that a lot of water had built up in my ironing board, so I will be looking for a different pad and board. With this iron, you need one that can handle the steam. I was leaving it on the board flat while I moved the shirts around, I'm sure that caused the water. It was not leaking, the steam had to go somewhere! Mine is refurbished and the best part is, I bought it for 35.00! So far, it's a five star rating. I'll update if I need to later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best iron ever owned","review":"We've been through many models of steam irons. This is the best ever owned. Increases ironing speed by quickly eliminating wrinkles. Clothes look like they were pressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"Excellent amazon service. Iron arrived before expected. I was amazed at how different and better this iron worked as compared to a previous model I owned. It is heavier, yes, but takes care of creases instantly. The pointed nose allows me to attack difficult areas and the steam takes care of the rest. Very seldom do I have to wet the fabric. I hope it works as efficiently a few years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth paying extra for","review":"Finally, we have a worthy iron that is almost professoinal grade! THE only thing that prevented this review from being a five star is that it is a bit heavier than we'd like. Smooth ride on the ironing board, temperature & steam always seem perfect. Can be summed up in one word really.... QUALITY."},{"rating":"1","title":"rowenta effective drips","review":"I am about to send back this iron for the 3rd time, when they send the shipping label. The customer service rep says they are new irons each time, but I doubt it.The irons drip, no matter what type of water I use. This gets the clothes wet and the ironing board cover wet. It is hard to finish a couple of hours of ironing because the board cover gets wet and I have to stop until it dries or it keeps getting the clothes wet.Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks when you press steam","review":"First time using this iron and creates large water leaks out of the bottom metal plate when I press steam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Iron - Leaks Like a Sieve","review":"I think all the glowing reviews about this iron must be from people who have only owned it for a short time. I LOVED this iron while it worked--which was for all of about six months. Now water POURS out of it every time I plug it in. This is not a leak, it's a full-on deluge, and the iron is useless. Ridiculous, considering the amount I paid for it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Iron","review":"I am sure Rowenta makes good iron but I now feel that amazon may be gets the worse of the lot and sells it online. Any electrical and electronic products that I have bought recently just does not work the way it should. Water leaks through this and I have burned myself with the steam so many times. I doubt that Rowenta's product and bad but I somehow feel that Amazon gets this rejected stuff from manufacturer and sells them online on the site."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS great, then the LEAKING began!","review":"My husband and I loved this iron- the design, the numerous steam holes, the way it glided over fabrics- and then, the LEAKING began. Profuse leaking. It started after approximately one year- we would find huge puddles of water under the iron on our counter where we left it over night. It would spill puddles on to clothing after a few minutes of use. Please, understand: we did NOT overfill it with water, and we did NOT put in distilled water, either. We followed all instructions exactly, including cleaning the iron out to be sure there was no blockage- the iron just started malfunctioning. Thankfully, we purchased it from Bed Bath and Beyond- they ALWAYS accept returns on defective merchandise with your receipt (I kept ours!). I would probably NOT buy this particular brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"I have owned this iron for 14 months. It began leaking recently and is now too leaky to iron with. I have used bottled spring water and been careful to take care of the iron according to the manual. This is not a quality iron that will last you. I would not recommend this to anyone.It gets two stars instead of one because when it did work properly, it was an excellent iron. It is just aggravating that this iron lasted 12 or 14 months and my last iron was a Target $29 special and lasted me ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowenta Focus Iron","review":"The Rowenta Focus Iron is the best Rowenta Iron I have ever purchased. It takes the wrinkles out of my cotton clothes with one pass. It sends out a lot of steam. i bought this iron from Amazon and I received it in the mail in 5 (five) days. I was very surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to my new iron. Unfortunately, the indicator lights did not work (yellow for heating up, green for right temp, red for too hot for setting). When I tried using it anyway, it was nice and hot, with lots of steam, but it also leaked all over the place. Oh well.....back to my search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks water all over!","review":"I bought this iron about six months ago. Recently, I noticed that my iron is sitting in a puddle of water in my cupboard every time I go to use it. I decided to do some searching online and I found that this must be a common problem with the Rowenta Focus. Today, I got my gumption up and called Rowenta's customer service number. I explained to the representative that I wasn't that crazy about mailing my iron to another state for repair because I need my iron. He rudely said, \\"Well, what do you expect us to do?\\" I was shocked! I hung up and am left sad and soggy. :o("},{"rating":"1","title":"It Leaks!","review":"I read reviews of this iron that reported the iron leaked but thought there had been a bad batch, since the review was a while back. I received my iron and on the first use it leaked when using steam, and when pressing the \\"burst of steam\\" button, water streamed from under the soleplate at the top of the iron. Since my purchase was past 30 days by the time I used it, I had to return it to Rowenta. I will have to wait to see if they repair or replace it and if this solves the problem or not. I'm not optimistic about the outcome at this point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"water and fire mixer","review":"I have a Rowenta DZ5080 iron that cost too much for a junk iron.

I was unhappy that the iron is too big for the holder - if you had one that held this iron I would purchase it. I would appreciate a reply. The iron is far better than a less expensive iron. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Quality","review":"The iron did exactly what I bought it for. Until it broke 2 months after the warranty expired. The Rowenta service department offered me a $5 to $20 rebate depending on the iron I would purchased. I view this as unacceptable for an iron costing more than $90. Save your money and purchase a cheaper iron. The added cost does not make sense when you have to purchase a new iron so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Placement of \\"Precision Dial\\"","review":"I love everything about this iron other than the placement of the \\"easy to use\\" precision dial. It may be too easy to use. I brush it with my hand *every* time I reach for the iron and guess what, it changes the setting I'm on. Oh, I forgot to mention there's a handle in front of the dial, so if you want to double check what setting your own, be prepared to put your face close to it, and read at an angle.I haven't thrown it in the trash--the results from ironing are phenomenal. I've just been frustrated one to many times and needed to let other consumers know about the major pitfall of this iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rowenta Iron","review":"I purchased this iron 2-6-2011. I have used it 3 or 4 times and this past week it would not turn on. I did all the things that the Rowenta website suggested and no luck it was not working. This Iron was a big disappointment. I purchased it due to the name and durability that I had heard about. Now all I can do is send it to a repair center. Rowenta website gives a list of places to contact. and of course none of them are in or around Iowa. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water works.....not the game, a leak.","review":"I purchased this Rowenta less than a year ago...it is my second Rowenta in the last three years. I love them at first but they do not last for the price you pay. The first one started staining clothes. This DZ5080 just started leaking water all over the place. Not just a drip but leaking so much the whole ironing board was soaked. What is happening to the reputation of this once giant in its' field? I just purchased a T-fal for $40 so am hoping it last longer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Monster","review":"I loved this iron right up until the 18 month mark. Then it started leaking all over my clothes, saturating the ironing board with water, even when it was off in the upright position. (If you read enough Rowenta reviews you will see that they are notorious for developing leaks.) I give it a 1 due to its short life-span for relatively high cost. I have a $20 Sunbeam from Walmart that is 6 years old and doesn't leak. You are going to read reviews that make this sound like the best iron ever and that is precisely how I felt, but now I feel ripped of and rightfully so for assuming that its German construction was some how superior to my made in China Sunbeam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowenta Iron","review":"It is the best iron I've had since the old fashioned Hoover brand of the 50's. It is smooth an weighty and gets into tight corners without fuss. My only complaint is with the cord. It is always in the way when setting the iron upright between items. I'm sure it will wear in time and give me trouble in the future. For the price, this \\"bug\\" should have been obvious tot he designers and worked out long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Iron - WARNING","review":"I've had this iron a little over a year and up until one incident was completely satisfied with it. One day last week after ironing, all of a sudden the iron started smoking profusely. The iron started to burn and melt - it was a miracle that I was not injured. Rowenta customer support stated they had never had this problem reported before (of course not!), and the best they can do was to send me a $15 gift certificate towards a new iron. I don't feel comfortable using them again, especially seeing reviews on the DZ9080 model as having this same dangerous problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, short lived...","review":"I bought this iron for my wife for Christmas a year and a half ago after reading all of its glowing reviews. Sure enough, it looked beautiful and worked well except for the occasional water leaks. Sadly the leaking started to grow progressively worse and now less than 18 months later the iron no longer holds water and has shorted out. I thought irons were one of those things that lasted for 10+ years when you bought a nice one. If that is also your expectation, this is probably not your iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a find!","review":"I don't know if I qualify to write a review since I picked up my Rowenta Focus DZ5080 at a rummage sale. I was thrilled to come across this iron in perfect(I thought)condition as I was helping to set up our church rummage sale last week. Macy's was even advertizing it in their current circular! What a find! I have been using and loving it...until today. This iron must be one of those that leaks right there by the cord. The cover on my old fashioned wooden ironing board is soaked. I would go buy a new Focus but it seems that leaking is a common problem with this iron. Rowenta, are you listening???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great iron","review":"This is a great iron.

You can read all about the short lives of Rowenta on the internet. Wish I would have been more savy.Secondly, there is no way to turn it off. You have to unplug it, to turn on and off.Will never buy another Rowenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy wth Focus iron","review":"I'm so disappointed in the Rowenta Focus iron. Since I'm a quilter and I use the iron almost daily, I really wanted a good steam iron and thought this one would be it...wrong...it leaks all over! I constantly have water spots on my cover (which, incidently is also a Rowenta), even if I hardly have any water in it.It also seems to run out of steam fast. At first I just thought..well, I must have really got a lemon...my husband has told me it needs to go back to the store.This is the first negitive review I've ever written; but I thought people should know and beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product rating","review":"It was necessary for me to send the iron to Rowenta authorized service in Illinois. I only used the product twice and both times it leaked water. I had to pay for shipping the product back for repair/replacement. It will take two plus weeks for the iron to be returned to me. Hence my satisfaction rating is quite unsatisfied. I thought Rowenta was a quality product and my purchase was at the high end, not an in-expensive iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best iron I have ever seen","review":"This product is manufactured to a high degree of European craftsmanship.

Have used ONLY Rowenta irons for many years....the less expensive ones.....and hoped that this high-priced one would be that much better. Wrong! It worked well enough for the first couple weeks; the pointy nose seemed to get into much smaller spaces, and one filling generally did my ironing for the week. BUT...it soon started cutting offpower and was cold while I was ironing! After couple times of this, I decided to send it back for one with NO AUTO OFF, which is now costing $20. more than this one. Am hoping the new one works as it's supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"this iron is not all they say it is. the cord consistanly gets in the way when you set the iron upright, your fingers hit the temp dial because it is in the wrong place(not enough space from handle to dial), constantly refilling water. when low on water iron dies not iron as quickly it forces you to refill again... one full tank will allow you to iron two shirts. when done ironing if there is water left in tank it is difficult to empty. product not worth the $79.00 i paid. would not reccomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 6 Months","review":"I bought this iron in December of last year thinking it was worth it to spend the money on a good iron, hoping it would outlast at least 3 cheap irons. In May it broke. The auto shutoff seems to have malfunctioned, and the iron won't turn back on after the shutoff has been tripped. I bought this specific version of Rowenta because it wasn't plagued with the auto shutoff problems of the others, but it's not true.In short, this then $90 iron lasted 5 months. Our $20 Black and Decker iron was the backup, and continues to iron after 3 years. I'm not saying that a cheaper iron is the way to go, I'm just saying DON'T BUY THIS IRON."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon","review":"Lots of steam and hot fast.

WTH! who can afford using bottled water in an iron! it just is not practical! and if they want us to install water softeners to our taps, i'd much rather buy a totally different iron than this one.you might love it at first but trust me you will HATE in within a year.i recommended this iron to so many of my friends and they all curse at me now for making them buy this piece of garbage.i'd say don't buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great - not quite what was advertised though","review":"Let me just say that this is a terrific iron - typical Rowenta quality! My only complaint is that I did not receive what was advertised - mine may be a slightly older model. This one did NOT come with the LED lights to show when the iron was too cool, too hot, or just right - a bit disappointed but I just couldn't be bothered to box it up and ship it back. Usually I get exactly what i had ordered through Amazon - but not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant","review":"I first used this iron at a friend's house & fell ion love with it.

It was great until it stopped working 13 months later. Of course, Rowenta would do nothing about it since it was outside of the 12 month window.

This was absolutely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"it blows, but not steam!","review":"let me start by saying that I love to IRON! Now that we have that on the table, this is my second and FINAL Rowenta Iron. It was also expensive, it was also nice at first, and it also decided to lose it's mind and stop working indiscriminately in the middle of ironing and shut off... too much money, time and patience for me! I had an old Rowenta back when they made products that were worthwhile, but alas... those days are gone... gone with the days of good washing machines that load from the top and actually get white laundry clean on the first wash... ah, the good old days... good bye Rowenta... you'll not be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Leaks","review":"It is light and steams nicely. However mine developed a leak after a few months. After about ten minutes after turning it on it leaks.

I always assumed that most irons are all basically the same. However, when I replaced an old Black and Decker iron with this Rowenta, I could not believe the difference! The heft of the iron in conjunction with the quantity of steam produced makes garments look impeccable in a fraction of the time required of my old iron. Also, the specially designed tip allows for phenomenal pressing around buttons and other hard to press areas. The only downside I experienced was the propensity I experienced of inadvertently changing the temperature dial while ironing, due to my large hand touching the dial during ironing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron in nothing flat","review":"This iron is great! I iron my work shirts every Sunday and this iron does the work in no time. It gets hot fast and the burst of steam feature really gets the wrinkles out of my fire retarded shirts. My old iron had the water squirt function, like this one does, but it is so much easier to hit those stubborn wrinkles with the burst of steam and flatten them with no effort. My wife, a quilter, loves it also. It is great for large or small bits of fabric of all types and the heat of the iron follows the different heat settings very rapidly, she says. Have not had a bit of trouble with this wonderful iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Rowenta product","review":"This is my second Rowenta iron. The last one lasted around 10 years.

I don't much like ironing, but like ironed clothes, pillow cases, etc. This Rowenta DZ5080 does an excellent job, producing major steam with no spitting. It's fairly heavy, but I think this helps with the ironing, and I don't have to press down as much, because it carries its own weight. This is a big issue for me, with long-term tendinitis. So far, so good. Everything about it seems to be very high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great steam iron","review":"This iron has lots of steam, is light weight, and my husband likes the tapered tip because it gets around shirt buttons very nicely.

The previous (2) were handed down to friends and they are both still working. The DZ5080 FOCUS is an outstanding Iron. A little on the pricey side, but well worth ever penny. The steaming function is phenomenal and best of all; the spout where you fill the iron with water is flawless. Unlike most other irons where you need pinpoint accuracy to fill the iron with water, this iron is a cinch! If you're looking for a new iron, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iron","review":"Iron is very sturdy and the fine tip makes it easy to iron collars and around buttons. Heats up fast which helps if your in a hurry. Wanted an Iron that would hold the test of time considering my wife's 15 dollar iron lasted 10 years.

Produced lots of steam, even to the point of having to refill it after ironing only 4 shirts. But now, even after many attempts to clean it, trying different types of water and making sure it is hot enough, it POURS water out the base when I pick it up. It makes no difference how much water is in the reservoir. After I'm done, it continues to leak as it sits on the ironing board. Thankfully, it hasn't stained any clothes, but I'm definately replacing it! (And yes, it was made in Germany.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPENSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Expensive does not guarantee superior performance. Before I ordered the Rowenta DZ5080 I had purchased a T-Fal Ultraglide in August but much to my dismay, it is already leaking which prompted me to but the Rowenta iron in September. After using the NEW Rowenta for a couple of weeks, it too is leaking and it is worse than the T-Fal was. The iron gums up easily and does not like spray starch. The iron leaves large spots of water on the clothes. There is so much water leakage that it leaves puddles of water on the floor and the ironing board cover soaking wet. My old cheaper Black & Decker does not leak after many many years of service. Less is definitely more when it comes product satisfaction. My ONLY recommendation for this product would be DON'T waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews about Rowenta Irons we purchased this model in Nov.06. Granted we paid a lot of money for this product, about twice the price of a highly rated Black & Decker, but we expected superior quality. Well the other night the iron started acting funny, inadvertently turning on and off. Well low and behold it appears that the power cord has an internal break. This is not a simple replacement, my guess would be close to half the cost of the original price. A call to Rowenta Customer Service fell on deaf ears. The original one year warranty has expired. We're going out now to buy a Black & Decker for half the price that would probably last a lot longer than the Rowenta.Save your MONEY and don't buy the Rowenta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle burst in flames","review":"I really like this iron and have used it for at least 4 years. However, water must have leaked into the handle where the cable attaches to the iron itself and burst into flames. Luckily, nobody was injured. This iron had cut my \\"average\\" ironing time by close to half. Now, I seriously doubt we will spend $100 for a Rowenta. None of the cheapy charlies I had bought before ever burst into flames. I will not recommend this appliance to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly leaks after 14 months of use","review":"I've purchased and used the Rowenta DZ5080 Focus since March 2010. It performed very well for the first 11 months or so, then started a slow leak somewhere near the baseplate. Now at 14 months, it POURs from the baseplate. Unlike what others may think, it was never overfilled, and I only began ironing once it had heated up (the yellow light disappears).I truly liked the product initially, but have to give it a 1-star rating because of its very short life span. As a comparison, my old Black & Decker lasted years without any issues (although its performance was lower than the Rowenta).For those of you who believe there is a quality difference between irons manufactured in Germany vs. China -- mine was manufactured in Germany."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BRAND - STAY AWAY","review":"I have the same problem with the Rowenta auto-shutoff as several other reviewers on amazon and elsewhere. Bought a Rowenta iron in Aug'07. The autoshutoff started kicking in even when the iron was in use. Suddenly during use, iron shuts off and red light begins to blink. Only way to restart - switch on and off OR bang it down hard sideways on the ironing board (\\"gentle sideways shaking\\" recommended by the manual doesn't cut it). Then 15-20 seconds later - same problem.Returned and got a replacement in Sept'07. Autoshutoff broke again again in May'08.Out of 90 days return/replace policy - so seller won't return OR replace. Only option to send to Rowenta service center prepaid and wait for 2-3 weeks for it to come back.Better toss and buy a different brand. WITH extended warranty this time. Oh well... No more Rowenta EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowenta DZ5080 Iron","review":"This is an excellent iron. My only complaint is the weight of it. Extremely heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iron!","review":"After reading tons of reviews, I finally decided to order the Rowenta DZ5080, and I love it!! Several reviewers complained about water leakage and weight. I have not had any problems with water leaking, and the weight seems just right to me. I love the sturdiness and quality of the materials and its ability to get out even the toughest wrinkles. I also love the pointy tip as I do a lot of quilting and it allows me to get into folds and seams. This iron gets hot and has enough steam to get the job done- it's totally worth the money. I am so glad I made this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for too little","review":"These irons don't last. My 2nd one just went in a little over a year. Same with the first. I wouldn't be upset if this was a $30 iron, but come on folks! I liked it when it worked, but it's just not a reliable appliance. If you are thinking of buying Rowenta, you need to go into the purchase knowing you'll be back for another one in a little more than a year. I am a single guy, so over use is definitely not the problem! I will probably end up buying a 3rd one just because I love it when it works. Kinda like owning a forgein sports car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this iron!!!","review":"this is a great iron! I have a job that requires me to wear a wrinkle-free shirt everyday. Let me tell you, this magical iron allows me to perfectly iron my shirt 2 minutes flat! kick the steam on and you're ready! do yourself a favor and buy this iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I've wanted to replace my old iron for years and finally broke down and went for the Rowenta Focus. It's going back today. I didn't have a problem with leaking, but the LED which is supposed to turn green when the iron is ready based on the temperature you select on the dial glows red at all times. I was ironing a white cotton comforter cover and was scared that I would burn it because I couldn't tell how hot the iron was. I don't know, maybe mine is defective but I wasn't impressed with the functionality at all. My old one that I probably paid less than $20 for works better than this one. I'm going to try the Panasonic cordless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Iron","review":"I took a chance, spending a lot more than I normally would on an iron. I figured \\"Made in Germany\\" so it must be quality. Within a couple weeks, the ironing plate began to burn and although I have tried to clean it, it continues to happen. I don't know if the iron gets too hot, or the stainless steel plate is at fault, but i'm ironing standard cotton garments. Once the plate is burned, it can no longer go over clothes smoothly and leaves brown marks on clothing from the scorched plate. Additionally, the adjustment wheel is so loose, that you continuously hit it with your fingers while holding the iron - an annoyance, but not a deal breaker.Stick with a non-stick plate, and forget about Rowenta. Apparently Germany has lowered their standards..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catching a vicious serial killer","review":"This is a fascinating detective story that happens to be true. It would be hard to write a dull book about Andrei Chikatilo, but the way the author drew his characters really gripped me -- as did his horrific examples of the corruption and incompetence within the Soviet criminal justice system, which among other things lead an innocent man to be convicted of one of Chikatilo's murders and executed.A word of warning: the book is as much about Inspector Kostoev (who was in charge of the task force to find Chikatilo and who eventually wrung a confession out of him) as it is about Chikatilo and his crimes. It goes into great detail about Kostoev's background, childhood, etc. I found it all very interesting but others may just want to read about the murders. Most of the Kostoev biography can be skipped if you really don't want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"an advertisement for professional services","review":"How to Hire a Nanny is essentially a book-sized advertisement for GTM payroll services. The take-away from this book is that you ought to get professional help with taxes and the like if you want to hire household help. I actually use GTM household payroll services, and I am pleased with what they offer. As for the book, it will help you understand the many 'gotchas' in hiring help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I didn't like this book. It did a great job of explaining the legalities tied to hiring a nanny but I was looking more for tips on recruiting and what to look for etc. If you're planning on starting your own nanny placement agency then I would definitely suggest this book. But if you're just looking for some good advice on how to hire one on your own I wouldn't suggest this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed","review":"Isabel's Bed looked like a great read & it's gotten great reviews, but in all honesty I was diappointed by it. The writing is great, I would give Elinor Lipman 4 *'s for her writing talent, but this story just never took off for me. Harriet Mahoney is a 40 something year old woman who finds herself alone after her live-in boyfriend of 12 years meets someone else. An aspiring writer, Harriet takes a job working for Isabel, living in her mansion & helping her to ghostwrite a novel about Isabel's scandalous life. Where this book fell short for me was in the character development-I never got to know or care too deeply about any of the characters. I will still give Lipman's other novels a try as she is a talented writer. This novel wasn't terrible, but I felt it was a little flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and Fickle","review":"If you're after a quick light-hearted read this one may suffice. Be warned: Isabel's Bed is crammed with sterotypical, over-exaggerated characters whose predictability becomes palpable with every page. The heroine of the novel, Harriet Mahoney, is filled with so much self-pity and lack of confidence you feel like slapping her and screaming ,\\"Get over yourself.\\" I had no sympathy for her constant self-undermining drivel. Harriet shacks up with Isabel, in order to ghost write her life story. Isabel seems to have ten-fold of everything Harriet lacks. One can only assume her brash, self-righteous behaviour are attempts at keeping readers amused. But Isabel merely grates with her self-indulgent comments and pathetic fashion sense. Other characters, mainly men, are again sterotypical and unbelievable. The storyline itself is uninteresting and trite. If you can find it at half-price, Isabel's Bed may be worth it---just."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book with heart","review":"This is a book I find to be wonderfully layered with truth. On the surface it's a funny and light-hearted. But as you read deeper into the novel you find that it is more then just laughs and giggles. Isabel's Bed has a lot of heart and tells a good story. Harriet Mahoney comes to terms with her writing ability, her relationship with her X-boyfriend; she finds new friends and a new home. Through her struggles you see that it isn't necessary to write a published book or have a high paying job or a degree in a University to make you happy. You just have to find your own voice and live it out loud and that's what Harriet Mahoney did. It's really an enjoyable read and who can't help but love this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crafty, witty, and charming with a major dose of reality.","review":"It is 12am and I have finished the last pages of Isabel's bed. Though I have always been a fast-reader this was definately a page-turner. There is something for everyone in this novel. You laugh and smile and see a bit of yourself in the both Isabel and Harriet. This book was given to me yesterday by a relative and it was the first I had ever heard of Elinor Lipman and I definately do not want to stop here. Isabel's Bed wasn't challenging nor a real brain-picker but it nevertheless was enjoyable. Charming and personal, it was a breath of fresh air into the life of a teenage college student, trying to escape the pressure of mid-terms and stress. Congratulations, Ms. Lipman for such a wonderful, playful, and welcomed novel. Please do not lose that flair you showed in Isabel's Bed"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books that I have read in a long time!","review":"I truly enjoyed reading Isabel's Bed, it made me laugh out loud and fall in love with the characters. It is book that I would share with my friends. I can't wait to start another one by Ms Lipman. Great Find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Poor storyline made it boring and I never loved the characters, as I almost always do. Not a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"This book looked interesting enough to read, but by about page 40 I knew the plot was not going anywhere. I'm not sure how this book got such great reviews! I could not even finish it. I ended up reading \\"The Glass Castle\\" instead,which I would recommend to everyone. Made this book seem all the more silly and boring. I just couldn't ever get into the characters or with what was going on with the plot. Really a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Lipman fan","review":"I loved Then She Found Me, and decided to try another Lipman story. Isabel's Bed was just as enjoyable. The characters and the setting kept me turning the pages (after reading this I wanted to go straight to Cape Cod). I tried reading the Inn at Lake Divine before Isabel's Bed, and I couldn't get into it. I'm glad I didn't give up and gave this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"While I agree that the characters were easy to get to know and fairly well illustrated, I felt less than satisfied with the final chapters. With quite a bit of build-up to the main plot, it seemed the book then took a quick turn away from the plot and the author quickly jotted an ending leaving me wondering what had just happened. There were loose ends, but what really bothered me is the time I invested in the plot, only to have it unravel with no real purpose. It was less a surprise ending than a 'why would you do this' ending. Lipman has done better, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!!!!","review":"It started out okay. I kept thinking it would get better--it didn't. The characters were not that interesting. There were a few funny lines but nothing that would make me laugh till I cried. The story line was lame and predictable. When I finished it last night I threw it on the floor in disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very Boring","review":"I can't believe people thought this book was funny.

I bought these in wide width from a specialty store. They offered me a great deal and I thought they were so comfortable. The shoes were tight but I thought they would \\"break in.\\" By the time they broke in I had lost most of the foam because it seemed to melt to my socks/tights and come out bit by bit with every wearing. I actually lined the interior of the shoe with grip tape just to make them last a little longer.

After reading the reviews, I ordered a 6.5 N to allow more length and got a GREAT price on them at the time I ordered. When they arrived, I found them to be very tight on my feet and almost sent them back. However, the length was fine, and after I used them a couple of times the leather stretched and they fit comfortably. The soles are spectacularly cushy and your feet will thank you for these shoes.

There is no explication of what the author understood relativism to mean, and which aspect or version of relativism the he is attacking. The use of an interview in which two fictitious names are used in place of the author is a trite too clever. I am not a relativist as in one who believes that everyone's views of morality is right whatever that view might be. Neither am I an absolutist in professing that morality admits of only one way of discerning it. Whether there is one truth or many truths, or none at all, is a matter that is still open to intense philosophical debate. This book adds little to that debate except confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"This is a difficult book to read. You will like it but you will have to go back many times and re-read complete sections. Nevertheless, this is a book that prepares you for a discussion that is happening all around us: you have the right to thing whatever you want. Do you? Where do you draw the line? Why do you draw a line? Even is few things stick, read it. I would have liked more examples. That's why I gave it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided and poorly written","review":"Having never read any of Kreeft's books before, I started with this one, since it was an interesting subject. I had to give up about 3/4s through because it was just so awful. It was obvious what side the author was on, because the absolutist was always calm, composed and full of examples and theory, while the relativist was childish, petty and awed by the inability of her philosophy to provide counters to the arguments. It is simply not worth the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a refutation, but merely an affirmation","review":"I am strongly Christian and reject \\"relativism\\", but this book is relativism itself. What Mr. Kreeft portrays as relativism is really the code of the new absolutes that are foisted on us at every turn. The true relativist in this book is 'Isa, Mr. Kreeft's supposed absolutist.

Isa was putting up a lot of sound arguments, then relatavism spewed forth from his mouth. It's OK to steal if you need something? That's what Mr. Kreeft says! What about the man he stole from? Now, I'm not saying I wouldn't steal under those circumstances, because I probably would. That doesn't mean that I was not stealing. Mr Kreeft seems to think that stealing is absolutely wrong when HE says so, and right when HE says so. And people read this relativism and pat him on the back! Who is writing those glowing reviews? His students? God help them. Please don't be taken in by this nonsense. If you believe that sinning is all right if it suits your circumstances this book is definitely for you!

Think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do publishers keep publishing this man's stuff?","review":"The answer to my question is: reputable publishers don't. Again Peter Kreeft bores us with his adolescent sense of humor, irritates us with his sophomoric oversimplifications, and congratulates himself on being so terribly clever--which he is not. The best thing to do with this book is to ignore it. Watch tv, go to the movies, watch birds, mow the lawn, paint your garage. Anything. Your time will be better spent.

However, this season, Season 3, returned to the camp without the creepy. Although there were a few misses, like the pedophile on the street - for the most part, Season 3 was a wonderful season filled with lots of twists and turns but still never veering into the completely inane.

His playing sounds like that of a young guy starting out and trying to prove how good he is. It shows great ability but lacks confidence.And his producers weren't doing him any favours - the high echo level just exaggerates his saxophone's shrillness when he's trying too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remakes","review":"When dealing with Ray Price cd's, pay attention to the fact that he has re-recorded his greatest hits many times.This collection is a good example.

Gone are the twin fiddles and honky-tonk sound. Known for his hitting high notes with perfect percision, Ray disappoints his listeners by having backup singers hit the high notes. The accompaning music is fully orchestrated and sounds like it should be backing Tony Bennett instead of country legend, Ray Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best TV has to offer!!","review":"The Sopranos is by far the most developed and cinematic show ever to be seen on television. The characters are incredibly in-depth and the plot is beyond that of any TV show and majority of movies. The world of the mobster is highly intriguing. The most fascinating aspect of it is that we can all still relate to many areas of that world. And, we can easily relate to the family life of Tony Soprano. The Sopranos is a masterpiece, and the chance to pick up these timeless works of art on DVD should not be passed by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I love the Sopranos. I bought the first season just to see what it was like and got totally hooked. You really become emotionally involved with the characters, and find yourself rooting them on and looking down on the cops! It has such a great story line, even my mother who doesn't like mafia flicks got hooked. Everyone I know who has seen them, loves them. I can't wait for the fourth season! I miss my Tony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Report","review":"The jungle was hot, the hero was hot, the heroine was hot, the sex was hot, the premise was not. I realize romance is fiction but must be a bit pausible. If our hero, Kyle, can stay away from a one weekend stand for 4 years why can't he, with numerous lives on the line, keep his zipper up for 5 days? Delanie was suppose to be the brains of her family, a scary thought. Why did she do everything possible to foil a mission, risking a lot of lives to do absolutely nothing of value? She hated playing the bimbo yet she did so without any prompting. I bought this book right after reading Kiss and Tell. What a disappointment, whereas in K&T the hero and heroine are both competent in H&S this is not the case. I'm still looking forward to ST John's book but I hope his heroine shows more common sense and likeability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"I liked Cherry Adair's last book - Kiss and Tell - and had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found the story contrived, the suspense forumlaic, and the sex just distasteful. Yeah, let's consummate the relationship while she's on serious drugs about 100 times. Great.This heroine had no rational basis for her choices. With hundreds of guards around and a psycho for a host, with the assurance that no other woman is there from the psycho's mother, the intelligent heroine would have left - not had sleazy sex. And the hero was just plain ineffectual.I do not recommend this book. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"PASS THE ASBESTOS GLOVES, PLEASE!","review":"Holy cow this book is hot! The first sentence is guaranteed to make your eyes pop and your mouth fall open. This one is much hotter than KISS AND TELL (also a five star book), and I really think I liked it better. More action, more steam - and not just from the jungle location! A little too close to home with our present terrorism problems but if we had a hand full of Kyles at our disposal, our country could rest easy. My one complaint is the cover. Where did they come up with that male model. It looks like he's been waxed and hasn't seen the sun EVER. Come on! There are so many male models out there who would have fit Kyle's description to perfection. Just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover. A KEEPER!! Can't wait for the next brother's story. Hurry CA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one","review":"Hide & Seek is the 2nd in a trilogy. The first book, Kiss & Tell was fantastic. It could easily be an action movie. This one was rediculous! A kindergarden teacher posing as a \\"hired girlfriend\\" for an internationally wanted drug lord, who's mother sells women into sexual slavery. OH MY GOD! Just because it is a romance novel is not an excuse for a stupid plot. On top of that, there were so many errors in the book (grammar and clarity) that I wonder if the author had an editor. And if she did, why didn't they do their job?I loved te first book, but after this one, I'm not sure I'm gonna bother to read the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!!!!!","review":"This book was sweltering hot, From the locale to the heat between Kyle and Delanie!

I spent a total of $1 at a thrift store and I regret even that. The plot was atrocious, the characters unlikable and the writing awkward. Ms. Adair referred to the heroine's 'hoo-hoo' in the middle of what was supposed to be a serious love scene. I mean, really, people. That's the word you tell your two-year-old daughter to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea!","review":"The story here is simple: Girls's sister is missing, girl goes to Vegas to find the last man seen with sister, girl goes to stay with man in South America to find sister. I was barely able to finish this book for several reasons but most prominent was that I found many things completely unbelievable. Such as.....how a woman (Delanie) could easily get so close to one of the richest men in the world in just a few weeks. How she would just happen to run into Kyle on a secluded mountaintop in South America?????? Etc. The sex scenes or interactions were not my cup of tea (particularly with Isabella).

I didn't expect a classic, but i at least expected to be entertained, or at least to see some good acting. I got neither. The plot was stupid and so regurgitated that it made me shudder. The characters were never properly developed. Freddie sees Jessica Biel and talks to her once, and all of a sudden she's in love with him and encouraging him to persue his dreams and she's willing to disobey her father to see him. Uhm, what? Her lines were just cheesy and retarded. I would never recommend this movie to be seen.

This boring, boring, boring film attempts and fails at being anything more than the bottom of the barrel formulated teen comedy that aches in unoriginality (as shown simply by the title) and only reaches arm length for ridiculous obnoxious laughs. The cliche Hollywood teen comedy script (I've seen better story telling on bathroom walls) sinks to a new level of absurdity. I'm sorry but movies like this come straight from the pooper. Consistently awful performances all around, especially that of Mr. Prinze Jr. Well, I feel that if I have nothing nice to say I should say nothing at all, so I should stop here. I just wish Hollywood lived by the same set of standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"summer love!","review":"This is a cute one!

Tenley and another girl were introduced to Ryan by their friend (Matthew Lillard)....If Ryan and Tenley didn't end up together at the end of the movie, and Tenley ended up going to San Francisco, I would have been so disappointed. That would have ruined in for me.This DVD includes: 10 deleted scenes and filmography on the cast. There is also a feature you can turn on where you can hear commentary by Biel and this other dude throughout the movie.Freddie Prinze Jr and Jessica Biel make a pretty good couple, but I think him and Sarah Michelle Gellar make a better one.Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog-Doo","review":"I can't begin to tell you how much I dislike Freddie Prinze Jr., he just doesn't deserve to be such a big star.

However, the baseball games played in summer Catch are almost entirely \\"unrealistic.\\"Freddie Prinze, Jr plays Ryan Dunne an emplowee for his fathers gardening business. As it turns out Prinze is a very gifted athlete. He befriends Billy BruBaker who is the comic relief as well as the most comical in the Movie. He also falls in love with Jessica Biel, She is very glamerous. I was not satasfied at all with the movie. In one scene Biels sister ask Lillard and Prinze to sign her baseball card. If I recall, the only time that the Cape league made cards was in the summer of 1988. but enough of the technical stuff. I was definitely embarassed when I saw a 7 year old girl. There are many sexual scenes in the movie which are not even suitable for kids of 13. I suggest you rent the movie. you'll get some laughs and somewhat of a taste of Cape Cod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Cheesy .....","review":"A decent cast in the supporting roles, which is necessary to overcome the lousy script and general nausea from a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. Mathew Lillard's performance earned this movie half of the whole 1 star I gave it. Nevermind the idea that a 6'6\\" 160-pound catcher is ridiculous, I still think he's funny. The other half was simply because this is a baseball movie set in the New England area.Overall this is the typical Freddie Prinze Jr movie.

Fortunately Freddie saves all of these movies with his irresistable charm and likeablitity and only Freddie Prinze Jr fans will enjoy this movie.

Jessica Biel lacks the energy needed and has no chemistry with Freddie at all. Matthew Lillard is rediculous, as he always is in films, as the loudmouth goofball of the team. Other cast members try hard but can't overcompensate for the weak script. Summer Catch has it's moments but nothing to great.

He needs to take more risks and playing a variety of roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Where do I start. Let me first try to figure out what this movie was even about. I hated this movie. The acting was horrible, the story was predictible and it was not funny at all. I was looking more forward to it returning it to the movie store then to find out how things would work out in the end. Who told Jessica Biel (or whatever her name is) that she could act? Maybe I'm wrong about her. This is the first movie I've seen her in. But I'm not so sure I would give her a second chance. Most of the actors were annoying and not funny at all. Not even the one-liners!Baseball fans don't count on this to be a good movie. It's not. Don't waste your time.So don't count on this to be a humorous movie.I will not see this movie again.

I think the director was a minor league quality ballplayer and even produced a great documentary a few years ago about Hank Aaron (I think it was Aaron). Summer Catch got way lost in the teen-movie-thing. Jeez, for $20 Million, he could have fictionalized a Jackie Robinson type-story on how the Negro Leagues' destiny was to take over our hearts. Could you imagine the baseball scenes. It was \\"Magic Johnson Show-Time\\" way ahead of its time. Now, that's something we've never seen dramatized. Spike Lee still hasn't made the real Jackie Robinson story for the screen yet. For a baseball lover to do this Summer Catch thing is a Waste.

A truly advanced pop sound way ahead of its time. The second CD contains the best pop song ever written and sung ... Eloise.

Joey is delicious. In every role she seems to just play herself and she is so delightful. Monica Potter is ethereal in both her mood and her beauty but she plays this character perfectly: drawing us in early with her charms and later exposing her flaws with elegant alacrity. But Vince!

One of the most compelling reasons is found in the caliber of the cast involved. The acting job is quite spectacular, very realistic, and the story is very vivid and at the same time rough. Many times a director can't capture the audience's attention on \\"Every day life\\" type movies. In this movie, the director hit the nail right on the head!

I didn't need every vocal, certainly, but the \\"Ten Cents A Dance\\" number where the Bakers have to temporarily cover the vocals, with Michelle Pfeiffer coming in when she recovers, was a must, as was some of the late-night piano noodling of Jeff Bridges' character. A couple of other vocals, already noted elsewhere by other reviewers, should also have been included. This needs to be redone.

I've seen this title in the cut-out bins at CD & DVD stores - when they still existed (in higher numbers) - such as Musicland, Camelot Music, etc. for like $2.99.

The only downside to the Dr. Brown sterilizer is that it is bulky and finding a place for it. So I thought I would try bags and bought these Modela microwave sterilizer bags. They worked fine but the issue was with the size of the bag. They are tiny!! Could only get two bottles inside, so having to do a couple days worth of bottles took all day to do becuase I was doing them 2 at a time. The doc brown can hold 7 bottles plus all their nipples and takes the same amount of time.

You can do the same with other bottle parts instead of wasting time and water boiling.When at work, use this bag!

The items arrived in excellent condition due to careful packaging by the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for travel, not for daily use","review":"I purchased these instead of a sterilizer because I didn't want another item cluttering up my counterspace. Well, it takes 2 uses to sterilize all of my pump accessories and bottles and you can only use the bags 20 times. I ended up buying a sterilizer anyways for the sake of efficiency (it fits everything at once) but use the bags I have for when we travel. Most hotels have a microwave so I just put these in my pump bag and off we go.

I just found these, and am using them for breast pump accessories, bottles, and pacifiers for my 4th child. I only wish I had these for my first 3 kids! They make cleaning and sterilizing a breeze-just rinse the stuff off, put it in the bag, and pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes. Everything comes out sterilized and ready to use. No more washing and boiling! You can use each bag 20 times, so one package of 5 bags lasts awhile. I keep some at home, one at work, and one at the sitter's house. I reccommend them to everyone I know who is having a baby or has small children."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for cleaning baby stuff","review":"Great, so simple and easy to clean pacifiers, bottles, pump pieces, etc. Don't know what I would do without these, especially if you are breastfeeding and pumping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 4 oz bottles and pump accessories","review":"I exclusively pump so my gear gets heavy use. These bags are easy to use. Make sure you verify your microwave wattage and use as directed.

Worth the price.","review":"I pump in addition to breastfeeding to store milk. We used to just use our dishwasher to sanitize all the pumping parts. Sometimes though I didn't want to run the dishwasher because it wasn't full and I would end up handwashing the pump parts.While you should still wash you pump parts with warm soap and water, this product makes it very easy to sterilize them. 3 minutes in the microwave and voila!You can use every bag 20 times and there are little boxes on the back that you can mark each time you use them so you don't forget. I was worried about that when I bought the product. Imagine me, a sleep-deprived mother, forgetting something??Cheap and easy to use- I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK For the Most Part","review":"We use these bags in addition to the washing, and not as a replacement. They are effective and easy way to get the breast pump accessories and bottles sterilized, and work for the most of the ones that we use. However, they don't seem to be good for the breast pump tubes, despite what the instructions say. We discovered this the hard way when we nearly melted a pair of those tubes, and had to order the new ones. For the most part you don't really need to sterilize the tubes, but we wanted to be on the safe side. It could be that we didn't do everything quite according to the instructions, but these should be overall very easy to follow in my opinion. Overall, though, we have been fairly satisfied with these bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful invention!!","review":"I must say that I was not up for trying these out at first. I was just going to \\"hand wash and save my money\\" pshhh yeah right. Once I had my baby I had no time to hand wash anything. I use the dishwasher now! Needless to say I went and purchased these from target because I needed something right away to sterilize my breast pump to use it because I don't put my baby's things in the dishwasher. I have two different branded double breast electric pumps; Evenflo and playtex and i can fit all the parts per breastpump per bag at one time and in 3 minutes they are hot and steaming clean ready to use!! The easiest best money ever spent!!! you get 20 uses out of each bag and that is a good deal for the price because the pack comes in 5. that is a 100 times to sterilize...YAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oater","review":"the greatest western star of all time john wayne jumps off the screen and becomes real for an hour and forty five minutes.

There was no chemistry between the main characters (but how can chemistry occur when the first meeting involves rape). At no point in this book was love or even seduction developed. But, rape was mentioned over and over. This was so degrading and the main character Bettina by the end of the book has lost all her spunk. I love Lindsey's book because the female characters are strong and the strength is appreciated in the end by the man she loves. Not so in this book, Bettina's strength is broken and instead she's \\"tamed.\\" Disgusting!!!! Now onto Tristan how about callous, arrogant, rude, spiteful and RAPIST.

This book was so disguting and frustating filled with hate . I was wondering when was it going to end .

She often has the hero abuse the heroine. While in some books, Fires of Winters for example it is upsetting but given the historical context and a sufficiently repentant hero one can kind of understand. In this book the hero raped the heroine repeatedly. It was sick. I can't even recall when she consented? So what if she enjoyed it, it is still rape. On top of that he had some serious issues, telling her he wanted to beat her constantly, including when she was pregnant! Seriously, this guy is terrible and there is NOTHING charming about him. Ugh.

Not only was the book extremely stilted, but I felt like I was reading sentences from a child. I am usually not very critical but there is a point when one must draw the line and say enough is enough. I also didn't enjoy reading about the Bettina being raped continually by the \\"hero.\\" In conclusion, what can I say?

Not only was it poorly written, but Bettina was unbelievable, and though Tristan was a pirate, if he's going to be the hero of the story, he has to have SOME redeeming qualities other than not raping or bedding another woman while he's busy raping Bettina for months.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book","review":"Anyone who reads Johanna Lindsey's books know that the character are ignorant to the last minute. This is no different with Bettina. She is captured by a pirate who desires her.

All of Johanna Lindsey's book protray the characters as saying one thing but thinking another. She does call it rape but it is not rape. No rape victim gets sweep in the moment.

I felt no affinity whatsoever for the characters, and their about-face from rapist and victim to a loving couple was entirely unbelievable. I am very pleased there was no sequel (possible plot: Tristan rapes his daughter, or something equally sordid).

I have read a Lindsey book before and enjoyed it very much. However, this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It certainly has me questioning the authors idea of a healthy relationship. Im all for the strong willed man seducing a woman but I am NOT for the continual rape of a woman. I hated this book and I would have it banned from bookstores if I could. Rape is not romance no matter how you write it. It is disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Lindsey Look Like The Ed Wood Of Romance","review":"As part of my reading club, So Bad They're Hysterical, I recently received A Pirate's Love in the mail from a fellow networker. At the same time my sensitivities were offended beyond ire (falling in love with a rapist? Please!), I also found I couldn't stop laughing. These characters are so cardboard cut-out I wondered if maybe cookie cutters had been issued with the original printing. Our hero (ha) and heroine (more ha), Tristan and Bettina (what horrible names) were delightfully irritating throughout. I wish they'd both been eaten by sharks or blown up in a volcanic explosion--that would have been a happy ending!And for heaven's sake, what on earth is a hellcat?For those of you who'll cry out, \\"But I read this book when it was first published...things were different then...blah, blah, blah\\" take note. This book has been in circulation with So Bad, They're Hysterical since 1979. Obviously there were people 20 years ago who could discriminate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape is not romance","review":"This book is disturbing and, frankly, dangerous. It is based on the premise that women really like to be raped, that if a man just rapes a woman well enough, and often enough, she will be really turned on. That a virgin is forceably raped on threat to others and herself is not the basis of a romance. And when a women \\"falls in love\\" with her captor, we call it the Stockholm syndrome and talk about the extensive therapy she will need. Here Lindsey, whose writing I usually like, has the \\"hero\\" repeatedly rape the heroine who secretly is turned on by what he is doing to her and eventually she falls in love with him. This book is offensive. I do not know that I will ever buy one of her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!","review":"How can rape and romance equate to romance and love? Readers in the 70s may have found this storyline romantic - but I was disgusted. All the negative reviews regarding this book hold true."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author's other books are better!","review":"This book is not for those who are squeemish about kidnapping and rape as a basis for most of a \\"romance\\" story. I had a hard time reading this book but was \\"compelled\\" to finish it to see if it got any better. With the amount of kidnapping and raping by the \\"hero\\", I felt this must have been the author's one \\"off\\" book. All of the others I have read were much, much better and developed more of the character of the main \\"lovers\\". It does have a bit of romance between the pirate and his captive, and gets better toward the end, but I was very disappointed in this book; I doubt I would have bought more of her books if this had been the first one I read. Her other books are wonderful, very descriptive, sexy and extremely hard to put down; I own almost all of them. Don't let this book stop you from reading her other books as you won't know what you would be missing. I believe she is the best historical romance author I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is An Astounding Insult To Women","review":"I cannot think of a less flattering, more misogynist view of awoman than what is portrayed in A Pirate's Love. I read it for thesake of being \\"read up\\" on the genre, and I am told that such instances of rape, violence, and general degradation do not occur in more recent romances. I'm very bothered that this book remains in print and available for purchase. Yes, it's THAT offensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most degrading book I've ever read","review":"This book is so disgusting I don't know where to begin. My friend read it and told me about it so I read it for myself because I didn't believe anyone could write something so horrible. There is no way anyone who was raped would feel anything but revulsion for her rapist. This book was so revolting that my friends and I were convinced a man had written it until we found out that there were a lot more books by this author. I'll never read any of her other books because I'd never be able to forget she'd written this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringe-worthy","review":"My friends and I have a thing for pirates, so when one of us picked up this book at the library, she said, \\"You all HAVE to read this,\\" and it made the rounds. Not because it is good, or even just mindless entertainment, but because it is so ridiculous it defies description. We still laugh over how stupid it is, but I guess it isn't really funny that a 20th century woman writer could ever put that on paper. I do not believe that any sane woman could ever fall in love with a man who raped her. And in this book he doesn't just rape her, he forcibly, repeatedly, brutally rapes her. Come on! It was absolutely a revolting book. I almost have to recommend it because it's so bad. You might find it amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"In modern society today, do we consider rape sexy or romantic? Of course not! Which is why I say don't read this book. Tristan kidnaps Bettina and gets her pregnant after continually raping her. The only part of this I enjoyed was when Casey showed up and realized Bettina was his daughter, therefore thwarting Tristan's plans to try and get Bettina to stay. Also, I loved it when Bettina planted doubts about her child also being Tristan's. But the rest of this book is disgusting. I don't understand how Bettina can love Tristan after all he's done to her! I would NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about falling in love with the man who rapes you","review":"I'm a pretty big Lindsey fan, but this was the worst Lindsey book I've ever read! The fact that the \\"pirate,\\" Tristan, forced himself on Bettina day after day was NOT at all romantic. I found it upsetting. If Tristan wanted Bettina's love, he just had to love her without forcing her. This book is not worth reading. Thankfully this is one of Lindsey's first books. I'm guessing that she didn't have the romance \\"formula\\" down yet. Her other books are much better and don't involve the main character constantly raping the women he supposedly loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant story....","review":"Seduction is acceptable, but rape? No. Thank you kindly, but I'll pass. This is one of Lindsey's worse books, but it truely makes you appreciate her later works. She is an astounding author, but the period in which _Pirate's Love_ was written tends to be a bit on the masochistic side of sexuality. I've read other books from the time that my grandmother swears by that leave _Pirate's Love_ looking clean and wholesome. Not for everyone, but try it anyway -- from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst of Lindsey.","review":"I know I read this book in it's entirety sometime, but when I tried to re-read it, it was awful! Lindsey's later work is a lot better and I hope even she would agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape,Blackmail,This book has no Redemption","review":"I was totally disgusted to pick up this book and read the awful RAPE scenes written by Ms.Lindsey. It made my stomach sick that she could justify putting this in a Romance. The Pirate(Tristan)-Kidnapped, Raped, Blackmailed, Lied his way thru the whole book. I couldn't believe the mother trying to talk the daughter into forgiving her Rapist and telling him that she loved him. It was the worst waste of money ever printed!!!!! Don't buy this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"This book was okay. The plot was interesting and I liked the little secondary romance with Bettina's mother. My biggest problem with the book was the relationship between Tristen and Bettina. The fact that he raped her wasn't that bad since many books written in the seventies and eighties had this theme in common. The trouble was there was never any reason for Bettina to fall in love with Tristen. He never changed. He never grew to respect her feelings. The two of them fell in love abruptly and unbelievably. All in all okay to read once. I do enjoy Johanna's other later books and I would recomend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Had Ever Red !!!!!!!","review":"Hey my name is Maayan,I love to read romance books and i can never get boared of it.This book is difrent from other that i have red, and i enjoyed every second of it and i always read it again and again.I think that its every woman dream to be kidnaped by a dangerous and handsome pirate that is also a great lover.And althoug some of you that red this book thinks that its digriding and grous but i think that this book shoes how powrfull woman are with thir beauty.Tristan raped bittina but sence he saw her she was the only thing that intreset him.I know that i would want a man like this that will defend me and wershep me like Tristan.I loved the person that Tristan rpresent, and my biggest dream is that this book will be a movie some day soon.Its the best book of Johannas books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it, but just couldn't!","review":"I really tried to like this book, but it just never got any better. Tristan who I guess is suppose to be the \\"Hero\\" constantly rapes Bettina. There was no seduction and at times very brutal. The only way Bettina could have possibly fall in love with him is from shear brainwashing by confindment and threats. Worst is her nursemaid from childhood and even her mother tell her to just make the most of it and couldn't she just try to love him because he's \\"handsome\\"!!!!!!! Come on. This book should just be retired because it's way past time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guide on how NOT to write","review":"I absolutely hate this book. I recently bought it as an example of pirate-related romance fiction for my own writing since I am not very familiar with the genre, but instead I found it to be an example of how NOT to write. I went to my local bookstore with a different book in mind to buy, which they did not have in stock, so I picked this one up instead. BIG mistake and waste of my money. I'll never again buy a book without reading the reviews first. I actually found myself laughing out loud because the plot is so ridiculous. I can't imagine how this book ever got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone really find this romantic??","review":"Please someone tell me what is so romantic about a man who repeatedly rapes a woman? I was so discusted by the way that poor woman was treated that I will never read another one of this author's books. And to top it all off, her mother and maid tell her to make the best of it. If my daughter were being raped, I would not stand by and tell her to make the best of it. Is this author smoking weed? No one in this book is loyal to their spouse, everyone is trying to rape someone, and in the end the wretched woman thinks she is in love with her rapist. I am sure a pschologist would have a field day with that one. Really, if this poor author thinks rape is so romantic, I ask her to please get to know someone who has been through it. Pure filth!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tempted to give 5 but...","review":"I held back on the 5 stars because I guess this book does lack something. What that is...I don't exactly know. What I do know is that I love Benilde Little's talents and skills at writing. She is smart and thoroughly entertaining with her craft. Her writing takes you to another intellectual level as you read her works. I have read other books that I literally couldn't put down but his one, I can more or less take it or leave it. That's really why it didn't get the extra star. But, it definitely is still a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check this out at your local library and save the money...","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and am very grateful that I checked it out at the library. The lead character is only a little bit interesting and the supporting characters are dull. In fact, the storyline is dull, predictable and I could not muster any support for the lead. I mean, by the fifth chapter, I was not interested in her plight anymore. Moreover, there are sequences in the book that come out of nowhere and some characters end up having a complete personality change by the end of the book (i.e., David)...I just did not get the sense that Ms. Little's heart was in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fan of Ms. Little!","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms. Little, but this one was not one of her greatest. Ina was an interesting person who appeared to be a good person, great mother and decent photographer. However, she had some problems in her life and it seems like she was always looking for someone else to blame for her misfortune. Her mother was never around, David wasn't the man she needed but she definitely wanted, Paige was the perfect neighbor who had it all but was judgemental and lived the life that Ina wanted. Jay brought her total joy and total frustration at the same time. He provided her with a stable life with three beautiful children, but after his indiscretion, caused to have to live a life that she never wanted or asked for. So, all through the book if something wasn't right, then Ina never owned it. I wondered if she had lived out her true life if she would have had all the problems she incurred.The book was good, but not extraordinary like her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FORGOT I READ THIS BOOK","review":"I DID READ GOOD HAIR AND LIKE MANY OTHERS ENJOYED THE STORY.

This one was painfully boring! There are two particular dance moves that you can default to if you get lost, and they are also used to link the separate dance sequences together. The problem is, you spend 2/3 of the workout doing only those two moves (which aren't very cardio-intensive anyway). You learn one new step, you go back to the defaults. You learn another step, you go back to the defaults. Then you link them together -- using defaults. I wish I could get my money back on this one. I was really disappointed.

A nearly perfect narration keeps the flow going. quiet, understated. Intelligent use of old clips.For the deep fan/historian, there are some glaring errors, though they are assumed to be not much more than copy typos: Mantle hit .353 in his first MVP year, not .356. His career did *not* go progressively down after 1964. He had a good year in 1966, including a stretch when he hit 8 homers in 6 games! He was not 38 when he retired, he was 37.Another small issue: the DVD title is a bit misleading. His \\"own words\\" are only from a 1953 on field interview and a circa. 1993 chat at \\"Mickey Mantle's\\" in NYC. (until youtube, the '53 clip was rarer than rare).

I believe there is no such thing as a bad JJ Abrams show and Brian clearly illustrates that. Every single main character is likable and different. I loved everything involving Dave and Deena. Those two are magical and great actors. The whole Marjorie, Adam and Brian triangle is edge of your seat great as well. Every show has some blunders and the Heather/Summer stripper storyline could have been left out, but this is a show that you will root for all the characters.

But the story is quickly unraveled by the \\"convenience of coincidence\\" to tie characters and situations together to further develop the storyline. Too many coincidences and predictable events ultimately make the storyline appear like a collage of several other novels. The ending was a huge disappointment - a heartless killer suddenly becomes more obsessed with a woman's body than completing his mission; a divorced couple who seemingly have nothing in common except loneliness are suddenly madly in love (again); a man who has been \\"protecting\\" the Amber Room for decades decides to shoot a pursuer in the shoulder at close range rather than kill as planned. Many entertaining chapters, but the story quickly becomes a fairy-tale rather than an adventure novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Hollywood drama","review":"This book ended up making me mad. At first, the subject Berry chose to write about had seemed exciting and original. The first chapter was compelling, and it drew me into the book. I settled in for what I thought would be a can't-put-down mystery. However, by chapter three, this novel developed into a very bad version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\" The characters reminded me of a hodge-podge of action movie personas. The plot was over dramatic. Besides the topic, this book lacked originality.I would have enjoyed this book more if the characters were original, the events described were more believable, and the overall tone of the book was much less Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"See storyline above.This being Steve Berry's first novel, I think he did a fine job.A well researched story about the Amber Room along with an illuminating look at the world of treasure hunters and lost treasures makes for interesting reading. It also makes a good thriller.Don't expect a Dan Brown novel just because he wrote a positive blurb.Though not as riveting as some, this novel kept me entertained.I will read his next novel knowing it will be as good or better than the first.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This book is typical of modern American fiction: Predictable. The protaganists, Rachel and Paul Cutler, are a divorced couple. It's obvious from the outset that these two will wind up finding out that they really love each other. Boring.And then there's the long passages of European Art History/Nazi Art Theft History. I'm an avid reader of just about anything I can get my hands on, and very few pieces of writing put me to sleep on the commuter train as quickly as these passages did. I love history, and I love fiction, but this author put them together in a way that isn't even remotely interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for first book, but Berry's a mysoginist","review":"I too bought this book due to the endorsement from Dan Brown on the cover. I thought it unusual on some levels and interesting regarding the lost Amber Room. However, the writing is inconsistent in parts. And, Steve Berry obviously has a problem with women. His main character Rachel is an unlikeable bitch called the \\"Ice Queen\\" by her co-workers. As a judge, she pisses off both police and attorneys and has few supporters. She's treated her kind ex-husband (who is still holding a torch) like crap. She can't hold her tongue and makes one bitchy comment after another..and then says she doesn't know why she has to act like that. I think Berry enjoyed creating such a detestable character and no surprise when she was set up for a rape. Other female characters are also abused in other scenes. I found it disturbing and a little sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Subject, Less-than-Well Written","review":"Excellent parts: the Amber Room mystery itself, travels in and around Russian (current & ex-territories), World War II stories.Other than the above, all other seemed unnecessary and boring. I actually picked up this novel cause Dan Brown put his remarks on it. If the Amber Room subject is to be written more adeptly, I think it has a chance to become blockbuster novel and movie, alike. Not the case with this version. Waste of time reading. Sorry, 2 stars only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had quit at chapter 1","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. What was Dan Brown thinking putting his endorsement on the cover? Some of the problems I had with this novel: the characters we were supposed to like were consistently making completely unrealistically stupid choices; the characters we were supposed to hate were 100% one-dimensional; entire chapters slogged along (I was skimming by this point) without even one mention of the main characters, particularly near the end of the book; the editing was terrible, with many errors and spelling of names changing throughout (sometimes Monika was Monica, etc.) This book started out with some promise, but the only truly interesting character was killed off. After that it was a downhill slide into terrible plot choices and a strong desire just to be done with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I never read","review":"Unreadable.

I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery lover","review":"Online reviewer Amorae pretty much says it all, but I would add that the gratuitous sex scenes interrupt what plot Berry has going. The descriptions are predictable and banal and their inclusion seems counterproductive for the author if he wishes to reach a wide audience of male and famale mystery novel readers. The topic of The Amber Room is certainly intriguing, but it deserves a better mystery woven around its disappearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooooooo violent!!!","review":"I know this is a mystery thriller, but does the author have to make it so violent and bloody?

There are many other books on the market addressing similar topics, virtually all are better than this book. Far too many gratuitous (not to mention annoying) sex scenes, far too little plot development. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun, fast read.","review":"More thriller than mystery, Berry's debut novel feels fairly familiar, but adds some interesting aspects. The historical, World War II angle, along with the more legendary mystery of the Amber Room itself certainly is a unique frame for what would otherwise be a rather cliched thriller. The characters, though they don't feel particularly convincing as parents or credible in their careers, somehow still manage to be just engaging enough to keep you interested in what will happen to them. The romantic thread, though also not very believable, makes a nice touch and rounds the book out to appeal to a wider base of thriller fans. It's an interesting premise and though its execution certainly isn't flawless, for a fast and fun read, it fits the bill. Perfect for a plane ride or a beach read, I will be keeping an eye out to see what Berry follows this debut up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Tedious","review":"The plot is good, and I felt like the book ought to be exciting. But something about the way it's written just made the story boring. Perhaps it was the characters, most of whom are terrible caricatures.

I love this genre of historical fiction in which it becomes difficult to know when the transition between history and fiction is happening (I sometimes wonder what will happen if these novels are discovered a few thousand years later by our future generations and they consider these novels as history:-) In all three books there is a basic historical premise and that central historical premise is \\"massaged\\" to produce fiction. In Romanov, the fact that the children of the last Tsar may have survived; in Rozabal the fact that Jesus may have children in India who are Islamic terrorists; In Amber, the possibility that exquisite art panels from Catherine's palace in Russia may survive. I thank Dan Brown for having inspired so many wonderful mysteries that have a historical basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Mechanical","review":"I really wanted this book to work. It seemed to have all the right elements; history, Nazis, action, art and romance. Ultimately it was too mechanical. This was Berry's first novel and it was obviously very well-researched. Maybe his next attempt will be more finished. THE AMBER ROOM is like a painted room with no curtains. There's just something missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"Fail. I couldn't buy it - like a lot of thrillers this novel was too contrived to like. For example - a main character, who is a judge, can clearly see that her father was murdered; but when she speaks to a homicide detective about it she agrees with him that it must have been accident. Why? She didn't want to have to tell him the unlikely, fantastic story that lead to his death. But then the reader of *The Amber Room* is supposed to buy into an ongoing fantastic, unlikely story. No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escapist thriller","review":"In this suspenseful novel, several sets of people are racing to uncover the Amber Room, which has been lost since World War II. The book manages to impart quite a lot of factual information about the Amber Room while also being a readable, fictional, thriller. The amber itself has still not been found (in real life), but the series of events laid out in this imagining seem, at least to a layperson like me, quite plausible. The one complaint I have is that there were several \\"mini-climaxes\\" in the book, a couple of which were quite a bit more suspenseful than the final one...it was kind of like a roller coaster. Besides that it was an entertaining and informative book with decent characters and an engaging plot. Recommended to any reader of the mystery/thriller genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first novel...","review":"I previously read several Steve Berry books from his Cotton Malone series. They were good enough to keep me coming back for more, so I decided to start at the beginning. The Amber Room is not a Cotton Malone story, but a stand alone novel.

Life is simply too short to spend it reading badly written books. Mr. Berry is not a writer; if he were a chef, his skills would be strictly limited to microwave fare--fast, tasteless, and forgotten. I am not being too hard on the \\"writer\\" since he has no claim to that title. His books are not just formulaic, but lacking in imagination and momentum--I'm surprised he hasn't addressed sunken treasure in the Bermuda Triangle yet (if, by chance, he has, please forgive my oversight).

For me, Everclear had a bit of a paint-by-numbers, nothing-all-that new feel to it and I was especially put off by the one honky-tonkish number on it (track 5 if I remember correctly). Mercury has a much more exploratory, experimental feel to most of it. Nits: The instrumental/pseudo-minlmialist FILLER that occupies track 13 and the somewhat corny folk feel of the last track.

I think they have a good variety of swords at reasonable prices. When this sword arrived I was disappointed with the looseness of the blade. I removed the end cap on the handle and was able to tighten the nut. The blade is much more solid now. The blade appears to have too much of some sort of thick oily substance on it, which means its in the scabbard too. It can be easily wiped off, but a little annoying. If I wasn't able to correct the blade and the price was higher, I probably would have given it a MUCH lower score.

The book, too, held my attention from beginning to end and actually caused me to cry several times (and I don't normally cry over books). Davis has a fantastic command of historical events and everyday detail, her characters are wonderfully alive and worthy of our sympathy. I would even go so far as to suggest that Falco--much as I love him--does not measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"After chewing through all of MuCullough's Roman books, and waiting for a new one, I chanced across this one and decided to give Lindsey Davis a try. I was not dissapointed. A different perspective and a story I was not familiar with, I devoured it. Just a tiny bit romantic for my taste, but certinaly worth the read. If you have ever felt anything like Caenis and Vespasian felt for each other, this story will hit close to home. I now find myself compelled to investigate the Marcus Didius Falco books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but lacks Davis's usual excitement.","review":"Junkies of anything related to ancient Rome will enjoy this. Unfortunately, Marcus Didius Falco this ain't. The only exciting part of the book comes at the very end when the main character's fate is, only temporarily, up in the air. Hopefully, Caenus and Vespian, the two protaganists, will be included in future Falco entries, all of which are far superior to this effort. I kept feeling like this story had been greatly edited, leaving out large chunks of time and action. Maybe if Caenus had babysat Falco this could have been more interesting. Nevertheless, Miss Davis remains a marvelous writer with a God-given talent for bringing the Classical Era to life. This book just needed more of her customary humor. I want Falco! I want Helena to have that damn baby! Amazon.com, please let us know when the next Falco novel is coming out!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Below \\"I, Claudius\\"","review":"I like Lindsey Davis's Falco series, but I must agree whole-heartedly with \\"A Reader's\\" comments. This book drags, particularly in the middle section (when Vespasian is absent). In addition, like the Falco series and Steven Saylor, the protagonists have too much of politically-correct agenda (feminism, democracy, and, in Saylor's case, anti-slavery) to be really belivable First Century Romans. Robert Graves does it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Course of Honor, or, L.D. just can't get enough Vespatian.","review":"This is an excellent book, a departure from Davis' Falco stories, not only in central character, but in tone. It is deeply romantic at its core, the love of a Roman Emperor, Vespatian, for a slave-born woman, Caenis. He could not marry her, as Roman law was quite strict as to whom a member of the Senatorial class could and could not marry. He could not make her his wife, but he loved her all his life. This is a great read, but it is also informative. Most moderns would think that slavery was an altogether wreched existence, but Caenis, the favorite of one of the Roman royals, not only has a dignified, comfortable life, but buys her own freedom at a relatively young age. This is a book that people who think the Romans were just as you and I will find a bit of a shock, but humans are humans, and their essential humanity shines through. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, intelligent story of Ancient Rome","review":"I really liked this book. It tells a wonderful story of two people growing and developping, over beyond 40 years, (thank God not another of those books that end when people are young and beautiful - here, they grow up) without ever becoming unbearably long or dull, quite the contrary, it leaves you wanting to know more about that time and those characters, but still, it is somehow enough to know that much. My complaints: I lost the thread a bit when Caenis was living first in that slum appartement, then did not want to move back to Antonia's house, but still moved out of the slum. I either overlooked something or she was living somewhere (where?) for a few years; the other one: I never quite figured out what Caenis lived on: those occasional pieces of dictation and the (explicitly) unpaid lessons to the Imperial children - these inconsistencies make me rate the book only a 4, but extremely enjoyable still - if you like Ancient Rome, this is a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very intensive or comprehensive","review":"This was the first study guide I bought for my MCAT review. After reading through it I thought it was very good. However, after purchasing and reading the Kaplan comprehensive review study guide, I realized that the Columbia Review book is NOT very intensive and does not thoroughly explain some scientific concepts (especially in the biology section). Specific details include the muscular/skeletal system and the nervous system. Bresnick's book is like glossary of terms with simple definitions with inadequate scientific background. Save your money. Buy the Kaplan book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Errors!","review":"I received the Columbia Review book as part of an MCAT course I'm taking. The book is out of print, but just in case anyone is thinking about special-ordering it, DON'T!The book provides a decent overview of MCAT science, but the subject area practice tests that follow each section are full of errors. Some of the questions don't have a single \\"best\\" answer, while others don't seem to have any correct answers at all. I'm not talking about typographical errors; I'm talking about poorly written questions that do not reflect the level of difficulty of the real MCAT.Preparing for the MCAT is hard enough. You don't need review materials that make it even harder. Use the Kaplan Comprehensive Review, and if you want more practice on a particular subject, try the MCAT Biology/Chemistry/Physics series from Nova Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I don't understand how this book could get anything but a \\"1 star\\" from anyone. The questions are downright wrong! I've only done a few of the passages and found numerous mistakes where the book outright contradicts itself. You don't have to be a genius to find the mistakes, I found them in the verbal section. This book needs to be tossed - do yourself a favor and spend a little more money buying Kaplan/Princeton or basically anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a Good Doorstop","review":"This book was a dissappointment. I found the chemistry and biology sections to be lacking in their explinations of concepts vital to the MCAT. The testing sections were full of mistakes, something I found to be quite frustrating. How are you supposed to learn from an author who has trouble with the material? I would recommend Kaplan's Comprehensive Review, and sticking to the AAMC Practice Tests. Save yourself the frustration! Good luck on test day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest rated MCAT book you can get","review":"In recent surveys of premed students, this book has been consistently rated the highest MCAT prep guide (it received an A-). It's a great book to use as a review- kind of thin on a few of the biology sections, but overall very good. Using this book, plus the 4 practice exams published by the Association of American Medical Colleges will do a great job of preparing you for the MCAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practice Test Confusion!","review":"The information about the subjects may be adequate, but it does not explain it very thoroughly and the MCAT is about having a full understanding and being able to link concepts together. In addition, the tests have many mistakes! After having done a few passages, I started carefully picking through them after I had finished and found a few answers which directly contradicted the passages - these practice tests served only to confuse me. It feels as though no one proofed this book. Since then I've bought a book from Kaplan and Princeton and although they are a bit more expensive they have been used by many pre-meds with reliable results - and they don't have mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"Belt doesn't fit. It is about 1/8th of an inch too short. I'm going to heat it up and hope it will stretch out enough to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading illustration-improper content","review":"Especially for Catholic families, children or young adults, please do not purchase or read this book for it is a discription of sin, not a reflection on the beauty of our faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and hard to put down!","review":"This book is such a neat, fast read! I picked it up and didn't let go until the last page. The investigations are really interesting and it's a truly unique book. I love crime solving stories, especially when they're true, so if you're like me you'll LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, dry beyond dry","review":"I was one of the reporters for the Columbia Missourian who first profiled the arrest of one of the murderers discussed in this book, and I covered a lot of what prosecutor Joe Moseley did around that time, so I was very interested in this book.But I was incredibly disappointed when it arrived. This is the most dry, overly clinical, forgettable retelling of these stories -- geez, of any murder story -- that I can imagine. There is no suspense, no insight, no artifice, no writer's voice. Zero. All you get are four straightforward, third-person chronological narratives. I can't underline enough how dry this work is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with inconsistencies","review":"I bought this book because I am a forensic pathologist and wished to learn what another professional chose to write and how he wrote it. I could not have been more disappointed! While an average reader such as the one who wrote the review I read might not notice the inconsistencies, they ruined the book for me. I would have been quite willing to accept one or two, but when the number became much, much higher, I found myself wishing that Dr. Dix had chosen not to write a book at all. I have no knowledge of him, even though we are a relatively small group, perhaps 4-500, and over time we do get to know one another. He may be one of the best forensic pathologists in the country, but that did not come across in the book, in my opinion. I have chosen to use the word \\"inconsistencies\\" as it is kinder than \\"mistakes\\" but, actually, and sadly, both are present. I would never recommend this book to anyone who wanted to learn details of our profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Rubbish","review":"This book is useless for kids. I remember reading a version of the story as a kid. It was fantastic. This version is scary and badly written. The quality of the drawing were horrible. Overall i hate this version of the book. Its thrown into a corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Zane is sooooooooooo hot!!!!","review":"Lake Consequence was the perfect opportunity for the actor, Billy Zane, to display his amazing acting talent. He is phenominal as Joan Severance's gardener...the way he trims her trees is so skillfull!! He is also in amazing physical shape. He must work-out, like, a lot-n-stuff. I would love to have a poster from this movie. I could stare at it for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't completely suck.","review":"Well, Joan Severance is pretty hot, but Billy Zane couldn't act his way out of wet paper bag, and the script is ...slightly less than A List. But it does produce wood, which is probably part of the point, nyet? The other woman is also hot and somehow believable in her own shallowly defined role.
