I mean inspirational in the sense that you can take a primitive and silly story, wrap some gibberish around it, bind it in hardcover and sell it for $20.3.

However, if you want to save yourself a few bucks, here is my summary: People have a comfort zone. Sometimes you have to leave that comfrot zone. Change is hard but change is good. Be adaptable.We need Spencer Johnson to tell us this? With mice? The extended metaphor that we are all rats in a maze (which, people seem to identify with though by these reviews) gets old fast.

I'm not a manager (not yet), although this book was recommended by a manager at our company (I'm not reporting to him). Nevertheless, I think this book has a point. Yes, it is oversimplified, but has an excellent lesson. I would agree with the critics that change is not always good and sometimes change can be abused by those who have the power to do so. But that's their problem; some things are beyond our control, and what this book teaches us, is to deal with what is under our control, and when things in life change to look for new and better cheese. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"They moved my cheese for sure!","review":"Beware!

Although you will benefit by reading just \\"the story part,\\" I encourage you to read every page of this book, for it is the first and third section that frame the story and make it memorable. I also encourage you to read this book with someone else. Discussions identifying which character represents you and others in your companay and life are where the gold lies.

If you are looking for life changing inspiration and guidance, this book will be a sorry disappointment.I am in the habit of reading any self help book I can find that promises something new and profound in the hopes that even the smallest nugget of new information makes it all worthwhile.

It is a very useful guide for people who find it difficult sometimes to face changes of any kind. It takes you less than one hour to read it, but the insights you will find there are unique and will be of great help.It is a funny story about four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. Of course, the cheese is only a metaphor for what people want to do in life (a good job, a relationship, money, health, etc.). Life is seen here as a maze, the place where we look for what we want.I was fortunate to participate also in a training course on this book, which really helped me understand even better its meanings.

It reminds me of the resistance in Orwell's \\"1984\\" that we learn was actually controlled by Big Brother.

However, I was let down. It is a drawn out story about some mice, and how they deal when their cheese isn't where they expected to find it. In so many words, you control your own destiny, you need to take charge, you need to stop blaming others when there are obsticles in your life, and you should never feel defeated. This book is a very quick read, with large print, and it is easy to follow, so it has that going for it. But I didn't really get anything out of it that wasn't already common sense.

It's like going to an expensive mediocre restaurant: The food's OK, but overpriced and overhyped. (And where's the beef?)The message is nice, cute, simple and easy to read. It's more like a pamphlet than a book actually, the kind that you would read at the waiting room of a doctor's office. It deals with how to handle change in our lives and in our fast-paced everchanging world, and the author creates a parody of how 4 different personalities react to change. The ideas were presented clearly, and the analogy is brilliant.

So I went into it excited to learn. However, I quickly, and I mean quickly, was bored with this book. It is written on a 2nd grade level, and tries to teach lessons that only a 2nd grader would find enlightening.There are so many things wrong with this book, I don't have the time, or inclination to highlight them. Especially annoying is the forewood which states that if you don't like this book (the story), that if you don't find the stories enlightening, that you are somehow missing it, and not able to realize the value of the book.

I was given this book by my principal and was ORDERED to read it. After this we were instructed about all of the \\"wonderful\\" changes that we would be honored to be a part of. Less planning and lunch time and more responsibility outside of the classroom. As a added bonus, we were going to be reviewed in the classroom by a set of new and unproven standards made up by people that had never taught. All the while being reminded with the mindless and gutless performance of the rodents in the book. If you receive this as a \\"gift\\" never turn your back on the person that has given it to you.

And if you are already there, then spend your money on a book which actually helps you get where you want to go, like \\"What Color is Your Parachute?\\" Yeah, this little thing is short, but why waste your money? This book's cost of $12 is hardly justified, either. I couldn't believe the list price of $19.95, at least they dropped it down some.

Upon finding the cheese, the characters are all very happy, but when the cheese is gone, 2 of the characters quickly move on to find more cheese, 1 moves on reluctantly when he realizes that he does not have a choice, and 1 stays in the same place, whining and crying that his cheese is gone. The cheese is a metaphor for anything you might want. The maze is obviously the path you must travel before reaching your goal. The moral of the story is to understand that when something is taken from you, whining and crying about it won't help. You must take action, commit yourself to your goal, and envision yourself reaching the goal before you meet with success."},{"rating":"1","title":"INANE GARBAGE","review":"This is easily the worst book I have ever read. It talks to the readers as if they are idiots. The authors take the same old worn out subject of change and how it can benefit you if you are willing to recognize it and move with it, taking risks if necessary. This is an incredibly simplistic attempt to condemn the individual for not fulfilling their dreams or ambitions, when in the real world our society is a complex system in which all can not possible success, personally or professionally. That is evident in the control that 1 percent of the population who owns 90 percent of the wealth has. This book at the least is childish at the worst a blatant attempt to sell the reader on the flawed American Horatio Alger line, which is unobtainable for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't need a book to tell you this","review":"These concepts are not new. To anyone thinking of purchasing this book, set out a half-hour of an evening to think about change, instead of taking that time to read this book. Plus, you can probably infer what the author is going to write. Johnson shows the \\"revolutionary\\" new concept that you have to adapt to change...does anyone else find this funny (adapt and change mean the same thing)? Don't waste your money on a book that takes a large amount of time to tell you what your subconcious can do on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did I put my resume?","review":"If you don't \\"swallow\\" this inane, paternalistic, Orwellian crap, you must be resistant to change.

It disrupts our lives, hopefully eventually for the better. Meanwhile, how do we manage change? Spenser Johnson gives us his suggestions in the book \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\"I have read self-help and managerial books consisting of hundreds of pages. After each chapter, I can sum up that chapter in a sentence. Spenser Johnson makes his points succinctly and humorously, in only 94 pages. This is appreciated after some other books I have waded through, containing less insight. This book was definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple minded garbage","review":"I gave it one star because it is not possible to give zero.all what is said in this book (be prepared to view change positively and respond to it timely) is known to a 5 yr old child and reading this book only TELLS them (without saying how) you need to change which is easier said than done.It is like telling someone you need to lose weight , how helpful is such advice?Any major change can only be brought about by determination, sacrifice, courage and taking risks not by reading a book, (inspirational stories might help)I am amazed at the IQ of the average American if they think garbage like this can really change their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid Book Only a Corporate Manager Could Love","review":"Several people I know have been given this book by the companies they work for. Fortunately, I work for a small firm where the managers are also active employees. They don't do \\"management\\" type things that must be taught in MBA programs. So I borrowed the book and read it and would now like to get the time back that I wasted doing so. This book is incredibly simple, offering slogans rather than any new ideas, and it makes assumptions that all people are alike. Not only should you not read the book, if your company gives it to you, you should probably begin looking for a new job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Surprise - my boss made me read it.","review":"Admittedly, I approached this book with suspicion, since I have found the \\"One Minute Manager\\" to be one of the most idiotic and dehumanizing approaches to leadership in my lifetime.

Is this really the reading level of the average American? Or just my boss? 2. Maybe my boss is trying to tell me something. Guess I'll call back that interview offer after all.In other words, I would not recommend giving this book to any adaptible, intelligent employees whom you wish to keep. And I doubt it will affect the sheep in any way whatsoever.To individuals who want to know what the fuss is about, you'd probably better read it just so you don't look uninformed. Try your library.

I think the maze is an appropriate image because it suggests that we don't know our course and can find triumphs and upsets at any turn. It also emphasizes that our not liking the way things show up won't make a difference, but that adapting and creating new solutions will make life more fun and a lot easier. Johnson prescribes going forward with intuitive hunches despite the ever-present fear of change in our lives. I'm glad I read the book and that I followed a reviewer's suggestion to read another book as well: \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. I've read many books that have pointed the way to a great life, but this one went right to the heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in the places you'd like get out of, but getting into the moment will set you free.

Ever feel like you work for an idiot? This book is downright demoralizing and depressing when it's given to you by a company you slave 8-5 for everyday.

It describes change in life as somebody moving the cheese away from you (and the other rats). So adapt you must!Its a deceptively simple message, and you would have probably read about it somewhere else before.But once you get the message, there is little left to get from this book. It offers no hidden insights or messages that you can't get from the initial reading.

While Jarlsberg got in some good pokes, I don't know that he grasped the true horror of the original book as deeply as Brown.Brown gets it spot on when he writes: \\"Some readers of this book's early manuscript preferred to stop at the fable, without reading further, and interpret its meaning for themselves. Still others preferred to stop after \\"the Loitering,\\" and never think of the book again.

In other words, the whole thing could have been type-written on two pages! And here's the message: Life Changes--if you don't change with it, you'll get left out.

It wasn't long before I found myself skimming through the exploits of Hem and Haw. I'm all in favor of a simple approach, in fact I think a simple, straightforward approach has largely been lost in our sea of over-information. But self-help drivel does not a simple take make.

It took me about an hour to read, only because I had trouble staying awake. Maybe I missed something but if anyone thought this book was innovative or unique in any way then they just don't read a lot. Two words I would use to describe this book would be trite and boring. Did anyone learn anything from this book that has not been told and said over and over again at least a million times before, and in a more engaging and thoughtful way? Not likely. Still after I saw the success this book had (weeks on the bestseller list, go figure) it made me wish I had written the book since by now I could have been happily retired in Hawaii somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Unless you can get it for less than $5, do not buy it.

The only good thing about the book is you can finish it in 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just borrow someone's copy","review":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" deals with one of the most important topics in today's business world, but I'm afraid it does more harm than good because of the lightweight nature. While the message that change happens and we must be flexible enough to respond is good, the book offers little guidance on actually doing it.This book is likely to fall into the hands of executives because it's a quick read, but will likely leave them thinking that just telling people they have to change is sufficient. As someone trained in change management, I can assure you that is very far from the truth. Getting people to change successfully is much more difficult than decreeing it be so.I would recommend this book as a light-hearted introduction to the world of change, but would definately follow it with another of more substance. I'd recommend \\"Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers\\" by Kreigel much more than \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lamest of the lame","review":"Spencer has one metaphor here, and he squeezes it dry, to no good end.

Overly simplistic and an insult to make the comparison with mice being forced to find cheese elsewhere and a person being laid off and having a $2500.00 morgage to meet, family to support and bills to be paid. I would recommend this book to parents who want to help their 4-7 year olds see that change can be good. For adults, I would recommend reading a book on how to deal with the harsh realities of life.

In fact, I was quite bored for about 1/2 of it. However, when Haw finally starts to take action, some of his insights are fairly inspiring. There's really nothing new here, and certainly not all change is good, so don't take the message TOO seriously. It's not ALL attitude, but much of it is. For example, sometimes life just throws stuff at you; when that happens, your attitude does make a difference. The best parts simply encourage you to face your fears and find the good stuff, the silver linings. Make lemonade, to use another cliche.You can easily skip the discussion at the end, and probably the intro as well. Don't expect anything earth-shattering. It's a pep talk, no more, no less.

It's more like a pamphlet than a book actually, the kind that you would read at the waiting room of a doctor's office. It deals with how to handle change in our lives and in our fast-paced everchanging world, and the author creates a parody of how 4 different personalities react to change.

I have also gone to the website: ... Very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - on one topic","review":"A nice simple read but this book is being recommended a bit too strongly for what it can really deliver. I got the message about 1/4 of the way through the book. I felt beaten over the head by the time I got to the end. Also, there's much more to managing change than what is described here and unfortunately some people I see reading it come away feeling more capable to manage change than they truly are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Bad Sermon","review":"One other reviewer described this as simple but useful.

There are four basic characters. Two are mice who are nonjudgmental and just want cheese and two are little humans whose whole self-image is based on the cheese. One day they have to face change and adjusting their attitudes toward the change. How they let go of the old and face the change unafraid makes for an interesting journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Littlepeople and Mice","review":"I am somewhat interested by the characters in this book.

For a very anxious person like myself, the book attempts to show how silly anxiety regarding change can be and (2.) The book is very short, therefore there is no reason why people shouldn't read this book and judge for themselves if they like it or not...On the other hand, the content of the book is quite simplistic and the point that it is trying to make is no different than the advice that any friend would give you when going through a trying situation; for example, losing a job, going through a tough break-up, etc. There is always \\"light at the end of the tunnel\\" and \\"no door ever closes without another one opening.\\" This is the type of advice that you can get from a friend that would serve the same purpose that this book serves.

Despite the breathless acclamation of this book by executives of all sorts, the truth is this book contains nothing of value. The premise of the book (the absurdly simple fact that \\"not all change is bad\\") has somehow been turned by American corporations into an article of faith (the absurdly false \\"all change is good\\").If your company makes you read this book, it's probably a sign of bad things to come.

But this one,I have always been suspicious about. Then a few days ago, a friend lent it to me and I read it ! The message was simple, good and must be embraced. Since the message is obvious, we need a story to keep it alive in our minds, so Hem, Haw, Scurry and Sniff was created to act thier parts.

It's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, obvious, and overpriced","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the worst \\"business\\" book I've read. I put business in quotes because it barely even qualifies as a business book.

It would have been overpriced at $5 yet I found out I paid $17 on my Kindle.The best thing about this book is that it only takes about an hour to read so, while a waste of time, it's not a waste of a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I'm not a regular reader of \\"self-help\\" books, but I bought this one because I had heard it described as \\"amazing\\", and, frankly, because it sounded sort of fun, all of these little people and mice running around having life experiences inside of a maze. Also, it was very short, so I figured that even if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be making too much of a commitment. Now that I've read it, I wish I had my money back and I wish I had my time back. It's not insightful, it's obvious. It's not clever, it's patronizing.

The premise of the book is to convince you that things change, and it says that in about 15 different ways, and then tells you to accept change. Hardly an original thought between the two covers which are pretty close together. It's more like a pamphlet than a book. But it is being used as a tool by management to cow their herds into submission. I believe HR managers who use this sad excuse for presenting change should be ashamed of themselves (they should read \\"empowering HR in the M&A process\\"); management that endorses it is lacking in communication skills (they should read Jack Welch's Battle Plan for Corporate Revolution) ; and intelligent readers who buy it will be embarassed that they succumbed to the hype (they should read anything else). \\"The glass is half full\\" -- I just saved you [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendously condescending","review":"This book is a tremendously condescending parable, bordering on propaganda, about how corporate America doesn't owe you a living. If the last ten years has failed to drum this reality into the American workforce, spending precious money on a badly written story about mice won't do it either. My manager handed these out as gifts one Christmas, which I thought was ironic and in poor taste (\\"here's a patronizing story likening capitalism to a rat maze, and you, to a rat. Enjoy!\\") I suggest that everyone considering this book invest instead in one that elucidates the history of American labor, its founding ideals and modern day failures, and then ask themselves whether they agree with the message in \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" (that being, our laziness and lack of creativity as workers solely determines our experience with economic misfortune in this country)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analyzing our attitudes toward change","review":"Having read several of the reviews of this book, I am struck by a recurring theme. Many of the reviewers who disliked the book also expressed hostile viewpoints about change, either personal or in their workplace.This is not a how-to manual or a cookbook. If you are looking for a guide with Steps 1,2,3 to dealing with change...this is not it. What it is is a short story with a point to it (Aesop's Fable's comes to mind). Read it and think about how it applies to situations you find yourself in. Share it with your kid's and talk to them about trying to be Sniffers and Scratchers instead of Hemmers and Hawers. While on first approach this looks like a quick read, that is deceptive. In order to get something out of it, you;ll have to put some thought into it.Personally, I found it thought provoking and worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better left unread","review":"I wish my manager had saved his money and simply passed around one of the many inane heart warming \\"true stories\\" that get passed around the internet. This book is pop-psychology for the CEO-set. Inane and ultimately confusing, the book's ultimate \\"theme\\" doesn't hold up to even minute philosophical scrutiny. Once considered, its theme actually becomes ominous, and if I worked anywhere else I would be concerned for my job and would probably take it as a sign to look for better chesese.

Who Moved My Cheese and one other book has given me that extra push to even take a shot at the american dream of owning a business - an internet franchising business. What ever happens to the business is not an issue. The main thing is that I was able to get out of my comfort zone and do something diferrent and take risk for a change.

It's fantastic. Now compare the success in sales with - as an example - Richard Farson's \\"Management of the Absurd\\", which is a great antidote against Johnson's book. Johnson's cheese book is about change, but surely not about change in the brains of those who promote the book. Farson, however, asks the leaders themselves to take the lead in really changing their attitude to management. Obviously that is asking for too much: Amazon ranking 22872. Farson's book ist for strong leaders who can cope with complexity and absurdity.

How to get people to buy a service or product is no longer based on the quality of the service or product but rather on the strategic format of the presentation.This book was sold on its references to the former success of its author.

The message is meant for everyone, however, and is presented as a clever and useful allegory, bringing to mind the message vehicle that made Aesop's Fables so famous.

If you are really seriously into self-help, however, you definitely should start with the easy-reading, life-changing book by Remick called \\"West Point: Character Leadership Education\\" which will provide you with the philosophical basics that support ALL of the self-help books on the market.

One friend mentions recalls a story called \\"Who moved my cheese,\\" and tells his friends how much he and everyone who knows it likes the story.The second section portrays two mice and two men in the story of \\"who moved my cheese.\\" The moral of the story is as stated above.The final section returns to the group of friends, where they all agree that the story was wonderful and they all loved it.The print in this book is so large, that the 90-odd pages probably contain less than 1000 words.

In fact, I had a hard time of hurdling the first flaw in the writing... the cheese is described as the consolidation of what one would want in my life, yet the entire book removes the power from the entity creating the cheese to say that the cheese can be molded and removed from someone's life.

This is the crucial part of the theme (what change our perspective), while the book does little on discussing it.Also, it seems that the author has assumed that changing existing practice (or thoughts) in response to change must be good (rewarding), but sometimes resisting change may also be an option.

This is a story I like to tell when I meet up with some old friends, after a high school reunion. I was given this book by my terrible boss, and told I had to read it. I did.

We peons were smothered with insider \\"cheese\\" references from apple polishers for far too long afterwards. I managed to sneak a peek at this \\"book of wisdom\\" during my lunch break, and was less than impressed. The book's key points - stating the obvious using cute mouse/cheese imagery - were made in the first few pages of the book. These management fads have really deteriorated in recent years. At least applying Miyamoto Musashi's \\"The Book of Five Rings\\" or Sun-Tzu's \\"The Art of War\\" to business exposed the reader to literature instead of simplistic pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless hooey.

It is an embarassing statement lack of confidence by upper management to the competency or common sense of the employee. If this is the degree to which they are stooping, maybe a move to improve the human resource dept. would be money better spent.... do they really think thier employees operate on this simplistic level? Very insulting I would think. Perhaps the people who perpetuate this in corporate environments will be embarassed when the \\"buzz\\" wears off, you know, like \\"paradym shift\\", \\"lean and mean\\", and other buzz words that cost irrevocable damage to some companies.

The steps used in looking at change are clear, but running forward without checking what is around the corner is just as dangerous as not moving. This book connects what is needed for change to a happy ending. The middle steps of strategic planning and predictions are missing. What would be most useful is if a Stephen King element was added. Around the maze there are traps, the unknown is not always safe and without planning can be very dangerous. There are many other books that are more informational and useful when looking at the changing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile, stop telling us what we already know.","review":"All management staff was asked to read this - only takes about thirty minutes.

In fact, to call it a book is a stretch. It is more akin to a long pamphlet.I can't believe I actually read the whole thing ( even though it on only took about 20 minutes).It did prove one point ... come up with a catchy title and you can sell just about anything.And yes ... to all those who see the deeper meaning in this novelette ...

This is very insulting.3) Too high a price for such simple ideas. The message is basically that if someone moves your cheese, you shouldn't keep going to the old place, hoping to find it there.4) I don't see the author as a peer, and that doesn't help. He has an M.D., a lot of money, is more likely than I to be giving orders than receiving them, and is not subject in the same way to layoffs, downsisizings, restructurings, etc. It seems fairly clear that he has found HIS cheeze by looking in new places, so maybe there IS a useful message in the book; however, I still get the feeling I am being patronized by someone who knows very little about my situation.5) I was practically forced to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your boss hands out Who Moved My Cheese, BEWARE!","review":"\\"I like to give this book out to all my employees before I lay them off.

Whether it be changes with your career, your relationships, or even the direction your life flows in, this book has thought provoking guidelines that will stimulate you to examine and question your own destiny.

The story-in-a-story convention feels horribly forced and by mixing mice and littlepeople, the author took an easy out rather than work out the story's details.Because of poor writing, I have concluded from the author's story that: 1) It is good to let a friend starve rather than leave your own comfortable stash of cheese (how Haw left Hem). 2) It is best to act like a rodent.A better author would have delivered the message with more consistency and greater satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese?

If what this tale wants to support is that a worker always must be profitable and his past services are not worthy any longer, that is not new nowdays. Each one must try to update his knowledge everyday to be profitable, but the company also bears some responsability. It's easy to get the maximun outcome from people, not investing on them in their training on new tools and years later discover that the worker is outdated. Then simply replace them for \\"updated ones\\". It's so easy, but at least do not blame on them as lazy \\"little men\\". Not to mention the application on private lives. Must I replace my wife if she is not wearing sport shoes?."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply wonderful","review":"Like Dr. Johnson\`s other books, WHO MOVED MY CHEESE is a simple allegory which hits the mark. You can\`t help but feel a bit silly as you read it and realize how often you\`ve dealt with life\`s little, and not so little, disappointments in non-productive ways. (At least I couldn\`t). My suggestion is you copy \\"the writing on the wall\\" of the maze in the book, tape it on your mirror and read it over every morning. Not since Dr. Johnson\`s YES OR NO (another great book) have I seen such important guidance expressed so clearly. For a few dollars and less than an hour of your time you\`ll be on your way to making the most of every opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a joke, right?","review":"I think this book must be a hoax. The basic premise is so thin it could have been written in a single page.

This book was a good starting point in helping me to realize that although it can initially be painful and challenging, change is good & even necessary & we shouldn't be so afraid of it. It gets 4 stars, though, because it makes adjusting to change seem like a very easy & simple task, but realistically, it is often very difficult to adjust to change and it can take a long time to adjust regardless of how open minded you are to the twists & turns that life gives you. Overall, it is a really good, helpful book & everyone should have a chance to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very simplistic book.","review":"This book reminds me of another worthless best-seller of a few years ago.

Nice and relaxed, so I thought I would give this book a go thru. At first, \\" Cheese\\" what does this mean??? Well, like the books says, it can mean anything you want it to. Each quote, in the book was a different situation and fits to several different things going on in my life. Some huge some just trivial things. I also found myself alot like some of the characters, Hem- who doesn't want to do anything except complain about it!!! Haw- who goes after it and tries to look for it, again and again. The two mice who just go from the beginning and look for it with no regard to Hem and Haw.

He realized that there are millions of managers who lie. They tend to tell subordinates there's cheese when there isn't. It's a short sighted motivator with an obvious and easily foreseeable downside. The subordinates eventually find out there is no cheese and never was. They get mad and the managers get a persecution complex. Dr. Johnson recognized this and asked himself, how can I make millions by selling these liars some feel good nonsense? He shrewdly wrote his book on a third grade level so they'd be able to understand it. These managers enthusiastically buy multiple copies for subordinates and force them to read it. It's filled with childish, easy answer BS so the guilty feel better about screwing the people who work for them.

The parable can only be useful for those who never has absorbed the unconscious reflection on the ancestral lessons of life which already are codified even in the most mutant DNA sequence that rambles nomadic in the planet.The morals that I interpret are: The women do not exist, or at least within the context of the success they do not have capacity or they are unnecessary. Maybe they are lost in the darkest turns of the labyrinth or maybe they are the anonymous manufacturers of cheeses. It only concerns the individual. . The society does not exist. Only the mice reach their goals by instinct. If you want to succeed follow the mice or at least act like them. If you want to succeed leave the friends.

No!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One good thing","review":"The way I look at it, if you can cull one really good thing from an experience, then the experience was worth it. For me, the simple thought of \\"what would you do if you weren't afraid\\" was it. This simple little thought has made me rethink and move forward more quickly than I previously would have.If you're already an adventurous person bent on changing the world, read this book anyway.

Whether it is a job change, divorce, terrorism, or any sort of newness, Mr. Johnson manages to speak into almost anyone's \\"changing\\" situation. His admonition to change our paradigm is a cogent one. After all, because dinosaurs could not adapt, they too became extinct.

I thought I would by the tape instead of the book and am very happy I did. The writing is not very sophisticated and makes for a much more interesting listen than a read. Perfect timing for a drive to work and back. Some of the points are obvious and maybe even a little corny but still worth remembering.

In fact, I had a hard time of hurdling the first flaw in the writing... the cheese is described as the consolidation of what one would want in my life, yet the entire book removes the power from the entity creating the cheese to say that the cheese can be molded and removed from someone's life.

Although this book does not contain many pages, it contains useful insights on how you could face and manage crisis and difficulties. The author does not explicitly and clearly state what you should do when facing crisis, so you need to think about the insights behind by yourself by first identifying which character in the book you belong to. Then think about who are your competitors, who are your potential competitors who are preparing and trying to steal your cheese, and think of how you can react on their actions and how you can equip yourself.Reading this book only needs about 30 minutes, but you can gain insights for your whole life, quickly read this book and recommend to your friends.Point to note: remember to read the preface before you start to read, you will find you understand more on the background of the story and would be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for very few words","review":"Are you kidding? $17 bucks (kindle version) for something that took me a half hour to read?

I thought I had tried everything over the counter available, but I hadn't even heard of Pernox! It is an excellent product. I doubt that it is just the Pernox working alone since I do use other good products, but since I started using it, my skin has improved so much. Way fewer pimples. My skin is still oily of course, but Pernox gets away the oil better than any other face wash, without drying the skin. My skin feels so clean and soft after using it too! I look forward to using it every day. Pernox isn't a miracle worker, but if you're looking for a face wash that actually does something for your skin, this is what you should use! It is quite expensive, but at least you only need to use very little of it each time you use wash. The 4 oz tube lasts me a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Skin","review":"I have used this product for about 35 years.

The conversational style of writing about knitting reminds me of EZ, but the patterns are from another world all together. They are edgy and like nothing you will find at the mall. While there are only one or two of the patterns I can ever see myself making, I loved this book for how it opened my eyes. The pictures, diagrams and instructions are clear and well written.

Even some of the designs that, at first glance, seem too far out grow on you over time. My major problem (and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) is that the garment sizes are TOO SMALL for anyone in the plus or nearly plus size ranges. That leaves many of us out in the cold. \\"Loop-d-Loop\\" has some wonderful patterns for scarves and other such items, but sizing problems limit the usefulness of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"teva duram should learn to knit...and add","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. I knitted the riding jacket in Teva Duram's Loop D Loop book. I have never seen so many errors in a pattern. I knitted the medium size and none of the numbers in the pattern worked. The origional cast-on number yeilded 10 too many stitches in the back of the jacket at the bottom of the arm hole separation and there were still 2 more increase rows to go!

She obviously has never knitted her own design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of errors","review":"As an experienced knitter, I found the ideas very interesting and exciting. However, knitting the actual pieces is fraught with frustration. The instructions are both poorly written and contain *a lot* of errors. There are no 'correction' pages on her website nor did she answer any emails regarding the pattern instructions. Several expert knitter friends suggested that rather than continue to waste time attempting to dicipher and amend her instructions, I ought to simply look at the photographs and create my own set of instructions. Not at all what I expect from a knitting magazine editor and designer.

Yes, the patterns in this book each and every one are absolutely gorgeous BUT choice on sizing absolutely sucks. I am a good knitter, but cannot rewrite a pattern myself. Therefore, not a single clothing pattern worked for me. My daughter fell in love with the ballet top but I cannot make it for her because she isn't a size 2/3 or 4/5, the ONLY choices.Highly anticipated and equally disappointing... just because I'm big doesn't mean I don't want to knit and wear something gorgeous.

My niece has a brother, four years older than she, who presents the \\"Olivia\\" persona analogous to my niece's \\"Sophie-like\\" tendencies. To give a four year old a book which exemplifies more \\"you should be like me\\" than \\"just be the best you can be\\" is, in my opinion condescending and lacking in building a child's self-esteem.

It's a polemic against Richard Bach's 1970 bestseller \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". The author alleges that Bach's book was probably the result of satanic visions. This thin premise doesn't really go anywhere; it's all just an excuse for this little theological tract. The author didn't fancy the idea that some readers (and Richard Bach himself) saw JLS as a Christian allegory, or at least didn't fancy some of that allegory's thrust...so, the attempt is made here to launch a cultural counter-strike against JLS's popularity and acceptance.As a sermon or two, this book is probably fine.

A disappointing study","review":"Professor of New Testament and Early Judaism in the University of Tubingen, the author is keen on cohering Paul's own declarations with the accounts given in Acts. He necessarily brushes aside contemporary scholarship that sees more literature than history in Luke's Acts. By doing so, his presupposition leads him to anchor Paul's training in Jerusalem. He also considers that the earliest Christian community was a hellenistic one, rivalling in the Jerusalem synagogues, explaining that their foremost member, Stephan, angered the Jews who stoned him. Paul carries on the pogrom in Jerusalem and then in Damascus before his revelation of Christ who abrogates the Law. Not surprisingly, Hengel holds that Augustine and Luther were the only ones to fully understand Paul. The book is a short apologetic essay full of twists to level the difficulties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed more thought in the design","review":"The problem with this colander is that all of the holes are located in the very bottom portion, which is made of hard plastic.

I purchased the DVD in Australia and I gotta tell ya -- WOW!Same tracks as the CD. First few times I played it I was mildly impressed -- then I remembered to flick the Dolby Surround button on the amp. What a mix! Most engineers get it wrong but Bob Clearmountain did a fantastic job -- one of the best surround sound mixes yet.The only critism I have is this -- Andrea and band followed the MTV unplugged thing to the letter. All sitting down. Unfortunately I think you can hear a problem with Andreas Corrs voice. Every musician knows you get a better sound from standing up than from sitting down. It also didn't help having Andrea slightly high in the mix at times.Well done Corrs and all involved in producing this great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to get to the plot","review":"I have read some of Joseph's books, but was entirely bogged down in this.

Just the right weight, cool handles, totally flat bottoms, oven-safe, nonstick inside and out, really fine pots and pans. Just get yourself a set of silicone spoons and whisks (and be sure they have silicone handles too, not metal handles that you'll bump against the edges of the pots).

I have to say I'm highly disappointed in it. In fact, after listening to it just once or twice when I first bought it, 6 or 7 years ago, it sat on my shelf until just this past week. After listening again, I found only one track good enough to write home about, the rest mostly a jumble. Definitely NOT the theme-based set from start to finish, which is what I came to expect from APP after all those wonderful earlier albums. I disliked Gaudi so much that I've given it away to a thrift shop.

I gave it a 5 in durable because i don't know how many times i dropped it and it's still in awesome shape.(except when i dropped it on my older brothers foot then the tail fin fell off).

With this item attached to your hose/unit you can use the small 1lb propane tanks and the small coleman tanks will fit.

At first it worked great but batteries died quickly (I had to replace them 3 times in less than 2 months). Then it all of a sudden decided to stop working all together. What a drag...and of course now its past the return period so im stuck with a crappy pepper mill that doesn't work anymore. Thumbs down on the Trudeau."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS, DO NOT BUY","review":"THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS ONE STAR IS BECAUSE ZERO DIDN'T SEEM TO BE AN OPTION. THE BOTTOM WAS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE AND CLOSE TO INSTALL THE BATTERIES. BUT THE WORST THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL, BARELY WORKS AT ALL. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR A FINE GRIND, NOTHING CAME OUT. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR A COARSE GRIND, AN OCCASIONAL BIG CHUNK CAME OUT. NOW I HAVE TO GO TO THE HASSLE AND EXPENSE OF RETURNING IT. SINGLE MOST WORTHLESS PRODUCT I'VE BOUGHT FROM AMAZON EVER. I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BUY THIS NAME BRAND OF ANYTHING AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seizes in High Humidity","review":"If you live in a climate w/o humidity, this works really well. Otherwise the salt locks the motor to the shaft that turns grinding the salt and the whole thing seizes and becomes nearly impossible to fix. After trying to force the motor out (motor is supposed to disconnect from the shaft in order to refill) with no success, I eventually filled it with hot water from the top, allowing the salt to dissolve enough to separate the pieces. I have the matching pepper grinder and this problem doesn't occur (which I assume b/c pepper is not water soluble). After separating and drying thoroughly I tried it again, and now it's locked up for a second time. Worked will in the Pacific Northwest, but not in the South.FYI - The \\"chrome finish\\" is 100% plastic. Still looks pretty nice, but there's no metal on it anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality--will not last","review":"It worked well for the first few months, then it began to require constant adjustments to keep the peppers grinding. Finally, after only 8 months of use, it stopped working completely. Motor turns, but mill does not--appears to be defective gear inside the mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great, then fizzled out","review":"At first, I would have definitely given this pepper grinder 5 stars. It was nice to have an electric pepper grinder that is easy to utilize with one hand while cooking. I liked how you could chose the fineness of the ground pepper that comes out....That being said, filling it is rather awkward and messy. You must take out the battery pack to add the peppercorns, and once it is screwed back into place, it turns on and grinds until flipped over. After one refill, the battery pack \\"handle\\" itself broke, so that it would not pull out easily. We were able to \\"fix\\" it, but every time we had to refill it, it would break again. Then the 3rd time we refilled it, the battery pack got stuck, and since the handle was broken off of it, I couldn't get it out. I tapped it lightly on the counter and the whole thing just fell apart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elite Graviti Pepper Mill","review":"The mill works very well. Only thing I would change is get a finer grind. Other than that which is a minor problem. We are very satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job - No Sloppiness Allowed","review":"This is pretty nifty. The thing to be careful about is that it starts grinding immediately on tilting the mill so you have to position it carefully over exactly where you want the pepper. It would be nice to have an on/off switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken in four months","review":"This grinder has several flaws. It only went three months before I had to replace the batteries. It is difficult to adjust the grind and have a consistent size grind.Now it has quit grinding the shaft that turns the grinder has come loose and just spins. I am waiting to see how the warrenty is taken care of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"Works exactly as described. You tip it over and it grinds the pepper. Stand it back up it stops. Perfect sized grind. Easy to refill. Best of all it doesn't leave a dusting of pepper on the table because when you stand it back up the grinding head is towards the ceiling not resting head-down on the table. Had it for almost 5 months. Use it every day. Batteries are still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Grinder","review":"Have used for 3 months now, and it performs very well. I use this mill for cooking, and I use a lot of pepper. This mill is plenty powerful and grinds fairly quickly. Uses 6 AAA batteries, but still going strong on original batteries. Very easy to adjust grind from course to fine depending on need. Easy to fill, but a little tricky putting the base back on because, by design, it starts grinding when it is upside down and you put the base on the unit. One note, you need to turn the base with a bit of force until you hear a click."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful not to overfill!!!","review":"I love these, I have one each for salt and pepper and they work great with no mess on the counter, unlike my more expensive Peugot mill. 6 AAA batteries are standard for battery operated pepper mills, fyi for those who feel it's an odd number, stock up on AAA at Costco (I was lucky to find two mills for the price of one there for the holidays, but they are not always available there). But I must caution you, that if you overfill these even a little bit, or if a pepper ball gets caught in the mechanism you will ruin the mechanism, and it will rotate without grinding, as happened to some reviewers. This one has a nicely marked fill line, I would exercise caution and UNDERFILL, leaving a bit of a space between the pepper and the fill line and you'll be safe. It won't ever look completely full, but don't be tempted to top it off. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"auto pepper grinder","review":"I love this thing! It automatically grinds your pepper corns. No twisting or turning. Only 1 hand needed which is super when I already have my plate in my hand. I should have bought the salt grinder too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like this pepper mill","review":"Great peppermill. Works great - exactly like I expected. Just two minor negatives...it could hold more peppercorns, and it is not real easy to refill since you have to take it apart from the bottom. If it had been refillable from the top, I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient - just tip and grind","review":"We love the convenience of this pepper mill because you don't have to press and hold a button as you do for many of the others.Bought one from Amazon after the one we bought in a store finally died. The previous one had been used for about 3 years ... almost every day. Even with fresh batteries, it just whirred without producing any ground pepper and it didn't seem to be jammed. It is unfortunate that it didn't last any longer, but for the price and convenience, we feel that the product it worth it.We'll probably buy additional ones for gifts and maybe a spare for ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight","review":"Handy item....but feels a bit cheap. Stainless steel finish on plastic? Plastic just does not belong on quality kitchen products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non operating Trudeau Elite Graviti Pepper Mill","review":"The product worked for approximately one month and then it stopped operating when tilted to discharge the pepper. I have changed the batteries twice, but to no avail. I also found that the bottom cover could not be fastened securely to the body of the shaker. I have taken the drive from the salt shaker and found that it works in the pepper shaker. The bottom cover, however, still remained a problem. I would like to negotiate an exchange if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Workmanship Poor Design","review":"The concept is inticing however the execution in assembly and the overall design is poor.

I've been using it for two weeks, just about everyday, and today I can no longer adjust the grind setting (it appears to be stripped). It's supposed to tighten the grind by turning the knob clockwise and counter-clockwise to loosen it - all it does is spin around - no change in the depth of the grind. There is also NO CUSTOMER SERVICE phone number on the box or the pamplete inside of the box, which leaves me with no alternative but to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"What a waste of money!

It explains in detail Nilsen's early years, and the profound psychological effect on the 6 year-old Nilsen when he sees his first dead body - the corpse of his beloved grandfather.Although Nilsen's crimes were horrific and, to us, senseless, you cannot help but feel immensely sorry for a man who is so consumed with loneliness that he prefers the company of a corpse to no company at all, hence the title of the book.

It includes tons of ueful information about Amsterdam, but I wish it had a lot more detail on the rest of Holland. (I suppose it is truthfully titled!). Another nit to pick is the inadequate maps.

The newest edition of the Alfred's Basic Guitar Method and other titles from Alfred actually use a lot of pieces from this old method. The new edition books add up to a worse method though.

I love the original version and couldn't get into this one - it's so weak. I like the song I am a dreamer and could sell my soul for the L.

It's an interesting premise, and I had heard various people recommend it, but it left me with a blah feeling. It is a fairly engaging adventure, and it's kinda fun following people through the story. But a lot of the stuff was really quite routine, and partially due to the fantastic nature of the book, a lot of it just seemed outlandish, even reading in a huh-wouldn't-it-be-interesting-if-this-happened mindset.

That is also the reason why those vested interests control nearly all media outlets.In this movie, those in power (local business interests) were trying by ALL means to prevent a speech (only that!) at a college hall by a democrat (also Democrat), in the person of movie director and social agitator Michael Moore. They were afraid that he could influence public opinion (an overwhelming majority for the RP) and change the political majority and its agenda, although the chances were practically inexistent.As Saint Augustine said: \`Men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.'This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"How and Why Fascism Arises by 'Good Germans'","review":"wow. it's been so long since 1939 and kristallnacht we all forget the mood of the german people prior to the nazi takeover, but here is the psychology all over again displayed as clear as day in this film: the 'good germans' just wanting to maintain the purity of their race, and so imposing the constriction of society and the ostracizing of the other and the tyranny of the narrow minded. Look at how the wealthy ignoramuses in America get to impose their will on everyone else.

I've heard a lot of people say they dislike the changes made to the show for the recent revival, but their casting was mostly excellent. If you're a fan of either performer, you won't want to miss this recording of some of the most well-known tunes of all time. \\"There's No Business Like Show Business,\\" \\"You Can't Get a Man With a Gun,\\" \\"Everything You Can Do,\\" \\"Moonshine Lullaby,\\" \\"Doin' What Comes Naturally,\\" \\"They Say It's Wonderful,\\" \\"I Got the Sun in the Morning and the Moon at Night,\\" and many others are all here.

When I heard that a rival of this show was being done, I ran to buy this disc. Bernadette Peters and Tom Wopat are very good, but the story and music have been rendered unrecognizable from the original. The story has been sanitized to be politically correct. Trying not to offend American Indians, the Overture, Colonel Buffalo Bill, and I'm An Indian Too are all cut. Also, who was responsible for the musical arrangements? Simply awful. Just compare My Defenses Are Down to past recordings and you'll see what I mean. It sounds too modern and out place for a song that was being sung in the 1800's. For crying out loud, why not keep the music in the era and spirit that it was intended? Thank goodness other classic recordings exist. Don't waste your time with this one. If you want to see how this story and music should be treated, rent or buy the 1950 movie when it becomes available this November."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational!","review":"I went to New York 2 months ago and I got to see this Broadway musical!

My money back!","review":"I was very excited to get this cd. I cut my teeth on the Ethel Merman soundtrack and was so excited about a revival AND Bernadette Peters. I have listened to the cd twice and don't think I will again. Ms. Peters seems to be talking with a mouth full of marbles - it's embarrassing to listen to, and her singing, while adequate is nothing extraordinary. Tom Wopat's voice is fine, but the Frank Sinatra arrangements (for example \\"My Defenses Are Down\\") are awful! \\"I Got the Sun In the Morning...\\" seems to be sung and orchestrated while the company was on tranquilizers - gone is the rousing get-down version on the original Broadway recording. All I can say is this must be one of those shows that must be electrifying on-stage (at least I hope this is the case) because the soundtrack, for me anyway, doesn't have the spark to stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where it is Good it is Very Good, But...","review":"I was hauling this CD off to trade it in. Listening to it in the car, I realized just couldn't part with it. My biggest complaint is that many of the new arrangements of the old Berlin/Bennett tunes are too \\"eager to please.\\" Why? Invasive orchestrations. The Bad: a horrid Sinatra-style swing arrangement of \\"Defenses Are Down.\\" (Berlin was NOT a swing composer, no matter when this show originally premiered.) The Bad: Bernadette Peters' 2 big ballands really drag. The Good: there's a lot, actually. All of the country tunes are spirited and charming. Peters has more fun with dipthongs than any singer ever. And, the bottom line is that the Annie and Frank relationship comes across in this recording.

Rubber mount will dampen vibration, but it wouldn't last longer than polyurethane."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Ripley","review":"Although Highsmith stuck with her formula (two deaths per book involving Ripley), this book was disappointing and a bit boring. Somehow I think this book evolved out of Highsmith's curiosity concerning \\"what if\\" Ripley had a kid (what would his fathering instincts be like). It really doesn't work in this one and Ripley begins to look sappy rather than sinister in a passive way. Also, Frank seems way too precocious for a sixteen-year-old. Arguably the worst novel in the Ripliad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid. Outrageously Entertaining.","review":"Patricia Highsmith said that she was interested in the effect of guilt on her heroes. Nowhere is this more true than in her novels about Tom Ripley, a man who has no sense of guilt. In The Boy Who Followed Ripley, we see Ripley in a parental mood, as he takes a troubled young man under his wing. No mere synopsis can do justice to the delirious plot, but suffice it to say that Ripley gets to show both his paternal side, and his maternal side. The sneaky sense of comedy that has always lurked in the shadows of these books comes very much to the forefront, and the reader will be astonished that Highsmith had the guts to conceive, write, and get away with this remarkable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy","review":"This book is definitely my favourite of the Ripley novels. Patricia Highsmith has an incredible ability to detail the touching relationship between Tom Ripley and Frank Pierson. Ripley remains a murderer who sees his dark deeds not as crimes but as necessary steps or precautions. His regret, for instance, when recalling his murder of another character in a previous book is cold-hearted and very funny: he remembers murdering the man by hitting him on the head with some wine. He then recalls that the wine was a good quality product, and he regrets having chosen that particular bottle to commit the deed.Oh how I love Tom Ripley novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinite bore!","review":"Highsmith's Ripley series is charming, intelligent and, most of the time, thrilling. However, this is a clearly dissonant note: \\"The Boy...\\" never reaches the surprising heights (or depths) of psychological insights of her earlier books. It lacks rhythm and consistency and its characters are not less than unbearable. In one word, this book is a terrible bore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Mature Ripley","review":"I was enthralled with \\"The Talented Mr Ripley\\" and looked forward to reading this book and was not disappointed. It is not as good of book as Ms. Highsmiths original, however, that being said it has some gut wrenching moments. Tom Ripley becomes the fascination of a wealthy priviledged boy with a troubled past. He seeks out Tom for guidance with a life that much like Tom's, has turned suddenly sureal. Tom can connect with this boy on a level others cannot, however will the boy be able to carry the same kind of burdens Tom has grown accustomed to? That is where the basis of the story lies and shows the difference in how each individual acts under severe circumstances. This one is a good read with a fateful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Guy Turns Good","review":"Patricia Highsmith spent way too much time stalling, I thought. The build-up process for this novel was tiresome. It was worth it though for the scenes where Tom Ripley finally took action, and ultimately for the novel's ending. Even a character like Tom Ripley isn't one-hundred precent evil. A compassionate, parental side to this character surfaces -although he always seems to be dissecting life. This novel is a great read partially set in Germany when the Berlin Wall was still in place. It is out of context with the other four novels though."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are sleep on nothing.","review":"Agree with previouse reviewer. It is fluffy first, when I go to bed.

The Minus-X Affair is about a Thrush scientist who has invented a drug called Plus-X that enhances a persons five sences. She also invents the drugs counterpart Minus-X, which turns a normal adult into a babbling five-year-old. One of the cutest scenes in this episode involve Napoleon.

She seems to really enjoy how the Dragon bounces in un-expected directions when thrown across the room. Like another poster has said before, I am not sure how long the tongue or tail will last (due to the flexibility needed, the rubber is thinner), but I avoid this problem by not getting into a tugging match with her.

The picture alone it looks plush and not rubber. My dog hates rubber toys he will catch them and immediately spit them out in disgust so for me it truly was not worth it. Still, four bucks on a rubber toy I still think that is a bit much. Especially how tiny it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premier Pet Squeeze Meeze Jr. Dog Toy, Octopus","review":"This dog toy greatly disappointed me because of the 8 curled legs that were attached to the body and could of easily been chewed off and possibly get caught in the animals throat.

That being said, within 3 minutes he had chewed off both the tongue and tail of this dragon and probably would have eaten both if I wasn't monitoring him with his new toy. If this thing starts falling apart with only a few puppy chewing minutes, it has no chance with adult sized dogs. Yes, my dog loved it, but I don't want him taking apart and eating a rubber dragon.

He enjoyed this product immensly! The neighbor boy(age 6), my daughter(age 6), and my son(age 10) all enjoyed boxing this bag along with each other. These all stayed inflated really well, and the children didn't get hurt playing with them. The only time the bag and gloves did deflate a little is when i used an electric pump on them, however once I blew them up again manually they stayed inflated for weeks. I was very happy with these products, and so were the children. I would recommend these to any family that has children that they don't discourage play boxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplistic yet still good","review":"This CD is not bad, the only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the sound isn't as developed (which is understandable for the time it came out) and seems simplistic to me.

I hope that the publisher will consider putting it back in print, as this is one of the few books on the subject in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most talented R&B lyricist delivers once again!","review":"I was hooked on Gary Taylor from the first time I heard his 1988 \\"Compassion\\" album. This amazing artist delivers once again with \\"Love Dance\\"- a CD well worth buying even if only for the title track. With refreshingly artful and intelligent lyrics, layered on a base-line that cuts you up inside, Gary Taylor steals from our inner beings the words we would all like to say to the one we love- and he says it for us.

Like its title, this album IS like a love dance, with slow, sexy, lyrics and a rythmic beat always lurking in the background. Gary Taylor's smooth, velvety voice is the perfect accompanyment to these jazzy selections. A must listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Stars, Great CD!","review":"What can I say about Mr. Gary Taylor, not only is he a sight for sore eyes, but that voice is ever so engaging. His music is so underrated. He should have a Mantle shelf full of Awards. The songs on this CD are so romantic and mellow. The title of the CD is so appropriate, it definitely is for a Love Dance. The songs that stick to my mind are: Love Dance, You Can Have It All (Ladies imagine the man of your dreams singing this to you), You Complete My Dreams, and Will You Come Back. I Love your music Gary, keep them coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing game","review":"I loved the movie Minority Report, and eagerly gobbled up the book as well. However, I expected more from a video game based on my #2 movie of the year, Your meager three weapons--A compressed air rifle, pellet shotgun, and spark machinegun--can only hold one clip, and the auto aim takes all the fun out of combat(not to mention the fact that you couldn't kill people). Unarmed combat isn't much better due to hypersensitive controls--it took me 8 tries to execute a combo in training. The foes are unimaginative and easy, and John Anderton looked nothing liked tom cruise. I ended up getting a little bit of fun out this game by turning on the FPSSTYLE and MRJUANEZ cheats, the beating it in about 10 hours. There are definitely better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 4 year old never cracked a smile","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old and he didn't laugh once. He thought the zebra riddle was cute but the concept of most of the riddles doesn't make sense to him. He is very intelligent, but the terminology to most of the riddles don't speak to young children. Such as \\"Name two kinds of wood you would use if you made a statue of Clifford\\" answer: \\"Giant Redwood and Dogwood.\\" Or, \\"What did Clifford do to get rid of dog pounds\\" answer: \\"He went on a diet.\\" If you get the riddle it's cute, but I found most of the riddles to be dissapointing. Most younger children don't get puns or riddles altogether. My son and I read it twice, but it will probably go on the book shelf never to be read again. He loves Clifford, but this one just didn't add up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with Pump-n-Seal 30 Day Guarantee","review":"I purchased the pump-n-seal from the Pioneering Concepts website, hoping to use it on both jars and plastic bags as advertised. The method for sealing plastic bags was ridiculous so I opted to return the product. It was never used and barely unpacked. After contacting the company about returning it, I was told my refund would be minus my original shipping plus an as yet undetermined handling fee and, in addition, the refund would be lowered because this is a food product that could not be resold as new. I was offered a rebate of $8 on my $42 purchase and told I could keep the product. Since there would be additional expenses to ship it back to get a refund of less than 1/2 what was paid, I opted to keep it. Hey - anybody want to buy a pump-n-seal cheap? Never used!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had the old version","review":"I found the old edition of this book in my flat when I lived close to Chichibu. I lived in Minano, which holds the last temple in the 34 temple pilgrimage.The book gave some good information but I felt not enough history about the different temples or the different sects that each temple follows. Never the less the book is very good and better than the cartoon map that you can find in town.Any book that can help you get off the beaten path in Japan is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"best to avoid unless you prefer his silly side...","review":"if you prefer Loudon's comical/not so musical side you might enjoy this CD; however, if you prefer a mix of serious and lighter songs as i do, you are much better off buying Attempted Mustache, History or Last Man on Earth, all of which i think are really much better. to be honest, i thought most of the songs on this CD were pretty poor, and did not seem to reflect much effort or significant emotion.

I have no first-hand experience of him so I cannot comment on that.However, I was very turned off by the writing of Hans Holzer.The book reads like an infomercial.I wanted information; instead I got a very long and not terribly useful advertisement for Kolman.We are informed how to contact him for healing at very high prices.Actually, there are many wonderful healers out there. I have worked with some of them or met them. They are people of integrity in most cases.None of them commissions a book to hawk themselves like a product in the marketplace.This book does a disservice to Mr. Kolman if, indeed, he is as great as Holzer claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Alice Munro","review":"I borrowed \\"Runaway\\" from the library. Now that I have read it, I have no choice but to go out and buy it. One read will never suffice.On the surface the stories seem straight forward, perhaps more so than Munro's other recent books and yet they are rich and complex.These are stories of great humanity. Outcomes are not predictable and the smallest of decisions can change a life forever. A word not said, a second glance not taken, have huge consequences. The characters and plots do not follow a predictable course as they would in a lesser fiction.Even the less sympathetic characters are drawn in shades of grey and we feel their pain and humanity. In the title story, a bully of a husband is a complex man who may or may not destroy, depending upon so little. We hold our breath in dread, hoping that those around him tread lightly.This collection of stories is simply breathtaking and deserves to be savoured again and again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent short story collection","review":"Alice Munro is the queen of the short story genre. I have read other collections of her stories, but this one is memorable. It is a worthy winner of the prestigious Giller prize. Her stories seem so straight forward and simple at first glance, but as you finish each story, you realize that there is a complexity there and it forces you to go back an rethink the story again. These stories are all very good, but my particular favourite was \\"Trespass\\". It almost took my breath away with it's hidden meanings and nuances. I usually do not read short stories, but I make an exception with Alice Munro. Hers are absolutely wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and well-written. A great collection/great writer","review":"RUNAWAY is one fantastic collection, the same way McCrae's CHILDREN'S CORNER is and the way HAUNTED is. All are stellar short stories and thank goodness that these authors are still plowing the fertile ground of this genre. The story whose impact lingers longest is \\"Powers\\" which is too big in all ways to try and summarize. Read it, and be moved by writing that seems beyond storytelling, that feels like Truth Itself. Reading Munro at the height of her art is like listening to John Coltrane play the saxophone - there's a point where analysis breaks down and all you can do is pay homage to genius. I highly recommend that you check out this wonderful collection today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone wanting to actually read the story","review":"This book is essentially a poor photocopy of an incomplete previous publication of the Shackleton journals and report. There are multiple missing and illegible pages. Of mild historical interest only, not for anyone wishing to actually read the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I debated about buying this book and I should have gone with my gut instinct. It was a waste of time. The only reason I finished the book was because I paid for it, otherwise, I would have shipped it off to the local Goodwill store. I didn't particularly like Rafe and Imogen in Kiss Me, Annabel and they were no better in their own story. If anything, I wish the book had centered more on the Gabriel/Gillian story - that was a more interesting/heartwarming storyline. Unless you find this at a used book store or at the library, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time and hard-earned cash on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly unreadable","review":"I bought this book for a long flight and was looking forward to a great read. I could not have been more dissapointed. I felt like I walked into conversations without any context. The first chapters with the sisters bantering back and forth was terrible.I could not finish this book. Nothing made sense to me. I will admit that I did not read the first books in this series, but I have picked up many books in a series and while I knew I needed to go back and catch up, I understood the plot. A great author or even an okay author should be able to engage a reader anywhere in a series.This was like watching Matrix 2 without seeing or understanding the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"I will refrain from summerizing the plot, as many other reviewers have done a fine job.All I have to say is that I really, really wanted to like this book, and I was really looking forward to it, for I loved Imogen's and Rafe's interaction in Kiss Me, Annabel. The first half of this book was decent, and I enjoyed it; however, something happened in the second half. The characters seemed to lose their wit and edge. I found myself trying to stay awake and wondering if (and when) the story was going to be resolved.I don't know what happened, but this story just stopped drawing me in, and when I finished, I was disappointed, for I was expecting a much better story than the one I read.Having said all this, I have to admit that this book might have been better if I hadn't had such high expectations for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no taming, but really lame","review":"this book was so badly written. i couldn't understand how the two main characters fell in love with each other. in the other books as supporting characters they had more meat to them than in their own book. several scenes in this book had sooooo much potential to expand into something more, but the author never expanded and explored those possibilities. the ending was so rushed, when i was reading it i thought to myself \\"huh?!!! that's it?!!!\\" the way james wrapped up the ending was so lazy. not worth the time and money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I have read all of the Essex sisters novel and this is the only one I can truly say I disliked. While I always enjoy Rafe, Imogen always comes off as needy bordering on downright b*tchy! She spend too much of the story pitying herself, talking about herself and whining about how much she's suffered. I was hopeing that her story would be different, that she would be different. But the side story with Gabe and Gillian was well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of effort!","review":"After reading the first 94+ pages and STILL in building up the story line/character intro and getting nowhere... I had to stop. I hate the way the author scatters subplots all over the place when it should be focused on the hero and heroine. I don't think the introduction of Gabe and Rafe together is a good call--I got confused figuring out who's the main hero (Yes, after 94+ pages later, you still can't tell). The book is badly organized and hero & heroine are just weak and faulty people. Definately not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving heroine","review":"The third in the series about the Essex sisters, this is about the Madonna-like Imogen and the drunken duke Rafe. Rafe had redeeming qualities and I definitely wanted to root for him. Imogen, on the other hand, was such an unlikable character, despite the author at some point having her say that the way she had behaved was not her true character. Her jealousy and subsequent treatment of Tess was heartbreaking in the first book. Understandably when one is in pain, one can lash out, but her cruelty to her sister was too much. In the end, Imogen gets to be a duchess - how unfair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I thought the characters were lest than memorable and the story line was just plain and boring. Haven't read a book this bad in over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hopeless muddle","review":"Shakespeare was a great writer of comedies as well as romances. Eloisa James is clearly neither in this tedious fumbling of errors. What worked in the 16th century clearly does not work in the early 19th, or us reading it in the 20th.A romance is one hero, and one heroine, falling in love. Not a whole group of characters we could not care less about all being jumbled together for the sake of trying to sell a 'series.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rose by ANY other name....","review":"may smell as sweet, but calling it a rose sure makes it easier to order at the florist. This usually dependable brand name author just loses it in this confusing story. The names of the characters--Imogene, Rafe, Lady Ancillary-something--make it very hard to follow who they are. Descriptions are few and then when one character is consistently described as \\"fat\\" or havinga belly, then--poof!--he loses that one identifying characteristic. There also seem to be a couple of charming love stories hidden in here but I needed a trail of breadcrumbs to find them. Far too much work to be any fun--pass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tghe Taming of the Duke Essex Sisterss book 2","review":"Very good book.

This one has all the elements -- the single, inquisitive female sleuth with obligatory cats, the small town with its deep, dark secrets, characters with names like Bathsheba Butterbaugh -- but the end result is an improbable story-line filled with improbable elements, all told in a writing style that sometimes borders on the insipid. Tori Miracle is making a return visit to Lickin Creek, PA. On her last visit a historic building was burned and someone was murdered, as Tori keeps reminding us. Surprise! This time the same things happen. But the doctor says that Percy Montrose died a natural death. That's not good enough for Tori. She's convinced he was poisoned. Why nobody thought to do an autopsy until much later in the book is never explained. There is an attempt at a twist at the end of the book, but it's so lame that any perceptive reader will have seen it coming well ahead of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Food for Thought","review":"This book is a very good introduction into herbs and flowers that can be eaten as well as used medicinally or as garden plants.It is very basic, and will be of little use to the experienced herb gardener or kitchen herbalist. There are about five paragraphs of information for each of the 50 herbs listed; background, how to grow, how to use, top choices, and hints and tips.Where I found this book excellent is the colored photographs and the Latin names make plant identification very easy. Basic information for drying, candying, and other means of preservation and propagation is included, and there is a zone map and an excellent index.Beautiful in its simplicity, this is a very good starter book, and recommended as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tom and Jerry","review":"The Fast and the Furry is my son's favorite, probably has something to do with the cars. It's classic Tom and Jerry hijinks with neither of them able to talk.

Both want it so Tom and Jerry create their cars from a junk yard and off they go. All the characters in the movie are fun and silly - lots of visual gags.Blast off to Mars is not as good as The Fast and the Furry, but it's still a fun space adventure movie with silly characters and visual gags."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was for my kid.","review":"She loved it and happy that ther were no scraches and worked just right and recived it on time and fast"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom and Jerry video","review":"My 4-yr-old son loves Tom and Jerry and the racing on Fast and Furry is hilarious.

The Hinge Is the Achilles Heel","review":"I had two of these cases. On the first one, the cheap sheet-metal hinge broke after a couple of months, just from opening and closing the case in normal use. After some back-and-forth, the manufacturer finally agreed to honor the warranty and replace the case. After a few more months, the hinge on the second one bent as well, for no apparent reason. Now they refused to honor the warranty. Since they're located in Canada, there's not much I can do. Neither unit was abused in any way, and both totally failed to live up to the \\"Armor\\" name. And the warranty is a joke, since the manufacturer just claims that the defect is my fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Get Anymore Negative?","review":"Being a new mother who knows too many peers with rude and unruly children, I unwittingly picked up this book thinking it would help me to postively discipline my child. If only the back cover stated what it really is about- (how terrible children are); rather it had glowing reviews from the authors' peers. Luckily, each page has an indented paragraph- a highlight of sorts, so it didn't take me long to get through it. I have never read such a lop-sided view of parenting, and I'm very sad to see it come from such an educated and influential person. Needless to say, it was a very depressing and discouraging read. I'm no Pollyanna, nor am I very religious, but this author needs to take a chill pill and appreciate the absolute miracles that are our children for better and for worse. All I could think of was her poor children and daughters-in-laws. Yes, children can be very challenging, but this negative spin was really over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"A KID AND A PARENT BASHER!","review":"Many desperate and frazzled parents would certainly welcome this book with open arms. I thought it sounded like an excuse to bash and dump on childen. Naturally a child cannot give or show the same generosity that a parent can. The relationship is not equal. Naturally allowances have to be made for the needs of children as they cannot care for themselves. What an angry, toxic dumping ground this book is to many groups -- parents, would be parents, praying-to-become parents and children. After reading this Book of Wrath, one wonders who ISN'T included in the free=for all bashing? If I could have given this book a zero star rating, I would have. Don't waste your money or your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The description of the book is not what it is.","review":"I have great difficulty seeing how this book is holistic or for adult readers. It consists mainly of readings that are less than 3 pages and avoids abstract ideas or inferential questions beyond the lowest level. As another reviewer said, it is good for developmental learners, perhaps.According to the manual, the essays included are mostly between 9th and 10th grade level, yet the description from the publisher implies that it is for more advanced readers. The book is skills oriented with more pages of isolated skill instruction than actual mature readings. The editorial review is misleading. To call this book holistic is simply inaccurate. Each reading has a few unimaginative comprehension questions and some vocabulary but that is by no means what \\"holistic\\" means.

I managed to get through a quarter of it before I gave up. To say that Olsen's writing is confusing is an understatement, it is not even confusing in a good way, like house of leaves. Case and point an entire chapter that is an internet chat between two characters, but nowhere in that chapter does it indicate who is speaking which lines, just line after line of all caps text. While his descriptions are vivid they tend to get in the way of the story and do little the help further the plot. The entire first quarter of the book could be summed up easily in a handful of sentences.

His book was somewhat off track when he went into his \\"fantasy characters\\" in one of his chapters instead of providing more hope and better treatment guidelines. he seems to focus on old issues as opposed to new medical and psychiatric information which would have made the book more helpful. It read like a \\"basic guide' as opposed to something more scientific or helpful to the family in need of assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Most Accurate Portrayal or Research","review":"As a Romanian immigrant, I found this book very inaccurate and it did not tell the full or accurate story of Romanian culture. Groza did not do accurate research in the history of Romania nor does he really understand the issues related to the institutionalized children and the evolution of the problem. He makes some very off the cuff remarks which further lower the books quality and make no real sense in the context of Romania and how families can help the overall problem. It is clear Mr. Groza needed to do more accurate research about the children as other research in the field which has been published disagrees with his \\"studies\\" which seem to be more of a \\"survey\\" than true scientific data. This book may also be a bit misleading to families about to adopt from Romania as, again, the whole tragic story and conditions are not being told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas but a bit off track","review":"As a Romanian, I found many of Groza's statements to be inaccurate although he tries his best as an American-Romanian. He did not seem to really understand the evolution of the Romanian culture which led to the serious problem of children in institutions (you would have to live there to actually know as opposed to just visiting). I could not figure out the relevance of his last few chapters talking about characters in a mocking sense--it just did not fit in the book's main topics. Having seen many of the children who have been adopted out of Romanian institutions, I don't think Groza gave a full picture of the long term problems these children are facing as well as their families. There are certainly good outcomes, but it seems Groza missed the issue of how the children fair over time as he is not a doctor who treats patients--more of a researcher on sociological matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"irresponsible","review":"This book falls short of what one would expect of an academician such as Victor Groza.It is poorly documented;it is inaccurate historically,and his chapter re: Charlotans is completely irresposible,unethical,rude, insensitive,and ridiculous.That chapter is filled with all kinds of innuendos-sexist,racist,etc.As a social worker he is clearly in violation of NASW ethics.His attempt at paradoy is pitiful.While he vaguely attempts to disguise internationally known experts in the field of adoption,he fails-everyone who knows who is who knows the individuals to whom he is referring.This book is of no value to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quality has its price","review":"Dont let the price put you off!!

Yet, these are some great beats. Those who are not into hip-hop, may feel the beats become monotonous, since there is little change in composition from the beginning to end of each song.

The 1991 reprint is a book which, long before, has been slowly chipped away by other scholars, who were unbeguiled. May I suggest The Acentric Labyrinth: Giordano Bruno's Prelude to Contemporary Cosmology by Ramon G. Mendoza as a counterweight? Here Mendoza shows that Bruno anticipated concepts which, in some cases, were only confirmed as late as 1929. Bruno was fully aware of his modernity, and used mental exertion only to arrive at his conclusions. For his work he was regarded with great esteem by Schilling, Hegel - and Goethe, one of the more brilliant men of his day. Mendoza thinks that Yates did terrible damage through her misleading theme, and I am inclined to agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the University of Chicago","review":"This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing. Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991. The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much. The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition. The ink bleeds all over some of the pages. There are diagonal streaks on many pages. Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side. Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing. A note on the back of the title page claims only that \\"The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ...

I was influenced to purchase this CD from the outstanding reviews it received in several publications. I was highly disappointed after listening to Jason Moran's debut CD. This is a very bland performance. I don't know what the critics heard, but they must all be amateurs to give this CD such high praise. Its obvious to me that the record companys are paying critics to write favorable reviews. Jason Moran, like so many other \\"Young Lions\\" have no business recording as a leader. His compositional skills are one dimensional. He has potential from listening to him perform on other recordings, but he is certainly not ready for the leadership role. I'm not trying to trash him as a musician; I just think that he needs a lot more seasoning before he returns to the studio for his sophomore recording.

They worked well together and the music was very enjoyable. In the subject presentation, Ravi Shakar's Daughter played her Satir in combination with another artist. Again enjoyable. This work (Improvisations)must be for the true Raga Music Lovers. The evaluation of an Amazon Customer swayed me into buying this product. I have had a difficult time being able to listen to it. It is not of the same type of use of the Sitar as the Beattles used it. I am told that Mr. Shakar gave a less than kind evaluation of the Beattles use of this instrument.

So, let the buyer beware!Hopefully the entire 6-movement symphony will appear on DVD soon..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this music, but this is a lousy documentary...","review":"There is very little ABOUT the writing or preparation of this music. Instead, Howard Shore, sounding heavily medicated, tells us (or reads to us?) what each piece of music is about and he says that LotR is a beloved piece of literature. Thanks Howard, it's about time somebody noticed that... ho hum...He gives no more insight into the creative process than any lighting technician or gaffer could have done.Contrary to somebody else's review, all the music is NOT here by a long stretch. This isn't the full concert and even the full concert did not contain all the music composed for these films.Sorry to say that I wasn't even blown away by the musical performances.Overall a disappointment. I'm not sure why I'm giving it two stars instead of the minimum-allowed one star. Probably out of recognition of the overall artistic achievement of this series of films.

I always imagined his books were boring and completely symbolibic to the point that you don't understand it. However I enjoyed this book and all the short stories involved in this. All the stories were interesting and connected the theme that the \\"winner takes nothing\\" in different situations. I enjoyed the fact that since he probably wrote this in Europe, Hemingway weaved French and sometimes German into the dialogue. Also in one story Fitzgerald is mentioned as a wild child. \\"Winner take nothing\\" is an easy book to understand and follow, and the stories are original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mix a history and magic","review":"I am usually not a fantasy book reader, let alone a reader of fiction.

That said, I like this album a lot, but it doesn't match the hype that it received as being a return to their harder roots. Some songs are pretty rough, but the overall feel is more on par with Animosity, but overall: a far cry from their self-titled album. As far as I can tell, it's the next step in the natural progression following Seasons, or maybe the darker half-brother of Seasons, still son of Home, and full-blooded sibling to Animosity. Yeah, that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale and tasteless.........somewhere between 2 &3 stars","review":"Boy were these guys awesome once......years ago. With the release of Animosity there was a change in the band. They were going down hill(in my opinion). I lost interest in them and never picked up Seasons or Double Wide. 2005 a new release, a new record company and a new guitarist Sonny Mayo( ex -Snot right on). Those facts peaked my interest once again. I went to Best Buy picked up the CD/DVD combo for $9.99. Ok so far,so good right ? Though the album starts of decent enough with a few heavy melodic typical Sevendust songs you begin to realize the have been doing the same boring patterns for a long time. The same chorus over and over and over. The same drum beats in the chorus over and over and over. Get my meaning.

Besides a couple of classic Sevendust tracks like Shadows in Red, Hero and Ugly, this is a strained effort. I'm sorry for all you fans out there, but lets be honest, this is a little substandard.It cruises along at a pace that makes me feel like i'm listening to a Sevendust B-sides effort!!I want and expect better from a quality band.

This album fuses them all into one! This album is genius. Every song is excellent. You will not skip any song...each has its own heavy riff and/or catchy chorus.

Some may call this idealistic, but I find it pragmatic. The student-teacher relationship is built on a foundation of trust that both parties have learning as their goal. Within this book I found concrete methods to help build this trust.I also found methods to help build knowledge in a meaningful way--such that the knowledge will affect students lives. An example is the math teacher who introduces the concept of a function by throwing a pen, then prodding the recipient to recognize that in order to catch the pen, he used information from it's trajectory to extrapolate where it would be at the moment of capture. This simple example illustrates that learning in it's natural state begins with questioning.I am very appreciative of this beautiful book. It's well-founded conclusions based on thorough research will make a difference in my teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely vague","review":"This book presents itself as a serious source of ideas for becoming an effective college progessor. However, it is extremely vague to say the least. The author indicates that it is the product of 15 years of research but no serious data are provided; it's all anecdotal. For a better coverage of effective college teaching read \\"Saints and Scamps\\" by Steven Cahn, which is shorter and far deeper in its coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for college level teaching","review":"This smallish tome is an excellent summary into the mechanics of college level teaching, and the best practices of the best teachers.

If you're thinking about how to be better at you job as a teacher, then find a different book.This book starts with the conceit that the author found good teachers by finding prize-winning teachers. How many of your best teachers won teaching prizes? My experience is that the best teachers don't seek out this type of acknowledgement. My experience is that the best teachers, much like the best students, and for that matter the best workers in most fields, are largely focused and anonymous.And it wouldn't have been hard to find these people.

I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled, but there were also a couple other issues. First, the bottom was extremely slippery (pun intended). Maybe this would improve with wear (like outside on concrete), but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor. Second, the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe. I could feel it clearly, even with socks on.

It makes me wonder if the recipes were tested before they were printed or what. I'm curious if others have had any problems!?

I even forgave that song for the other material. Luther Vandross and Patti Austin's vocals are prevelant on this effort. They give it, along with the other background vocalists, that extra something that helps you to embrace it. It also didn't hurt that David Sanborn lent his saxophone prowess.

It made me understand why she has had to write it in another name. This book is one that, wether you like it or not, it brings you into touch with the kinds of things and people that we are living with today and sadly enough, unable to do very much about. The way she lives shows us living in Europe and America and places like that, just how lucky we are. It was one I couldn't put down even though the things I was reading greatly desturbed me at times.

By all the incidents in those two books, regardless of the names being used, one would be sure enough of whom those two books are talking about. I would not be surprised if the identity of this so called princess was identified by her family, relatives, or friends. In the sequel part, the author tried to explain why the princess' identity wasnt discovered, but her , the author's, reasoning was terribly weak! I think, as a personal point of view from someone who knows the culture very well, that this story is a fictious story that was based on some gathered data that the author believed would be a hot selling novel. The author gathered what would interest and, most importantly, entertain the general public here in the United States, and that is basically what you read in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Women Story","review":"This book is full of contradictions and mistakes.

It certainly doesn't even resemble any of the people I know there. Of course most of the readers of these kinds of stories are probably people who would never travel there so how would they ever know the truth. I suppose that's why alot of these books get sold.

Women who fly with permission to Paris & Milan to shop don't give up this life quickly. I did not get the purpose of the book's message if there was one or why it was even told.If she had really cared about her children and a life to chose, why did she run back to the money with a husband she no longer loved or respected. What life will her son and daughter have except the one perpetuated by the same society which doesn't breed authentic people, only games from both sexes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready for a shock?","review":"If you are at all interested in human rights, read this book. It is a shocking true story of the physical and emotional torture endured by women in Saudi Arabia, told by an anonymous princess. I liked it because it was told with a calm, human voice; without \\"screaming,\\" making harsh accusations, or pouring out propaganda. It simply tells of the events of one woman's life and lets you make your own judgements. Princess Sultana's story is horrific, painful, and almost unbelieveable, showing that being a part of a royal family does not exclude one from the sexism and oppression faced by many women of Muslim faith. Includes a glossary, maps, and translated relevent excerpts from the Koran. You won't believe what you read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliest thing I have ever read.","review":"Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I read this book and I actually laughed, untill I found out what a stirr it had caused in the West.This book is the silliest thing I have ever read, but if you are a person that beleives that every Saudi Arabian has a 4WD camel, and an oil well in their back yard, THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of Fictions","review":"\\"~The book was written in a very good way. I could not put the book down until I finished the last sentence(that is why i gave it one star). growing up in Saudi Arabia, I find princes a fictional book. For example, FGM is NOT a Saudi tradition, and never was, nor is the dark room, in which supposedly Saudi female would be put in for life as punishment for adultery\\"~ facts and not fictions. Infact, the book DID have some valid points, but was ruined by the rest of the events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This is an extraordinary book. How sad to know from the time you were a child that you were not wanted or loved as much just because you were a girl. It is not hard to believe this story because lately, more and more stories have been in the news about the plight of the Saudi women. This book made me feel sad and angry that women are still being treated like possessions rather than like humans. I think it is great that Sultana had the courage to tell this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!","review":"After reading this book, people will have the clearance that this culture of Saudi has no correlation whatsoever with Muslim practice.I'm a devoted Muslim woman, and never in my life was I ever mistreated as it is described in \\"Princess\\". This book is a very interesting book to read about seeing facts over life incident from a woman's point of view. A woman with a very strong cultural background. This book should enrich your point of view and analysis towards your own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for women!","review":"I have just finished two of Jean Sasson's books and I cannot believe the emotional journey she took me on. First, I would like to commend Jean for her writing and bringing us these books. Secondly, I would like to thank the Princess for having the courage to be the type of woman Saudi Arabia needs to start turning the country around concerning women's rights. After reading the books I wish I could meet the Princess, because I feel that I have a connection with her as a woman. These books are riviting and will make you want to do anything you can to help women in the middle east. I always knew things were harsh for the women over there but after reading these books I cannot ignore their plight any longer. The books will inspire you to do something, on any level, to help change these women's lives. I have a deep respect for both of these women and recommend that you read the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at Saudi Arabia as a woman/still timely","review":"Even though Princess was written 20 or so years ago, little has changed in S. Arabia for women. The subject of this book risked her life to tell the story and I could not put it down. This book takes you behind the walls of a privledged member of the royal family of S. Arabia. As an American women, I found it truely fascinating to read how limited her freedom was (and still is) and also a bit thrilling to read just HOW rich they are. Post 9/11 and Gulf War as an American, I wonder alot about the Arab world who appear to have such a difference in thinking than the western world I live in. This story will transport you into the deserts of Arabia, shed light on the psyche of the Arab culture and Muslim religion, while weaving a story full of rich characters. I recommend to anyone who is interested in learning more about the Arab/Muslim culture. As a footnote, the kindle version I read had some translations of Koran relating to women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do women live like this","review":"This was a good read.

One would think that as descendant of the great leader, King Abdul Aziz life would be luxurious with one opportunity after another..and for the males that's true..but as a female born and raised in the Royal family life was severe and restrictive.This book is very well written and you wont want to put it down. Most people have no idea what life in the Middle East is like. It will shock and sadden you to read about how cruel and harsh life is for females (children and adults) and the sickening double standards allowed for males. This book will open your eyes to the true nature of Islam and just how intolerant and incompatable it is regarding human rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luvheidi","review":"If ou don't read the mail.

This book really helped me to understand their basis for treatment of others. Though these men are very westernized they still have the core ideas that are brought to light in this book. The autrosities that women suffer in the Saudi culture are amasing to me as a westerner. I have suggested this book to my co workers who must try to find the easiest way to work day in and day out with someone who apperas to be westernized but still has the very basic idea that women are servents and have no opinion. Great book! It has helped me in my every day life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked To Action","review":"Like so many readers of this book, I started it and couldn't stop until I had read it in its entirety. Throughout our world, women are being oppressed, abused and tortured, merely because of their sex, and we are free to take action to help them! This book can help you to be informed, and it can help you to understand the religious fantacism that led to the Sept. 11 attacks - some of the hijackers were Saudi! We must write and speak out on behalf of these women of Asia and fight for their human rights. I am sending this book to so many friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, informative and emotional","review":"This should not be thought of as a feminist book! I think that scares people away. My friend recommended this book to me back in 1995. I have always been fascinated by how women are treated in the middle east. This was an amazing and informative book. I think I read it in less than a week.With everything that is going on right now, I highly recommend this intensely emotional look into the lives of Saudi people and the human rights atrocities that still take place. The world has turned a blind eye to it all because, God forbid, we tell other countries what to do with their women folk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulden't put the book down....BUT!!!","review":"I have read both books and it was one of the few occasions when I completly finished the book in one sitting. Lot of the imagery in this book is very accurate but clearly it has been exsaguerated. I have live in the Middle east for 15 years and I am a muslim so i have first hand knowledge of this subject. The life of the women in Islam is not as dismal as the author may have you belive, Most of the women pefer the vail and are quite happy with there life. They are not like silent sheeps as protrayed in this book, I think in over all the stories have some truth to them but to make it a bestseller the author had to SPICE IT UP so the public would be entertained. It is still a very intamate look at the life of the Muslim women that you dont often get to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"I MADE my 20 year old daughter read this book. I wanted her to realize, like I do, how fortunate we are to have been born in the West! I will NEVER, EVER take my freedoms for granted.It was hard to believe most of what we read, so we asked a couple friends who lived in Saudi for a few years how true it sounded. They verified that it was \\"so very typical\\"! Even if only 25% of what we read is true, it is still unbelievable. Every woman should read this book and thank God for being born free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling read","review":"I became absorbed in this book and read it in two days. It is fascinating to read about the cultural norms in Saudi Arabia. It is also haunting to read about the malevolence that many of the characters feel toward the U.S. given that this book was written well before 9/11 (written '96 I think). Although the book is supposedly non-fiction I cannot believe it to be a true account of one woman's life (I'm not the only reader to have such doubts). However, it did seem that the author tried to convey the patriarchal society of Saudi Arabia in a true light."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling and intriguing","review":"Princess is a powerful book providing an eye-opening insight into the lives of Saudi Arabian women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Very enjoyable book with lots of information and insights into another world.

The glimpses of life behind a black veil make me realize my own life is pretty darn good! As I reflect on the story, I find that I am not totally sympathetic with the main character, who pops into London for a shopping trip, owns three Lear jets, wears diamonds and rubies, destroys a Monet and priceless vase, etc etc. Someday I hope the women of Arabia realize their true power, unite, and rise against their oppressors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewels, clothes and wealth not worth this sacrifice","review":"It is appalling that in this day of age, women are suffering such extreme oppression in Saudi Arabia. Women are treated as objects, yes, their men, if wealthy lavish jewels and clothes on them, but, their sacrifices are great. They have no freedom, not even in their own home. A female child born to a couple is an unfortunate event, at times, the infant is murdured because she was not born male. The circumstances in this country are shocking and this book shocks you into awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthy story! Buy it!","review":"The stories of this royal princess regarding women's lives in Saudi are shocking. What she has witnessed, learned and experienced is overwhelmingly distressing compared to America's generally good treatment of women. I shared it immediately, among my other office readers after, first, making my teen daughters read exerpts that I marked. All women should read it to be aware of the differences of female lives in countries that believe people are property. It truly educates on the different practice that women are private property versus those that are constitutionally held as equal citizens.Good for book clubs, high school English or college sociology classes. Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not consistent","review":"I am sure that many of the stuff happens in the royal family that was mentioned in Princess, however, I must say that after growing up in Saudi and knowing many Saudi women and princesses, this story seems like it was composed by a westerner who heard about incidents of some saudi women and put it all together in one person, Sultana.I wouldn't believe her story 100%...Ultimately though, the attitude of the book is from a western world-view, you can't view the Middle eastern world-view through it because you will never fully understand it. Also, it gives the impression that this is how the Islamic world is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brave voice is a beacon of light","review":"I admire this extremely brave and kind hearted Princess so much as well as Jean Sasson. It takes guts toexpose what goes on in this very secret and backwards society where a young woman can (and often is)killed for \\"dishonering\\" one's family including lies told about sisters by young men. I read all three books(couldn't put them down) and can't count how many times I gasped. I urge everyone, woman and man,to read these books as a means to comprehend the Arab mentality and way of life.

It is amazing to think that men and women (and women aren't allowed to) interpret the Koran differently...no wonder the diversity in Muslim's behaviors in different countries.

Some of my family lived in Saudi Arabia for a while, and let me tell you that this book is the truth when it comes to life of the women over there. They are treated like they are less than dirt. I don't care what other reviews say on here about how it is not how they treat women, because it IS!! I don't know if it is because they are trying to keep what is going on over there in the dark or what, but this book really sheds some light on what really happens. I really recommend this book.

A must read for anything even remotely interested in Middle Eastern culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely and informative","review":"With the increasing focus on the Middle East, I approached this book in a somewhat skeptical fashion - wondering if the issue of women's rights in Saudi Arabia could be discussed without prejudicial Western commentary. Thankfully, this book succeeded. I believe that this book accurately describes the hardships faced by women who are prevented from discovering their full potential through the mis-intrepretation of the Koran. I agree that all women should read this series and work in their own way to educate themselves about the lack of rights that some of our sisters suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I loved this book, as sad as it was. I could not put the book down. I didn't read it on kindle but am seriously considering purchasing to read again. This is one of the first trilogy books I read and now i am hooked. This was the first book I read from Jean Sasson, and needless to say, fell in love with her as an author.It was fascinating reading about members of the royal family. Things that have always been kept secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Misleading!!","review":"To believe what is written in this book about the average Saudi (or any Arab/Moslem female) is equal to believing that the guests of the Jerry Springer Show are average, typical Americans! In addition, Jean Sasson has obviously not done her homework with regards to learning more about \\"female genital mutilation\\". I suggest that she reads up on this subject by looking up the latist statistics from the United Nations/UNICEF reports which all agree that female genital mutilation is not practiced in Saudi Arabia. Since this information was the subject of a large chunk of Jean Sasson's novel, then I advise all of you to ignore the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It and Be Sickend","review":"This book is a shocker from begining to end. Although it merely restates on a human level what groups like Amnesty International have been saying for yeasrs Princess is a good introductory novel for anyone who is interested in what life for Saudi women is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener","review":"As a military member stationed in Saudi a few years ago, this book became the topic of many conversations, and was read and passed around by everyone including the commander.How it every made it into the country, we don't know, it was an incredible look into a closed society"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic Story","review":"Although the story told is a sobering one, its hard to feel sympathy for a woman who regularly wakes up at noon, has servants at her beck and call to care for her and her children, travels on a whim, spends thousands of dollars without thinking twice and then complains that she leads a repressed life. Sounds more like whining than constructive criticism.Its really the stories of women like Sultana's older sister and the young woman condemned to a dark room for the rest of her life that shock and upset you. I now wonder how the \\"other half\\" lives in Saudi Arabia, what is the fate of women that don't have the financial means Sultana has?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This book is so compelling.

I have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering","review":"This story although well written was hard to read at times because of the nightmarish ways that women and children are treated. It is appaling to think that women and children are not sheltered from abuse and used, abused and/or protected at the whim of the male of the house.Even though some of the events in this book took place years ago, I was shocked to hear that \\"punishments\\" such as stoning and placing wives and daughters in womens rooms existed.This book made me very sad for the women of Saudi Arabia because unfortunately having a male body part and testosterone does not define supremacy or superiority in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Try something else.

The characters China and Jake were cute but that's about it. China hated Jake it seems like throughout the whole book and then she finally realizes how much she is inloved with him. And she blamed Jake for taking both her brothers away when they were grown men and basically decided on their own they want to leave Astoria. Also, Jake and China don't become lovers until page 307 and by that time the book is almost over with. The book was just boring don't waste your time or money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't do its only job.","review":"I bought this DVD rack as a solution to my growing DVD collection. It's very easy to assemble, and took probably only about 10 minutes. Although it is affordable, it fails to do its only job well. When you put a DVD on the rack it will sit, but if you pull one out, the DVDs next to it will swing down so that the edges are no longer horizontal with the ground but perpendicular with the edges of the rack. Then to make it look decent again, you have to pick it up and put the back edge against the small back corner again, knowing full well that the next time you pull a DVD out or put one in, you will have to fix each DVD again (unless you don't mind your DVDs looking bad). On top of that, it's constructed out of aluminum rods (OK) and cheap, brittle plastic. When it was shipped by movers, although it was well wrapped and in a box, the whole thing shattered. Before it was even shipped, the top section broke off when the rack tipped over (in other words, it is not stable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, Some Flaws","review":"This media rack is pretty good. It was incredibly easy to put together (no tools required - the only one that's needed is in the box), and it works. It stores a lot of games. We have about 60-70 games and have a few empty spots left open. My only gripe is that it isn't very sturdy. If you bump into it it's likely some of the games/DVDs/etc. will half fall through the holes on each rack. Moving it with everything on it requires surgeon precision but IS possible - we've done it twice. The dividers/ends are of mediocre quality (they don't really slide smoothly), BUT they do do their job in keeping everything on there. Really as long as you don't plan on moving it or have rambunctious animals or kids running around the house, I think this is a really good rack for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little rack","review":"This is a good space saving rack.

It isn't exactly the most stable rack in the world but it is adequate if you don't intend to overload it. The assembly was easy once I figured out the instructions.

If you want to wall mount it then use a phillips head screwdriver to put the mounts up."},{"rating":"2","title":"pratical for the price","review":"the shelf is perfect for my dorm room because it is compact and holds a lot of stuff, but if i was still at home, i would have bought soemthing else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, please. Period.","review":"Really, this rack is the perfect recipe to drive you crazy in frustration. It looks beautiful in pictures (and from a distance at home too), the price looks great, however the catch is that there are no bases in the shelves. As a result, when you try to keep in or take out the DVDs, they tend to fall through the space, most times they upset the balance of the DVD's in the lower shelves, and when you try to resurrect those ashes, the DVD's on the sides get messed up. Last but not the least, the rack starts shaking if you meddle with it too much, making you shake with trepidation. If it worked great for you, I suspect that you used it mostly as a decorative piece in your media room, not fiddling around a lot with it. Do that, and trust me, it will drive you nuts. Not a user friendly piece at all. Don't buy it. You have money to spare, donate it. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's worse than it looks...","review":"Where do I start? VERY poor quality.Cheap plastic, very light weight must be mounted to the wall for SOME stability.

It was cheap because it is cheap plastic, barely usable for the purpose intended.This looks like it came from the dollar store discount bin. This would be returned, if I didn't have to go through the trouble of disassembling the thing and mailing it back....as it is, I'll chalk it up to a lesson learned, and throw it away.Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra, and buy a WOOD rack unit.

I knew it was cheap, but I did not know it was going to also be horrible at holding DVD's. It was pretty easy to assemble. Good luck trying to put DVD's on it and having them stay on there. The bottom lip of a \\"shelf\\" is SO SMALL that one minor, tiny bump to the shelf while placing a DVD on it, or removing one, will cause many, many to fall off. Once you spend a very painful amount of your time to fill the whole thing up, it gets a little better at holding them on there, but only because there are so many on there. Remove one the wrong way and boom, there you have many on the floor again. This would have been a MUCH better product if the lip of the \\"shelf\\" was say, at LEAST ONE INCH for the DVD to rest on. Two or three inches would have been a GENIUS of an idea. Oh well.. Final word: AVOID"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"When the package arrived today I thought they made a mistake, no way could something like a DVD tower fit in such a small box. Very small. It was correct however, and I went about assembling it, disappointed in my purchase. This thing could be built better if they used spaghetti. Cheap, flimsy plastic is the majority of the construction, and even after full assembly it sits uneven on the floor, wobbles like it's broken, and is so poorly aligned to itself that none of the shelves follow the same angle. I loosened all the bolts and readjusted and that helped, but it still is about as stable as the Eiffel Tower on one leg. No wonder they send wall mount brackets with it, it technically would be more secure screwed to a wall, not even touching the floor, but you'd never get it level. I could have built something out of wood for the same price and had a much superior product. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is by far one the cheapest made products on the market. Its not worth half of the price they ask for.

This product is flimsy and one of the plastic sides broke after about a week of use. The CDs and DVDs constantly fall through the holder as the lip on the shelves is not near large enough. Needless to say, I am now looking to replace this with a better storage unit. Please don't waste your money on this product, it's not worth 2 cents, much less the asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty sufficient.","review":"Some of the reviews I read by others on here were surprising. I've had a 5-tier unit that I bought at Walmart many years ago (maybe 10 it feels like) and it's done a TERRIFIC job of doing what it was designed to do. It's very very affordable, very lightweight, takes up very little space, holds plenty of DVDs/CDs and can be combined with additional units for more storage. Yes it can be a little top-heavy but that shouldn't be a problem unless you're moving it a lot or having it on unstable ground. Mine is completely loaded and I've never had it want to tilt. I got the vibe that a lot of people think a DVD case should be a big piece of furniture and cost a lot but that seems a little silly. This model is downright dandy and I'm ordering another 5-tier and a 2-tier in a few days since I have such an overflow of stuff that I've never been able to store properly. I figure 10 years of adding on DVDs and CDs over time means I'm due for more shelving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compact stand for a small space","review":"I bought this stand because of its smaller size to fit between a fireplace and a window and it works beautifully.

It really was cheap.It can barely hold my video games. In fact if you plan on storing DS or PSP games on it you'll find that the DS games almost fall over. The PSP games have to go sideways, and all of your other media will want to rest on an angle. Assembly wasn't super hard, but it was a pain. I have mine anchored to a wall.

But from the very first page I was entralled in this deeply personal novel. Just Like Beauty is often sad, usually funny, and always weird. But for all of its apparent lapses in conventional taste (in Lerner's futuristic world, girls train for a pageant in which they must butcher their pet rabbits, and teenage boys in the suburbs run amok), Lerner creates a wonderful. This is hardly a usualy, stoic dystopia. This is a rich portrait of Edie Stein, a young girl confused about her sexuality, her mother, and life itself.

I thought we could do with a quirky read-- the sci-fi elements seemed interesting, too. Well, here's the consensus...\\"yecch!\\" We felt like this book started in the middle, with little or no background to set the stage. Many critical parts of the story were unexplained or barely explained. The many sub-plots--the main character's first love, her relationship with her father, why her mother was the way she was, etc.--just weren't developed enough, in our opinions.

I will never believe that humanity will end up like that. People will always have faith in their different religions which is why the world will never become so bad that people approve of their young daughter performing sex acts on robots to win beauty competitions.

The sleeve with the hand only comes down to my daughter's elbow!! And it cuts off her circulation, it is so tight. She can't close the velcro behind her neck. There is a hole in the mesh under one arm. There is a bunch of material sewn under the other arm (poor sewing job). When she took it off, the mesh ripped from the bodice. Only four days until Halloween so there is no time to return it and order something else. Besides we already purchased the matching wig from another store.

Save your money and wait for a better book to come out, or read \\"Business Process Improvement Workbook\\" from Harrington, Esseling and Nimwegen which I would give 5 stars. This is the most disappointing business book I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Age Its Cause and Prevention","review":"I purchased the original of this book that was published in 1921.The book contains excellent photographs of the author Sanford Bennett when he was 72. I assume the current book is a republishing of the original. There are several stretching exercises that are similar to what is being done in modern health clubs. There are 30 illustrated exercises. I found them quite helpful in putting together my daily exercise routine.The author started his rejuvination exercises when he was 50. He was a chronic dyspeptic.He says in 1921 that you are not too old to begin and to commenc now and succeed. The book is a consolidation of articles that Sanford Bennett wrote for the San Francisco Gazette. It is his story well documented medically that shows how he transformed his body from a sickly 50 year old to a healthy energetic 72 year old man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Clear & Durable","review":"I have to give it to Countour, this case is well-made and very durable. The plastic is crystal clear and does an excellent job of protecing the screen (and the whole iPod, for that matter). It even comes with slip-resistant pads that you can put on the back of the case which can come in handy. The only downside is that the case can be very difficult to remove. I couldn't pull it apart with my bare hands for fear of breaking off my fingernails (ouch!), so I used a towel to protect my hands. I know, it sounds like a real pain, but how many times will you really need to remove the case? I only took mine off because I had forgotten to clean my iPod screen prior to putting on the case. Also, considering the wear & tear that this case will save your iPod, the price isn't bad at all. Overall, a great case that will last for a VERY long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good, But...","review":"The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove. I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time. I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod. In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system. I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case as long as you don't take it off a lot","review":"At first I was frustrated with the case because my iPod didn't fit into my universal dock when the case was on, and taking the case off is a big struggle and usually involves a nail file (don't believe the \\"gently pry apart\\" instructions). However, once I figured out that it docks in the case when you don't have any adaptor in the universal dock, I'm thrilled with the case. The only drawback is how difficult it is to open, but that's good too because if the iPod is dropped the case won't go flying off."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a re-release","review":"This orginally came out in 1998. THe album is under the same name: Lay Lo -Simple and Plain. It has a white cover. Lay Lo is a group consisting of Max Minelli and his cousin, JVon. Both were memebers of the Concentration Camp, a group released under C-Loc Records, then Camp Life Ent. Good to have in your collection if you are a fan of their music. Happy Perez does the beats. (Note: Lil Boosie fans, He debuted on the Camp III album on this label.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening Easy Read","review":"A number of Vignettes highlighting actual accounts of people becoming embroiled in the \\"hell\\" of pathological gambling. This is a well written, inexpensive, and easy read. I believe it is useful as an introduction to the topic.With the explosion of Casinos all over America we are seeing an equally proportionate rate of ruined lives related to gambling. The suicide rate among problem gamblers is extraordinarily high. It is most important for healthcare professionals, both in addiction and general medicine, to become familiar with this problem and screen patients for potential gambling addiction. This book was part of my curriculum as an addictions counselor in the state of New York.Another excellent book on this topic is 'Born to Lose' by Bill Lee, who also wrote the book inspiring the movie 'Chinatown'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific editing","review":"This book is riddled with typos, missing words, and even missing sentences. I managed to get through about 30% of the book, but finally could not stand it any longer. The book title is actually very apropos - it describes perfectly what reading the book is like. There are numerous other options out there which are much better on every level, including Behind the 8-Ball and Born to Lose.

Very cool and original...and since originality is so hard to find in extreme metal these days, it gets a solid 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Were King, one of Ronald Coleman's best","review":"\\"If I Were King\\" is set in fragmented France without a Charlamagne to meld the country together. Remeniscent of ancient Greece' citystates, Paris has its own king. The movie is based upon true events. Ronald Coleman is a rascal of sharp wit and tongue who is confronted by a seemingly impossible challenge issued by the King of Paris, Basil Rathbone, with his life as wager. In short, Ronald Coleman is a renegade who is forced to summon his wherewithall where his mouth and pen had previously been.In my opinion, \\"If I Were King\\" is a *must have* for the library of fellow classic buffs. Ronald Coleman was a rare actor who's transition from silent films so enriched the industry. His starring role in \\"The Light That Failed,\\" from the novel by Rudyard Kipling, was perhaps his finest and a personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Vesper Adventures","review":"I've read all the Vesper Holly books (and ADORED each of them) but I'd have to say that this is my favorite. (Followed closely by the El Dorado adventure.) Fantastic plot, funny, exciting, and it gets even more clear that Helvetius is infauated with Vesper - a twist to the series that I found intriguing. I'd love to see a book in this series where they had to work together to solve some mysterious caper - but then I'd love to see another book in this series period. Amazing books, and this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Done.","review":"One of his best book. Can't believe how spectacular.

Azpiazu's orchestra is tight, and peppy. They really sound great on \\"Peanut Vendor\\" and a song that sounds very similar to \\"When Youba plays the Rumba on the tuba\\". The vocals are great, the band plays exellent Cuban dance music . For those who want some pre Tito Puente Cuban orchestra music, this is what Cuban music sounded like before Puente, Machito, and thw whole Mambo, Salsa, afro Cuban jazz movement occured. This band is important historicly, even if there are not jazz solos, the music should interest those fans of 30's big bands, and swing. This is great stuff, and there are some rumba rhythms and some spicy exotic dance songs. Great 1930's Cuban American orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned to solder! (Go figure!)","review":"This kit was actually better than I expected. It has very clear instructions and a lot of tips on soldering. I was successfully able to complete the kit.The biggest downside I experienced with the kit is the soldering iron loses heat very quickly so It can be tricky to get a nice solder. It is even harder to desolder using the desoldering wick because the wick absorbed all the heat. The iron also got dirty very quickly which made the rest of the project a bit more difficult. I am not sure if it's because of the lead-free solder included or just the tip itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice learning kit","review":"The solder is good. The soldering iron is pretty good from what I can tell. The directions were pretty easy to follow although the card with the resisters on it was a lil confusing, this may have just been me though. I still have not gotten the solder wick to work but I admit I am new to this hence the learn to solder kit.The practice section of the bread board was easy to work with although one of the contacts came off and was unusable after that. I assuming this too was because of my inexperience in soldering. After completing the siren the potentiometer quite working which really didn't concern me much given the price of the kit and the joy I experienced completing the kit.I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase and intend to buy more things offered by Elenco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning tool!","review":"This is a great product for anyone who is considering learning how to solder.

I did one soder bridge and the speakers would not work.MAKE SURE THAT YOU GRAB THE RIGHT PART OF THE SOLDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a complete kit for beginners","review":"This product was the first kit I got for my soldering practice. It's pretty simple and it comes with a decent soldering iron and all the other parts for the kit.I was able to build the kit but i ran into a lot of problems while trying:- the desoldering braid (soldering wick) is poor-quaility. I tried several times desoldering a single connection- but no good.- There is no information about solder tip maintenace. I didn't know that i need to clean it with solder cleaner or a tip tinner and cleaner- so after 5 mins of use- i couldnt do anything. This was extremly frustrating.- There is no information about what king of iron to be suitable for electronics. I tried another iron - a 40W without knowing that it could ruin the board completely!other than that its a quite mediocre kit for beginners- considering it's low price (20$)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little kit","review":"This is a great kit. I had no prior soldering experience before purchasing this learner project. After finishing I am more than confident in my soldering skills. A few things to keep in mind are, first there is nothing included for cleaning the tip of the iron but the brass sponges are cheap so by one. Also, having something to hold the board while you're soldering is a great help so invest in a helping hands. Now as for the board itself, it's not the best but it will teach you to take it easy with the hot iron. I learned not to keep the iron on the soldering point too long very quick. I know I read a review where the reviewer said the soldering points kept popping of the board. Well I made one pop off and shortly learned to do quick soldering actions. So it helped me be better. Only one soldering point popped off and it was just one of the practice ones so it didn't even matter. All in all it's a great little kit and is well worth the money. Now I'm getting the am/fm radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just a toy","review":"I bought this to repair a defective board in my car, and it turned out a lot better than I expected. The soldering iron is actually pretty easy to handle and the tips can be removed to add on a bigger or a smaller tip. I actually only needed it for the bit of solder and the iron itself and its a steal considering the price of this kit is only a few $$ more than an iron by itself. After doing my repair, I still had plenty of material left to build the kit. Its awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty, surprisingly good instruction booklet","review":"A great value. However, note that the iron doesn't come with a stand as depicted, and what this means is that while that iron is hot and in your hand, it has to stay there because you can't put it down.The instruction booklet is surprisingly well written. Very informative, really gives step by step guidance along with practice. Detailed in a way that allows you to really understand what you're doing and why as well as why the materials matter.All in all this was a terrific purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good kit excellent booklet","review":"I recommend this kit to anyone who wants to introduce electronics to young people. Kit itself is from quality components but the most important part is its instruction book. After this and maybe a basic radio kit, your son/daughter will have the confidence in basic electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"intr to soldering","review":"Well thought out kit, bought this for my 12 year old and it was easy to understand and a nice as advertised introduction to soldering and went into an explanation of the components."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the butt","review":"I bought the kit mainly for the soldering Iron. I need one to desolder an item i bought online. I'm not doing the desoldering personally I have an uncle who know's how to do that stuff for me. but i was still interesed in trying it out. It would have been fun, but i found that the desolder wick doesnt work well at all. I tried multiple times to desolder something but it just didnt work. And multiple times while soldering a piece on the board, the little metal part you solder to would come off and the solder wouldn't stick to the board. I only got one light working on the whole thing. AND, often times my soldering iron would retain a lot of the solder and i wouldn't be able to do anything. I had to stop multiple times to try and clean it after like 2 minutes because the solder would just stick to the iron instead of the board."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"very dissapointing.

As part of the Malinke community in Upper Guinea, Laye captures the layered tradition and culture of his community, deemed, perhaps by most, to be simplistic or primitive compared to today's modern standards. Yet it is exactly from Layes descriptions of the traditions of his community that we can begin to understand the psychology of the author. Each chapter is rich with imagery, and his words smack of sincerity and innocence, bringing about an effortless quality and flow to his work--it is as if we are there with Laye experiencing his many transitions, from boyhood to manhood. His descriptions of the communal lifestyle of his people is remarkable. Laye's works like other modern African authors reveal the realities of colonization, and help readers to appreciate and celebrate indigenous African traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"In reply to AaLii \\"AaLii's review below \\"I can't believe I read this garbage\\"","review":"I took the time to read all your reviews on books you said were garbage (can't belive u included Things Fall Apart).

He does justice to all songs and soundwise this cd sounds absolutely great. Great songs overall and two of them especially (Strange Fruit and Sky is crying) totally justify the five star rating for me. \\"The sky is crying\\" has me reaching for the repeat button all the time (gorgeous bass!) while the awesome \\"Strange fruit\\" really punches its chilling message home. Utterly moving, and quite possibly one of the greatest recordings of this deservedly famous song ever.In terms of song selection I find the latter half of the album more enticing, but it's obvious John Martyn had a good time recording all the songs. A solid, wonderful sounding album."},{"rating":"1","title":"German the hard way","review":"This method of learning German is not for beginners! Having had previous German study, I was able to understand the concept and process of this course, but with difficulty. There are no English translations on the tapes. The course is more book intensive, and there are two booklets that accompany the tapes. They must both be used simultaneously, which is cumbersome. The rules of grammer are not introduced or discussed; reliance on a separate grammar section is required, and could be understood only by individuals who have had previous study in a foreign language. Sometimes the speakers' voices trail off, and occasionally pronunciation is not distinct. While this is how we will probably hear the language, it is not helpful in the learning process. I think many of us expect to use tapes for learning a language in a more passive way, i.e. in the car. The neccessity to have both books at hand during each lesson makes this kind of learning impractical."},{"rating":"2","title":"De-resonator","review":"Have used this product with great results.

But let me be the first to assure you these recordings of some of the most renowed literature in the chamber medium are at excellent quality for such a bargain price. The Debussy is exceptional - I have never heard it played with so much expression before. There are moments of supreme virtuosity balanced equally with lucid sound. And although - it isn't at Emerson statue (yet) the emotional output far exceeds that pedagogue - that Emerson. My only complaint is that at times - in piano sections - the first violin tends to play inaudibly while it has the melody. The Ravel is phenominal - I can almost picture a 1920's atmosphere - the kind that it paints fo rthe listener - the industrial world of the sound of daily hum drum.

From start to finish it is brilliantly filmed and directed. Vincent Gallo's performance is gripping yet hilarious, and his role as Billy Brown is interesting throughout. I have never seen such a serious movie be so funny. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a story with profound meaning. A low budget film though it may be, the onscreen performances are priceless.

From the time the opening preview that was on the VHS ran through, I knew I would fall in love with it. The trailer alone was just incredible!You can tell that this movie was Gallo's passion. The story is one that no one can say they have lived but everyone can relate to. The chemistry between Ricci and Gallo is akward but perfect, and Ricci's performance is almost too good. You'll want to \\"span time\\" with her too.You find yourself laughing at the parts where you don't know if the scene was supposed to be funny or if you should feel sorry for him.

I bought the VHS when it was first released as a rental copy. The DVD version of this film states that this is a \\"widescreen\\" or \\"letterboxed\\" presentation. I must say however that what they call \\"widescreen\\" is little more than the original VHS presentation with black bars cutting even more from the film! This is a ridiculous concept to me.

This will certainly be one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Spans Time","review":"\\"We're husband and wife spanning time!\\" are the harsh words quoted by Billie Brown (Vincet Gallo). This, I believe, is romance in it's true form. Born out of greed love suffers through constant fights and bickering between the two. Though I suppose this movie better describes Billie Brown as a person. I enjoy this movie because I can relate to this individual. An individual not so smart, not to lucky, and pretty pathedic. Yet he can't be all that pathedic if he wins the heart of Lela (Christina Ricci).The craft of this film is done so well to illustrate Billie's obsession with looking decent to the outside world and Lela's need to be free of comformities. And yet these two characters are perfect for each other, at least for the moment, despite their opposing passions. This movie is hilarious and emotional and just really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't it nice when movies don't suck","review":"Where do I begin, oh at the begining I guess. This film Buffalo 66 starts out as our buddy Billy gets bounced from the slammer and tries tie up some loose ends of his life from before he was incarsorated. He deals with things as intense as settling old scores, family, bowling, girls and simple tasks as trying to find a spot to take a leak. We meet Billys family, buddys and a girl he meets just after we met him. Sound all right but shown and heard with the just the right score and songs used so well you won't be able to hear them again without your mind returning to Buffalo. Vincent Gallo nailes this movie to your heart. With cast members including Anjelica Houston, Mickey Rourke, Cristina Ricci to name a few this film moved me in ways few films ever do. Give it a shot, like it or not the finale is executed with skill and ease and makes you feel. Gallo puts the move back in movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo '66 is a smart, fresh, well-told story--Gallo rocks.","review":"Buffalo '66 is a product of director/writer/actor/etc. Vincent Gallo--a true genius filmmaker. It is a terrific story, told perfectly from a fresh cinematic angle. The clever blend of comedy and drama makes Buffalo '66 a true original--and the characters are unbeatable.

Always go Back to Buffalo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still remember scenes seven years later","review":"Vincent Gallo's \\"Buffalo '66\\" is a minor classic that sticks with you. The story itself is relatively implausible (e.g., Christina Ricci's character seems blithely unconcerned about her kidnapping by Gallo's Billy Brown), but these leaps of faith required by the viewer don't deter from the train wreck-like fascination of watching the tale unfold.The standout scenes by far are those with Billy's parents, portrayed indelibly by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston. Huston is particularly noteworthy - in a dysfunctional family (one can only imagine this is very close to home for writer/director Gallo), she's the most dysfunctional - she's invented a completely unique character that words can't describe. Her compelling, fascinating performance will lodge itself in your brain for a long time - you'll not see another one like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflective ride!","review":"This is one of the most intelligent, provocative and lucid films of the Indenpendient film genre in years.

Fianlly, Christina Ricci playing some roles that actually showcase her talent. The cinematography in this indie flick is superb, and the dance sequence and the \\"singing\\" sequence do anything but tkae away from the film. With SUPERB performances by the four leads, and an outstanding performance by GOON/ROCKY, makes this film a great achievement in independant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal, Original Movie","review":"This movie was odd but compelling. You couldn't help but have sympathy for Vincent's pained character, ignored and insulted by his monstrous parents. Layla was a strong character, played by the brilliant Christina Ricci.I'd recommend this movie to those who are fans of uncommon, independent films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film","review":"Wow, what a movie. After skimming numerous reviews and expecting Vincent Gallo to dominate the movie with a one-dimensional 'vicious con' performance, I was very pleasantly surprised.From the beginning it's obvious that Billy Brown is no stereotype - when asking to be allowed back into jail to use the bathroom, he comes across like a frightened kid; this idea comes up again and again throughout the film. Ricci is good, but Gallo steals his own show - and the ending, well, it's wonderful. I rewound the tape and watched the final ten minutes for a second time as soon as I finished my first viewing.As a final aside, I think this is the closest a film has come to capturing the tone of 'Catcher in the Rye'... miraculously also adding a note of hope to its generally bleak vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY","review":"This was by far the most boring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. From the first five minutes you can tell how the rest of the film will be, SLOW. The only redeeming quality is the good-looking chick. But the main character, Billy, treats her like garbage the entire movie and towards the end you are hoping he'll get killed. But no! It just suddenly says, the end, and shows him and the girl lying on a bed. The acting is awful, the music sucks, and the story is about as interesting as reading a dictionary from cover to cover. If it comes to this movie or staring into the sun for two hours, pick the sun!Imagine you are sitting in a waiting room somewhere for two hours. That's basically it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG LET DOWN","review":"I heard this movie was going to be good. But within minutes of renting it and putting it in the player (please don't waste money and actually buy this tripe) I found it to be a two hour study of a guy who shot a movie - simply so he could look at himself. The saddest thing is, that he's just not as sexy as he, or the semi-retarded housewives who think he's sexy, think. The movie has no purpose other than ego and it's amazing we even know this bums name. Can;t wait until it's forgotten either, because since seeing it, I've seen so many articles on his NEW MOVIE, suckering people into watching what I'm sure amounts to more of the same. The only thing Gallo is actually talented at, is getting more press. And that's something that any pathetic, souless, brown noser can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for sale to persons under 18? Why is it for sale at all?","review":"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Edgy Barry Levinson-esque camerawork, some truly funny moments, an A-list cast who must have worked for scale, the whole nine yards. But I still couldn't get my head around this movie. Vincent Gallo just isn't credible as a revenge-plotting ex-con, though the movie other major plot (dealing with the dysfunctional family) works pretty well. The cast backing him up, with the exception of Christina Ricci (she plays it as well as she can, but her role is just written badly), injects some truly fine moments into this film, but a collection of fine moments held together in an awful pit of celluloid does not a good film make. Maybe someone will release an outtakes version (and cut out the hideous soundtrack, which is basically the guitar solos from Yes songs redone badly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Buffalo '66 is by far the best and most original film of 98. Vincent Gallo is truley remarkable, considering he wrote, directed, played, and did the soundtrack for the movie. Christina Ricci, who I just happen to have the hots for, is superb in the movie. It's definitely in my top 5. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story, kinda reminds me of A catcher in the rye","review":"This is an interesting tail of a guy, billy brown, that has been in jail for 5 years, and somehow managed to hide it from his parents. He now finds himself released and returning home to visit the parent. He's told them hes making great money, and he has a wife. Now, how does he find a wife in the matter of a few minutes...oh yeah, kidnap one (christina ricci). Soon we find out that Billy has grown up in a unique household, and also that he went to jail under unique circumstances. Finally, how does he reconcile his mind from what he has obsessed about for 5 years with what actually is occuring today. A decent story, and some good performances, but now that I really objectivly look at it, so much like a film version of a catcher in the rye, but modified a bit, but essentially the same. Substitute Christina ricci's character for Holden's sister, and Billy being Holden Caufield, and walla, a catcher in the rye. Check it out anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAKES BUFFALO SEEM COOL","review":"This is a great indy film that I thought was one of the ten best of its year.

And I have the hots for C.Ricci. But still, this is an amazing film. Funny throughout the entire production, it leads you to think that it is some dark comedy. But it is actually a deep look inside the human mind, and how our surroundings influence our development. In the end, we find that love conquers all. I want to shake Vincent's hand - he not only wrote the movie, directed it, and played in it, but he also did the sound track. He is truly an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Really Got Me!","review":"Like many other reviewers of this movie, I was totally captivated by how untraditional and original this little gem is. Instead of telling each other how they feel about each other, Gallo and Ricci use body language, awkward pauses, and goofy expressions to convey their emotions.It's not that there's not dialogue--in fact, Gallo's character can't seem to stop talking--but what is spoken is not what is being implied. A great deal of the tension in this film is the inability of these characters to express themselves in any coherent manner.I'd like to go on, but it would just be a rehash of the other positive reviews! Just let me add that this is one of the the very few movies I have watched more than twice, and lots of people I know share the same sentiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This film is an awful mess!

You can call it a 'film' and pretend it sucked because 'artistic vision,' or whatever, is sometimes too deep for everyday comprehension. But there really is no excuse. This movie was slow, boring, and without a redeeming quality. There was no point to a scene that dragged on for twenty-five minutes. In all honesty, there was no point to the movie itself. Christina Ricci should be shot.

Well, there's a reason Unleashed is the definitive Judas Priest live recording of their early years -- it is a professional quality recording. On this disc, the backing vocals burst out over the lead vocals, lead guitars are inaudible over the rhythm section...you get the idea. This is a bad bootleg-quality recording.

Spock's final words, \\"Say goodnight, Q\\", even echo the old George Burns/Gracie Allen dialogs which ended with \\"Say goodnight, Gracie\\".

Running the corridors for some food, or sitting upstairs in the library and talking about not wanting to become their parents is tough stuff for this lot.

Not just teens, but adults as well will hark back to this time in their life, where you could do no right. Your parents, your friends, your teachers, even the janitor, can't help but bag on you and point out shortcomings. Hughes use of kids from different backgrounds and social standing is the key, and he explores it masterfully. So for the young writer, don't worry if your film is dialogue heavy, just make it insightful and you'll be okay.So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart already:).

You like Brian, although he is a geek, but you know that even he has his negative perceptions about the \\"criminal\\" like everyone has about him.Sure, Andy's a jock, but he is also a nice guy-a rarity. Claire hates doing what her friends want her to do, and so she is not as independent and envy worthy as eveyone may think a popular girl should be. And Alison-the \\"basketcase\\" (does anyone use that term anymore?) she is just odd, but like claire, we don't find her disturbing, or \\"cool\\" as she says either, just kind of....different, and for that, she is just as likable. The witty dialogue is good as well.If you haven't seen this movie, please do! I do not think you will regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Re encode of a classic movie","review":"The Breakfast Club was released on HDDVD 4 years ago with a solid transfer. The film grain was minimal and you could see the details in the film especially the principal's suit and tie. The Bluray re release although sporting the same VC1 encode is a lot grainier than the HDDVD version. I would avoid re buying this if you own the HDDVD version. The HDDVD version is superior to the Bluray that lacks definition. Boo to Sony for re releasing a classic with a cheaper version of the same encode. They could have at least matched the quality of the HDDVD version.

It is cinematic genuise and John Hughes, with his brilliant eye for the youth in film, portrays teenage life in the 80's better than anyone has ever done.

Few films have portrayed the high and lows of high school any better, and its characters and plot are still relatable today.My complaint in my review is the dvd. Sure the sound picture quality are better than ever, but hwere are the extras? C'mon, an audio commentary by the cast and crew would've been welcomed, as would a documentary.

The entire time all I wanted to do was punch each of the kids in the face and tell them to stop acting like such whiny little brats. Bender, the \\"outcast-druggie\\" stereotype was possibly the most obnoxious character I've ever seen in a movie. He basically spent the entire time aggravating the other characters (and me at the same time) who were equally annoying in their reactions to him (they ALWAYS took the bait, ALWAYS responded like he wanted them to. Seriously, don't you learn in preschool to plug your ears and say \\"I'm not listening, I'm not listening\\"?).Then at the end they magically become friends, and 2 pairs of them start dating, which also got on my nerves, because it was SO unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great!","review":"Watched this movie with my teenage daughter.

I had to watch this movie for English class in preparation for a Cause/Effect paragraph and I would have to agree that there is a lot to cause some effect; i.e. kids annoying the crap out of each other, kids embarassing each other about sensitive topics, and corrupt principal being his usual self.

There isn't even Stereo, the audio is all center channel mono! On top of that, the audio is muffled, the music sounds like it's being sent through a circa 1965 radio.That having been said, the picture quality is fairly good. I would classify it as somewhere between DVD upconversion, and a true HD film transfer.Overall, this may be the first HD DVD that I have seen that should not actually be classified as HD.

Not only because of its deeply emotional characters, but because of the reality of it. It gets away from the stereotypical character outlooks seen in almost ALL teen movies, like japs, jocks, blondes, and geeks.

At the start we se very obvious examples of different levels of high school. The outcasts on the bottom , and the popular at the top. As the movie develops so do the characters. This movie delivers laughs,tears,joy,and sadness. It features some drug content, language, sexual dialogue, and thematic elements. I recommend it for middle to high schoolers.The reason I gave this movie 4 of 5 stars is because of the lack of features, I mean come on!

If the film stock had been restored and remastered, it might be different. But the music/soundtrack? Yawn.Then there's the fact that there are no extras, no deleted scenes, nothing.And lastly, I was majorly annoyed to be forced to watch four movie ads prior to getting to the menu. You CANNOT hit Stop, you CANNOT hit Menu, you CANNOT hit Pause...once this DVD is in, you will always, always have to sit through four movie ads before you get to the menu! \\"Action forbidden by disc\\" is what you'll see.

I'm not a fan of cheesey unrealstic films so this movie was really genuine to every generation even 'til this day. Every scene is entertaining, funny, and memorable. It's amazing how even after all these years it still reaches a new generation of people and still has the same impact it always has. I think the best thing about this movie is that no matter who you are, where you are, or how old you are you can relate to at least one of the characters. The best part is the ending- it's not a particularly happy ending but it's real and believable which is what the whole movie is about. Great writing! Great acting!

How does a director even convince human beings to act in such a manner? Hi, have you heard, I'm the nerd. Then they show it at the retro soc hop iGasm. And you take your disillusioned significant other, palms pasty, hands clasped awkwardly and tight, reaching toward one last empty grasp at what is now long past, becoming a biased memory.

But for about 15 more years at least they had solid storyline. Then in 1985 with the premiere of the Brat-Pack pictures (beginning with this one)pictures sucked and no longer had solid storyline. As for this film. I rest my case. The story which is (only!!!) about teenagers in detention wouldn't have made a z-picture in Hollywood back in the 1950's. As for the dialogue well, it's weird to say the least. The film is pretty pointless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"complete junk","review":"Worst movie ever.

Bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and Children of Bodom (or, if power metal is your thing; Stratovarius, Sinergy, Nostradameus, and even Yngwie Malmsteen) have pushed their music so far beyond the reaches of the \\"classic\\" Iron Maiden sound that it's rediculous.

These annoyances are just a tip of the hefty iceberg that make this movie straight garbage.The only power this flick seems to possess is the uncanny ability to protract time, making an hour and a half seem like a solid, bang-your-head-against-the-wall three hours.Treat this picture like a rabid animal: avoid at all costs, but if you do happen to stumble across it- destroy it with extreme prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring...did I mention it's BORING?","review":"I would not say this is a bad movie, but it definitely is a movie for little kids.

Both are excellent stories. In Powder Smoke we have a young cowboy accused of murdering his older brother, and his former boss, Powder Smoke Peters sets out to find the real killer. Son of the Wolf introduces us to Wolf Blaine, a heartless rancher who will kill his competitors if he can't buy them out. Both are tradtional stories of the west dealing with the usual type of situations westerns are known for. But that in no way diminishes them; for they are good stories and well worth reading. In fact, I have not found any Colt MacDonald books not worth reading, and his Three Mesquiteers stories which were made into movies, some of which starred a young John Wayne are considered classic. I can say the same for his Gregory Quist, Railroad Detective stories. I say buy 'em if you can find 'em!

So, it's worth the money for the ten minutes of fun it will create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cedar Benches","review":"We like the benches they are really nice but the planters should come with them or explain that they don't come with them.

There is not one song in the album that i dont like. I truly love the music and miss the band very much. If you are just getting into the goth scene, this album should be your first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated as hell","review":"I was horrified when i heard this, the album that \\"Invented Goth\\". the music is fairly good, but peter murphy's cod-transylvanian accent is too ridiculous to take seriously. You want to see who invented goth? BUY SOME CURE AND JOY DIVISION!what kind of song ends with the word \\"Silly\\" anyway? Ian curtis and robert smith are two of the best singers and lyricists of the century, peter murphy makes this album bad. hell, i would actually rather have the whole album as an instrumental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I think this is the best album I've ever heard! everyhing about it is perfect. the songwriting, that spectacular 'notchy'guitar sound, Peter Murphy's vocal slay me everytime. I only recently began listening to Bauhaus and I wonder why I waited so darn long. A MUST HAVE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense anger and pain say it all here","review":"This is really loud, intense, angry, paranoid and well whatever other word you can think of to describe this. The trouble for some might be that it might scare them away on first listen. Which would be terrible as if it is given repeated listens it's not so bad at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamics of Faith -- Paul Tillich","review":"Reader from NJ -- Wake up and open your eyes, Tillich is talking about YOU (...the idea \\"faith\\" that rests solely on belief and demands the elimination of doubt is the antithesis of true faith). Tillichs' views on symbolism and faith do raise \\"questions\\" about all symbolism in religion, butthose questions prompt us to look more closely at the nature of our own relationship with God, and thereby fortify that relationship!I read this book in college, and it was the best book on the subject of philosophy of religion I have ever read. I am going to buy another copy to replace my old college edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say doublethink?","review":"About the only thing this book is good for is toilet paper.The author uses concepts that are diametrically opposed to one another as part of his philosophy, and rips on the Roman Catholic Church. Had he had proper knowledge of the the Roman Church, he would have realized how silly his criticisms are. His theology simply can't hold water, and his book is worthless. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff - but where is Hope Road?","review":"Anne Clark is the kind of artist that hits 1 out of 3 - 2/3 of her stuff is too sad/boring. 1/3 of her stuff is biting and beholding - this best of catches much of her best work. But where is Hope Road on this Very Best - Hope Road is one of her best works ever, missing on this CD, but there are some hard hitting catchy tunes on this CD. If you've never heard Anne Clark, past Hope road, this is a good intro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Compilation Ever","review":"This is one of the most cohesive compilations ever put together regarding overall sound as well as packaging. I still regret passing over the deluxe edition album, which included the 24 page book, in favor of the standard album that saved me a whole five dollars or so. Regardless, I still get chills listening to \\"Frontier\\" and \\"Muscoviet Mosquito\\" after twelve years. The comp. as a whole has a dark, atmospheric, post-punk sound that successfully documents 4AD's hey-day. I would recommend releases by any of the bands on the album, especially MEDUSA from Clan of Xymox, SPLEEN AND IDEAL from Dead Can Dance, IT'LL END IN TEARS and FILIGREE & SHADOW from This Mortal Coil, THROWING MUSES from Throwing Muses (available as IN A DOGHOUSE), VICTORIALAND from the Cocteau Twins, and THE LEGENDARY WOLFGANG PRESS AND OTHER TALL STORIES from The Wolfgang Press (if you can find it). Do not hesitate to buy this, the video of the same name is excellent as well and worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic Memories","review":"The best song on this album is \\"Fish\\" by Throwing Muses, from which the title of this moody, angst-ridden gets its name \\"Lonely is as lonely does. Lonely is an eyesore.\\" I used to listen to this when I was 19,in 1993, wanting to be goth, writing bad poetry, and this seemed like the soundtrack to my life. It's a good mix of dark (Clan of Xymox, Dead can Dance) and light (Throwing Muses, Cocteau Twins)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true 4AD classic!","review":"I have had this album for over 10 years, and I still listen to it often. For anyone who likes DCD and the Cocteau Twins...this is a great album to discover some of the other talent on the 4AD label. I also agree with the other reviewer that the video completely enhances the experience of this album...try to find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"This compilation is unworthy of 4AD or the selected artists. Should have been titled the \\"the worst of\\". I'm a big DCD fan, and bought the disk for their two songs. They were both very disappointing tracks. My local reseller didn't want the disk, so it ended up in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Video","review":"Great CD but seeing the video is more rewording. It's out of print, but you can still find it for auction."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far the Best for a True Believer","review":"This is by far the best video depiction of the Book of Genesis.I don't know where the other reviewer gets his information about Moses being in this video. As I remember it, this video covers the Book of Genesis, not Exodus.Sticks faithfully to the biblical text, which is why this one is so hard to find. (The establishment is no friend of the Bible.)Topol's portrayal of Abraham can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential addition to your video library!","review":"When I first seen this video I was expecting more of the same old 1960's style bible movies. I was wrong. This seemed to be more accurate than past videos. I enjoyed it very much! The only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is there were a couple spots that were a little off and a couple ommisions. I was very tempted to give it 5 stars. Moses in real life had a speach impediment and Arron done all the talking for him, this movie (like past movies) still had Moses doing most of the talking. Little things like that effected my rating. But those types of things were few and far between and easily spotted. The important areas seemed to be accurate and very entertaining of course. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !!! Entertaining and accurate!","review":"I enjoyed this dvd so much that I'd like to know if there are any other books of the Bible directed in the same manner??? In my opinion, these stories were presented very well! I particularly liked the way the bible scriptures (verses), were directly woven into the storylines. Very nicely done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Original Version/Narrator","review":"This is a different version than the original. The original narrator had an amazing voice and read from the King James Bible. Reader's Digest must have purchased this from The New Media Bible and decided to dumb it down. The authentic music and the bible verses read by an amazing voice, have been replaced by an annoying narrator who tries to explain the stories for a pre-teen who's never read the bible. I've been waiting 15 years for these films to be converted to DVD, and now I'm extremely disappointed that they've been ruined. I will be buying the VHS and converting it to DVD myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"When I saw this on television, I thought it was very good and I loved Topol's protrayal of Abraham. However, when I received this copy, the quality of the film was so poor and the narrator's voice drowned out the Hebrew. Had the picture been clearer and not badly faded, I would have given it a higher rating. No, I would not recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down version---------horrible!!!!!!","review":"This is not at all what I thought I was getting. I own the New Media Bible original VHS version. It is 1000 times better. Flawless choreography between the scripture verses and Hebrew and Aramaic background and the actors. That is what John Heyman intended. This is more than a rip off but a artistic embarrassment.Reader's digest would do themselves and their viewers a favor by releasing the original version with Alexander Scourby (you cannot do better for a narrator!!!).Please release the original. I had waited years for this version and my wife purchased it for me. If you will not, please at least acknowledge this is not the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Documentary or Horrible Drama?","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of the production. If this is supposed to be a documentary -- mostly told through voice over and the actors are not speaking English -- then it needs some citation for it's information. If it is supposed to be a drama -- the Bible scenes are acted out and there is scenery and costumes -- then it needs better actors. This group of actors was worse than watching a third grade performance.The biggest problem though is that no where on the DVD box or the videos themselves is it explained why these Biblical stories are being told this way. It was a waste of my money because there are much better documentaries out there and certainly much better dramas of the exact same stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis leading","review":"None of the good songs in the movie were inclouded on the sound track.

All the music is instrumental, it isn't the fun music from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: NOT THE SOUNDTRACK","review":"This is the background music written for the movie by Michael Giacchino (aka the getting in the car mood music); NOT the great 70s songs we all know and love used throughout the movie.I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn J Paw Paw, MI","review":"After seeing the film and loving the music i was very excited to purchase the cd. Upon receiving it I was very dissapointed. The CD is actually only the classical pieces composed especially for the movie. The actual songs played in the movie like, \\"Fooled around and fell in love\\" are not on the CD. If you want the CD for that music don't bother. I do like the music but an entire CD of almost the same song played fast then slow is not what I was after.

Much to my surprise and many others (I'm guessing)...TPTB decided no to include it. Can anyone help???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the fine print...","review":"I agree with everyone here, that they blew it, but if you have seen the movie and the not-so-subtle product placement of Apple Computer products, and you grabbed a magnifying glass to read the back of the DVD case, then you'd know that the soundtrack is available at the iTunes Music Store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The best thing about this movie was the sound track. The movie itself is very disappointing. I expected more comedy afterseeing the trailers. It is very predictable and the changethat Sarah Jessica Parker's character goes through is totallyunrealistic. I'm glad I didn't see this at Christmas whenit came out - one of the story lines is depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... but short","review":"When I saw this movie, I just had to buy the soundtrack. The music is beautiful and powerful, but just toooooo short. A son was like, 40 seconds long. I was really dissapointed by this, but still... buy this. It's very excellent and divine"},{"rating":"1","title":"They blew it","review":"How could a movie that had such great songs throughout it, blow it by not including them on the soundtrack CD?! I came here to order the soundtrack after seeing the DVD, and cannot believe that none of those great 70's songs are included (as another reviewer realized after ordering). How idiotic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Songs","review":"As others have noticed the songs you REALLY want on this Soundtrack are missing.

Looks a little worn, but I knew that when I read the description.

This is my first term as a graduate student, and I don't think I could have survived had it not been for this book. It gives useful commentary, helpful hints and a terrific reference section for footnotes and bibliographies. It addresses real problems that often occur in writing an art history paper and provides insightful solutions that encourage independent thinking. It also includes a section on essay exams which gets a quick read through when I take a test.I had several \\"a ha!\\" moments when reading it for the first time, and now I keep it within arms reach whenever I write.The price was a little steep, so I hesitated in buying, but when I finally made the purchase I was glad that I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference","review":"This is a great book to refer to when writing an art history paper.

Got here very quickly, thanks for everything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So irritating to read","review":"This is the kind of book that makes the reader think: \\"Gee, if thing got published, certainly I can spend an afternoon writing and get published.\\" Absolutely agree with the previous writer re: embarrassing sex scenes which I think are the worst offense, of many, in this book. I'm all for some seduction in a book but these read like the writer's fantasies described in the crudest and most immature manner. They remind me of a friend who uses the same language while the rest of us give eachother awkward and uncomfortable looks (and all of us discuss our sex lives openly). The characters are ridiculous, completely unbelievable, and nobody I would ever want to meet. It's hard to get involved with them because you find yourself looking down on them. If I were 14 this might be a fun read, but at 34, married, kids and a very successful career, I found it nothing but irritating. Did make it to chapter 4 though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, funny, serious, should be a movie","review":"Nelsie Spencer's \\"The Playgroup\\" catches you off guard -- it's not just a social satire, but also an exploration of motherhood, marriage, expressions of love in all its forms, self-denial and revelation. It's a brave book and a grand achievement for Spencer. Someone should make a movie out of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Playgroup Rocks","review":"Drawn by the sexy cover art, I was well pleased by \\"The Playgroup\\". It's really, really funny, but with a pulsing undercurrent of dysfunction. (I wanted to SHOOT her mother Sara- the scenes between her and her daughter Ellie ALONE make this book worthwhile). I found it heartbreaking, tender, and outrageous. You won't be bored, or disappointed- the author obviously has extensive experience in \\"WaspWorld\\" and skewers it deftly. I also love the scene where she tapes a gift box to her behindular area as a birthday gift for her dreamy hubby Peter (the \\"Lyon Burke\\" of the new millenium)Bravo \\"The Playgroup\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicy Beach Read!","review":"I read this book last summer, and I could not put it down!

I think nelsie is an amazing writer and personaly i think she should do stand up.I loved the flow and the spunk.It wasnt one of those mommy books that has know deepth.personaly I could read this over and over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I made it through three chapters of this, and that's only because I was trapped in a car repair shop waiting room. I didn't find any of the writing funny, the descriptions were painfully hackneyed, and there were so many mechanical errors I found myself actually defacing a library book to correct the rampant unwarranted semicolons and missing commas. There's more, of course - the plastic characterization, the embarrassing sex scenes, and the meandering plot, for instance - but I think I've made myself clear. I'd read a few pages before you seriously considering buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally implausible.","review":"I'm sorry, I just don't believe that a co-sleeping, breastfeeding mother of a young infant would be having this much sex. And the sex scenes are badly-written enough that the author didn't *make* me believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Conservative","review":"I picked this up for a good 'beach read' and was a bit shocked. I am, admittedly, conservative...but the sex scenes in this books were so raunchy I could not enjoy the rest of the book. As a result, I skimmed it.Don't waste your money if raunchiness will make you uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Book","review":"From start to finish, Nelsie Spencer hits a home run with The Playgroup. The story surprises, the characters are fresh and the locale makes an inviting backdrop.

The album cover is one of my favorite's. I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise for Joan Baez Fans","review":"The demo disc is reason enough to buy this pricey album. It is a complete album by itself, more intimate and reflective than the album that was originally released, and many of the cuts are very beautiful. The instrumental accompaniments are spare, so you mostly hear Baez in all her glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unexpectedly good album.","review":"this album offers a lot. i find myself humming the songs all day long. what struck me first was the exceptional accompaniment on all songs...she's working with some very good musicians here. and the songs are good: some she wrote, most she didn't, and this kind of variety is exactly what i like on a joan baez album (similar to diamonds and rust). when i'm listening to the cd in the car, there are only a couple of songs i click past (high praise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is money the only reason?","review":"Personally I think his mom is some what just a typical stage mother.

When I was done reading the book I didn't feel like JUST another fan I felt like a friend of Nick who grew up with him and knew all his secrets. I especially loved the little quiz at the end, to test on how big of a Nick fan I was, and I got 100/100. Well I could go on for hours talking about how great the book is but you'll never know for yourself until you buy and read the book.

Instead I read the words of an arrogant mother that is taking all the credit for her son being where she is. SHE did this, SHE did that, SHE played Super mom. Blah blah blah. This book is all about what SHE did to get Nick where he is, not really what NICK did to get where he is. Although there are some really adorable pictures, I don't recommend the book.

I adore Nick Carter...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth it","review":"I was really excited when I saw this book and decided to order it. Honestly though it doesn't talk about Nick Carter that much. Mostly it talks about Jane Carter. She does discuss Nick Carter but we learn more about her and his family than him. It was boring.

ON THE OTHER HAND, ARTHUR DOES THE SAME, FEELING HE CANNOT MARRY HIS LOVE SINCE HE HAS NO MONEY. THE EFFECT THAT MONEY OR THE LACK THEREOF HAS ON THESE 4 PEOPLE AND THE OTHER CHARACTERS IN THE STORY IS THE CENTRAL THEME. THE BOOK IS SO BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND EXAMINES DEEPLY THE PSYCHE OF ALL THE CHARACTERS. I LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not my favorite Trollope","review":"In the lengthy passages about Palestine and Egypt in this work, Trollope tends to come off as a frustrated travel writer. Besides these strange interludes, this is really a classic Trollope work in the raw, emotionally painful vein. If you've read a good deal of Trollope before getting to this novel, you'll find distinct echoes of plots from He Knew He Was Right, The Way We Live Now, and other works. (I notice Trollope has a preferred method of dispensing with unworthy but problematic men). But there are some lively and original characters in this somber novel, making it well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is a Decca/Eloquence reissue that can be had possibly cheaper","review":"The prospective buyer should know about a reissue of this excellent recording by the Eloquence label, who have reissued many great recordings from the Decca catalog. I don't have my copy with me at the moment, but I don't remember anything in the notes about a new remastering for this particular Eloquence reissue; but even though it has a less attractive cover (no offense to M. Rousset), it can be had for perhaps less than half the price of this original edition. Here is the Eloquence edition:Couperin: Lecons de Ténèbres; Motets; MagnificatAmong the many reasons to hear this album is the angelic voice of Mlle Piau, whose other recordings are well worth hearing.

It also includes several live versions of his hits - unfortunately, to the exclusion of the original studio recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary Heroes- no Ordinary Book","review":"A master storyteller has written a gem of a WWII story. It has been described in other reviews as \\"tedious in the middle.\\" Well, war is, indeed tedious (form follows function) and I think Scott Turow does a great job using an officer whose various duties carry him all over Europe, to illuminate the boredom and the fear and ferocity of war in general, and of several of the big events in WWII. He brings in the Battle of the Bulge, and through his alter-ego jeep driver, Biddy, the D-Day invasion and the degradation of the freeing of the camps. Yes, there are parts that are not exactly accurate, but this is a novel, and the liberties Mr. Turow takes, in my mind, do not detract at all from the value of this marvelous and well-researched book. I personally loved Biddy- his wisdom and good sense; a terrific character. This wonderful book should change the mind of anyone who thinks that war is glamorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"better on second read","review":"When I first read \\"Ordinary Heroes\\" I was disappointed, but when I re-read it. I concluded it was one of his best novels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start, powerful second half.","review":"The faults first. Some of the character dialogue is unrealistic and serves as exposition of Scott Turow's personal philosophies. The racial issue is interesting, but a bit heavy-handed. The opening hundred pages are a bit slow.Having said that, Ordinary Heroes is incredibly gripping in conveying the drudgery, horror, and injustice of war, while still giving an entertaining read. This novel accurately conveys the moral uncertainties of war for all parties - including American forces. The central plot twist was well handled. I suspected the resolution, but the uncertainty was enough to make the culmination surprising.The sheer epic sweep of Ordinary Heroes is humbling, especially when one thinks of the millions of similar stories that can be told about World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Turow quality","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I am more than casually interested in WWII -been to Omaha Beach and the American Cemetery with a WWII vet from the 101st Airborne and to Bastogne and Dachau and Berchestgarten Hitler mountain retreat--but this was mostly boring and seemed to be filler for the pages that tried to uphold the flimsy plot. I am a Turow fan but this book put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Read in Years","review":"Normally a Scott Turow fan, I eagerly delved into this book. But it is a collection of cliches, bad misinterpretations of history and hackney scenes done better by other authors. The concept of a JAG parachuting into Bastogne to arrest an OSS officer strains belief. German planes bombing Bastogne??? The Luftwaffe was gone by this point in the war. German snipers sitting around all night in the snow to see if a \\"corpse\\" moves rather than putting an extra bullet in each?And that's not the worst part. Dubin, the \\"hero\\" never has an original thought throughout the book. Gita, the love interest, parrots cliches in broken English. The homosexual (practicing on his troops--right!) general is meant to show us military hypocrisy at its worst. Biddy' real nature is meant to teach us that equality is best. You'd be better off renting a Michael Moore movie than reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"so finish already","review":"Wordy and repetitive, this book began alright then devolved into word clutter.

The story and the characters were compelling and believable. Gita Lodz is one of the most exciting female characters in any book I've read.

The ending was dynamite.Writer Interruptus and Other Stories"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"If you're a Turow fan like me, you can't be but disappointed by this book.The premise is good. And the first few chapters raise expectations for a gripping tale. Then somewhere around page 100 the books begins to sag under the weight of unimaginative dialogue, two dimensional characters and a couple of shallow plot twists.For example, Turow's inclusion of the Biddy character is a sophmoric transparent attempt to add some Meaningful Social/Racial Content to the book. It feels totally forced and phoney.Gita is another character who is presented shallowly. Her role in the climax of this book was so telegraphed that I figured it out by page 300.Not worthy of Turow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turow, but not his best.","review":"Scott Turow has proven his abilities over the years. His fiction is a \\"must\\" on my list of authors.Ordinary Heroes can not be considered one of Turow's best works. Purely fiction, he is somewhat in an era where he has no first hand knowledge. That always makes a novel a bit \\"stressful\\" for the reader.But reading the book is not \\"work\\". It is a story of fiction conceived in the mind of the author...and serves the purpose of filling a rainy day. Not bad, not great, always well written, Turow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome, boring, and unrealistic","review":"I'm not sure how this book has so many positive reviews. It is extremely tedious to read, the characters are tiresome and not terribly interesting, and the whole scenario is barely plausible.I also agree with another reviewer here who writes that much of the dialogue seems better suited to the courtroom than the battlefield. In fact, for me, the dialogue, among other factors, makes the whole thing feel disjointed and almost surreal.And the whole idea is how a son discovers his father and all these family secrets, but for literally hundreds of pages, we barely hear a word of or from the son. This goes on for sooooo long that you basically forget the entire premise of the book. The result is that it largely leaves the war story to stand on it's own as a war story and it is not nearly good enough to do that.Lastly, if you are thinking this book invokes any of the mystery and drama of his courtroom stories, know this: it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding read","review":"I recently read \\"Soldier of the Great War\\" by Mark Halprin. I thought that it was an excellent historical novel. Now, I have read Turow's book, and find it a step above. While immersed in this book, I have marvelled at how skillfully and artfully it was created. Enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptioal WWII book","review":"Read this book slowly, savor it like a rare good wine,every sentence is a gem every chapter is a new revelation of human foibles and triumph. There is nothing ordinary in \\"Ordinary Heroes\\"by a master story teller Scott Turow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls you in, keeps you guessing","review":"As other reviews mention, this is not a typical legal thriller. But then, Scott Turow is not a typical writer. His books do not follow any predictable formulas.WWII fiction is well trod ground, but Ordinary Heroes still gives some new perspectives. The characters are unique, flawed and interesting, and you care about what happens to them.I said Scott Turow does not follow formulas, and that is true, but if there is a common theme to his work, it is that all of his characters have secrets. The plot lines of the books are about how the secrets affect their lives, before and after they are revealed. The characters are well drawn, and he shows you how the story affects all of them, for better or worse.Why not five stars? Too many typos in the Kindle version. Well worth the time to read, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oridnary Heroes","review":"It's been a long time since I have read any books by Scott Turow.For one thing, his books are never out in the stores.

I read on line about the replacement part that Dorman makes and that it should solve this problem. Buying the aftermarket part vs. going through the dealer or the Chevy specialty parts company saved me a whole lot of money. AMAZON shipped it for free which made it even more economical and it arrived to Hawaii in under a week. The best part is that it fixed my problem!

There always seems to be something missing here, that the company making the game has even better. That is the case with Super Mario 64: Survival Guide by J. Douglas Arnold. Out of all the strategy guides that were made, this one was the worst ever made. There really isn't a lot to focus here outside of there is no 3-D Maps, to help you locate any of the items, not enough text, and especially, the tips here really aren't as detailed as the book claimed it has.

I pulled out my old Nintendo 64 and Super mario 64 for my son to play, this guide was packed away with it. I was amazed at the lack of details in the guide. The guide will allow you to complete the game, but there's not much there about the extras - where do I find the flying cap etc... Sometimes the instructions are a little vague, without the details you can still spend a lot of time trying things over and over and over...The guide will get you through the game, but if you want details look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"catch the vapors","review":"This video is very over-rated.

The stand's hinge is made of cheap plastic and will break after a few uses. The plug at the end of the cable which hooks to the PC, is stored in the battery compartment. The plastic lip which should hold the compartment closed is made of similar shoddy material - poorly designed, which will break after a couple of months.

I wouldn't say that they're good for someone looking for a bass pumping tailgate music package, but for our kids to watch a movie on the video iPod or listen to some bedtime tunes they were more than adequate. The internal cord storage is a nice feature, and they will work passably well without any batteries installed (just using the headphone driver power), but much better with the batteries. The cord storage cover also doubles as a nice little stand. All in all, better than a laptop's speakers and nicely portable.

Lisa Gerrard's incredible voice is evocative on many levels. Jim Morrison's much-praised poetry is clumsy and immature in comparison to the artistry of Brendan Perry. Together, Gerrard and Perry challenge one to feel things that can't quite be put into words. They use rhythms, instrumentation and vocalizations that drive me to transcend any spiritual affectations. My psychic facades of perfect balance fall away and I am brought face to face with the deep awe that we all feel when contemplating the ineffable mysteries of existence. But DCD doesn't leave me drowning in the Abyss. Their music rides currents of hope, peace and beauty that break through the surface to carry me to new levels of wonder and excitement for life.Do you think that all sounds a bit dramatic? Well, then you should hear the music for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Can Dance : Passage In Time","review":"Excellent CD with many titles that are from previous releases and a few that are new.

I've been listening for 13 years and still have no real comparisons. Only the \\"Cocteau Twins\\" or a darker \\"Enya\\" come to mind...but not really. Though some of their stuff has kind of a tribal sound to it, most of this collection is more gothic, more medieval. I always envision this music coming out of some cathedral, in a far away and mysterious place, hundreds of years ago. That's what's so wonderful about \\"Dead Can Dance\\". They can transport you to places other music cannot. I also enjoy both the male, and female vocals, on the tracks that have them. I honestly think that someone would enjoy most of their albums equally, but this does give you a taste of many of them.

I am a big fan of The Faint, have been for years, been to their shows, etc. This album does not do anything for me at all. Their others are fantastic, this one, you can tell they are working out the kinks, getting to where they want their future sound to be, that they exhibited for all of us on Blank-Wave Arcade and the rest. As has been said before, if you only can buy one The Faint album, do not buy this one. Even if you are a big fan of theirs, you can go your whole life without owning this one. For those that love this album, hey, good for you. This sentiment that some have regarding music, in which you have to like everything your favorite band puts out is pure garbage. Every band, repeat, EVERY BAND, puts out something they don't like themselves, or at worst, wish they could take back. You can still be super fan and not like everything a band does. This applies here, in the case of Media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst Album","review":"Listening to this album after you've heard The Faint's more recent releases will completely convince you that their change of sound was warranted. If they'd continued on in this direction they'd have become just another obscure emo band churning out mediocre, self-absorbed pop for college students too unrepentantly normal to seek out more unusual musical fare. Both this original sound and their current sound are \\"generic\\" in the sense that they adhere strictly to genre definitions, but since New Wave is a far more musically interesting genre than emo, fans of their contemporary sound will find this album to be a total disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic grounding in the earth's weather system","review":"Nigel Calder is a very good writer for taking large technical knowledge and presenting it in an everyday language.

It is reasonably thorough for the developmental stage it seems to be aimed at and the limited time is has to get the story across and is carefully non-committal about the encounters between the Inca and Pizzarro, without pulling any punches.

Dershowitz emphasizes that American Jews must stop maintaining low profiles or feeling anxious about our success (and non-success), as doing so is the essence of second-class citizenship.

It seemed to do exactly what the author said it would which was to tell you what you already know, but in a way that explains the significance. In effect, gives you some 'mental shortcuts' to use. It is more a book about behavior in a conversation and what the significance is. I can see immediate benefit to a person that performs interviews as part of their job. There are no silver bullets to detecting lies, but there are indicators that suggest the probability. It depends on the context. As I was reading it, I realized that I do some of the things he mentions in the book in my conversations, when I recall information, I look away, when I am thinking while I am talking I look away, when I am trying to 'dump' a talkative person I shift my body position, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal experience of Police Interview Techniques","review":"This great book tells the very personal experience of a Police Interrogator. We can all learn (a lot) from reading this book on dedecting deception, influence and strategic conversation.

Chapter 7 'The eyes have it'. An outstanding chapter which shows the passion and expertise of the author over and over in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and Only Mildly Interesting","review":"This book is just over 200 pages long, and could be much shorter. The words and spacing are large, and there really aren't that many unique concepts. The main thrust of the book is about what a person's eyes can tell you when you are talking to them.

There are a few other little insightful nuggets in the book, but it is otherwise mostly filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense: The Book","review":"I was intrigued by this book because it is about an interesting topic, and because it is by a former police officer. I was very disappointed that I didn't get much out of the book. Unless you are a hermit and have never encountered human life, you know most of the things discussed in the book. There are a couple good topics, but overall it was lacking. As a Criminal Justice major, I found the interrogation tips decent, but felt there was much more to be discussed.

I am a serious movie collector and have over a thousand DVD's in my collection. And the painfull truth is this machine is poorly constructed and it doesn't leave a mirror smooth finish that is necessary for the newer high resolution DVD machines and Blue Ray players. This machine will suffice if you are only using low resolution DVD players because they are not nearly as sensitive as the newer upconverting machines that are being sold today. This machine will also overheat your discs and will likely do more harm to them than good. If you are a serious movie collector and like the beauty of Blue Ray and High Resolution TV Sets, do your self a favor. Don't waste your money on this machine.....Do some reaserch and be willing to spend a fair chunck of money....good repair machines are not cheap, but they are better than wasting money on a poorly made product such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!","review":"I bought this machine because I have a 2 and a 3 yr old and other DVD repair products weren't able to remove the scratches they caused. This one works!! Although it is a little pricey, I believe it has already paid for itself. Some tips: work in batches when repairing because of the multiple steps and although it doesn't say to, you should use the cleaning step as the last step to remove any excess wax - don't hand clean! Also, the polishing pads are pretty sticky, I only took off a small piece of the backing, otherwise the polishing pads tear when removing them from the mounting plates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I used it a few times after I got it. I got acceptable results. The CDs worked again, but still had tell-tale signs on them. No way I would consider the resurfaced discs \\"like new,\\" like some reviewers say. The machine makes trashed discs usable. It doesn't work miracles.I put the machine away for a while, mostly because it was a bit of a pain to use. Fixing a disc was a good 5-10 minute process depending on how far gone it was, so of course I was always putting it off. I finally got around to trying to use it again, once I'd accumulated a sizable pile of scratched discs, and the motor was seized up. I pushed the button, and it just hummed. But of course the warranty is long gone, so now all it's good for is an expensive doorstop.I may try taking it apart and cleaning/lubing it, since I can't make it any worse.

I have several PSP UMDs that are in need of repair.This machine looks like a fine machine, and I will try it on some DVD and CDs that I have, however, IT WILL NOT FIT UMDs.The UMD disc has a smaller diameter hub core, and a metal hub disc with a pinhole center that will not fit the securing hub of this machine. Even if you were able to carefully remove the hub disc, the hub core is too small to fit the machine hub.Even if you were willing to alter the machine hub, by sanding/grinding it down to fit the disc core, the repair pad would not contact the inner 1/3 of the disc.Again, probably great for large discs, but definitely not for UMDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PURCHASE!!!","review":"My little boy loves Toy Story and Monster's Inc. so much he takes the DVD's out of the box and rubs them on the floor.

Since it was only $129.00 and looked like the more expensive models, I decided to give it a try. I was totally blown away at the quality of the machine and the results it produced. I took the most damaged and scratchy disc I could find and this little machine made it look like new again! I used to hand crank scratchy discs and sell them as \\"Resurfaced\\" because they were always left with swirls and scuffs.

The story has a well defined and carried out plot with developing and likeable characters. Young girls with great physical and mental damage are given another chance at living, if only to take the lives of those that are wanted dead by the goverment.

You don't learn much about famous Scots except as their lives relate to one of the main topics listed above.The main impression left by this history is that the Scots did nothing but fight among themselves or with the English. I find it difficult, at best, to visualize the progress of battles, even with maps provided, but if this sort of thing is your cup of tea, you should enjoy the book.Magnuson is a fine writer, but this book contains little in the way of human interest.

I bought the guide because Pyzdek (Six Sigma Handbook --very comprehesive) was associated with it. However, the guidue turned out to be pages of lists at worse or statisitical problems with no explaination at best. If this is a study guide I think Pyzdek & Company are out of control"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has ZERO smell","review":"If you want to order a comfort pillow for the aromatherapy benefits then DO NOT order this. It is okay I guess in terms of comfort- although the material is relatively cheap and you can get something for the same price that is made much better. But there is literally, NO SMELL at all. I can't believe it. What a waste of money. I am not ordering from this company again, 2 negative experiences in a row. Save yourself money, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make 'em like this anymore!!!","review":"Well, I thought this was a piece of music I had lost forever!! I originally purchased this back in 1989 on the strength of 3 tracks - Big Fun, Goodlife and Paradise. With 15 years passing since I last heard the CD, I was sure it would not be as good as I remembered it - boy was I wrong! This CD had stood the test of time extremely well and I would recommend it to anyone interested in 'real' dance music. Definately some brilliant tracks worth downloading onto the ipod for an instant mood lifter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Music","review":"This is one of the few albums you don't get tired of. Soul flows throughout this cd. Paris Grey vocals are powerful but never overdone. My favourites are the two club classics \\"Big Fun\\" & \\"Good Life\\" and more R&B/Soul songs like \\"What'cha Gonna Do With My Lovin'\\". I recommmend this album to anyone that enjoys good music with positive themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"lo mejor de kevin saunderson (comercial life)","review":"El primer y mejor disco de K.S. en su vida comercial. En Paradise saca a relucir todo lo que aprendió del tecno europeo y lo vuelca a la pista de baile. Ninguna de las pistas tiene desperdicio, especialmente BIG FUN y GOOD LIFE, aunque a mi especialmente la canción que más me gusta es POWER OF PASSION, una excelente muestra de tecno-minimal que muestra el poderío vocal de Paris Grey. Sin lugar a dudas, un disco que hizo un camino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking.","review":"After ordering 'Blood', the 3rd album from This Mortal Coil, I decided to pick up Filligree and Shadow, and I am very happy I did. This album combines gentle strings, throbbing guitars and gentle piano chords, along with mesmering synthesizers, creating a 76 minute epic 4AD masterpiece. I was shocked at how wonderful this CD is. Ivo Watts Russell takes a number of relatively unknown songs by other artists, and gives them a '4AD makeover'. (The Jeweller, Come Here My Love, My Father, Strength of Strings, Morning Glory, Firebrothers, I Must Have Been Blind, Alone, Drugs)There are also a number of TMC originals, which connect the songs to each other quite well. Darker and Warmer than It'll End in Tears, but more unfocused than Blood.If you like Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, Pink Floyd, etc. Pick this album up. NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not age well","review":"I remember liking this album 20+ years ago. I gave it a listen recently and determined it belongs in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, emotive mid 80s goth/new wave","review":"'This Mortal Coil' was a superband for 80s alternative label 4AD. I read somewhere that this record was partly the inspiration for NIN's THE FRAGILE. Certainly, it is one of the most influential 80s new wave/goth albums in the canon. It manages to avoid the sickeningly overblown melodrama of several other bands in this category (i.e., Sopor Aeternus) and skips many of the genre's cliches, as well. The emphasis is on mood, voices, and texture; the overall result is suprisingly coherent, given the sheer diversity of participants (cocteau twins, dead can dance, wolfgang press, etc.) Definetly without a question a must-have-on-a-desert-island album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever made!!!","review":"I first heard This Mortal Coil in 1988 and fell instantly in love with their haunted sound. Filigree and Shadow remains in my top 5 of greatest all time records ever. The Jeweller, I Must Have Been Blind and My Father are brilliant. Full of dark strings and voices, it is the sound of midnight come to life. Buy this and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly beautiful music that will make you cry.","review":"My favorite coil cd, though all of them are equally stunning and beautiful.Fillagree and Shadow is the most dark and haunting with my favorite track \\"I must of been Blind\\" reducing me to tears everytime.Check out \\"The Horizon bleeds and sucks its thumb\\". Unreal. The songs on the coil CDs demand your attention, the music is so depressing yet so great that you cannot help but melt.I was into extreme heavy metal 10 years ago (still am)but an ex girlfriend turned me onto This Mortal Coil, Dead Can Dance and the Cocteau Twins. She forever changed my tastes as I own just about every CD I could find on the aforementioned artists.4AD has re-released? Lonely is an Eyesore on CD, which is similar to the This Mortal Coil CDs. Definitly worth a look.Their is no music quite like the This Mortal Coil CDs. Simply put, Coil is essential to any music collection. Seek out, purchase and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly beautiful","review":"This CD has not left my stereo for all that long lately... It serves as exquisite chill-out music, yet forces you to pay attention to it... All the tracks on this album are of stellar quality, but the ones that most readily leap to mind for me are \\"Tarantula,\\" \\"Firebrothers,\\" and a quite sinister cover of the David Byrne-written \\"Drugs.\\" I can honestly say there's nothing on this that serves as filler, and that Ivo Watts-Russell and John Fryer picked an impressive array of collaborators, as well as gathering a unique eclectic selection of cover songs (Van Morrison and Judy Collins, for example). I must admit that this is the only This Mortal Coil CD I own... but that'll be remedied soon enough, to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start with \\"It'll End In Tears\\" first before this one","review":"this has some great moments, but it can be uneven and sounds a bit dated now. I was a 4AD addict way back when but sometimes there can be some cringe-inducing moments of frilliness on this one, also moments of over-production, but I suppose that was part of the 4AD sound. \\"It'll End In Tears\\" is really the one to get. This is a runner-up. Still has moments of beauty though."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasurable sounds indeed","review":"The mood of this work is intentionally melancholic. Some songs have beautiful melodies, others are little more than \\"ambient\\" music, but all are superbly arranged and performed. Echoes of Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance abound, and you will like this CD if you like these groups. Well before the new age and ethnic craze, TMC anticipated a popular trend, while managing to avoid the kitch that pervades the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like the Cliff Notes of great Psychology writings!","review":"This book provides a fabulous overview of some of psychology's greatest works - chapter-long excerpts from renowned psychologists like James, Freud, Pinker, Chomsky and so many more. A great way to get a feel for some of these original works (without getting bogged down with pages and pages of over-technical psycho-babble). Great for the undergraduate psychology student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcus creates a great collection of readings!","review":"This book is great--I have to read certain selections for my Psych100 class and they are always interesting and exciting.

The text focuses on mathematic theory, not on calculations and economic applications. This text is not good for applied economics or business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I used this book as a review of the mathematical concepts before entering my Ph. D. program. It is extremely helpful and well-written. From the very beginning, Chiang does a good job in explaining things. I initially complained about the dragging discussion on convex sets. Later on, I realized the importance of such in optimization, and finally understood why Chiang had the reader go through that much detail. A decent background in calculus and statistics is probably sufficient to get you through this book on your own. Although the last edition of this book was written in 1984, I think that it's still one of the best reference books that you can have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashe is dreaming","review":"This book is often taught in Arthurian classes as an example of the mistakes historians can make by engaging with a problem with a preconceived idea of what they want to discover. Dr. Ashe presents evidence that does not preclude the existence of an Arthur and uses this for proof that there was an Arthur, which are not the same thing and would not be nearly so compelling to someone who did not begin believing that there was something to find. The development of an Arthurian tradition - and the stunningly disparate accounts of the supposed \\"man\\" himself - are so fractured as to make it difficult to find any single unitary thread. Far more likely that the idea of a single King Arthur grew from elements of Celtic folklore concerning heroes named Arthur and the more general desire for a salvation myth for P-Celtic culture, then in the process of being overrun by population shifts from mainland Germany and Denmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another good band that didn't know when to quit","review":"As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me. And they were, for 2 releases anyway. This band has run out of things to say. Dean Wareham's lyrics grow more inane with each release. Ex-Feelie Stanley Demeski is gone, replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer. Buy Lunapark or Bewitched instead...Penthouse is okay, but the decline started there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much time uptown at the zoo?","review":"Please don't get me wrong. I love this band. I just don't think this album is much to talk about. I really tried to like it---but after 7 or 8 listens I found myself diggin in the archives for my Luna fix. The hooks weren't hookin and the craft was average at best. I did like the GnR cover though (Better than Sheryl's cut --((gulp)) If your lookin to check out Luna start w/ Bewitched, Slide, or Penthouse first. This release ain't the masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"I work at a music store, and I have to admit I only picked up this album because I thought it had a cool cover. I had never even heard of them before. When I put it on the overhead, I was immediatley drawn into the layered guitars and the shadowy vocals. Luna is an interesting brand of pop unlike anything I've heard before. They blend mysteriousness and melody very nicely, and the album is a smooth listen from beginning to end. The highlight of the album is \\"The Old-Fashioned Way,\\" which will stay humming around in your head for an endless period of time. I do, however, think that the cover of GN'R's \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" does not belong on this album. I dig Guns N' Roses- it just doesn't fit here. Although I must say Luna's version outdoes the Sheryl Crow version by leaps and bounds. Overall- a great surprise; you should check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another good bad that didn't know when to quit","review":"As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me.

This one is subtly accessible from the get go and much like all of the Luna releases, rewards more and more with repeated listens.As is par for the course with Luna, you get a handful of incredibly irresistible, perfect, pop songs (Old Fashioned Way, Seven Steps to Satan, Math Wiz) sandwiched between tunes that are not quite as catchy upon first listen, but prove rewarding at the end of the day.The only misstep - Slow Song - which is a true throwaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piano Spectacular","review":"A fascinating and challenging piece of music that grows on you, the more you listen to it.

The interpretation of the music is reasonable but does not compare with more accomplished artists such as Marc-Andre Hamelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has been a bad year","review":"This has been quite a year for Latin singers making bad career moves, but this is the worst. It's bad enough when someone like Alejandro Fernandez wastes a great voice on dumbed-down pop, but that becomes so much worse when someone with only a voice for dumbed-down pop pretends he has the voice for ranchera. Christian Castro has neither the necessary alpha-male voice nor the emotional expression nor the sophisticated macho sex appeal to carry this music. He should stick with what he's done before and please that audience; some of us are very particular about who is up to the challenges of ranchera. The single star rating is for the quality of the booklet insert; that's the only good thing about this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible service!!","review":"I never got my DVD from this vendor (Zoverstocks) That sucks! they should send the product or refund my money I hope they do something about this Issue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad CD!","review":"I don't like this CD! His voice is not for ranchera music and he does not look good in a charro suit, either. I think Cristian should stick to pop music and regular civilian clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a rating below 1 star, for just outright unacceptable...","review":"Cristian or should I say Cristina, should stick to singing his pop ballads and leave the Ranchera genre for people who don't sound like a female trying to sing these much loved songs. He neither has the vocal range or the feeling to sing these songs. It is quite obvious that he recorded this CD to attempt to compete with Luis Miguel since everything Luis seems to do, Cristian is not far behind in trying to copy him. He should stick to what he does best, which is being the son of Veronica Castro. Quit while you're ahead Cristian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time friend Angie Stewart Carroll from Cullman","review":"I am a long time friend of Jayson, Brett, and JD. Their album is awesome!!! I am extremely amazed on the extreme talent that these guys produce. They are a great group and have awesome talent. I love ya'll and good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD that hasn't been pushed around enough","review":"I was introduced to the band shortly after I found out their lead singer (Brett Hestla, who, by the way, has the most awesome voice I've ever listened too. He gives Scott Anderson (Finger Eleven) a run for his money) replaced Creed's bass player on tour back in 2000. After that I just had to have the CD, there was no stopping me, though it was extrememly obscure here and still is.I was awestruck after listening to songs like \\"Beautiful Lie\\" and \\"Parasite\\" by far the best on this CD. The others blew me away too, the lyrics, like Finger Eleven's, are deep (words can't describe them) songs like \\"The Cycle\\" and \\"Disregarding\\", the opener and closer, respectively, seem to bring this point across easily.I recommend their 2nd album, under the name of Virgos, though it is only available through bandrags.com, it is even better than the this one. This is a must buy, both are, take the chance and discover something new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss, personified","review":"my god, brett hestla has the voice of an angel. it is like this blissful, clear-ringing bell, accompanied by these blow-you-away chords and lyrics. i swear, BUY THIS CD--you will thank me! i can't get enough of these amazing songs, such as \\"the cycle\\" and \\"wrong\\" and \\"kiss my disease!\\" it's amazing! the first time i ever heard them, it was live, and i must say i was not in the LEAST bit disappointed in the way they sounded on the album. they are NOT one of those bands that only sounds good live, if you catch my drift, but i have now seen them live twice, and it just gets better and better! these guys and their music rule! they are also so polite to their fans! GO VIRGOS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Record!","review":"Virgos Merlot's \\"Signs of A Vacant Soul\\",rocks!

Songs are beastly, beautiful and memorable at the same time. It has become one of all time favorite albums. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil","review":"Black metal without the keyboard drowning out the rest of the bands. It seems alot of black metal groups have too much keyboard Dimmu is no acception but on this one its not as overwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not terrible, just boring","review":"Nothing really stands out here. No melodic keyboard work, evil vocals, or memorable riffs. Alot of reviews praise Hellhammer's drum work, but lets make no mistake about, he's no Nick Barker. The drumming on this cd is nothing out of the ordinary.I like the idea of them making a concept album b/c DCA was a plain cd, the songs were not related in any way. My fave album from these guys is Spiritual Black Dimensions, and this is a far cry from it. I know most bands progess as times go on, but on Diabli, it just doesn't click."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was over 2 months late","review":"I enjoy this cd, but the delivery estimate was for may 3. I didnt even recieve it until the beginning of july. This is the second time something like this happened with amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal gods","review":"In Sorte Diaboli is not a let down. Great follow up cd to Death Cult Armageodon. This one is heavier that Death Cult heavier guitars and pounding drums with the help of the great Hellhammer. This is a concept album but was pulled off very well unlike other bands. It tells the story of a man who was on path of god but discovers that the left hand path suits him better. This album is worth every cent, great music and the booklet is an added bonous along with the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Black Metal Masterpiece!","review":"What more can really be said this is Dimmu Borgir. In extreme theatrical black metal style they deliver another masterpiece that will keep them on top in their genre. They take some getting used to which I'm still working on but you can't knock these guys for the talents and abilities they demonstrate in this album. It is finely produced at every point and like other cds by this band you get a eerrie evil feeling listening to them which means they are good at what they do. If you like black metal then dont fail to pick this new one by Dimmu Borgir you won't be disappointed by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimmu just gets BETTER!!!","review":"This is one of the most awesome and complicated albums I have ever had the privelage of buying! Dimmu Borgir is definately becoming a legendary band! The only problem is its a bit short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mah....could have been alot better....","review":"Not quite what I was expecting. I know when I can't listen to a cd more than 2 or 3 times something is wrong with it. Hellhammers drumming (which is no where near talents of Barker) completly takes over the album. It's hard to listen to the guitaring, and if you hear any guitaring at all, it's very simple, and repetative. Once you hit the half way point on the album, you might as well just hit stop, there is nothing past song 5 that is worth the listen, well you pretty much have listened to it on the first five songs, nothing new at all. These guys are telented musicians, they are far more capable writing something better than this album. We will all have to wait and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for the whole family","review":"No, actually, this will probably appeal to a small segment of the population. However, having never bought a black metal CD, this is some awesome work. I've listened to some other black metal (emperor and more DIMMU) but this CD and DVD are excellent introductions to the genre.'Serpentine' is far and away the top track here. Sorry to the hardcore black metal fans who'll dismiss it as too clean sounding. This song rules, the changes are awesome. It gets you so pumped that you're goign to listen to the next three tracks regardless. the \\"concept\\" of the album is kind of \\"meh\\" but if it gives them some inspiration to pummel my skull with, that's fine by me.The Limited Edition also features a DVD that covers the album's production and the video for the Serpentine Offering. Worth the extra couple bucks for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential, like Ezra Jack Keats, Shakespeare, Virginia Lee Burton, the Greek myths, and the Bible","review":"This thin oversize book---bought on a whim when my four were young, because I'd grown up with Hyman's illustrations--became a staple of my kids' childhood. They pulled it out in October, in lovely anticipation of coming snow. We read it in spring, as we prepared to face the summer's heat. In fact there were years when this book was never put away at all.It's charm is not just one of selection, illustration or layout, but all three and much more, too. Barbara Rogasky selected modern and old works of poetry both nonsensical and profound and, married to Hyman's wonderful watercolors portraying life in their chaotic, shared Oregon house, these works just come alive. In fact an adult, too, can easily sink into the big, crowded Hyman/Rogasky farmhouse right along with their children. This is a purchase that parents will want to keep for their grandchildren. Mine stands by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Toastmaster!","review":"I used to own the Toastmaster Hot Pot but I accidentally left it too close to the burner one day and I needed a new one. I liked the Toastmaster but I wanted to try something a little more aesthetically pleasing so I bought the Toastess as a replacement. One of the things I loved about the Toastmaster was that it automatically turned off when it reached a certain temperature; the Toastess does not do this and regularly boils over. The Toastmaster's electrical cord was long but never really in the way. The Toastess cord is located underneath the pot and makes the pot sit on an angle. The black hot plate inside the pot of the Toastess is already peeling off and I've only used it maybe ten times and I never had that problem with the Toastmaster. The Toastmaster has a built-in strainer and the lid is removable. The Toastess has neither option. If you're looking for something like this, get the Toastmaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, however.....","review":"I'm not here to review the Beach Boys' music. Their \\"records\\" speak for themselves. I bought this CD hoping to get a \\"cleaner\\" version of \\"All Summer Long\\" than the one I have on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Well, the sound on this CD is worse. It's terrible on all tracks. Yes, I know these aren't remastered or anything, but there is static, wild fluctuations in volume, and that popping noise you hear when playing phonograph records all through this CD. Frankly, I think I could make a better recording myself if I had the vinyl records!

With the help from Goto's friend Matsui and Momoka the reporter, the team finds who's involved and plan to stop them. The other two dvds is all in Japanese with english subtitles.

Smooth jazz can describe anything from Kenny G to George Duke, which says nothing about either.Now, say \\"smooth jazz,\\" to describe texture, and there is something to talk about. Azmuth fits such description: the buffered sheens of this popping bass, electric jazz don't tell you if the Light As A Feather is great or terrible, just that it is smooth.This music reminds me of a much more funky, more complex Bob James. The glistening keyboards, popping cymbals and precise, popping four string playing make this substantive work glide down. Your listening repeatedly to this ear candy that happens to be very,very vitamin rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jazz from the Brazilian group","review":"I had heard a track years ago, and was trying to work out who it was by.I realised that it was called 'Jazz Carnival' by Azymuth.I picked up the album, based on one track, and I wasn't disappointed.There are some nice melodic tracks, and some funky ones too!If you like Azymuth, this is a nice album to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadzilla - 'Broadzilla Vs.

Although there are a few hits missing, such as the 1964 remake of Walk--Don't Run, but since this is a special market budget comp, you still get a decent overview of their signature songs in their original mixes, while the most comprehensive compilation, Walk--Don't Run: The Best of The Ventures, is part of the Legendary Masters Series has many tracks remixed by Ron Furmanek in 1990, so if you wish to hear their hits the way they were heard in the 1960s, this is the disc to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"LP transfer","review":"The CD label, Definitive, has the right idea by issuing this long out-of-print engaging 1954 session. The packaging is top drawer with a well documented insert (a reproduction of the original LP liner notes) and back tray. Nevertheless, for those who are prone to purchasing this CD----it really is all about the music. This CD is a transfer from an LP and not from the original session master tape. Pops, dings, and even surface noise, though faint, are discernible intermittantly throughout; Louie Bellson's cymbals are barely present. A skip or 2 are detectable. Curious why an LP in better condition could not have been used for this transfer. The bonus track? \\"Lullably in Rhythm\\" is presumably ripped from the recently issued Norman Granz Jam Session box set. The sound quality is quite improved; Louie Bellson's cymbals are easy to pick up. Though a \\"bonus\\" track to the CD, but not really \\"new\\" music, which is what a bonus track typically implies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a bit disappointed as the quality of the CD had a number of faults where the sound skipped.

But if you are looking for a thought provoking, tender, poignant and often funny story, you've hit the jackpot. I am running out of adjectives for my two favorite actors (Newman and Woodward ought to be declared America's royalty) They shine here. Much deserved Oscar nomination for Woodward and should have been one for Newman, who never ceases to amaze. Blythe Danner is a plus as well. I thouroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks dramatic momentum","review":"Episodic and disjointed, this contraction of Connell's 2 novels never really gels. There doesn't seem to have been a direction plan established. Ivory's transitions are blunt and graceless and his camera blocking appears arbitrary. Little dramatic power is built up and the film just kind of ends.Like the human body, it is often the connective tissue of a movie that creates structure and definition. Here that is mostly ignored, with the result that you see in Mr. and Mrs. Bridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr and Mrs Bridge","review":"The story is slow paced.

Very strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acting by Great Stars","review":"This movie has some wonderful actors in it, and the development of the characters was fascinating to me. I only gave it four stars, however, because the ending was disappointing. It was almost as if the director decided the movie was long enough, so it should be wrapped up quickly by simply narrating the ending! If not for the way it ended, I would have given it five stars for the acting. I enjoy character studies, but my husband prefers action, and this was a very different kind of role for Paul Newman, who plays a concerned but stern patriarch of a family coming apart at the seams. My husband felt there was not enough action in the storyline to hold his attention, but I loved the subtlety of emotions playing across the wonderfully expressive faces of Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman and Blythe Danner, especially. Superb actors at the top of their form!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"Nothing happens in this pleasant-looking, well-acted, plotless film. At regular intervals it seems like something might happen or at least develop enough to inspire an emotional response in the viewer, but as soon as an eyebrow is raised the film cuts away to another scene. Frustrating. Until the very end when it seems certain that something will happen that will give the film some shape. It doesn't.This film does keep reminding you that parents and kids don't understand each other and it will please some Americans to see the affluent class and history on display. My only real enjoyment was realising, as the credits came up, that, despite all the expectation, nothing had happened.Might appeal to retired middle-class parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Value, Terrible Construction","review":"This product offers a number of features that are usually only found on more expensive metronomes, so it is a good value. However the product is completely unreliable. The drone sometimes plays the pitch indicated on the led screen, and sometimes plays a pitch that is a semitone and a half sharp. The circuit board is constructed terribly. At least once a month a wire becomes disconnected on my metronome and I have to re-attach it with a solder gun. I would advise spending the money on a Korg or a Boss metronome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened, no value here","review":"To start, I'm a fan of Kareena Kapoor and I think Shahid Kapur is a good actor. But this 2004 movie (somewhat early in their acting careers) is a harsh, unsympathetic, and extreme story.The acting & cinematography are good (the DVD quality is good), but the characters' actions in this story are always extreme (love to die for, cruel/greedy personalities). This is not a light/happy movie.The ending, though reasonably appropriate, is a little shocking and very depressing.I would recommend other movies that are actually enjoyable, with great stories/acting involving these 2 actors as follows:..... Kareena Kapoor - \\"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\\" (2001), \\"Khushi\\" (2003), \\"Jab We Met\\" (2007), and \\"3 Idiots\\" (2009).....

The scene of Elvis in the donut shop is one of the best ever -- the absurdity of the situation, coupled with the truth (as we know it) about Elvis makes it one of my favorite movie scenes. Elvis, alone, is something that I never contemplated, nor, it seems, did his entourage. It truly offered a different perspective of the man. Acting -- good to excellent, especially Elvis. \\"My boy, my boy\\" -- it's a movie I would highly recommend, especially for those weekend nights where you want something different and light."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King goes to DC!","review":"I saw this movie on Showtime back in 1998, and have been hoping it will break into the DVD market soon. A brilliant account of true events. It gives you an enjoyable experience of the King of Rock and Roll, as he journeys around Haight-Ashbury and then around DC, ultimately visiting with President Nixon in the hopes of becoming a DEA agent to fight the war on drugs. A great insight into the similarities of two totally different characters, Elvis and Nixon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"One of the best movies about Elvis that you will ever see.

There are amusing bits, yes, but most come at the expense of the actual truth, not the \\"truth\\" the film makers sell. That's what makes this film most offensive to me. You can (and they did) make up so much of this stuff! Do your homework, \\"fans.\\" While the general outline of meeting Nixon is true, there was no walk on Sunset strip, no record shop moment, etc. So many scenes have been manufactured. The fact that neither Sonny West nor Jerry Shilling would lend their names to it as \\"characters\\" tells you something, particularly since they were there for some of that actual meeting. What this is is a hodgepodge of various moments arranged by movie folks with an ax to grind, if not with Elvis, most certainly with Nixon.

For those who are putting this show down...as a lot of others have said...this is for kids not you. And I may not be a trained and professional musician or dancer but I think they are very talented (Kiki, the one in pink is trained in Opera by the way and has been playing violin since she was 3 for all you snobby people who say they have no talent).

This is pathetic in comparison. I can't help but wonder why something of such low caliber would even be published.It may be somewhat suitable for the junior high youth group crowd, but it is far from a sounding board for deep, mature, articulated discussion.

From the youngest (age 6) to the eldest (60), they all loved it! The play is really simple- you select a card with an item on it and everyone has to anonimously draw the person/ place/ thing/ idea. Then you draw another card with an adjective on it and vote whose drawing best depicts the criteria. (ie. Which drawing looks like the artist didn't know what they were doing?)

Deux-Deux: We know her debut sold 14 million copies in America due to el jailbaited laced video for title cut and Crazy and the song Sometimes cries that she was a victim of abusive relationship. However, people grow tired of bubblegum music quick and hence why this tramp's sales have curtailed in recent years.

Kickass dog chew toy or beer coaster!!","review":"The only good thing that came from this album is the 2 punk covers of \\"Hit me Baby\\" One of them was done by Blink 182 with Travis (the drummer of the band) as the lead singer! That was the greatest thing I have ever heard. Besides the punk cover of \\"Hit me Baby\\" everything else on the \\"album\\" blows the big one. I just can't comprehend how people can listen to this and actually enjoy it. Its so manufactured, lame, boring, unoriginal, FAKE, and the most absolute obvious attempt for the record companies to seperate young teens from their money. Do youself a favor and avoid pop idles like Britany Spears like the plauge. If happy, emotional or party music is what your looking for then I would recommend the Ataris album \\"So Long, Astoria\\". Besides that I recommend Metallica Master of Puppets or anything by NOFX."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst CD","review":"If I'm giving an award for the worst singer and album. I would give the award to Britney Spears. She sings like a little child, actually, she doen't know how to SING at all. Her voice is disgusting and I feel like she's screaming everytime I hear her music. She won't even write her music like many other artists do. I'm sure she won't be around for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Preppie Pop","review":"This is a prime example why many people went \\"Alternative\\" starting in the late 1980's. Sure she's beautiful, but the music is artificial junk,and the way technology is today you can make a dog's howl sound better then this! There are many others like her out there. Listen to top 40 radio, and you'll hear many others who sound just as bad or worse. I think there is going to be a \\"REAL\\" Pop music revolution within the next two or three years with the emergence of internet radio. I can't wait until the day comes when the general public \\"wakes\\" up and starts listening to \\"ReaL\\" music."},{"rating":"1","title":"god awful mindless pop","review":"it amazes me that Britney has become the queen of pop and it all started with this album which is nothing spectacular. BABY ONE MORE TIME and YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY are extremely infectius and you may shoot your stereo because of the contagious melodies those songs have. After that, well the album pretty much goes stale. there is not alot to say about this album which is pretty much ear candy musical soda pop. not really good for you but it sounds good. not as provactive or sexy as later Britney, it is, if anything, a begginning but i found this album to be flat, emotionless ballads and generic pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Album Is Perfect!","review":"Britney Spears first album is perfect. Why? Because she was just starting out in the pop world. She was just a teenager and the songs went well with her image at that time of the release. I really enjoy her vocals because her voice is pleasing to the hear even though some say her voice was changed and dubbed by a machine. All four singles that were released from this album show cased that she no one hit wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 and a half stars would be better","review":"Eeeeew. It's no surprise that this album hit 12x platinum here in the US prior to \\"Oops I Did It Again,\\" I give her credit for her success, but it's all Backstreet Boys/N Sync/Christina Aguilera/soundalike material designed to help young girls get out of the hardest things in life. There are so many better artists out there, listen to any one of them and you'll soon notice what's missing in her."},{"rating":"1","title":"so many bad things to say, so little time","review":"Well, this CD might be tolerable if Britney Spears could sing. Which, by the way, she can't. And honestly, even if she could sing, the lyrics would still be insipid, and the song \\"E-Mail My Heart\\" would still exist. To think that the lyrics are that dumb and she didn't even *write* them. To think that someone was actually *paid* to write something that absolutely awful is sickening. My sister has this CD, and even she got sick of it after about a week. Please, save your money and your sanity and skip this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for only 2 good songs","review":"The first 2 songs are good but after that all the rest are so bad.

And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"um... no thanks","review":"one of my friend's little sister has this CD and had it on when i was there. this is one of the worst CD's i ever heard. but it doesn't help that me and my friend hate her, but if you actually like her, you would probley like the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugary sweet pop at it's best!","review":"This CD has lots of great dance tunes that you'll love!

Songs like 'Sometimes,' 'Baby One More Time,' and all the other totally cool songs by our favorite artist, Miss Spears. Congress should pass a law saying that EVERYONE MUST OWN the Britney Spears CD!!! If you don't have it, GET IT!!! Britney Spears... What can one say?

I recommend this CD to anyone who likes a variety of music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad......Bad......Bad.....","review":"I bought the cd because of baby one more time. I absolutely loved that song but all the rest of her songs suck. When she sings live she is horrible. The onley thing she has going for her is her looks.

What a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BIGGEST ONE HIT WONDER OF THE MILENIUM!!!","review":"She has only one good hit on the whole album and that is obviously the track's title.

It's so stupid. \\"...Baby One More Time\\", the hit single, is sung by just that-a baby. 17 years old with songs begging for sex and freshly-done breast implants? Not to mention the fact that she can't sing. It's all computer synthisized-there's no talent there. And guys go nuts over her!

But this is just too much. Boring, uninspired songs with dumb lyrics (\\"email my heart\\"!?) which Spears did not even write. As usual, another cheeky, sexually teasing pop adolescent.

This is hardly great. It's not so terrible either. For the genre, she sings well enough. Obviously influenced by Mariah and Whitney, she finds that she doesn't quite have the chops to do a straight imitation, which has a real plus side...NO VOCAL OVERKILL. There's a kind of nice Europop feel to some of the tracks, and her updated version of \\"The Beat Goes On\\" is less kitschy than the Sonny & Cher original (and dumps some of the cornier lyrics to boot). But unlike Cher, who was also in her teens when she started out, I kind of doubt Britney Spears is in it for the long haul...but then, you never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"So I thought this CD was gonna be so much better than it was. When I first get CD's I don't like them that much so I try to give them a chance for a couple of weeks. This CD just didn't come around. The songs were unoriginal and followed the lines of every other pop singer. Honestly, I only liked 4 songs on this CD. I was also thrown off by the song titles: Soda Pop and E-mail my heart! I did not expect this album to be like this. If you are interested in a CD look elsewhere this time. But keep in mind she is coming out with a new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDD!","review":"ok, I know that this one is the best compare to britney's other stuff. I don't listen to this crap anymore. I selled it to my brother 2yrs ago....with about 4$ and so did other ones. I really regret wasting my important money.Whenever I listened to this, I suddenly thought that she was totally lack of musical talent. Her songs still make me disgustied or sometimes make me vomit. oh god!!!!!and more worse thing is It's been about 5yrs that she's been a 'singer'(well, I don't know that I can call her singer, 'cause she's more like dancer or stripper), there's no change in her songs. She still sings about temptating men and go to bed with them. for 5yrs! maybe, she's just too obsessed about going to bed with men, whatever.I really dislike her. She shouldn't have been a singer if she was gonna sings these craps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A KID!!","review":"Although I have to said that her songs in this albums are great, but hey SHE DOES NOT NOW HOW TO SING, IS ALL COMPUTER WORK PEOPLE. !BE REALISTIC!Well She is smart though, she dosen't scream like SCREAM MACHINE (C.AGUILERA), that's why she is still in the market , o yeah that too she barely wears any clothes on stage , You know how it is, if you know how to dance, and don't mind wearing nothing on stage u are hired.Anyways, I have to open all of u eyes, by telling u that DON'T GET THIS CD, is not worth to pay for computer work that u can do at home with a kareokee machine. And for the record, don't let ur kids get too involved with her music etc, cause then they all want to become BRITNEY SPEARS and hey IS NOT A GOOD THINK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright Tripe","review":"Possibly one of the worst albums of the year. Britney cannot sing worth anything, and any vocal skill she has is not displayed on this album. The dipthongs are flat-out annoying (for example, the awful mispronunciation \\"...oh bay-buh bay-buh...\\"). Perhaps if she could actually pronounce words correctly this may be a slightly better album. But not that it matters, since she didn't actually write any of these songs. The songs aren't actually about anything important anyway - they all have the same, 'gee whiz, boys are fun and I'm an idiot' type lyrics. Britney is a mere flash in the pan, reminiscent of the Tiffany's and Debbie Gibson's of yesteryear. This album is awful and a pathetic attempt at pop. Puh-lease, \\"E-mail My Heart\\" ? How can anyone take this seriously? For real pop fun, try the pop-punk band Mr. T Experience, for real clever lyrics and savory pop melodies...that's my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed listener","review":"\\"Baby One More Time\\" is a disappointment to pop fans. The lyrics are so sugar-coated and Britney exudes no vocal range or depth whatsoever. The only decent song is the title track.

Sorry, but I regret listening to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE IS HOT!!!","review":"I usually never listen to this stuff, but she is so damn hot and her voice is awesome.

Britney's following singles like Crazy and Sometimes are pleasant sounding enough to keep you interested in the CD. Unfortunatly these tracks are at the beginning of the album and make this CD a big anti-climax, as the tracks on the rest of album, seem to be forgetable mushy, pop ballads. Britney is an appealing personality, but it seems most of this album was written in a very short space of time to meet the demand of Britney fans due to the well deserved success of her first hit. However this album seems directed towards the younger age group of fans, the same fans who would buy the Britney Spears doll and lacks any real substance to appeal anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by title track!","review":"I listened o this CD at a friend's house and I am so glad she wasted money on it and not me. I think that they are trying to hard to make her a star and a sex symbol and they missed the fact that she can't sing. All her songs are pointless and meaningless and it doesn't help that she has an annoying voice. If all her songs were more like the title track then maybe this CD would have had a chance.

I bought it for the new single \\"Crazy\\", which I really like. But to my disapointment, the rest of the CD was ballads, and none to good at that. I realize that Miss Spears is a likeable person and I am not saying anything bad about her (in fact, I am not even going to bring that issue up), but I feel she should have more upbeat songs like \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Hit me baby..\\" (which hide her poor vocal range), and less of stupid, pointless, bubble gum pop songs like \\"Email my Heart\\" and \\"Born to Make You Happy\\". If you're like me and have only heard her three siingles, (Baby, Sometimes, and Crazy), I would say save 8 dollars and just buy the singles- the CD really isn't worth it.

Anyway it is about this time in music history when all of the worst stuff in music history was produced (not to mention it has not stopped). To this day bands are created by CORPORATIONS and not by their own means. Britney Spears is a perfect example of this notion, sure she is beautiful and sexy, but she has nothing worthwhile to say and not to mention her music is bland and it is quite apparently thin as music goes. Pop music has never gone so low as Britney Spears. If you want to waste you're money go ahead, but be warned today's music industry is nothing what it used to be and this is coming from a GEN-X contemporary. Corporate ROCK has to stop. Who will end the mysery of millions of miling minions? You or me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same...","review":"This is just more of the trite, bubble-gum, producer-driven crap with a pretty face to sell it - same old stuff the music industry has been spewing out lately. Nothing even remotely imaginative from an artistic standpoint. There's so much studio \\"sweetening\\" on this CD that it is impossible to tell what her voice really sounds like under the dozens of additional tracks of instruments, synths, backing vocalists and effects used to draw attention away from the fact that she just isn't that talented. At least Debbie Gibson can actually sing... let's see Ms. Spears do Broadway, then we'll talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's great!","review":"I don't know what happens when you listen to this CD but it is fure fun!

She has made a name for herself, but is her talent in reality worth record breaking stature? Honestly NO, society is deprived of a young female role model, so the first one to enter the late 90's pop sensation time period, everyone had choosen to jump the band wagon and idolize her. True she does conatain more talent that the average Joe, but all the publicity she has recieved had been unbelievably exaggerated. During live performances Britney is repeadly booded off stage for singing incredably horrible. The type of songs this young lady sings are in my oppinion not all their cracked up to be. They are the types of songs you can not stand, but you know every single word, because the music is so catchy. The music on this CD is not #1 on Billboard material. If you are a true music lover this is NOT the selection you should choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit me Britney one more time!","review":"Britney Spears has definitely made an impact upon music. Its seems like yesterday was the first time I heard Baby One More Time on the radio. I thought it sounded good but had no idea who she was. Only five months later, I own 3 copies of her album, (I'm not obsessed) and one of her single, and think she's one of the best singers of all time. Sure she didn't right any songs, but singing is 90% of the talent. Writing is easy if you can sing. So move over Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Backstreet Boys, N'sync, and all of you other pop bands, Britney Spears is here, and she's here to stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word-Disapointed","review":"When I first heard Baby One More Time, I enjoyed the song and thought, \\"Wow! She's good,\\" but she didn't even write that song. She doesn't write any of her songs. Even if she did it wouldn't make the songs sound any better since the rest of the her songs are just flavorless. The songs maybe a bit catchy, but it's still boring. Her voice isn't too wonderful either. I think she tried too hard to sound older and stretch her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"it really baffles me that millions and millions of people love this \\"music\\", which is not really music at all but britney's computer enhanced voice over drum machines and synthesizers. It's great if you're a shallow mindless teen who goes along with whatever's popular at the time to look \\"cool\\" in front of your friends, but for anyone with a scrap of dignity or musical taste, it's terrible. I am 15 yrs old and a bunch of my friends and my sister have bought this. I was forced to listen to the whole album once, afterwhich I SWALLOWED A BOTTLE OF ADVIL! It's just shallow, mindless and anyone with any sense will wholeheartedly agree with me. Try Kiss or Blues Traveler for some real talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO BRITNEY!!!","review":"This CD is great! There is only one song that is just okay: I will still love you because I'm not to fond of duets. The best songs are \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Born to Make You Happy\\", \\"You Drive me Crazy\\", \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Soda Pop\\". All the other songs are great to.

GO BRITNEY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An HONEST review for a change. . .","review":"It seems like all the previous reviews are by either raving lunatics either strongly in favor of or strongly against Britney Spears. . .Folks, for those of you who have seen Britney Spears sing live, I'm sure you can tell she isn't the world's most gifted singer, which is rather obvious on this CD. In fact, her singing may well be below average, she tends to sing through her nose and warble.If you are after catchy, peppy dance tunes, albeit ocassionally annoying and insipid, then this is the disc for you.But please people, we don't need to hear about how hot she is or how she's the world's best singer, and neither do we need to hear people cuss the kid out."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I think she worked hard but i was really disapointed. I only liked 4 songs. The rest were 70's or 80's music that weren't good enough to put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play This Album One More Time!!","review":"This is one of those rare debut albums that's great. Some of the songs are really childish, like \\"Soda Pop\\" and \\"Email My Heart\\", but they're still listen-able. I never skip a track in this album, and every time I listen to the songs I mention, I burst out laughing. Not all tracks are 10/10 this time. The ones I mentioned in particular are like 7/10. I only listen to these tracks because they give me a heck of a good laugh all throughout the song, and it's fun. Average album, but all her albums after this one are much better, and she gets better with every album she makes. Britney will always be the Princess of Pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im only giving it 1 star because I can't give it ZERO.....","review":"I went in listening to this CD with the impression I got from her constant promotions that there would be something more than asinine lyrics and bubble gum pop tunes. After getting through two and a half songs I found myself reaching for a blunt object to obliterate the CD with. Her voice sounds like she's being tortured. She tries to sound mature and sexy with her raspy voice but only comes out whiny. After learning more about her hypocritical ways it just makes me want to burn the CD even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old mindless garbage","review":"I would have given this zero stars, were that an option. The only reason I've even heard this entire CD is because one of my more simple-minded friends is a misguided fan. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing personal against Britney- it's only that she encompasses what is so irritating about popular music today. Why is it that I can't turn on the radio and hear some original music? Britney Spears does not write her songs, she does not play an instrument; what she does is sing (and not particularly well, truthfully; that little baby voice of hers is rather aggravating) and look pretty. Whereas, truly talented performers, who not only sing, but write their music, and- gasp!- play an instrument, go unnoticed. For some real music with lasting power and complexity, try Beth Orton, or Ani DiFranco, or Tori Amos. If you want \\"real\\" pop music, give Heather Nova a try. She's breathy, she's sweet, she's accessible, but she is also a songwriter, a guitarist, and she makes real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you all say Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, etc.","review":"Sure, \\"Baby, One More Time\\" is catchy, but I think anyone would have been able to make a hit out of that one with the proper slick studio producers. But the rest of the album is sugar coated and generic mush. Her voice is in the league of Paula Abdul and Jennifer Lopez, heaving, and sighing, and whining. I think she sang better when she was younger and on Star Search. I must give her points for being able to exploit her inoffensive and plastic surgery enhanced teen sexuality to the masses (pre-pubescent squealing teens). But for those of you dreaming that she is a diva and here to stay, I'd like to see if any one of you would actually listen to her when you are no longer teens yourselves. You can even dare to call her a Diva if she's around in 5-10 years. Did anyone call Debbie Gibson a diva, and she had two hit albums, multiple hit singles, could actually sing, and wow she even actually wrote her own material (as bubble gum as they were)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly nauseating","review":"I found this CD dull, unoriginal, and downright dumb. The songs make no sense, and dear Ms. Spears is a walking contradiction to her lyrics. It took me about 5 minutes to get through the whole CD, after listening to the beginnings of songs and discovering one repetitive song after another. She needs to let her real voice come out, and stop trying to be something she isn't. If someone gave me the money, I wouldn't buy this CD. Two thumbs WAY down for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"Don't buy this if you would like to keep your sanity and intelligence.

That is a lot coming from a boys point of view. Anyhow, get the entire CD! Not the singles because this is THE FIRST CD I have liked EVERY SINGLE song on.

Otherwise, she has good dance tunes that you're bound to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain-less, Soul-less and Emotion-less","review":"Britney has wonderful looks and she dances very well. As a singer, however, she leaves much to be desired:1. Unlike some singers who're not blessed with a great voice but who know how to make wonders out of it, Britney is neither gifted with a naturally beautiful voice nor does she know what to do with it.2. Some of her songs have very good beat and are great for dancing - but that's all you can get out of them. The lyrics are \\"blah, blah, blah\\" and there's no substance to ANY of her songs. No emotions, no depth, no meaning. If you want something that is totally drained of anything but has a good beat, Britney is a top choice.In a word, this is a CD that you'd buy and listen to a few times, and then take to the Princeton Record Exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is Britney's best CD so far. Her sound (and image) have obviously changed alot within the years but I believe she was at her best when she first started out. She actually sung the songs and her voice sounds almost real.

Yeah the songs are cheesy, but they were fun. I used to like them, now I groan when I think about how I used to like them. I don't agree with one song, \\"Born to make you happy.\\" Girls are not born to make anyone happy! That's a very sexist song.This cd will appeal pre-teens or tweens because of the cheesy and sugary sweet pop songs. This cd reminds me of a very sweet girl with talent, which was Britney Spears in her early career. Somehow along the way she has changed for worse! for whatever reason and is no longer the sweet girl that you now see on the cover of her 1st cd.Bottom line: Avoid even if you're a pre-teen or tween.

A good quality in a singer should be the way she matures and molds her music into a something worth listening to. I must admit that I have been caught singing britney's songs, but they are really catchy. Sorry brit, try again. Also, what's with the CD titles? You think she could at least think of something better than the name of her first single since she doesn't sing that well, dress nicely, or write her own music.

Obviously Britney Spears has the right look (but just to cover herself, she did get the plastic surgery). The rest- her music, her videos, her image- is completely manufactured by the hordes of agents, staff, and marketing execs who will tirelessly promote her sex appeal to drive sales. Of course, to the millions of adolescents who buy her music these factors don't register on the collective teen radar- this is music for pure teenybopper enjoyment, without a trace of artistic merit. There's nothing wrong with liking this kind of music when you're young, but when you get older and Ms. Spears becomes a trivia question in music history, you'll be embarassed to think that 1)you thought she had talent, and 2)you wasted money on this awful cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENHANCHED CD ?","review":"THEY ENHANCED THIS GARBAGE?

Japanese Beetle: Despite the fact this album sold 14 million copies in the US, her subsequent albums have sold less and I see that her career is over(especially after marriage to freeloader and her abuse of baby son).

It is clear that Britney's publicity has not actually come from her talant but from her sexy (non existent) clothing. It is hard to believe that people could actually call this MUSIC.

It was NOT a pleasant experience. This music is totally about making money. The songs are shallow, the singing sounds like it was altered by a computer or something; the arrangements are irritating. It seems the record companies have this tendency nowadays to find a pretty face and teach it how to sing. This is very sad indeed. Don't give in.

Her voice quality is truely nothing special, her overall range of her voice leaves something to be desired, (Please! I'm a male singer with a higher upper voice range than her!)and all the songs she sings have an unpolished feel. As for originality in her music, there is none. (Just another product of a visual over musical production) Sure, she's been made a public star, but I'm sure other professional singers cut her down simply because of her lack of musicality. I hope that Spears will one day realize that her looks, not her voice was the only merit that she truely had, which in the end is worth nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More painful than being bludgeoned in the head.","review":"This has to be the worst \\"artist\\" in existence.

Real, confident self-respecting women don't parade around their boy friends begging for them to \\"Hit them one more time\\".

The young lady on this album seems to think that she's only 4 years old (ooh baby babeee); her voice is dumb and childish, her lyrics are pathetic (\\"I wanna believe in everything that you're saying cuz it sounds so gooood\\"), and the album seems to carry on the same boring beat over and over. This girl could do more with the (little) talent that she has and she is pretty good dancer (although she is simply cloning Janet Jackson's moves---and Janet at least can SING), but this albums leaves pretty little room for positive criticism (the only semi-decent track \\"crazy\\" has a different remix than the one that plays on the airwaves). Just because she's a female in (relative) control of her career (she claims she will be as business focused as Madonna)this girl gets two stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepto Bismol Pink...","review":"I do think Britney is pretty and has an ok voice. Her voice is a little above avrage for me. I did like Baby One More Time and Crazy but until I saw the video for the millionth time. My friend has the album and she leant it to me and I didn't like it at all. The songs are too squeeky pop. I suggest getting the Christina Aguilera CD even though she has no opinion of her own as she nor Britney wrote any songs of their own. Get some Madonna CDs or Jewel, they have an opinon and write the best songs. Their music is veyr personal and emotional. also Tori Amos, these women should be role models not Britney. I'm an upcoming singer and I'm 16 but I do write my own songs and my music isn't just going to be pop, but techno. electronica and some rock. It'll be very eclectic.

She dresses in her underwear on the cover of Rolling Stone. She always wears clothes that bare her midriff. She says girls need to love their body for what it is yet she has fake boobs, fake hair, and a fake tan and I've only seen clowns that wear as much make-up as her. Her talentless songs and dance moves prove anyone can join the business for looks. She looks more like a hooker then a 17 year old girl who's still in high school.

If you want this CD for pictures, get it. If you want it for quality of music, TRASH this. The background music is so loud that it covers up her voice; and if it's soft, her voice is so irritating when she plays with it too much.

But the songs on here just don't do her justice. I hope that it is her record company that is making her sing these sexist against women songs and making these slutty pictures for magazines. And i'm a guy too! For instance, \\"Born To Make You Happy.\\" What the hell is up with that?! And most of the songs are about her guy trouble. If she's that hot, she should be able to get a guy!

I wish she'd just wake up and realize someday that she's 17. i'm sssssooooo sick of her little sexist what would you call them? \\"displays\\"? (I'm not jealous- i thank God i'm not in her shoes!!!!!) And what about her PARENTS????????? i've never heard anything about them and i'm not gonna judge but what kind of parents let their daughter show off like that? Anyways, the main point is her music so i'll get to it: congratulations, britney, you've just won the prize for #1 piece of dirt!!!!!!!!! i might give her a chance if she came up with some great music and changed her sTyLe if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Pop Music","review":"What horrendous talentless music this is. It is an embarassment to the music industry that such a talentless act such as Britney Spears can be so popular. She is the essence of what is wrong with the music industry where a catchy song or good looks get you further than actual musical talent and proficiency. If I could rate this album a zero, I would. Do not waste your money on tasteless, pathetic music such as this. Britney Spears has more hope becoming a porn star than a singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can she carry her voice?","review":"This is not the first time that someone has come out with a cd like this one. We have heard it before. I didn't mind the catchy songs; they were catchy. However, everytime she went to carry her voice, it seemed that the backup vocals were magically turned up. I have heard her sing, and for a 17 year old, she's not that bad. However, on \\"Baby one more time\\", I believe we heard more of her unnoted back-up singers than anything. Maybe next time, she will have enough confidence to sing by herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"So it didn't actually happen. SO WHAT?","review":"All right. I admit that Britney is not a born singer. I admit that her song is written purely to make money. I admit that her bug-eyed look can be annoying. SO WHAT? I like the song, it's catchy and I like hearing it. OK? All you people who keep saying you shouldn't like songs because they are too manufactured, read my lips. I LIKE HEARING THE SONG. When I buy music, it is because I want a copy to play at home, not to make some point about who deserves to be successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd is not worth 12 million copies!","review":"Okay, So Britney Spears has these pretty great singles--Baby One More Time, Sometimes, Crazy, and an okay single--from the bottom of my broken heart. Other than that, there is Born To Make U Happy, and nothing else. Soda Pop is the worst song maybe ever, and The Beat goes on has been ruined. Sorry Brit, you might wanna rethink the quality of your songs. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Is a Britney Fan must have","review":"Okay, this may at first seem to you as - oh no its a first album , I never buy those as the artist hasn't been in the buisness long enough. Well no, please don't think that at all. In this Britney Album there is a collection of some of Britney's famous songs and some songs that make you think, Why didn't she release that one. Some people may be disapointed by the fact that \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" isn't the stop remix as used in the film, but hey, the version is not that bad. I know that these are now judged as older songs but what stops you from listening to them. You'll just love Britney's strong voice in \\"I will be there\\" and the multimeda (the FULL length version of Baby One More Time Video).Personally I want to shout it out to the world, Buy this album, Britney IS just the best artist you could ever come across and you won't regret pushing the order button the the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I though it should be! Great summer music.","review":"What's up with everyone complaining about Britney's \\"babyish\\" voice? That's exactly what I love about this CD.Britney's childlike voice is very appealing and her youthful nature is a large factor in her success. It's part of what makes pop music pop.If you like fun, youthful, upbeat pop music, this CD is everything it proclaims to be ... so be sure to buy it! Britney Spears is without a doubt, a princess of pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Fan Of Britney","review":"I had some CDs given to me from a friend a few years ago and I decided to listen to this to see what all the hype was about.Of course, I knew of Britney's smash hits 'Baby One More Time' and 'Oops!

I didn't enjoy listening to it.Not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Pop Album","review":"This album has very catchy songs such as Baby One More Time and (You Drive Me) Crazy. Born to Make You Happy is an awesome ballad. E-Mail My Heart has very nice vocals (In my opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This CD is boring and Britneys voice doesn't help. I can see why little kids like this music, because it's easy to sing along to the lyrics. But there is no originality or creativity here. She's just reading words off a piece of paper written by an old man. If u want to listen to a good pop singer who's actually original and who's songs dont all sound the same try Bjork (she has a nice voice too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sugary it makes my teeth rot","review":"I borrowed this album from a friend to listen to and I had to go purge my ears afterwards. There is nothing fantastic at all about this album. All the songs are unoriginal bubble gum pop songs written by people who must have been stoned when they wrote it! Britney Spears is a huge hypocrite and a terrible role model for young girls. Her videos send the same message: you must be skinny and blonde with a nasally voice to be beautiful? Is this the kind of music I would want my daughter to listen to? No way!If I could I would give this rating 0 stars because this album isn't even worth one star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD [Stinks] Pinecones!!","review":"I really hate BS. She's full of BS. Her voice is so fake. Her songs are stupid, and she doesn't write them. She doesn't have much talent. The only reason she's popular is she's pretty. If she was a little uglier she would be nowhere. Bottom Line this and all her CD's [Stunk]. If I could I would give her 0 stars, but it won't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Britney","review":"I just listened to the whole entire CD and I am very disappointed. I tried not to listen to bad reviews because I wanted to judge for myself. But they were right. This CD is not all it's hyped up to be. And to be nominated for album of the year, what are these people thinking! Britney's voice is nasally and childish. The best songs are Sometimes and From The Bottom of My Broken Heart in my opinion. And whoever thought of E-mail My Heart and Sodapop need to be shot! Britney has no vocal range and her songs have no meaning. Maybe her next album will be better because Jive made a mistake with this one. I have nothing against her but she lost me on the implant thing. I think her voice is studio-made and her dancing is over-rehearsed. Please do not waste your money on this CD. Buy Christina Aguliera's CD. Her voice is naturally beautiful and her songs have meaning and truth. Maybe next time Britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Hell...","review":"Seriously, having a doctor forget to put you to sleep before having surgery is less painful then listening to this(...).

I especially liked \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" but the rest of the songs sounded redundant. I hated \\"Soda Pop\\"! I like Britney and all, but she is getting on my nerves! Everywhere I turn, it's \\"Britney this, Britney that.\\" And I hate to say it but she acts fake. She trys way too hard to act like the perfect, bubbly, \\"all-american teen\\" and itkind of makes me sick. She's turning into a studio-made Barbie doll like all the critics say. I like Christina Aguilera'scd much better. You guys should check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As her first CD","review":"It is great. Not my favorite of her CD'S, but I recommend it. My favorite song on it is, Baby One More Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Returns","review":"Of course she's evil! Why else would I listen to her? Seriously though, love her or hate her, she's not a multi-platinum artist for nothing. This first CD by the now infamous Princess of Pop reintroduces a genre that seemingly had been dead since Debbie Gibson and Cyndi Lauper hung their mics up. The first song on the CD begins with background acoustics and hard piano punches and ends in an almost rock-and-roll spirit. The rest of the songs go along the same line, with Britney seemingly begging for attention, even the abusive type. All in all though, I'd say she kicked her initial album off nicely. The others are a different story."},{"rating":"2","title":"the one that started it all!","review":"The summer of 1999 pop music changed because of britney!1.BABY ONE MORE TIME grade:A+2.YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY:a+3.SOMETIMES:A4.SODA POP:B5.BORN TO MAKE YOU HAPPY:B6.FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BROKEN HEART:C7.I WILL BE THERE:A+8.I WILL STILL LOVE YOU:D-9.THINKIN' ABOUT YOU:B-10.E-MAIL MY HEART:F-11.THE BEAT GOES ON:C-This is a enhanced c.d. where you get to :watch the bomt videoview great pictures and watch a interview w/britney wile she made her bomt video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney was born to make music","review":"Britney Spears is obviously one of the best female pop singers of our time. She's nothing like Mariah or Whitney, but she has a talent of her own. \\"Baby One More Time\\" is a very fun, catchy bubblegum album. My favorite songs are Born to Make You happy, Soda Pop, Sometimes, The Beat Goes On, (You Drive Me) Crazy and of course Baby One More time. This album is worth the money. You should see this album in stores like Walmart, Sam Goody, Barnes & Noble, and any other Music, CD, etc. store. I also recomend her 2nd album (Oops!... I Did It Again), her third album (Britney) and her fourth album In The Zone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is a sexy broad, and a good artist, but no more.","review":"Yeah, this is a good album. It has all sorts of good songs, though some are hard to understand. Some show Britney feeling excited for her man, such as You Drive Me(Crazy) and Soda Pop. Others show her feeling sad either because she has lost a love or a love has dumped her, such as Baby One More Time(S**t! That's the title of this album!)and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart. The rest just show her trying to snag herself a man in any way possible that she might be lucky enough to find and try. However, this is a decent album with catchy lyrics and pretty good tunes as far as an artist who's all sexiness and no singing goes. This is a lot better than some other stuff you might find in the music store, so don't waste your time if you like Britney or at least think she is a babe and a broad. Buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreed- pure crap","review":"OK, I like Britneys 2nd and 3rd albums. But for anyone thinking about buying this very first album- think again. DON'T get it. Why?

Britney Spears maiden voyage into the Music World might have gained her popularity on the charts, but her vocal talent is nothing compared to the rest of the guys on the charts. To give due where she deserves it, she has a beautiful childish voice.. and that is exactly why she should not venture into unchartered territories of soul songs. She comes out like a 6 year old kid proposing to his/her school-teacher. The songs I mentioned are strong as party treats but besides these songs Britney has a long way to go.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, whatever you do, DO NOT buy this C.D.","review":"I can maybe describe this album in one word... LAME! I bought this C.D. after I heard ...Baby One More Time.I didn't like any other song on it. The ballads have no passion or feeling, and Miss Spears really should have left vintage oldies to the person who first sang them.

Britney, about to become 18 rules the world. She is the best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Is it just me or does it seem like Britney was only a key to fame for the young female pop artists of today? Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and new-comer Willa Ford (pokemon soundtrack under the name Mandah) are all of the same age, give or take a year, but really, who has a more developed, mature sound? Whilst Spears' vocal talent is still stuck somewhere in her pre-teen years(my mother thought she was only about 13 or so), Aguilera, Simpson and Ford project a much more older sound, and not just vocally. 'Email my heart' (I really laughed listening to this) is just one of the examples of the many mistakes Spears has made. I must admit though, I didn't mind some of the slower songs, such as 'Born to make you happy'. The only problem was the voice. Which I guess means that it's not really Britney's talent, but the lyricist/composer, and the credits go to them. Heck, you can even compare Britney Spears to the young'un Mandy Moore and you'll find Moore has a more older sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"To put it bluntly...","review":"This cd is the epitome of what's wrong with music these days. Britney Spears needs to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up Beats Good, Slow Beat Bad","review":"Now, of course this is all just personal opinion, but I don't think the slow songs have anything against the upbeat tracks in this album. Those old men behind the pad and paper had the right ideas with \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\", and \\"Crazy\\". But thier lack of knowledge of what the kids are into now-a-days shows, in songs like \\"E-Mail My Heart\\". When first reading that track, I thought it was a joke!Some melodies suceed in moving me on the slow songs, but usally they are just sluggesh, and unpollished. The melodys are weak, and have me covering my ears more then opening them.The songwriting and Britneys singing are much better on her later albums, but all and all this is a decent begining for some old timers, and an old time Mouse-kateer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a First Try","review":"I hadn't bought Britney's first album until after I already had the other two. I really liked the singles that came from this cd, but I never got around to purchasing it. It is a very good album for Britney's first try. I definitely think her third album is the best, but this one comes in a close second. She had so many singles from this cd and there's a reason why...they are good pop songs. Worth buying if you are a Britney fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Baby One More Time","review":"I really enjoyed this CD, first it was enhanced, and it has her \\"...Baby One More Time\\" video. This Cd have 6 cacthy songs: ...Baby One More Time (You Drive me) Crazy Sometimes Born To Make you Happy From the Bottom of my Broken Heart I Will be There --- Many people think that an female artist must have a voice like Mariah or Whitney to be talented or \\"mature\\". I dont agree with that, Britney has an unique, sexy and beautiful voice, and her songs are not immature as some say, do you think that only teens get their heart broken, only teens that want their old boyfriends/girlfrieds back, and so on... I think Britney new album will show the World how talented she is, and that her voice is even more better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album BUT...","review":"...Baby one more time was a great song I loved it!

I recommend this cd for ages 10-15 if you're older than 15 chances are you won't like it because this cd is kind of ages 10-15.

Her voice is so squeaky and weak, that it's almost impossible for her to sing without an UUUGGH at the end of a word. Her songs do not mean anything much and everything she sings about is so unrealistic. i.e.Email my Heart ??? You want talent, go and purchase a Jessica Simpson CD and you'll be amazed at how great she can sing as opposed to Britney. Jessica' voice is very well developed and she has no trouble with hitting those high notes. You'll regret it if you buy Britney's CD. It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"has more hits per cd than usual","review":"lots of people complain if every song is not a hit but when I look back at my very extensive collection some of the best artists e.g. mariah carey etc had sometimes only one to at most three best songs on the cd. Britney has at least 3 hits on this cd: baby one more time, from the bottom of my broken heart, and I was born to make you happy. Unlike some artists she is not an imitation of another hit artists: so she gets an A for originality. Her voice is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"More garbage.......","review":"I just don't understand how anybody could possibly like Britney Spears. First of all I have trouble saying she's a singer since she doesn't really sing, she whispers at best... when it doesn't sound like she's whispering, her voice sounds obviously computer enhanced, she doesn't write the music, she doesn't write the lyrics, and she lip-synchs on live shows (can anybody dance around for 2 hours and not pant while singing?) so what does she do??? And why are you giving her your money???

Britney should quit singing and become a dancer or a choreographer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of an era","review":"Hey, I didn't say it was a good era.The CD \\". . . Baby One More Time\\" garners two stars simply for being the best of Britney's short 'n' crappy catalogue. It's the best because it's pretty much the only one that doesn't make you feel like a dirty old man while you're listening. Back when this CD was released, Britney was still a somewhat innocent teenager, and her music was kind of fun to listen to (albeit not for a long time, and certainly it wasn't taken seriously). Now, it's all electronics and oversexed lyrics, and the melodies aren't even as fun as the ones on the first album.In short, if your ten-year-old daughter wants to buy this CD, it's suitable even if the later ones aren't. However, if you're a person over, say, thirteen and you take music seriously? Save your money.

I heard Britney live on Rosie O'donnel, and I discovered that the rumors about using a computer to alter her voice must be true. Although, I guess I should be reviewing the album: I love the way her voice sounds on the record, and I love to get up and dance to her songs, but I just don't think she deserves the money, since she can't perform live. There it is, straight from the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question?","review":"Do people really call her the \\"Queen of Pop\\"? With only one album to her name? Good lord! America is in trouble. You can't just throw out prestigious titles to amateur performers with little staying power. Michael Jackson proved the title \\"King of Pop\\". Britney has a long way to go and I don't think she can make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY","review":"BRITNEY SPEARS NEED TO GROW MORE VOCALLY BEFORE PEOPLE NAME HER QUEEN OF POP!

SORRY BRITNEY BUT YOUR NOT ALL THAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but not GOOD enough for 5","review":"I really enjoy songs like Baby One More Time, Drive Me Crazy(Although I was disappointed that the STOP Remix wasn't on here),Sometimes, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart, Soda Pop, and Born to Make You Happy. These are all great! But some songs are really dumb, esp. E-mail my Heart. What's the deal with that stupid song. I would suggest this CD to everyone who likes to dance or just listen to pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than what i expected!","review":"I've always hesitated to buy this CD because of all those bad stuff about Britney Spears. Just lately, I decided to buy it and guess what? It's a really good album! Her songs are upbeat -- my favorites are \\"Baby One More time\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"sometimes\\", \\"from the bottom of my broken heart:, and \\"email my heart\\" This is a great Cd for any pop music fan! You don't have to like Britney Spears! If you like her music, then go ahead and get it, it's all about music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually...","review":"... the only thing I want to hit \\"one more time\\" is this CD. What a piece of junk.Kids, here's a word of advice: don't bother buying this, just download the MP3 of \\"Baby One More Time.\\" Not the whole CD, just the single, which is bad enough but MUCH better than any other track on this thing.Because, mark my words now, in two years you'll want to throw it away anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"little disappointed","review":"The album is ok, I just don't like Spears's voice and her singing style, probably because the songs were rather easy to sing, which doesn't really show her talent. There is room for improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby One More Time","review":"The 11X platinum album, ...Baby One More Time, is Britney's first album to date. Her first single, title track, was an instant #1 single. The second, Sometimes was a great summer song which showed that she was no one hit wonder. Her third single, You Drive Me Crazy raced up the charts, and is one of the best dance songs ever. The last single off the album, From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart is a perfect ballad, and will soon to be another #1 hit. Also, Born To Make You Happy, very catchy song and was huge in other countries. Overall, do buy the album! It's a wonderful collection of hits, hopefully her next album will show more maturity and vocal strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent...","review":"I read with revolt about reviewers here who will just scream their 5 stars out for this album. This album is nothing more than a collection of large group of background singers supporting a wimpy young singer. Most of the time I can't even hear her singing. Ironically, her weak voice is lost in the background amongst the multitudes. Yes! It is a daunting task to differentiate who is actually the artist(s) on this album. All Britney does is squeak and whimper, squeak and whimper...Her songs are tasteless, meaningless and are just schemes to get you people out, waste your hardearned 14 bucks away on a piece of waste material which is destined for eternal damnation and cold storage when the shelf lives of her \\"hits\\" are up. I urge you, therefore, to ask yourself the need to have this truly regrettable castastrophic album before parting with your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Ok, I am not gonna even mention her position as a socalled role model, b/c thats not the point. But as an artist, she is truly sad. I think she has had so much success because of the catchy music since her voice is a joke. Catchy music and sex appeal got her to where she is. Not to mention her sexist songs, such as \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" (the name says it all) which basically says that a girl is nothing and pathetic w.out a man. And thats how basically all her songs are. PLZ PLZ PLZ dont waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"the cd has great songs and i can always listen to it","review":"i love the song crazy because it make makes me in a good mode and just drives me crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a whole alota bubble gum","review":"this album is just ewwwww the worst i can't believe anyone would like it. true there are the standouts like \\"baby\\" and \\"sometimes\\" but,the rest of the album is a little too much teenybopper pop and to tell you the truth \\"soda pop\\" and \\"e-mail my heart\\" are truly classics i mean to listen to. this album is pointless if possiable just get the singles. don't waste your time on a bubble gum pop album like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's going to fade away after awhile","review":"This CD did not meet much of my expectations. Here are a few reasons: My number one reason is that she sounds like a machine. I mean, I can't even name one part of her CD where she sounds human. My second reason is that her songs sound like a poem it would take a first grader two seconds to write. I know it probably wasn't Britney who wrote the songs, but at least she can take a hint and hire better songwriters. Also, I would like to see a Britney song that's more than three minutes long. Finally, it got so annoying after awhile, that I decided to give my CD away to my relatives. What I'm trying to say is that DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Listen to better singers, and trust me, there are a lot of them out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this have gone 7 times platinum???","review":"Alright, Britney is hot as hell, but the music sucks so bad! How about listening to some artists who can actually play, sing, and write their own songs!!! Have a little talent!!!!!! Like:Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit, korn, Dream theater, Kid Rock, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Clapton, Rush, even CHRISTINA AGUILERA has talent, because her voice at least is actually pleasant. And, she's even hotter than Britney... Please stop listening to garbage..."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a pretty good c.d.","review":"Britney Spears is a really good singer. My favorite songs are \\"Baby One More Time\\"(after you stop hearing it on the radio a million times a day, it's a cool song), \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" \\"Sometimes\\", and \\"Thinkin' About You\\". Those are just my favorite songs. The others are good too,with the exception of \\"Soda Pop\\" (I don't like the lyrics), \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" (Way too dependent.I don't know how to live without your love/I was born to make you happy. Women DON'T need men to make them happy.) and \\"E-Mail My Heart\\" ( The title says it all.) Other than that it's a pretty good c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this CD.

You really need to get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few catchy songs, but an overall failure.","review":"Britney Spears is no big deal. All the hype about her is just rubish. A few songs have a nice melody to it, but I would like to see her write some of her own songs. The songs do not have any significant meaning to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This c.d is okay I guess","review":"The first song on the album was okay.....at first. Then it got much old. All she does is talk about love in practically every song. One song could have said what the whole album says altogether. The only song that I probably wouldnt turn the station when she came on would be the song about I was born to make you happy,or whatever it was called."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Spears is fake!","review":"I am not a Britney Spears fan. But I will give her 2 stars because I can admit she can dance, and sing. The only problem is she doesnt sing aobut her real life. All she sings about is love, love, and more love. That's it! She is only 17 and all she talks about is love. She is still a girl! The other thing about her and all \\"plain singers\\" is that the don't play insturments. All they do is sing. All Britney had to do to go big, is take some singing and dance lessons, then get a LOAD of make up on her face. Then when she did get famous, she had to get breat implants. She is totally fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY COOL!","review":"I only got this CD for the song \\"Baby One More Time\\", but I found out that ALL of the songs on this CD are GREAT!

YOU GO BRITNEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Flaws But Overall Great","review":"I bought this CD back in late January and it was great! The first 8 songs (except \\"Soda Pop\\") are the best songs on the album, along with \\"The Beat Goes On\\". The only songs that were not worth listening to was \\"Soda Pop\\" and \\"E-Mail My Heart\\" while \\"Thinkin' About You\\" was okay. My 5 big favorites were \\"Sometimes,\\" \\"Born To Make You Happy,\\" (You Drive Me) Crazy,\\" \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,\\" and \\"I Will Still Love You.\\" If you like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Sometimes,\\" then pick this CD up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is New and Original!","review":"I love her songs \\"I Was Born to Make You Happy\\",and \\"I Will Be There\\", but all of her songs are great.

The next Tiffany!!","review":"Once again we see the next Tiffany. Britney Spears is conquering teen girls all across America. She is the perfect example of selling out which usually doesn't happen until your 3rd or 4th record. Jive usually signs good acts but please!! Stop the trend with the hiring kids from The Mickey Mouse club and sign someone with a fresher attitude. She has a good beatiful voice but she is losing her identity in the process of singing songs that have no meaning. And isn't she a little young and new to be covering a classic song, \\"The Beat Goes On\\"? She is trying to hard to live up to everyones expectations and losing herself in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mousketeer Jumps to Teen Idol","review":"Britney Spears transforms from a little girl into a bright and shiney 17 year old. Her one hit wonder, Baby One More Time, is popular amongst the young and even the old. However, the rest of her CD leaves much to be desired, as does her singing. Unfortunately, Britney, I don't see you in the music future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy crap","review":"I can't believe I ever bought this cd. I was so incredibly 14 at the time.

One of the best ways to waste twelve, thirteen, or even fourteen dollars is to go out and buy this CD. Sorry, but personally, I can't stand this little \\"singer\\" who has so recently seemed to dazzle everybody with her...ahem... amazing voice. Her lyrics are incredibly shallow and it hurts my ears to hear them. What's even sadder is that some people look up to her as an idol. If you wanna be a wannabee, at least choose somebady worthwhile- not a girl who can't sing and can't dance with only a pretty face on her side. She has absolutely no talent. I'd give it a zero, but I can't..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so dissapointed","review":"When I first heard \\"...Baby one more time\\" I really loved the song and I just had to buy the CD but once I listened to the whole thing I only liked the first two songs and now I'm pretty sick of \\"...Baby one more time since it's so played out and I thought \\"Sometimes\\" was OK but now I can't stand it because that one is so played out too. Then when I heard her sing live Oh my God she can not sing at all she sounds half way decent on the CD because of all the stuff they do in the studios but come on now her CD is not worth buying and her videos are not worth watching the way she dresses is a little to reveiling ecspecially after all of the money she spent to look like that (you all know what I mean) I highly don't recommend this CD and I would gladly give mine to anyone who wanted to waste thier time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD BE BETTER","review":"Britney Spears is all right and everything, but I think what made this CD so poor is that it got to much hype.

But, if you like Brittany, get the cd and get horribly bored of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fan from Kelowna, BC, Canada","review":"First of all, I would like to say that Britney is a talented singer and absolutely gorgeous, but... all her songs are about losing a guy or broken relationships which kinda makes her seem like a slut or that she has a bad personallity or she can be so annoying that guys have no choice but to dump her. I would also like to say that apperently, the influences of the mickey mouse club have not worn off of her because her songs are okay if you're in elementry school. Maybe if she changed her style of singing to something a bit more... 17ish, then I would listen to her. If I had the choice after listening to her CD, I wouldn't buy it. I hope she does change her style because I would really like to see her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"One word sums up this trashy CD and Britney Spears: disgusting. The only reason Britney is popular is because she's selling herself, like a product. I am referring to the cover of Rolling Stone. Come on. She is 16 years old! No one should be dressing like that, least of all a teenager. Now. Let's get on to her music. Her voice is horrendous. Either she doesn't have the natural talent required or she hasn't been trained properly. Either way, combined with dumb lyrics it makes for one horrid cd. Don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spear is an amazing artist with so much talent.","review":"Because she is only 17 herself she knows and understands what kind of music teenagers today like. That's what makes her CD a hit. From the #1 hit single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to her most recent \\"Sometimes\\" every song on this CD is filled with talent, meaning, a good voice, and a good beat.

Then I saw her on the Rosie O'Donnell show (implants and all), and heard how weak and shrill her voice was. It was hilarious when her voice got off with the tape! It sounded terrible.

The tragic thing about Elliot juxtaposed to Spears is that Elliot is ten years Spear's senior. All that's given here to the listener is a bunch of prosiac tunes and a drum machine. Oh yeah, and for all of you who think that Spears emphaszies sleazy style over substance, your right. In case any \\"loaded\\" readers have joined us, I'm reffering to last month's Rolling Stone cover. I'm presuming that when Spears wrote the lyrical bank to this piece of unremarkable commercial dreck; she had some help from The Missing Link, because nobody who's just inches away from adulthood could be this dumb. Britany Spears, if your reading this; just pose for playboy and become a fading memory, please, for all of us who care about music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain & simple...I hate it!","review":"As a musician, I realize there will always be a desire to find the quick buck in the music world.

It will only be a metter of time before britney is dropped off at the curb and some other no talent is picked up, but until then, we will all hear her and n'stink, and the backstreet girls.

Her voice is too \\"airy\\" and it seems like there is no real feeling behind it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd with cewl multimedia stuff","review":"This cd is pretty good overall. It has the two hits \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Sometimes\\". The new hit \\"Crazy\\" differences from the single release. It's still good but not so good as the single release wich is the \\"Stop Remix\\" of the song. Besides these tracks there is one other superb track called \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" wich I think will be the next single. Other tracks are overall good exept track 4 : Soda Pop. This one is very weird and not good. Also track 12: \\"The beat goes on\\", wich is from the Sonny & Cher song is not good either. But hey, these are the only 2 bad songs on the entire cd.

I've heard better teen albums from Debbie Gibson than I've heard from Britney. What makes anybody think that this tired child can sing? True, she has maybe five songs that I like which are worth mentioning. \\"Baby, One More Time\\", \\"Sometimes,\\" \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\", \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"Crazy\\". The only reason somebody said that this is the best pop teen album is because they have no taste in music.Where did she think that she learned how to sing? The album is garbage without those five tracks that I mentioned. I swear that America needs a brain transplant. I may have all four of Britney's albums, but that's purely because I like what I hear. I don't love what I hear-merely like. She needs to hang up singing and leave it up to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble gum music","review":"When \\"Baby one more time\\" exploded, Britney was 17 years old and in a few months she became one of the most popular and successful Pop stars in the world, that's something which doesn't happen to a lot of young girls. Britney's success had nothing to do with talent, it was all about her image, her radio friendly singles, her bubble gum videos and her expensive performances. And of course, this album has nothing to do with talent, besides the catchy 5 singles, the rest of the songs are all fillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeers For Spears","review":"I say this album stinks. Britney should stick to modeling and dancing. She has no musical talent, and even worse is her acting ability (as shown in \\"Crossroads\\"). She's destroyed the pop genre as we know it and is now simply a role model for thousands of little girls who try to emulate her by wearing tight pants and belly shirts. How nice.Almost every track on her debut \\"...Baby One More Time\\" has become a hit on MTV and pop radio. \\"Sometimes,\\" \\"You Drive Me Crazy,\\" and the title track have all hit #1. The record has sold over 10 million copies and started a new generation of mindless teenyboppers, therefore putting Britney in superstar status.On we march to the apocalypse."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is supposed to be music?","review":"What is it with the music industry these days? Whatever happened to the days when singers were successful because of the voice? Nowadays, it's all about the looks. Britney Spears is one more example. Sure she's pretty, I'm not denying that, but the voice just isn't there. And no amount of make-up can compensate for that. I'll admit that some of these songs sound okay, but that's because they were written to fit her. Give her any other song, and she probably would sound horrible. I have NEVER seen her actually sing in a live performance, because I doubt she could. Studios are a wonderful thing, they can do so much to make a voice sound good. But the bottom line is, you must have the voice already to last in the business, and Britney just doesn't have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ah, wot peaceful lovely CRAP","review":"ok, britney, everything u do is WRONG in the zone & britney 2 (...), oops & baby 1 more time 2 peaceful & cutsie cutsie. yeah, baby 1 more time is a gr8 pop record, but SERIOUSLY? making the no. 1 in the us is just OVER DA TOP. buy lauryn hill or alicia keys instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhhhhh","review":"What is this world coming to?

Well hate her for the correct reasons.For instance, she is unoriginal. Has anyone noticed how simliar \\"Baby One more Time\\" is to \\"Show Me Love\\" by the Swedish pop singer Robyn? The similarities are too numerous to be a coincidence. The only reason Britney got away with it is because Robyn's music was unfamiliar to a lot of Americans.Another reason to dislike Britney: a teen sensation who started out claiming to be pure and a good role model for young girls is now a trampy little brat. Parents: do you really want your pre-teen daughters emulating scantily clad Britney, who sings crass songs like \\"I'm a Slave For U\\" ?There is nothing pure or original here. My advice, skip the album, and find a better role model for your daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I think this CD was reallly good, it's not boring and it has some songs you can dance to and others that just put you in a good mood and are sort of relaxing to listen to.

I am saddened that this trash is being exposed to youngsters and that kids these days never heard of wonderful innocent singers like Tiffany or Debbie Gibson from the 80's.

Too much sounds the same and it is not anywhere near the terms \\"experimental\\" or \\"artistic\\". This is almost definately Max's most vicious crime.

All of Spear's songs are catchy and the chorus to every song that you hear will be implanted in your head. She may be a one hit wonder, but hey!, she has good songs to remember by! so for my review, i say go for it and listen to the entire album for a least a week. All you need is time to hear her out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby, please stop!","review":"This CD is lacking in every possible way.Her songs are to corny and unoriginal for her to step up to the next level and become a diva. I feel that she is to obsessed with her image to even contribute enough to her music and plus I do not think she has that strong of a voice.One last thing, Email me heart is the cheesiest song title I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!!","review":"This CD was one of faves when it came out. I may like other music now but it is still one of the \\"good\\" cds I keep in my player. How could they rate it 3 and a half stars?? I know the lyrics by heart, every song! I recommend all pop fans who like Britney Spears to this CD. Just as good as her new one!! So, if you can't decide whether to buy it, remember, there is a reason why it sold 1.3 million copies on the first week out. Fun listening everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"more satisfying than her sophmore","review":"Even though it's not ideal to my tastes, it's still brings satisfaction. Miss Spears' sophmore album is ovverated and overproduced, and this one isn't nearly as much. It still is bubble-gum pop, though. The songs are very catchy, and easy to dance to. On her sophmore album, she tried to mature herself and the complitation turned out to be dissatisfying. She will not be singing in 5 years because her looks will only get her so far. Please spend your money on this album only if you like artists who aren't going to be in the music biz in 5 years, but don't count on me to tell you what artists to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of The Mainstream Pop","review":"Baby One More Time is not only multimillion hits. It was the phenomenon to prove that American mainstream pop is not yet distinct but has come back stronger than ever.Many anti-Britney sides may talk about trivial things as her measurements but not focusing music itself I think.Divas are destined to be scorned starting from Diana Ross, Olivia Newton John, Carly Simon, to recently Madonna.The album is overall soul flavored but weren't that the case with the American mainstream pop during 60s or 70s? Soda Pop is not released as single but nice pop song. Born To Make You Happy is my #1 favorite became #1 in UK chart. I'll be There is Debbie Gibson styled pop rock. E-mail My Heart sounds a bit bland but I am glad to find teenage side reminding me of our teenage diva Hikaru Utada. I am glad girls so cute as Britney's pursuing and keeping great mainstream pop alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is cool","review":"This album is pretty cool. Some of the songs aren't all that great...in fact, Soda Pop is pretty bad. Brit is a great singer, but I think this album would have sounded better if she wouldn't have used the nasally tone. I've heard her voice (pre-pop diva) and it was great. She could go into different styles if she tried using her \\"real\\" voice. If you're really into great pop music, listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this? Fonzy?!","review":"This is definatly a bad way to start a music career! I'll say that she has a good voice, but these songs like Soda Pop, or E-Mail my heart. That is just cheesy!!! Who would want to listen to songs like that?! Fonzy? Totally! Although I have 2 admit, some songs are good. Like Baby One More Time, You Drive me Crazy, and Sometimes. Otherwise, it is sooooooo boring! If she didn't have those 3 songs, she wouldn't be where she is today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spears-Baby One More Time Is Alright","review":"Don't be ashamed to admit it. At one time, or another you sang along at the top of your lungs to \\"...Baby One More Time!\\" Admit it!Spears' debut is excellent and fun! She actually shows she can sing on songs, \\"Soda Pop\\" and \\"Thinkin' About You.\\" Includes the hits: \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Sometimes\\" \\"U Drive Me Crazy (album version)\\" and \\"From the Bottum of My Broken Heart.\\" A couple of songs are a bit cheesy \\"E-Mail My Heart\\" and \\"From the Bottum of My Broken Heart\\" but other than that, it's a great find! It's the best you'll find of Britney Spears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to shout about.","review":"This cd was okay, I guess. There's really no depth to it whatsoever, but what are you gonna do, it's typical teenybopper pop. This is a cd you can play at a party and dance to, but if you're looking for really good, deep, meaningful, creative pop music, go look up savage garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRITNEY HAS PROVEN THAT SHES NOT ONLY PRETTY, SHE CAN SING!","review":"THIS CD IS SSOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AWSOME. WHEN I HEARD \\"...BABY ONE MORE TIME\\" I HAD TO HAVE THIS CD. I THOUGHT I WAS ONLY GONNA LLISTEN TO THAT SONG BUT I FOUND MYSELF ALWAYS LISTENING \\"CRAZY\\", \\"SOMETIMES\\" AND \\"BORN TO MAKE U HAPPY\\" THOSE SONG ARE SO INCREDIBLE. ALL THE REST OFF THE SONGS ARE AWSOME. IF YOU PLANNIG ON BUYING A CD, BUY THIS ONE (IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY:) YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this garbage!","review":"Britney Spears does a great disservice to the feministmovement. All her songs are about the same thing: boys and how shejust cannot live without them. Makes me sick! All she has going for her are her looks, which aren't so great either. She makes me nauseated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well at least she knows she's pop","review":"Britney is the epitome of pop, but she doesn't deny it. She is perfectly aware that she is being used and exploited and I don't think she cares at all. On the other hand, there are bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan who deny their pop-ness even though there isn't much difference between them and Britney other than the way they dress. I don't own this CD. Buy it if you like bubble-gum pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"This is absoultly the worst c.d I have ever heard. She has literally no talent and all she says is \\"Baby\\" She's embarassing herself. What is she thinking. All she sings about is boys. it makes it sound that their not good enough for her. Here's some advice, spend your money on another c.d unless you want to drive you and your family nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"this isn't singing","review":"all her songs sound the same and her voice sounds very deflated.it has no feeling to it.she is nothing special.at least debbie gibson wrote her own songs what talent does B.S. have? and matter of fact that's what her material sounds like to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music to get headaches to- - - puh-leaze!","review":"This album sux, and i'm gonna tell u y. SHE CAN'T SING!! have you ever heard her when she's not lip-sinking, w/o electronical help? she sounds awful! this whole album is just of her whining and screaming! i've never heard someone try so hard to sing well, and never be able to. next, this music just is soooooo stupid. e-mail my heart??! all the lyrics are the same! (except the really gay song soda pop)i'm stupid, let me be your boyfriend again. it gets so old. anyone who likes this trash, really needs to find help. if this is what professional writers can come up with, then i don't even want to see what crap she comes up with. save ur $$$$ 4 somrthing good. like 311, or rage against the machine. by the way, christina is so much better than this. peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness her first CD will probably be her last!","review":"Sure, \\"Baby One More Time\\" is catchy, but it takes more than an upbeat tune to become the next Mariah Carey, Whitney Houstan, or Madonna. Spears just doesn't have the talent to bring her tunes to life. A one-hit wonder is what she is and is all she'll ever be. Britney's voice is weak and manufactured. It may as well be a computer singing. The only reason why she's popular other than her catchy tune is because of her looks. Since when do looks confinscate for singing abilty? Her voice is just plain whiny. In a few months, her fans will deny ever being fans. If you want a young, female singer with TALENT, then I suggest both Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break...","review":"How many phony pop stars do they have to have out there? This is yet another example of a phony little pop artist who doesn't write their own songs, and will be \\"over\\" before you know it. The songs all are EXTREMELY annoying. Britney Spears just can not sing. All these phony pop \\"artists\\" are a disgrace to the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"its wicked","review":"i think this is a great cd i love the song \\"Baby One More Time\\" its awesome!!!! britney spears kix"},{"rating":"1","title":"she only gets one star because it's the lowest i can give","review":"One word comes to mind when I think of Britney Spears - GARBAGE. She is obviously a marketing tool to cater to the masses of pubescent, brainless teens out there. But not to be too hard on her, it's not like she STARTED the stupid-wave or will be the last prepackaged bimbo. She'll soon lose her shine, and it will be up to the next cute girl or boy band to continue the line. Unfortunately, I listened to the whole album. From beginning to end it reeks of unoriginality. It's just boring. Also, what in the hell is \\"Hit me baby, one more time\\" supposed to mean? Is she in to bondage or something??? And how devoid of any substance is the utterly RIDICULOUS title of one of her songs \\"E-mail My Heart?\\" It frightens and sickens me that anyone could get caught in the trap of actually believing that this little girl is singing from her heart. She's singing from cue cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As The Other One,..","review":"If this Cd is supposed to be a better one because it has new tracks, IT'S NOT! Absolutely no talent in this young girl!! All she knows how to do is strike a pose!! Not to be considered in high quality music."},{"rating":"1","title":"BABY NO MORE CDS PLEASE.","review":"This is as trendy and commercial as it gets.This bubblegum head pop princess is famous only because shes cute and was marketed right.It just amazes me how many people have actually bought this album because it is plain cheesy.All the songs sound the same and the lyrics are not even written by her.Without the production of the cd you are left with a girl who cant sing.This puppet of the music industry would do anything for money as she is doing those corny commercials for pepsi.She has fooled the world into thinking she has talent.This girl doesnt even appreciate her own fans and disses them in public.Without her fans she wouldnt be able to go shopping like she usually does.DO NOT SUPPORT ANY OF HER ALBUMS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're my loving sweetheart and I'll love you till the end.","review":"Bloody awful. It really is amazing how these talentless pop stars can ryme Sweethart, love and \\"You're my Baby (Blah, blah, blah)\\" together so many times and actually get away with it. It really is amazing...Anyway, I'm giving this album a 1 star rating, because Amason doesn't allow a 0 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoopee","review":"This is terrible. Where is the real music these days? For all of you reading this and bashing Britney Spears...keep in mind that your Beloved Korn and Limp Bizkit aren't much better. It is the studio that makes up for this lack of talent. That and overindulgant bass lines tuned waaayy too low. These songs are all junk. If you really dig this stuff ask for a drum machine for Christmas...then sing about your breakfast cereal and soda pop...then a star you will be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I think that Britney is a very talented singer, I like her catchy songs and her funky music videos, how ever not all the songs on this album were good. why! I could probably come up with beats catchier than \\"email my heart\\" my self. \\"Some times\\", \\"from the bottam of my broken heart\\", \\"Crazy\\",and \\"Babey one more time\\" are very good, however I have no clue why some of the other songs were on there. some of the songs are sort of good. well thats just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britany Spears","review":"Britany is great! I got this CD b4 i knew wut britany spears was all about. After hearing the whole CD i was hooked. Now im like, a huge Britany Spears Fan. Even if you have the CD already, u should get this one cuz this has extra tracks and you can watch her video on the computer. My favorite song is \\"I'll Never Stop Loving You\\"Tracks: (1.) Baby One More Time (2.) (You Drive Me) Crazy (3.) Sometimes (4.) Soda Pop (5.) Born To Make You Happy (6.) From The Bottom Of My Bro (7.) I Will Be There (8.) I Will Still Love You (9.) Deep In My Heart (10.) Thinkin About You (11.) E-Mail My Heart (12.) Beat Goes On (13.) I'll Never Stop Loving You (14.) Autumn Goodbye (15.) Baby One More Time (David Remix) (16.) Baby One More Time (Boy W. Remix)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bonus Track!","review":"The featured bonus track on this CD is \\"Deep In My Heart\\". It is a very melodious tune with a sort of mid-tempo up beat. It's just fun to listen to. It fits well into the CD at track number 9. (12 tracks total) Unfortunately, this CD is not enhanced, meaning if you pop it into your computer, all that gloss of Britney won't appear. But that's not a big deal. At least you still get that poster of Brit sitting in the chair and the cover is awesome- it's a picture of her hands together held in front of her face.(sort of like how you would greet a Japanese person). Very SA$Y CD - a must have for any Britney fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard better voices on Karioke Night","review":"Please, please, please save your money on this one. Brittney Spears is a no talent waste. She gets by completely on her looks alone. I mean come on now, she got breast implants at 17 years old. Why in the world would any one do that at such a young age? I think the sound of my cats meowing is more talent. I rate this album \\"0\\" stars if that is possible. All she does is shake her body around to get the guys hot and make the girls jealous and envious. I for one don't care for her and I think she is an empty headed bimbo and makes us teenagers look bad. Not all of us want to be like her. I don't look up to her, she is a bad role model. She should spend more time with school work and to make her self better so some day when she needs to earn a living doing something productive she has the skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful only as a Frisbee","review":"You know, Britney Spears is a pretty good dancer. But there should be a law against people like her putting out a CD. I don't know what's worse, the insipid lyrics, the annoying digitally enhanced vocals, or the fact that she paved the wave for other untalented female singers with dubious morals. Oh, and Britney is not attractive. If you want a real CD, check out KMFDM. If you want meaningless garbage, buy this CD right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less then one star","review":"This cd was awful. All the songs were somewhat the same. I was very upset by what she did to the Cher song, \\"And the Beat Goes On.\\" I would never recommened this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"This album is very good. There are some very good songs. These are my favorite three songs: #1 Sometimes #2 ... Baby One More Time #3 Soda Pop. If you are a Britney's fan, you need to buy it, because this album is different from her other albums. She sings here better than in her other albums. I really recommend to buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!!!","review":"Britney Spears' first c.d. was her worst out of the first three. I don't own it,(thank God) but I listened to it @ my friends house who actually LIKES it. It's very, very boring. All the songs sound the same, and Britney sounds horrible. Her voice was soooooo fake. It was totally different then what it is right now. The only reason I gave this piece of trash two stars was because I liked the songs baby one more time and crazy. Everything else totally sucked. I do like Britney Spears however, and I own Oops... and Britney, and those two are so much better then this one. Unless you are a huge fan of Britney Spears and devote your whole life to her, don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Stuff","review":"I give it one star for one good song. The rest is really bad - she can achieve higher sales if she just took out the attampt at a music career and just posed because that is what her career is based on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this album was FAB!","review":"I like this album a lot, but I don't have the version w/ the extra tracks. I like all of her songs a lot, and I'm seeing her this summer on tour! If you people think Britney is great, you'll love Billie [Piper], just type in her name in the search and you'll see some of her GREAT stuff, I like Billie better then Britney. You may've heard Billie's 1st US & Can. single, She Wants You? Anyways, Britney and Billie Rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spears is like \\"Madonna\\"--Talented beyond her years!","review":"\\"Britney Spears\\" album shows an ability to go beyond \\"Broadway\\" to a wider audience of listeners with a mix of interesting vocals, lyrics, dance upbeat, and variety of songs. In other words, buying the CD is like seeing Britney Spears at the show \\"Baby, One More Time!\\" coming \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" because I'm \\"Thinkin' About You\\" at least \\"Sometimes\\" especially when I'm drinking a \\"Soda Pop\\". Yes, \\"I Will Be There\\" just \\"E-Mail My Heart\\" and \\"The Beat Goes On\\". \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" Britney Spears. Britney is the next Madonna! A smart CD to buy. Bob from Cincinnati Piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spears is like \\"Madonna\\"--Talented beyond her years!","review":"Britney was on David Letterman recently. A clip from \\"Star Search\\" was shown of Britney when she was a youngster. She won one and lost one. She has a \\"Broadway\\" voice folks and on pitch! However, \\"Britney Spears\\" album shows an ability to go beyond \\"Broadway\\" to a wider audience of listeners with a mix of interesting vocals, lyrics, dancing, and overall presentation befitting of a \\"Madonna\\" -- a God given talent beyond her years that can adapt to the ever changing demands of our main stream listeners and perhaps for many years to come! Britney will continue to get better with time. No Doubt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE WANTS TO GET HIT ONE MORE TIME!","review":"\\"Baby One More Time\\" is probably the only decent song on this cd, and even THAT is bad! She's talking about domestic violence, that can't be a good message to girls. Some of the titles to the songs are just so laughable, like \\"Email My Heart.\\" GAWD! Her voice is fully computerized, she sounds terrible live. At least Mandy Moore TRIES to sing and doesn't lip synch! Britney may be a very pretty girl but she is a total airhead and all she can do is look good and NOT sing. Thank gawd for TALENTED artists such as Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera, who have brains and are REAL BLONDS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Britney!","review":"This CD is really cool. There are lots of upbeat songs as well as soft ballads. Everyone by now has heard Baby One More Time which is really different than anything else out there.

She has a good, clean cut image and wonderful music that makes you want to dance. Her soulfull voice gives you a good feeling and at the end of the day, you are singing, \\"Oh! Baby.

This lady can not sing. She sounds like me when I have a sore throat. What has become of this world.

She is a really hot young girl with a good voice and talent. But the problem that I have with this c.d. is that the people who wrote the songs for her wrote songs about her having guy troubles. I mean she is really hot and I don't see how she could have guy trouble at all (hell, if she's having guy trouble, I wouldn't taking care of that problem!) And I also think some of the songs are sexist against women, such as \\"Born To Make You Happy\\". These songs are empty love songs that no one should be singing! I'm sorry Britney, but you should be more careful in what you sing. Britney has alot more talent than this! I hope her next album (if there is one) isn't like this! But if you don't give a crap about sexism, empty love songs, and false whining about guy trouble, then this c.d. is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks, not music","review":"You know the music is bad when more than a handful of the reviews talk about how good she looks. It's great to have a role model, but to say that Britney is talented because she's pretty is, well, silly.She is a performer built on MTV's exploitations. Five years down the road, Britney will have joined New Kids on the Block. Thank god my favorite bands haven't sold out like this. After all, those bands have been around for 15 years, with those same fans, plus many newer ones, following them. Will we be able to say the same thing about Britney in 15 years?Well, if I come across the videos on TV, I watch them. On 'mute,' of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"This CD was rather disappointing. I thought that, myself beinga teen, I would be able to relate; I was very wrong. Besides the lackof emotion, her voice, though she can carry a tune, isn't half as good as some of my personal friends. The only thing she has going for her is the marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!! Defanently not a diva!","review":"I got this cd from my cousin as a birthday gift & I hateit. With trashy, funky, mussy songs. The ONLY reason shes famous is because she pretty(well, she is) & 10-14 year olds need someone to look up to. Girls I suggest some REAL talent like Lauryn Hill. She can do it all. Oh, & I read somewhere Britney's the next diva. She can't even hold a tune, hows she gona exceed in diva status. Yeah, right! If she is even a pre diva, Im Marvin Gaye."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOSH . . . . . .","review":"I cannot believe how . . . BAD!! this CD is!

She has a pop style while also having a soulful voice. I think it deserves about a hundred stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont think...","review":"she should have even gotten a record deal. Her image is too sluty for kids. Kids are the ones who like this singer. Perhaps because she's young,has a thin little voice,thin little body(which come on?A sex symbol at 17?!)and sings pop music(which obviously is not hard to sing!)In reality, she's; God knows what age, has implants, poses in skimpy clothes, cannot sing, never mentions family, hardly sings live, and to top it all of, A Very Conceited Person. I predict she will not last long in our music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was Jive thinking...","review":"What was Jive thinking when they signed Britney Spears? Her voice is average and the arrangements on the CD are blah. The songs are catchy and dance-able but fails to keep you hooked or impress you. I suggest Christina Aguilera, who has a much more soulful and mature voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney CAN'T SING even if she tried!","review":"This album is so so but I definitely think Britney cannot sing at all even if she tried her darn hardest to. Her voice is lacking and when she tried to do high notes it hurts my ears. When she tries to be a Mariah wannabe with those low pitch notes Britney sounds like a guy with a sore throat. I do admit she is a talented dancer and she is very attractive, but I don't believe she will last very long, maybe one of those popular fads that will come and go. DO NOT buy this album because it's a waste of cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...don't play this cd one more time","review":"Britny Spears needs help. She really bugs me because she has a good voice, and she doesn't let it soar. Instead she puts it to use in a bunch of\\"don't make me puke\\" ballads. The only good song on this pathic excuse of a cd is \\"Thinking of you\\". True, the tunes are cathcy, and you can't help but sing these overplayed songs around the house, but really, it's just not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepto Bismol Pink...","review":"I do think Britney is pretty and has an ok voice. Her voice is a little above avrage for me. I did like Baby One More Time and Crazy but until I saw the video for the millionth time. My friend has the album and she leant it to me and I didn't like it at all. The songs are too squeeky pop. I suggest getting the Christina Aguilera CD even though she has no opinion of her own as she nor Britney wrote any songs of their own.

I understand because this album is perfect commercial album and if it sells no matter what, B.S. wins. And she(and thousands of production staff) won totally. They did what they tried to do. But I just don't care about her, I love GOOD music not best-selling music.

Her voice seems untrained and awkward, and the songs she sings only help to accentuate that."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but she could be a lot better","review":"At first, I loved Britney, I bought her cd the first day it came out. Later on though, I didn't like the way she dressed or anything. If she doesn't know, lots of kids look up to her, but the way she dresses is too digusting. She should let herself grow up slower.

Out of everything that has happened with Britney you go: She's a singer? Yes she is and not a good one at that. Britney's CD is filled with Sweet bubblegum pop that makes you beg for some more. Her ballads are unbearable with an exception of ''The Beat Goes On.'' It's her title track (.....Baby One More Time) that stops us in our tracks. I propose for the Britster's new album to ditch her yucky ballads (Born to Make You Happy) and stick to what she knows best: acting sexy and brainless."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"......Baby One More Time\\" is the best CD I own!!!","review":"Sup, everybody? Me? Nothing much!!! I think Britney Spears album \\"....baby one more time\\" kicks &*%!!!!!!!! I think all of the songs are really kewl and she looks SO DAMN GOOD!!!!! Her \\"sometimes\\" music video is SOOOOOO cool and she looks every bit as good, as a matter of fact, she looks even BETTER in \\"sometimes\\" than in \\"B.O.M.T\\" But I still think she looks good in \\"B.O.M.T\\".

That song and that song alone is what was responsible for its success. Yet that is the only thing good coming out of this album. The rest of the songs are just to fill space. Even though, some other pop songs on this album that has some potential like \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Born to Make You Happy\\", they are nowhere near to being a #1 hit. Also, you can automatically tell that her voice has been digitally enhanced yet all the technology in the world could not save those ballads. I recommend that if you like the title track, you buy the single. The rest of the album is not worth the money. Too much if filled with horrible songs such as \\"Soda Pop\\" and \\"E-mail my heart\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"media manipulation","review":"todays world is sad where a singer with not alot of talent can use her looks and use her record company to hype it up till you see her around every street corner the songs have no meanings to them they leave no message and have no point people who buy this cd need to figure out that what mtv says is not always true and that there is other music in the world that is not played on that channel. .......Nothin proper about ya propaganda, fools follow rules when the set commands ya.beliven all the lies that theyre tellin ya buying all the products that theyre sellen ya-RATM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ALL That!","review":"Britney Spears has the looks, & the pop songs that make you wanna dance. But she lacks vocal talent, BIG TIME. She trys too hard to sound seductive, but she just sounds stupid.

If you want something worthwhile, look elsewhere.But if pop's your thing, and lyrics don't matter, by all means buy this CHEESY CD with no particular point whatsoever. \\"Baby One More TIme\\" is the title track. All I can say is UGH! The first few times you hear it, it's catchy. Then it gets really annoying.Then, there's \\"Sometimes\\",a bland, boring, stretched-out ballad, which shows virtually no effort to be interesting.Next: \\"Crazy\\" This,in my opinion is the BEST song on this otherwise pathetic CD.Umm,\\"Soda Pop\\" is really strange. Open the soda pop? Watch it fizz and pop? Okay...\\"Born To Make You Happy\\" is yet ANOTHER bland and pointless ballad.\\" E-mail My Heart\\" - somebody,e-mail her a brain!

But, what she needs is some voice lessons and a better looking CD to catch the eye of the customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable Fluff","review":"When the novelty of the single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" wears thin, there's little left to enjoy. Once again, the music industry gives us a fresh face with sex appeal and packages it as music. Although the formula is nothing new, it still works apparently. The difference between Ms. Spears and Debbie Gibson is that Gibson can actually carry a tune and continue to sing for a living (even if she's not at the top of the charts). I don't have the same confidence in Ms. Spears long term."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspiring debut","review":"Britney Spears' debut album is a marketing strategy cleverly executed by her managers determined to cash in on the current Backstreet Boys/Spice Girls craze. All the songs on this album sound like they are written in one day and all Britney had to do was to enter the recording studio and do her vocals. Sure, she can dance well, I give that to her, but what other talent has she got, when she sounds so pathetically amateur on the album? And they say the Spice Girls are talentless!!! Hello!!!! At least the Spice Girls DO write most of their own songs, even if the lyrics contain incomprehensible phrases like \\"zigga zig ah\\". Granted, there are only two good songs on this whole uninspiring album, \\"baby one more time\\", which is a darn good pop single, and \\"Sometimes\\", a catchy bubbly number which recalls \\"Stop\\" or \\"Say you'll be there\\" by the Spices. One star for each song, and that's more than enough for Britney."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent, bad singing, repetitive songs make this a failure","review":"This CD is repetitive and badly done, with no evidence of real talent. With songs that are about nothing other than love, guys, and completely commonplace,this is uninteresting and boring to listen too. Maybe she should stop trying to sing and just do photos, considering that that is all she does anyway. Very definition of a \\"one hit wonder.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"Britney Spear's songs are ok, but she won't make it long if she has a weak little voice like i heard when she was singing live on MTV, Nickelodeon Awards, and the Rosie O' Donnel show.

But she seems like a nice girl and just trying to make it in the world w/ her looks. So good luck Britney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spears- Great Artist","review":"She's hot and sexy and sings great, too! Who? Well, only the 16 year old sensation Britney Spears. Her best song is ...Baby One More Time. I love the music video, too. The ECD part of the CD lets you put it in your computer and see scrapbook pics of her life, the music video, and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop perfection","review":"This is an excellent CD filled with bubblegum pop music. Nothing deep or meaningful; just lots of catchy songs. Britney has a nice voice that shows a little more range than other teen pop artists we've heard. An excellent CD that isn't pretending to be more than it is: fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented?","review":"This CD was rather disappointing. I thought that, myself being a teen, I would be able to relate; I was very wrong. Besides the lack of emotion, her voice, though she can carry a tune, isn't half as good as some of my personal friends. The only thing she has going for her is the marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't get any better!","review":"Usually, I buy a CD just to listen to 1 song, and hate the rest. I bought Baby One More time, The CD, thinking I'd only like the first song and I ended up choosing it as my favorite CD! This is the first time I actually like every song on the same CD- which is a deep surprise! And better yet, my favorite song in the world is You Drive Me Crazy (track 2) :o) I suggest you buy this CD! (I also suggest, Geri Halliwell, Ricky Martin, The Spice Girls, N Sync, 98 Degrees and The Backstreet Boys as other related singers to britney spears)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Depths Of Shallowness","review":"Sorry, I had to steal the Daria line, but it's true. The material on this cd takes a look into the cheap, chezziness on this cd. In fact, this cd is so pathetic, I never bought it, I listened to my friends before I thought about purchasing it. Her plain songs are are forced through whines and squeaks, typical for an artist who hasn't even reached adulthood, yet. This album is seasoned with a horrendous remake of Sonny and Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\" and \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy; which is \\"Everybody\\" By the Backstreet Boys with different lyrics and singers. Spears also doesnt use real insturments. Her songs are synthesizers and drums. How Pathetic Can You Get"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another Mariah Carey wannabe","review":"If I could give this CD no stars, I would. Britney Spears flat-out cannot sing. If you want artifical industry valley girl overproduced pop, at least get *good* artifical valley girl overproduced pop. In other words, do not buy this album (I mean, \\"E-Mail My Heart\\"? Puh-lease!) \\"Baby One More Time\\" is a catchy tune, but the lyrics are disgusting (\\"hit me baby one more time?\\"). The only song on this album that is even remotely good is \\"Sometimes\\". The songs clearly show that she is just another pretty face with no vocal talent whatsoever, just a quickly thrown out album. Britney Spears should concentrate on singing, not on looking good on magazine covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Her tunes are catchy, but the messages they send are less than thrilling.

I still recommed S club 7 though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, no, no, no, honey, no!","review":"When I first heard this CD, my first thoughts were, \\"What is this?\\" It was anything but pleasing to my ears and I was extremely happy when it was done. This CD contains nothing more than manufactured songs that aren't sung very well, if in fact you can call that singing. I'll admit she does have some talent, but not enough to be able to have an album and sell it. People just got caught up in the hype and bought this album. My advice is not to buy this album and save your money for some girls who can really sing, like Christina, Jessica, or Mandy."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is low. very low","review":"i don't mean to spread around negativity. but this is not music. it is a dependent teenage girl singing about sex, love, and things that are basically above her head for her age. not to mention how dependent she is on her boyfriend in the songs she sings. so i wish i could give her less than 1 star. one girl i know calls her a mariah carrey wannabe. and i could not agree more."},{"rating":"2","title":"britney is awesome","review":"I think this cd is awesome. The lyrics are cool and britney's voice sounds amazing. My favorite song is \\"e-mail my heart\\" and of course, \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\". She is so hot and cute that I just want to hug her. She is my second favorite artist behind metallica. Yeah, I like all kinds of music. I got a sweet spot for some good teeny bopping music. My girlfriend thinks I'm crazy that I like both Britney and Metallica, but I do. Well, just buy the CD and you will definitely love it. Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you call this good music?","review":"Britney Spears is no different than any other teen band that had a few hits and then vanished without a trace. Her music all sounds the same, and tell me this: How many times can a 17-year-old be in love? How can you sing about something you haven't experienced? She may have music suitable for 7 year-olds, but for those of us that enjoy REAL music, I give britney Spears another year before the next Fake-Pop-Princess takes her place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song crazy is so nice!","review":"This c-d was not at all what I thought it would be! I got this album mostly for Sometimes, but I now I love it even more because when they first started playing the song \\"Crazy\\" on the radio, i realized it was also on my c-d.

SHE DOESN'T WRITE,COMPOSE,PRODUCE, PLAY ANY INSTRUMENTS---IT'S JUST FAKE! UH, MAKES ME SICK. ALL SHE DOES IS SMILE, LOOK PRETTY, GET IMPLANTS, AND TRY TO SING.

But why can't we get someone else to make this album? This is not a cd, it is a mini-computer that is just about making a voice as best as it can possibly be. I should know, I have heard her in concert and man was I glad I had my ear plugs.. Don't worry, she won't last long. Sure people may come out in a bang, but they will be gone so fast, no one will even remember they ever heard one of their songs on the radio.

Soda Pop is the worst song in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake was made the day Baby One More Time was released","review":"Spears does not deserve to be compared to Debbie Gibson, much less anyone who has an ounce of talent. Her voice is unpleasant as are the songs on Baby One More Time. The orange-skinned 17-year old has no business in an industry that has in the past set records with Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Nirvana, and Michael Jackson (to name a few). These people take their jobs seriously and treat music like an art and not a chance to parade around and pop out all over the place. Her career is a gimick and a ploy and like her appearance, is artifically fake. Baby One More Time and Britney Spears herself are sickening aspects of society that should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yet!","review":"this cd is really good, and it is surp rising that she is so young.It is one of the best cd's I have heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys","review":"All Britney Spears ever sings about are losing guys. Come on, isn't that enough? Also, for the lyrics to ...Baby One More Time, why does she want her ex-boyfriend to hit her? Did the writers of the song write it because it was the only thing they could come up with, or did they think teenage girls wanted to get their ex-boyfriends back by letting them hit them? And, please, \\"E-Mail My Heart\\"?

Go SKANK in peace my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Music, Baby","review":"Contrary to popular belief, music can be good. There are some records that will change you for the rest of your life. They are made by committed artists who put all of their energy and emtion into making something they can be proud of. If any one of those people had made this record, they would have buried every copy in a deep hole in the woods, changed their names, and moved to Alaska. This record is about as cornball, cliched, and vapid as you could expect. And the sad thig is, music seems to be getting even worse in it's steady decline into the pits of hell. Britney is pretty, so maybe she should be a model and save us all the trouble of buying earplugs. If you want to learn more about the musicians I spoke of earlier, they are: The Velvet Underground, Wilco, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, John Cage, Dave Brubeck, Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sonic Youth, U.S. Maple, The Beatles, My Bloody Valentine, Public Enemy, and Built To Spill. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS CD.","review":"When I heard baby one more time , I thought that she might have some other pretty good songs , but no all the rest is just a bunch of repettitive crap. They make so many changes to her voice which makes her music sound really bad. She can't sing well so it doesn't matter what they do to her voice cause its bad anyway. She doesn't even write her own songs for gods sake. Anyway I would strongly not recommend anybody to buy this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I would have given her and her album 0 stars.","review":"I really don't like Britney Spears. Her music is decent but she really can't sing. Her songs are overproduced and are all the same with basically the same lyrics and beat. Some songs are semi-decent like the overplayed \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" but others like \\"Soda Pop\\" and \\"Email My Heart\\" make we wonder how this girl got a record deal in the first place. As for her personality, I think she is a very bad role model and conveys conflicting messeges to her young fans. In interviews she says, \\"Be yourself and be happy with who you are.\\" Then she goes and gets breast implants to futher increase her popularity. I found many photos taken of her are sickening. Hopefully she wont be around for very much longer but I can guarentee that I will never buy any of her albums or merchandise. I don't want to give money to a 17 year old girl who wants to act like a Playboy bunny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cd is great!!!!","review":"I think Britney is a very talented Girl.

I love her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby, one more time","review":"I will be glad when Britany Spears is no longer heard over the airways. Her voice seems to have only minimal range and she has so much backup, you can hardly hear her own voice anyway.

I hope she flies where Tiffany and Debbie Gibson are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please make it stop!","review":"I tried to give Britney Spears a chance. I'm not one of thosepeople who is against teeny bopper singers, but if I hear \\"Hit MeBaby One More Time\\" or \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" again, I will go crazy and be forced to hit people. I'm not saying that Britney is bad, but she is not the great vocal talent that others would have her be. Her voice sounds young (almost cartoonish) because she is young, but she makes the mistake of trying to achieve a sound she's not capable of. Yes, she is bubble gum pop. Yes, there is a place for it somewhere. I even gave her 2 stars, because I have, to my horror, found myself humming one of her songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"....Baby One More Time is a great album that has a good variety of dance beats and ballads.

But is her album worth all the fuss? I like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" but most of her other songs are not as good as her no.1 hit and her singing voice is not suitable for certain songs in her album. If you are looking for a good debut album by a female teen, I highly recommend Billie's \\"Honey to the B\\" or Christina Aguilera's self titled album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, if you like superficial muscians...","review":"Britney Spears' songs aren't good. I frankly have no respect for her at all, the way she dresses is just one of the reasons. PLUS, all the girl does is dance and lip sync! I mean, can you call that talent?! If her songs were OKAY sounding, then MAYBE you could overlook the lack of orginality of the whole CD, but they aren't! It's just fake, WAY too sugary pop music that is just perfect for teenie-boppers, and she keeps on adding this fake emphasis to her voice which is not cool. But hey, if you like superficial musicians, knock yourself out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good- NOT the best, but pretty good!","review":"I have the cd, and i think it's pretty good.

Did you notice that the song \\"...baby one more time\\" has the same chord progression as the new hit \\"Oops!... I did it again\\"? That's right, they're practically THE SAME SONG. Listen to each one, one right after the other. That's why everyone loves her new song as much as her first hit. People tell me they bought her record because they think she's a good dancer, but tell me, how can you SEE HER DANCING ON THE RECORD? If you just like her dancing, buy the video. She's not a bad dancer, but that doesn't make her a good singer or songwriter (not that she wrote ANY of those songs in the first place). I just hope that her records don't make the top 20 of all time among musicians (not performers like Britney) who have some real talent.And believe me, she's close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I have to admit I went along with the hype about this teenage prodigy but after listening to the entire album I am thoroughly disappointed. I was really hoping this would be a showcase for her talent. \\"Baby, One More Time\\" is the best of the entire album. \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" is a thumpin' dance track but the remix on the \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" soundtrack is better and you get a little taste of what her vocal talent could be if she would just sing. \\"Born to Make You Happy\\" is also a showcase of her voice but on every other track she is trying her best to imitate Pee Wee Herman (e.g. From the Bottom of My Broken Heart & The Beat Goes on) when she should just sing. She doesn't appear to have any confidence in her talent and tries way too hard to stretch her modest voice. This tactic makes my stomach turn. I will hesitate to buy her next CD until I have heard more than one track."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Baby One More Time!","review":"*I Love This Album.

Look at me and applaud, everyone!\\" Well, I see no point in applauding her. I see right through those preppy clothes (And I don't need to see through them; Just look on the cover of her 'greatest' hits album...). Stay sane and don't buy this cd.

Trite, mindless lyrics and heard-it-all before music...not to mention the way she sings \\"baby\\" like she has a severe nasal condition: \\"Bahlby..baylby\\". THEN I saw her video one night on VH1. Of course. Between the belly button and the Catholic-School-Girl-Vamp outfits, who's listening to the music?

Please, can we say embarrassed? To represent America as \\"US Teen Pop Queen\\" is a diss! And now she's been nominated for a AMA award, along with Shania Twain and Whitney Houston? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? The bottom line is, she doesn't deserve it! I've listened to this album (thankfully I don't own a copy!) and perhaps the worst songs are \\"E-mail My Heart\\" and \\"Soda Pop\\". All the rest are equally annoying, for the mindless 10 and under age group. I suggest you check out the likes of Billie Piper's 'Honey To The Bee' or Jessica Simpson's 'Sweet Kisses'.

She's a little tart who can't sing, dance, write or even speak properly! Her debut album is awful- the songs are tuneless and the production is apalling. We all know the only reason this sold millions was because she pranced around like a naughty school girl.Every single song is terrible and corny and unoriginal and..........The worst track is \\"Soda Pop\\", an utterly disgraceful effort featuring some odd rapper style singer. The lyrics are \\"Soda Pop watch it fizz and pop. The clock is tickin' and I can't stop\\"!!As for the rest, you've no doubt heard it somewhere- utter tripe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Killer, Rest Filler","review":"\\"Baby, One More Time\\" is the best song on this album and, with the exception of \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", probably one of Britney's best to date for most of her other singles follow the same pattern: Catchy phrase, play it safe lyrics, and a Janet Jackson \\"Rhythm Nation\\" beat. The rest of the cd is predictable with a calculated mix of upbeat tunes and lightweight love songs that are designed for the average pre-teen to sing along and practice dance moves to. The majority of the cd is produced by Max Martin who also worked with Swedish teen Robin (\\"Show Me Love\\") who had the chops to carry an average song up a notch. Britney is certainly in lacking in chops but who cares when you have top notch videos, choreographers, stylists and people who write and produce your songs for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensable ears revolt at this mechanical voice crutching","review":"It's true; she can't sing.The processing on these recordings imparts a metalic and screechy character to the sound simular to the feeling you get if you chew aluminum foil.With that said...If you are considering buying this record...Look deep, deep within...and ask yourself...WHY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A devestating example of a singer...","review":"I feel almost insulted by this album.

I wonder if anyone will remember any of these songs 10 to 20 years from now.Well, what she needs is a classic number- and i'm not talking about recycling songs- and maybe a voice that is as distinctive as Barbra Streisand's.Is that impossible- not for me to say but whoever said being a recording artiste is an easy job?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to shout about.","review":"I have to say that Britney has a good voice, but her music is typical, overproduced, teenybopper-pop without a shred of depth. There are some decent dance tracks, but that's ALL they are, dance tracks. The rest is flat, unoriginal filler tracks.Born to Make You Happy is just a really sad attempt at a love song that ends up promoting the prehistoric idea that women are born to serve men. E-mail My Heart is just lame--it tried to be a \\"'90s\\" love song but the lyrics are just plain corny.The problem with all those I love you...I miss you...yada yada yada songs is that except for variations in the regrettably unoriginal lyrics, they are all pretty much the same: E-mail My Heart, Born To Make You Happy, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart...if anyone wants to point out to me one major difference between these songs, well, feel free.All in all, this cd is pretty pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Britney!","review":"I think Britney is the Queen of Pop.

You go Britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kenny G of pop","review":"Britney Spears is to the pop world what Kenny G is to the jazz world. Hence the same rating. Her music is just mindless ear candy, no substance. The same old, repetitive message in each song. She is not a good role model for young girls; her recent stage shows in which she acts like a stripper and her revealing outfits just goes to prove that.The only thing she has going for her are good looks and a singing voice, although I have heard heard many girls (who are not famous or well-known even) who can sing much better. Granted, some of her songs are catchy and danceable, perfect if you like mindless dance pop. But they soon wear thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"please people.","review":"while i have been instructed to review this album based on content, i find that rather difficult since there is on content on this cd worthy of notice..especially the grammys...but then again i suppose that is just the state that our musical minds are in right now. i just do not think that the likes of britney spears and company belong there with such artists as santana etc... if you are not a fan of teen pop rock, save yourself some dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS","review":"First of all, the album gets 1 star because I can't give it 0. Second, here's a little anagram/poem that I wrote. It's totally original, unlike Britney's music or chest.Sings like a four year old Plays no instruments. Couldn't beat a tambourine. Expects high pay cuts for other people's songs. Attains a large audience for looking like Barbie. Repetitive garbage that can be written in 2 min. Speaks as if she knows what love's about.I regard that poem as advice, not as humor. Let go of her now. She'll be gone in 2 years anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO WOULDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE LETTERMEN?","review":"The music of \\"The Lettermen\\" is timeless and belongs to no one time period. Their sound is easy and can transport you to another place of pure joy and relaxation. The blend of their voices is heavenly and takes the listener away with the wonder of pure romance and love. Whether you are a baby boomer or not, their music is as relevant today as it was when they first came upon the scene. If you have been in love, are in love, or are looking for love, this music will inspire and delight you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Songs","review":"This album is perfect for remembering those early years.

Sasha - Dat Sexy Body"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best cover albums","review":"This happens to be my favorite of the Sybersound dance series, covering songs from the 1997-98 era.They've really put their time and effort into this one. They even show it in \\"Call Me\\"(dance tune originally by Le Click). In earlier albums, when they covered a dance song, it was just a direct cover with minor changes; this one has been changed by repeating and overlapping the chorus in the end.Other highlights: Frozen, Semi-Charmed Life, Uninvited.If you want to avoid the simplicity of #2, the misery of #1, and the over-poppiness of #4, this album's definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and clever in places","review":"OK it's a bit dated in places, both in social attitudes (to women in particular) and the odd mis-step in futuristic technology. But the world is well imagined, the plot runs at a fair clip and the characters are well drawn. The plague itself is highly intriguing and the breakdown in society very realistically drawn. Only the ending feels a bit rushed.Not one of Harrison's best, that honour belongs to the early Stainless Steel Rat books, but a decent read nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Little Science Fiction Story","review":"\\"Plague From Space\\" by Harry Harrison, 1965This is an ordinary science fiction story. The premise is similar to the one in \\"The Night of the Living Dead\\": something comes to earth on a spaceship that wreaks havoc on the people here. In this story the hero sees the solution and has to disobey orders to the contrary to obtain it. A sort of 'shoot 'em up' ending. It was a good fast paced story.I was interested in the social conventions that were revealed in the story. The hero finds himself in the company of a beautiful woman of his own station. They go off to do battle and he cannot help but see how wonderful she is to work with and all. She becomes a cheerleader for him as he goes off to save the world. If it was not for this story being futuristic, it could have been 1964 or 1965."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product, good packaging","review":"This gameboard has very nice quality construction, traditional heavy glass marbles, and a classic draw-string pouch for marble storage. The only minor complaints are storage and coloring. The game comes shrink-wrapped in the shipping box, so there's no good way to store it except to hang it on the wall (slot in back of board provided for this purpose). The marble bag would then hang from the hanging board. A little inconvenient for my house where wall space is a premium. The only other minor distraction is the color of the marbles. They are beautiful marbles, but it is very difficult to distinguish between a few of the colors while playing. We have requisitioned brightly colored plastic marbles from another CC game and use them when more than three people are playing. Other than that, this product is great and we are very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese Checkers function follows form","review":"This is a beautiful wooden board, and the intent when purchased was to use it to play the game. The marbles that came with the game were very pretty, and matched the colors on the board, but the colors didn't stand out. Three of us played, but it was very hard to distinguish the color of the marbles. Except for the white marbles, they all looked too close to the same (light blue, dark blue, green all looked very close in color, and the yellow and red looked close in color to each other). We had to hold the marble to the light to see what color it was.The nice thing is that other marbles could be purchased for use and wouldn't be a big expense. And it is a beautiful game board and you can hang it on the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective board","review":"This is a nice looking board, but the one I got was defective: the wells for the marbles are not drilled in straight lines. Because of this, you can't tell where you're supposed to be able to move! The game is not usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and worth the money!","review":"My Husband and I were surprised at how sturdy & heavy this game is. We love the size of the board because my husband has big fingers and was always nocking the marbles out of the holes in cheaper sets we had bought.There are some comments about the color of the marbles, but we have not had any trouble telling the marbles apart. Just make sure you have sufficient lighting. We dont mind the fact that it does not come with a storage box, it has a notch cut into the back and we have it hanging on our wall, it has a nice antique or rustic look to it.If your looking for a classic game to keep in your family for years, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for an autistic child that likes to be covered!","review":"I had my parents get this for my 9 year old autistic daughter for Christmas. She is extreamly hard to buy for as we dont quite know what will make her happy. This turned out to be an awsome gift! She likes to be covered but I worry that she cant breathe well. This tent has plenty of mesh that I dont need to worry. It can also stay open if you want. When we put this together, she became VERY excited and she jumped right in and was giggling the whole time! It also kind of helped promote interaction with her little sister. She was so excited about it, she actually asked (in her way)her sister to get in with her, and then wanted her sister to sleep with her! She still has it up and the girls play in it daily. This was one of the best gifts I have ever found for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"My 5 yr old daughter loves this tent. Sleeps in it every night.

Moderately good trumpet playing is simply awash in lush orchestrations--but to coin a phrase, \\"where's the beef?\\" The compositions, solos and ideas are lackluster at best, swirled up in a meringue of sickly sweet backgrounds which more than overwhelm the slight substance.

Understanding the purpose of markets and being able to gauge the strength and weakness of buyers and sellers helps give you a clear market bias. In my opinion, without the right bias all entry techniques are virtually worthless.Mind Over Markets is mostly a \\"What\\" book, where as an MP book like Markets And Market Logic is a \\"Why\\" book.

I found the two lead characters engaging if relatively stereotypical and the plot is initially intriguing as it promises to involve neo-nazis, genetics, cloning, mad scientists etc. However,the novel runs out of steam about half way through,becomes muddled and over long and the ending, or \\"denouement\\" if you will, is a total anti-climax.

Jaheira's death most of all is extremely painful to all the readers, the writer had virtually no right to kill the character Philip Athans put so much work into from the begining of the series, they had the right to live happilly ever after.

First of all in the first three pages the amount amount of blood spilled would have made Dracula himself throw up. I'm completely positive that the author didn't play the game and the author only had a small list of the main events. I would expect more talent in writing in a five year old child. The only detailed parts was in a. The fight scenes and b. making love (With many DIFFERENT women mind you!). The author surely is a pervert. Not to mention he completely changed Jaheira's deity, thus making her completely different. Any person who would rate this book a five star is surely being bribed by the author.

He is accidentally transported back in time to the year 999, where he discovers a conroversy surrounding the impending dawn of the year 1000. Zack's adventures involve both the students of the Dragon Slayers' Academy and an actual dragon.This book is good silly fun, with some clever jokes and pop culture references. If you are looking for something that is actually eduactional about the year 999, look elswhere; the accent here is on comedy and fantasy.

Ihsahn's vocals are the same, a piercing and, for the most part, unintelligible shriek - however it is the sound as a whole which is meant to be consumed and appreciated by fans... this album might not seem to click on the first couple of listens due to its dizzying pace combined with strange tempo changes and multilayering of riffs, voices and samples - but that at the same time is the sheer genius of the album... Emperor have truly encapsulated the sounds of pure evil here. It is a must for fans of the genre. They are the Dante of the music world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthems to The Welkin at Dusk","review":"Incredible is the only word I can think of to describe this album. Emperor has really matured on this release. An amazing display of sophisticated Black Metal art. Emperor puts it all together on this release listen for yourself if you have doubts. The mix is much better then on their previous releases and the guitars are much more upfront which I like, being a guitar player. The U.S. release features two bonus tracks and a CD-Rom video.

(NO dimmu here)","review":"Buy it! don't let some [person] say to you that Dimmu Borgir is better than Emperor... Dimmu Borgir came after them... they're a tentative to copy Emperor... other bands like Hecate Enthroned and Cradle Of Pokemon (Filth) are the same... everybody who knows something about black metal knows that... Anthems is almost a modern music classic, no cd can came close to this in terms of technique , melody , and perfect combination between fury and slow viking-like parts.. because there's NO ONE in the same league as Ihsahn (maybe Garm From Arcturus and Ulver), this man is godly and no shagrath or any other ''just good vocals'' can come close.. that's a fact for whom knows something about musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE","review":"Emperor is nothing but a guy who can't sing or scream, coupled with a drummer who doesn't know anything other than blast beats, and two guitarists that you can't even hear under Trym's constant pounding. Emperor's lackluster attempt to reignite old metal guitar riffs by marketing them to the 'evil' satanic crowd falls short miserably. I'd rather record myself farting and put it on replay instead of hearing this 'black metal' jizzunk. BTW Ihsahn isn't smart, he's an idiot and he looks like a choir boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Metal is a Joke","review":"These people need to get lives. They burn down beautiful churches and kill innocent people to gain popularity in their genre. Does no one care about these lives enough to quit supporting this music? It's all the same, too. Who cares how much they hate god and who they want to kill and what they do with the devil? They are so caught up in their own little world of hatred that I actually feel sorry for them. I hope there is a hell and they do go to it. And I'll bet that if they do, they'll change their views of it. I'm not a Catholic and i see that the religion did support many violent crimes throughout history, but what religion hasn't? And the people today had nothing to do with it, so why feel the need to punish them? This music is glorified shock rock, and I for one would never support [stuff] like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"After I got this CD I played track 5 (Reverence) first and I knew the rest of the CD was going to be lame. The songs have no direction and the music itself is just some sort of 'progressive' exercise in the melodic black metal sound. It's as if some music students in college decided to write a melodic bm CD but had no real insight as to what they want to acheive. I listened to the whole thing a couple of times and I haven't listened to it since. It's too 'gothic' for me as well.My version came with a video, 3 tracks from the Reverence MCD, and a live track. I gave it two stars because the CD is lame, but it's not a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"<yawn>","review":"I don't think I could sum it up any better than the reviewer before me, but I will try. This record shows that the Emperor we all once knew & loved has deteriorated into a tired & boring band. There is absolutely nothing in the CD that makes me want to listen to it ever again. Emperor, the same band who recorded the immortal MLP (split with Enslaved) and Wrath of the Tyrant, sound no better than a sub-par clone of their previous work. The should have disbanded after \\"In the Nightside Eclipse\\". Then they would have forever been immortal & gone out on top. But for now, they are just another reason why Black Metal is in the sorry state that it is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUTRID!","review":"Yay!

Buy some Burzum or Von instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the ingredients but no direction","review":"Emperor's technical prowess shines through, but not much more. The concepts and poetic nature to their songwriting has all but vanished, leaving in its place circular songs that schizophrenic collide with themselves in order to somehow achieve resolution. Beneath the flashy production and instrumentalism, there isn't enough here to keep the interest of an active mind.

I need to put it into a private collection. I just love the melody, lyrics, and especially vocals. The balance between fast, heavy chaotic music and slow, beautiful, romantic parts is just excellent!

I've loved them from the start and this is, n my opinion, their finest moment. Beautifully symphonic, powerfully brutal, intelligent and masterfully performed, it's a rush in all senses from start to end. Ye Entrancempyrium is probably my favourite track, but it's hard to choose.

But I steered away for a while induldging in punk and other less prominent forms of music. Periodically I'd pick up some old school thrash but never quite found that \\"fresh\\" sound. Emperor is that sound. This album took me by complete surprise! Like Heaven and HELL mixed up in a brown paper bag. Consequently Emperor and this album have pushed me back into the Black/Death metal scene--the bands overseas I feel have the most to offer, and these guys stand above most of the others! Like \\"Mercyful Fate\\" on coccaine, with raspy ear curddling vocals that can still harmonize with the complex guitar and song structure. The drummer? Like a blast of lightning! There music has to be experienced! This album will be a favorite of mine for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emperor's best and most powerful.","review":"Wow! This cd is amazing!

But when opened and spun, this is simply another angry blast of tunes by a band throughly bent on creating a sheer wall of sound. Ihsahn's vocals are hidden under the irregular thumping of the double bass blastbeat and the incredibly horrific guitar sound. Seems to be all the rage. Most metal this brutal is covered with vocals that sound like dying cats or burping frogs. This lies somewhere between the two. I gave this disc a couple of listens anyway, just because I thought I might have missed something the first time around. I don't think I did. The prince of darkness probably spins the disc with a smile on his face.

I thought the portrait of Minty, the protagonist, was brilliantly presented. An obsessive-compulsive (and likely schizophrenic) nearing-forty woman, Minty is rendered not like the typical mentally-ill character (with cliched, oversimplified traits). Instead, we're given very compelling insights into what makes her tick. Other characters, though, are more thinly drawn and seem almost cartoonish. The plot, as others have noted, is also a bit thin, and ends in a way that I found anticlimactic. I guess I wanted it to resolve more fully the various subplots.

The underlying message of the book that being a Christian is all about building a relationship with God is beautifully built in the main characters, Em-ee-lee and Jonas. Liz, you're a genius!

The stellar cast, including Wm. Demarest, Jane Darwell, Phil Silvers, a young Jackie Gleason, Frank McHugh, Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, Judith Anderson...well, it doesn't get much better. Consider the 1942 release...the war was at it's peak. Then there's Bogie, playing a likeable gangster who makes good with rival gangsters to beat up a Nazi infiltration in NYC. Add tons of humor and the beautiful Kaaren Verne, and you have a delightful mix of suspense, angst, intrigue and American triumph (as well as a cute love story). It may not be a great film, but I think it's my favorite Bogie film, if only because it's so much fun to watch. Where's the DVD?

The engineering / mixing isn't the highest quality and reminds me of some of the early Australian releases of Mental Notes, etc that didn't compare to the US remixes (see Second Thoughts).

Most articles I read in the Times are thoughtful and decidely lacking in the \\"Us vs. Them\\" voice that is apparent in reading your work. I wonder how anyone who is not black could read the book and not come away feeling as if the target audience was \\"Blacks Only.\\" There are several instances where the reader is warned to the effect that \\"Oh, well, there goes the white man again\\". I have trouble beleiving this book will do what its stated intention is: to alert the races to each others inherent prejudices. Actually, it probably does do that, but unfortunately it does it in such a way as to reinforce the \\"Us vs. Them\\" mentality that Ms. Williams apparently lives by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"While this book tries hard to explain and dispell those divisive \\"little things,\\" overall I found that it perpetuates certain stereotypes even more.

You'll might just learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!!","review":"Sheesh, just when you think things might start getting better between the races someone has to write some drivel like this. Why bother with scientific evidence gathering and statistical correlations - just go ahead an use a few inflammatory anecdotes that may or may not be true much less relevant. Avoid this book and read just about anything by Shelby Steele or Thomas Sowell instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Just Bad","review":"I bought this book about a year ago and have yet to finish it to this day. I'm not an offended White person, I am an African American male who deals with issues of race everyday. I really wanted to like this book but it is just plain horrible. I can't believe that she writes for a newspaper. Her ideas are scattered and she doesn't really back up any of her claims. Some of the things in this book are true but they were just placed in the wrong chapter and just rambled off. She reminded me of a bad comedian who just jumps from subject to subject without ever finishing a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well -- At least she tried again.","review":"I'm just shocked she got another chance at the same subject matter twice.How about we stop pushing the stereotype that all \\"blacks\\" think this way, and all \\"whites\\" act that way and move on already. The notion that \\"race\\" is the defining issue is nonsense. Culturally the person raised in a different environment than me is bound to get under my skin now and then as I try to understand where they are coming from. No need for a book to tell me that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Black people may like this book and appreciate the message, but if you're non-black it will just make you sick. This book is nothing but a rant against all white people. The title and jacket cover claim to provide a balanced approach, but there is precious little input from \\"whites\\".Ms. Williams seems to think that \\"whites\\" are to blame for every little set back, disappointment, and inconvenience in her life. Since she's so fed up with this country I suggest she move somewhere else and quit her whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Ramblings","review":"I only got this book because it was required for my counseling class. This is literally the worst book I've ever read. IT's about a black woman talking about her \\"life experiences\\" (and I use the term loosely since I think she made most of these up) to show how \\"racist\\" white people are. She makes generalizations such as white people aren't cool but talks about how bad it is for whites to make generalizations. She has no research, no statistics, and no proof of her claims. The only reason this book won anything from the New York Times is because it's a black author writing about racism and the NYT was too afraid to say it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have stayed in the sports section.","review":"I felt like my intelligence got deteriorated after reading this book. It was a complete waste of time. The more I read, the more disgusted I got. She certainly has a few good points. But most of the things that she mentions in the book are so...dumb and prejudiced. For example, she says \\"we\\" the blacks know how to throw a real party and \\"they\\" the whites don't. Also, she implies that black men go out with white women because it gets under the skin of white men and want to show that \\"once you try black, you won't go back.\\" (Pp. 280) These are only a couple of things that Lena the know-it-all Williams says in the book. I'm so disgusted with myself that I spent my own money on this ridiculous book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree","review":"I read this book to get other perspectives thinking I would learn something for a series I am writing on race entitled \\"The Top 10 Things Black & White People Want to Know About one another but Won't Ask\\"on CainTV.com. I have to tell you that although I could appreciate some sentiments, overall, this was a complete waste of time & a tree. This book is mostly an idiotic diatribe of borderline (and sometimes overt) racist, narcissism and I'm being charitable. It is very arrogant for this writer to presume that she can speak for the entire black community and she didn't even try in several places to be objective. Two thumbs & toes, way down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for College Diversity Programs","review":"Lena Williams' Book \\"It's the Little Things\\" would be a great book to use in Diversity Classes. She really tries to zero in on the underlying causes of misunderstanding. She does a great job of analyzing the underlying anger and hurt of what she calls \\"mini-aggressions\\". However I did not give the book 5 stars because the book is not balanced in the sense that she does not explore the white american experience. There really is only one chapter devoted to the subject. However, if your class or group is all white or predominantly white, this would be a great tool for discussion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Spark a Discussion","review":"While I agree that the perspective was largely that of a black woman (we don't learn a lot about what gets under the skin of whites), this provided me with a different point of view. If nothing else, it's worthwhile to be reminded that things you don't even think about may be really annoying--if not hurtful--to someone else. And it can't possibly hurt to try and be a little more aware of the feelings of others.Nonetheless, I think this book provides a good jumping-off point for dicussions about race. Many people are remarkably ignorant about how thoroughly racism pervades American society (other societies, too, of course, but that's not what this book is about). Williams provides a number of examples that nearly everyone should recognize, whether or not you agree with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Lena Williams!!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this book.

All this may be true, but I certainly wouldnt have paid$22.00 less 10% to read this one sided, even if true,continuum of how poor the race relations are, without a further note about how whites really feel. I pride myself on being unbiased, but this is a very one sided, mean spirited review of white people. Thumbs Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought with High Hopes; But Highly Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book with much anticipation about getting a broad, balanced, objective view of every-day black/white relations as the cover promises. What I, unfortunately, got was a narrow, author-oriented nearly-all-black view of real and, quite often, \\"perceived\\" insults by whites against blacks. It furthers the advancement of relativistic \\"political correctness\\" that makes perceived wrongs as bad, if not worse, than real ones and puts us all on edge and hinders open and honest discussion. Ms. Williams overlooks and/or excuses bad behavior by blacks and applys her experiences in a lower middle class, hard-working black environment and extrapolates that all blacks are like those in her family or inner circle. Ms. Williams squanders a great opportunity to balance the scales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Unless you want to read 99% white-bashing trash, don't buy this book.

If you are looking for a book that reads easily, and will be informative as well as fun, this is probably not the book for you.

The fourth and fifth tracks (\\"Pump Up the Volume [Remix 2/Bonus Beat]\\" [4:47] and \\"Pump Up the Volume [Remix 3/Instrumental]\\" [5:07]) ARE present.

This track was a sharp contrast to the bouncy A-Side hit: dark, moody, and dense with distorted guitars, feedback, and real-time delay treatments. The B-side was more in line with the rest of the progressive and experimental 4ad catalog, and likely was under appreciated by the average consumer of this title.

Sadly, the coarse mill seemed to have trouble ingesting the pepper - I took the lid off (the grinding part), put in a few peppercorns and gave it several turns. The peppercorns just rolled around as they were too big to fall into the teeth of the grinder. Turns out I much prefer the flavor of coarse ground pepper and have begun a search to find a more suitable grinder for any size of peppercorn.Edited to add: I've been using this grinder for salt and have found that it works very well as a salt mill - four stars as a salt grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"So far, I've used these for peppercorns and various varieties of sea salt.

One of the early X-Men :).Even if you can read it in a matter of hours, you will find that Andre Norton had plenty to say about the actual world men lives in and not so much about the nuclear war that happened, which is fine by me. The trip of Fors in one of the ruined city and his encounter with the Beast things is very gripping.Usually, I resell the books I read.

If you have volume one you have to get number two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed review","review":"Eichstadt and Small's study of the ways in which Southern Plantation museums do and do not address slavery is primarily useful in that it confirms what most of us already recognized. Most Southern plantation museums do not confront the issue of slavery in a useful or balanced way. This is not news to public historians. Although the book does serve to document the lack of slavery representation in most southern house museums, as a whole, it is not particularly profound. Some of Eichstadt and Small's conclusions and terminology, however, do provide useful tools for public historians studying the representation of slavery in house museums. The introductory sections are thought provoking as they address some of the reasons that the issue of slavery is often absent in the interpretive framework of many southern house museums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Although I see the validity of their points throughout the book, I walked away from it feeling bad to be a white person. Yes, slavery happened, yes, it was a horrible atrocity, but I don't think that they do an adaquate job of truly examining museums but instead reducing it to a white vs. black dichotomy. If you want to read something truly interesting and non white bashing, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable!","review":"I see Black people on the train all the time reading the Bible.

Some characters in this story are King Arthur, Queen Gueneveer, Sir Mordred, Sir Gawain, and Sir Lancelot. Sir Mordred is King Arthur's evil son. The story took place in the Middle Ages, and the setting was in Camelot. This story was very boring because there were never any exciting parts. The most exciting part I would say is a jousting battle between Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot. That's not exciting because it doesn't even give any specific details. Another reason you shouldn't waste your time on this book is because some of the wording is very hard to understand. The sentences are formed differently and it uses some words you may not understand. For example, you probably know this word but they use \\"thus\\" a lot and it gets to be very annoying. In conclusion, I don't think you should read this book because it's boring and hard to understand; therefore you should not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing stuff!","review":"It doesn't make a difference if you know anything in German (and I don't) you'll be singing along!

To make matters worse, the aging Fairbanks had little enthusiasm for his sound films, with the exception of the light-hearted \\"Mr. Robinson Crusoe\\" (1932).

I literally can't go a day without it. It is rich and creamy, absorbs very well into the skin, and with everyday use you will never see dry skin, ever. It's even great after sun damage. It is not greasy in the least bit and has a beautiful light scent that is not too overpowering yet still smells tropical and warm. I don't understand the reviews where people say it doesn't smell like coconut. It's not coconut oil so no one should expect it to smell just like fresh coconuts. It's the closest thing to a lovely coconut scent I can find anywhere. I've been using it for years and the best part is, I used it throughout my entire first pregnancy and NO stretch marks. Not one. I'm halfway through my second and still don't have any.

Rollins addresses some of the same topics on the video that he mentioned on the CD, but there are some different takes and some new things to be told. What really makes this tape are the breaks in between spoken bits -- I'm not gonna give it away, you'll just have to check it out.The best piece on the video is \\"Eric The Pilot\\", possibly the best yet of Henry's many whacked-out travel stories. This one is made better by the fact that you can see his facial expressions, something the CDs can't fully convey.With all of this we get Henry's take on Racism, Homophobia and other forms of human ignorance.

I don't buy books of fiction except on very rare occasion. So, on one page there is the bold announcement that this is a book of fiction. Next page says it's a memoir. And it went downhill from there. It's not impossible that events she described may be true---but I'm inclined to believe it's a book of fiction by a chronically self-pitying person who, also, is not a very accomplished author.

They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also, Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love it","review":"I bought this as a stocking stuffer (yes, for my dogs!) for Christmas and my 15 lb Bichon Frise and 8 lb Maltese love it so far.

ALL of my dogs absolutely love to chew them, however, I do worry about the small sharp, jagged pieces of nylon that protrude from the chewed surface so, I pick the bones up after they have been chewed for about an hour. That system works well. As with most routines, the boys have learned that they will get to chew again tomorrow. Yes, it is possible to take a bone away from a Pit Bull, a Labrador and a Shepherd. Just make sure that the dog understands that the bone belongs to you before you lend it to him. If you cannot pick up your dogs food bowl while he is eating, I would not try to pick up his bone while he is chewing!

After my puppy went though some of the other nylabones, I decided to spend the money and get the galileo- it was completely worth it.

I've had pretty good luck with two other nylabone products, but they were a bit small and I figured it was time to bring out the big gun. With all these bones I believe it's time to retire them when small chunks start coming off of them; this bone did not last long before this started happening. By contrast the other nylabones lasted much longer, but based on price and advertised qualities it should have been the other way around.So this was a lot of money for a product that lasted less than a month.

It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing, the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers, but don't break off. I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in.

This CD captures that feeling well, and makes transitions from one music genre to another without alienating the listener.Why four stars, you ask? Eclectic-based music usually has at least one song that you won't like....Interested in buying this but not sure if it's your style? Listen to Morning Becomes Eclectic (and other programs) at http://www.kcrw.com first."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds almoust eclectic","review":"Yes...almoust eclectic. You've may heard the radio show hosted by Nick Harcourt, it es an eclectic one, you can catch from the most experimental to the mainstream, or the quiet to the louder, but this record isnt at all.There's this sort of line to follow, despite the bands are real eclectic, within each other, the live presentations have similitudes, so maybe theres a louder or heavy act left.The good thing here is the selection of groups and the production by the host of the show. Nice quality sound, good masterization, and a better selection of songs, untitled from Interpol, one big holiday from my morning jacket and the BD from Demian Rice are the bestAs a conclusion the price is real worth the record and the effort of the public radio internatinal broadcast, and it is better if is purchased by amazon, speccially if you are over seas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matched the Basket","review":"I purchased to go with the basket I bought for the small Christmas gifts so our creatures wouldn't tear them up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of milonguero style tangos","review":"This disk is a nice collection tangos good for dancing milonguero style.

Two people who do not care for each other being put together in a bonding situation, and after some time, grow to appreciate each other. Been done before. I found this movie still funny and a bit original with the premise of 3,000,000 dollars and two supporting friends who add to the mixed emotions. Cameron Diaz and Aston Kutcher are good, and Dennis Miller as the Judge and Queen Latifa as the Therapist add to the cast nicely. Plenty of laughs and scheming of situations that create enough action to pull you through, even though you know how it is going to end. Worth a purchase, or at least rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Movie!","review":"This was such a hilarious movie..

Its good for a few laughs induced by some silly comedy but that's just about it.

It didn't get the same cult following simply because it was billed as a romantic comedy, but it was almost as funny and has a cameo by Zach Galifinakis. The story is about a couple of friends getting drunk and hooking up in Vegas. After a drunken marriage, Diaz and Kutcher gamble, winning 3 million dollars. They go to court, being that they want and divorce and don't wanna split it, and the judge played by Dennis Miller puts the money in escrow, forcing the couple to live together for 6 months. That's when they find out how different they really are. This movie is hysterical, fun, and much better than the previews which by no means do it justice. If you like comedy and you enjoyed the Hangover, check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I really was surprised after watching this movie about just how entertaining it was. To be honest I ws expecting something I was going to suffer through with a couple laughs. Sure there is not much to think about and it was a somewhat typical romantic flick but it was worth the time spent watching. Both Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz were funny and played wonderful roles. My biggest negative is that sometimes it got redundant when they were trying to screw up each other lives and it would have been nice to see them start to connect with each other for a longer period of time.If you want a good fun movie that doesn't require thinking and can give you some laugh out loud moments then this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not call this funny","review":"Zero chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher. The title makes it seem like this will be another Vegas caper flick. Not. Very little actually happens in Vegas here, though what does happen is what passes for the funniest part of this unfunny date movie. The rest is a yawn, at best. Nothing is even remotely believable. Watch if you have nothing better at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but funny romantic comedy","review":"This movie is a bit formulaic, but its a rare romantic comedy that isn't. There are a few different elements in this one tho. Mostly romantic comedies have the couple as \\"Dislike\\", followed by \\"Like\\", followed by \\"Crisis of misunderstanding\\", follow by \\"Love\\".There are a few more wrinkles in this one that stretch the formula out some in an entertaining way.One plot element that didn't make sense is that they had to succeed at marriage counseling in order to have their marriage annulled, and the counselor said that they were a good match, so the judge granted the divorce (should have been an annulment). However, this didn't really detract from the enjoyment of the comedy in the movie.If you have cable and have already watched movie channels' \\"blockbuster of the month\\", you could do worse than catch this movie in later weeks.

So many struggling actors, directors, writers that are out there that spin yarns more enjoyable in their sleep, and yet, Hollywood green-lights these ridiculous movies that degrade humanity and set us back as a people.

While I liked the movie and found the leading actors cute and funny I couldn't figure out the racist approach everytime Joy's Chinese colleague had to say something or do something. The scenes at work or in the boardroom or in the boss's house or in the night party with the Chinese woman with her Chinese husband? I thought that was far too much and I thought all this confirms it was done on purpose. Maybe it is fashionable now to bash China? What others think about this? I did not also appreciate the portrayal of other minorities in the movie, such as the African American guy who arrived in a police suit. Is the movie telling us that only this couple of mainstream white Americans can be truly \\"American\\" and that Joy's boss found a connection with her husband (Ashton) because he displayed some cultural treats?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible.","review":"So bad a movie I couldn't finish it.

The yellow skirt is HUGE and it doesn't lay on the waist as shown in the photo.. it comes up very high.. only a few inches below the bra.. so the full skirt that high up made me look HUGE! The sleeves are puffy, but the red band around the bottom of the sleeves does NOT stretch. It was cutting off the circulation in my arms, and I could barely get the arms through the holes. I ended up cutting them and sewing an elastic band on the inner part (near my armpit) so that my arms fit better. Also, the white collar is very floppy, and doesn't stand up unless you hold it (like the woman in the photo is doing).. however, it's 2 layers, so I was able to cut it open in the back where it velcros together, and I slid in some bendable foam that I got at the craft store.. sewed it up, and it stayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very important book to whom wants understand the nervous system .","review":"I liked this book, it's difficult to find out texts about central nervous system from invertebrate species.

It's part heist movie, part racing movie, and part action/cop and robber movie.

The Rock is a welcome addition to the franchise as a federal agent who specializes in tracking down fugitives. There is a lot of excitement in this one, with the distinctive storyline of the bad guys being the good guys because they are stealing from worse guys. It makes sense when you see it. Are there some improbabilities that occur during the course of the action? Certainly, but if not taken too seriously, this is a good old-fashioned action film.

Why is everyone scream and fighting each other in this movie? It was like going into a bad high school or a jail cell. Stealing cars and hiding them? Yah right, I'm pretty sure these low-life characters can get away with that. And what chick wouldn't want to get knocked-up by some guy who steals cars for a living, not to mention constantly getting chased by the authority and the Latino \\"mafia\\". This is like the Latino Jersey Shore with fast cars. By the way, you combine Brian O'Conner and the Rock character to get the Vin Diesel character. They were all like cry-babies, always dramatizing the situation, no wonder they couldn't get anywhere in life. 1 star because I cannot give it 0 star. I will put on another star because I like fast car, but take off another star because American cars are ugly. So there you have it 1 star for this lovely movie. Save your money, if you want to see fast cars just Youtube it lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"TESTERONE on OVERDRIVE!!!","review":"Why do so many guys like this movie? Vin Diesal is an awful actor! He thinks that good acting is strutting around flexing his big bulging biceps, knocking guys out to prove how big and bad he is. The stunts in this movie were kind of funny to me. Like how he and Paul Walker manage to survive that fall off that cliff jumping off the hood of the car! And how when the bad guys catch them and cuff them to the ceiling Vin Diesal easily breaks out of the cuffs and pounds the dudes to a pulp! Hmm yeah right? Paul Walker is a great actor but he gets easily overshadowed by big bad Vinny! They shouldve gave him a stronger role. Loved The Rock too! He was able to keep his machismo under control. I cant believe they're making a 6!

Not only do they pull it, somehow their mass is enough to whip it like a water skier behind them and smash it through buildings all while going maybe sixty or seventy mph though a city.

I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like \\"oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him\\".However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters. More than likely they would have just sat there spinning their wheels until their tires exploded or the cable would have snapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"seen movie on 11/5/11","review":"Thanks for sending me an email to review a film I seen 4 months ago!

Timeline-wise, it falls after Fast & Furious (#4) but before Tokyo Drift (#3). In my opinion, it revived the series in a fun way and makes me look forward to more in the series. The stunts (while perhaps far-fetched) were done very believable, with little CGI, making the viewing experience very enjoyable. The storyline didn't bore you, and watching Vin Diesel fight the Rock was just plain fun! If you're not a fan of the other movies, you probably won't like this one. However, some friends of our had never seen any of them and watched this with us and now want to watch the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst of the series, without a question","review":"At least the other movies were plausible.

I was not happy with the disc but I am very pleased as to how I was treated by Amazon and I continue to purchase from them.

This is by far the best in the series so far. The car scenes are amazing the story itself was more than what I expected from this franchise. The fighting was excellent, whoever thought to match Vin with the Rock was brilliant, could not have seen him fighting it out with anybody else. The on-screen chemistry between the cast is noticable, their passion to deliver the story in the best way possible is evident. Overall 10 of 10 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I wasn't a big fan of the series, but I definitely like this one the most.

The Rock would eclipse a meeting between Stallone / Schwarzenegger / Willis?Wonder no more - Fast and Furious 5 conclusively ends that debate. This is an epic movie, original, creative action right from start of the movie to the end. Not only action is superb, the acting is good too. A movie with equal amount of action and heart. Paul Walker adds to the mix with his great acting as well.The thing I like about his movie is there is virtually no gimmick. Just an excellent chemistry between a whole bunch of actors, mindblowing action and great storyline. I've never seen such action scenes before... epic!I watched this without any idea what I was expecting, and I was simply blown away.

Jon Hendricks (half the lyricss), Abbey Lincoln, Bernie Hanighen, Sally Swisher and Mike Ferro managed the impossible quite well. Even if you did, who could possibly sing Monk? Carmon McRae is the only possible answer, as hers is perhaps the finest and most versatile instrument in jazz. McRae's lilting humor and intelligent phrasing anticipates where Monk is going, which is amazing as Monk himself seldom knew. This album is a crystal tapestry of voice and instrumentation woven to catch the light - it is quite simply a beautiful thing. And all this at age 68 for McRae - an inspiration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF CIRCUMCISION DETAILS","review":"This series has some wonderful details of foreign festivals, but the Kenya book is NOT AGE APPROPRIATE for age 4-8, as indicated on the amazon.com summary.

Cradle of filth formed three years before this cd came out, and Cradle does this sound a lot better. The man who sings in emperor relies on distortion in his instruments and production to hide the fact that he has no vocal range at all.This band is nice if you like this type of music, but every element on here is one that has been improved upon by more creative bands like Cradle of Filth. So if you like this cd I would recomend Midian and Lovecraft & witch hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Emperor\\" of Black Metal.","review":"This is the classic example of what Black Metal should be. This CD, and in fact Emperor as a whole, have defined Black Metal. This was before classy production and popular bands such as Dimmu Borgir and COF were selling huge amounts of albums. There is a cold brutality to this album, that is getting harder to find in metal these days. Thankfully some bands, such as Enslaved, Opeth or Dimmu Borgir are popular but still doing things right musically. For casual fans of Black Metal, this is a bit difficult to get into. But, this is one of the best, most brutal, and fastest Black Metal albums of them all. I encourage you to at least listen to it. If you are already a hardcore Black Metal fan, you should get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic black metal","review":"I've been listening to metal ever since I was old enough to comprehend the message behind a song.

Absolutely essential for any black metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive black metal album","review":"When I first heard their splt CD with Enslaved I thought nothing could possibly top the sheer majestic atmosphere of those 4 songs. That is, until \\"Nightside...\\" came out. To me, this is what black metal and music in general is al about: intense, majestic, dark. This album has not been topped by anyone, including Emperor themselves. Possibly the Kvist-album \\"For Kunsten...\\" and a couple of songs off their second full-length, but that would be it. Get it, are get out of black metal altogether"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest black metal CD ever!!!!","review":"Pure,cold,dark,church burning music.

Emperor is so great, they are the Gods of black music! Forget about Cradle Of Filth because all they care about is making money (although their music is good which is a pity)! Emperor's the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure black metal beauty","review":"This is by far Emperor's greatest release and unfortunately looks to be there greatest ever. With Anthems to the Welkin At Dusk they succumbed to the 3rd generation black metal posers and sold out. But In The Nightside Eclipse is a true classic of black metal. The best thing about Emperor is their classic usage of keyboards to complement and not destroy the rest of the music. The compositions are so brilliant and beautiful that i'm not sure if it can be classified as black metal. Unfortunately, the musicianship is not the best as the band seems to have a little trouble staying together at times. The recording isn't the best either with some bass drum kicks sounding like a snappy pop instead of bass and depth. The only reason i give 4 stars is that the recording does not give justice to such an album. Still, In The Nightside Eclipse is a powerful work of black metal and should be heard by anyone intelligent enough to appreciate this style of black metal that has been lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mud","review":"I like a lot of metal, including some Black Metal, but this is by far one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I'm not talking about the song writing, or the lyrics or vocals or something, I'm talking about the recording itself. This has by far the worst production of any Black Metal album, and that's saying something for a genre that fans expect, nay, demand have low production value. It sounds like Emperor recorded this album in a concrete basement, through a PVC pipe, into a broken microphone, with their equipment covered in mud. Then it sounds like they played the recording back through a blown out speaker at full volume into a telephone and recorded that to the final album. I would like to criticize the actual music on the album \\"In the Nightside Eclipse\\", but unfortunately it is such a muddled mess all I hear is noise. If you think ultra-low production quality is neat, then by all means enjoy this mess, but if you like to be able to hear the instruments being played, then pass on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Black Metal album","review":"This was the first black metal record I ever heard and to this day it is still my favorite. So much so that any black metal I heard after this I have found my self comparing to \\"Nightside\\". This record achieved such a brash rawness while at the same time having an incredibly eerie air about it. Few albums have achieved the genuinly creepy darkness of this album for me, from the opening of the oddly 'Mechanical'? plodding sound to the mind tearing guitars. this is also one of the few albums to use a keyboard correctly to create truly terrifying atmosphere. And what can be said about Isahns vocals? sounding truly possesed and vile. All of these layers combined add up to the measuring stick for all black metal to follow in my opinion. Truly epic and sinister, still has yet to be touched by anything after it. For the brave, this album on a walkman, hallucinogens, and a dark snowy forest..... I promise you won't forget it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The majestic sound black metal sought","review":"In a layered mixture of distorted strings, vocals, keyboards and violent yet subtly alert percussion, the masterpiece of Emperor kicks off by reinventing the popular music song structure to fit the dimensions of a microsymphony. Lengthy melodies connect through the abrupt and dramatic harmonic shifts made in the course of each song, building moods until the album itself resembles a tunnel of imagination into which one crawls for forty minutes, escaping the world and its triviality for a vision of greater desire. This album would be a classic in any genre. If you love this album, Burzum's \\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\\" and Graveland's \\"Memory and Destiny\\" are the most comparable releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing cd!","review":"Wow, the minute I popped this disc into my cd player I was blown away. The atmosphere and yet incredible heavyness of these songs are simply amazing, its like you're taken to a different world while listening. Another thing that I really like about this disc is that Ihsahn's vocals are sort of in the background, the focus and forefront of this disc is mainly on the music itself which is Emperor's strength in my opinion. Anyway, this is an excellent disc and in my opinion is Emperor's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable! Essenial Black Metal.","review":"This album is THE black metal album. If you only buy one black metal disc in your lifetime it should be this. The music is haunting and energetic at the same time. The keyboards are not overdone and are very subversive to give this album a very eery and ominous feel to it. Unless you are a wigger or love pop punk you should buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Christian.","review":"This is a wonderful leather bound edition which includes three titles in one.

The 3rd time it would not power on, no matter how many times I rebooted. There is a firmware update on the company website, but that didn't seem to make any difference.

Anything to fill those pages, eh? Boring. I ended up skipping over alot. The plot is ho hum zzzz. There is but one action scene. The characters are cold and lifeless. The best part was the very beginning with the dog. That's it.I've read all but 2 of the alphabet books and would rate this down in the lower third. Mediocre. In my opinion _G for Gumshoes_ is her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Boring","review":"This time Sue Grafton made a mistake big time. Large portion of the book is taken up by her boring daily life goings: Driving VW, Eating bad food, Talking about her past. Characterisation is bad and the climax is hardly related to the main problem set at the beginning. Besides, I don't understand how obliged one would be to a spouse(whose marriage short-lived and fraught with infidality) divorced 14 years ago? Her whole motive is not believable. Having read many of her other novels, I always have known that she would be, at best, a distant third to the James hadley Chase and the famous Nero Wolfe mysteries written by Rex Stout. But this book does not even justify her being in \\"third\\" in my list. He must be downgraded fast.

He ex-husband has been shot and she sets out to find out why and who. It is a great read. As usual the ending is very good. Kinsey gets into trouble with the police afer entering her ex's apartment. She nearly gets killed but comes through again. Please read them in order, they will mean more if you do.

This is a nasty and bitter Kinsey that I would not want to meet. Her early \\"letters\\" gave us an intriguing character in the wonderful setting of Santa Theresa (a thinly disguised Santa Barbara CA). She has since placed most of the action elsewhere and has only minimally developed Kinsey's charactter. Grafton needs to return to the essence of here alphabet series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grafton's got it back!","review":"I love Sue Grafton, but N IS FOR NOOSE made me worry that she had run out of steam halfway through the alphabet. No more worries! O IS FOR OUTLAW is the best Kinsey Millhone in a long time. Grafton is in total command here. The writing is assured, the plot is thick, the characters are beautifully drawn.

The beginning is a great hook. I like my PI's to break the law a little bit. I found some parts of the book a little bit too predictable, and a bit coincidental, and strange (contrived?). I don't know how to explain it without ruining an illogical but thrilling chase scene. I've read this whole series because my sister got me into it, and I realized that a female protagonist can exploit some plot potential that male a can't. For me, O is one of the best in the series because for a change there is something really at stake for Kinsey, something about her that had perhaps been there all along. I love all of her adventures, before and after, but this is the first time I cared about her as a person. Serious readers of the series will kow what I mean. I've read all in the series, but this is the only one I didn't pass on to a friend. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good until the end.","review":"This is a very good Kinsey book until the ending. I was furious with the author for making such a mistake. My question to Sue Grafton is, \\"Why would Kensey drive past her back-up and the Santa Teresa police as she is being chased by someone who clearly intends to her harm?\\", stupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with shipment","review":"Came as ordered no problems with the order or the shipment - very happy overall with the book, and the service."},{"rating":"2","title":"KINSEY ON THE JOB","review":"Sue Grafton has done it again in her ABC continuing series. This story is apropos right now with all 'the abandoned storage lockers' reality shows on TV, and many of the finds in the lockers/storage units make for great stories and human pieces. Kinsey finds herself involved in one on a personal basis, and the story unwraps quickly from there. Her descriptions of characters and locations are always detailed and takes the reader right to the site. A fun mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and audio version is horrid","review":"I've listened to all of the alphabet series up to O on audio files, and I've generally like the stories and the narrator. Now with O, there is a different narrator (evidently the author herself!) who gives us an unlikeable Kinsey and a... what's the word... bizarre Henry. The tone of voice for Henry, probably my favorite character, and what he says is so unlike the previous Henry I can't believe it's the same character and I don't like him. In general the story is boring, boring, boring. I like some description of place and the daily routine, but this is ridiculous, and with a ridiculous ending. I never before thought Kinsey was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite from A to O","review":"I have enjoyed all of Sue Grafton's books from A to N, and this is the first one I didn't think was very good.

Not bad; just not up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I've really come to enjoy Sue Grafton's mystery series. But this one was a big disappointment!

Not among her best.","review":"I look forward to Grafton's new ones; however, I think Kinsey's slovenly dress and unhealthy diet was really overdone in this novel. Maybe I am just getting tired of it. I love Spenser's gourmet ways but, of course, that is Parker's style. I also felt that Henry did not interact with Kinsey nearly as much as in the past and Kinsey did not treat him nearly as well. I missed him."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"O\\" is for Oh, Boy! -- A New Sue Grafton","review":"Sue Grafton is in fine form in this latest Kinsey Millhone mystery. \\"O\\" IS FOR OUTLAW lets us see Kinsey's first marriage. Her ex is in a coma and, at first, the cops think Kinsey tried to kill him, so Kinsey takes on the case, which turns out to be complex, convoluted, and connected to places as different as Louisville, Kentucky, and Vietnam. As usual, Kinsey's methods are a bid shady but effective, as she retraces her ex's last investigation. The writing may be a little less sharp than other books in the series, but the plotting and characterizations are fine. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"O\\" should be \\"NO\\"","review":"I have been a Kinsey fan for many years even though she seems to be getting more and more immature. This book brings out her worst...not only is she so unpleasant to everyone it is embarrasing, she is given the unbelievable talent of being able to elicit information by being particularly annoying. The story doesn't seem to really \\"grab\\" one's attention as the previous books in this series did. It was a struggle to the finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am an avid reader of Sue Grafton's books...and always look forward to the next one.

It was definitely not up to her usual standards..I hope this doesn't mean \\"O\\" is for burned Out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New reader for audio version is disappointing","review":"I've listened to the audio versions of the whole series to this point. This one and later have a different reader than the earlier ones. Usually in a series that is a surprise at first but you get used to it if it's a good choice. But this reader has a horrible raspy voice that is not only unpleasant to listen to, but creates a completely different (and less appealing) image of Kinsey in your mind. It's bad enough I'm losing interest in listening to the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot and lots of padding","review":"This is the first Sue Grafton book that I have read and it will be the last. I picked it up hoping for a light and entertaining holiday read. Well it is certainly on the light side. It starts off okay but the plot never develops beyond the obvious. To make up for this the author frequently describes in minute detail the surroundings. This generally has nothing to do with the either the plot or the characterisation, and I was often left wondering just what a particular passage had to do with the story. As a comparison, novels by Dick Francis are both far more entertaining and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arlene B. Waite","review":"Too much time spent on changing clothes, taking a jog, eating poorly and jumping in the VW. It appears that writers are so pushed for deadlines that their writing becomes rather mundane. I have read all the alphabet books but will have to look over \\"P\\" before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"I've tried for several weeks now to read this book, but it is just boring. It had a lot of potential w/ it being about Mickey, hubby #1, but it became so bogged down w/ trivial stuff and no action that I fell asleep nearly every night reading it. I do like Dietz and Robb is O.K. (stupid, but O.K.) It'd be nice to see her really work on a case w/ one of them again, instead of calling them, or thinking a quick thought about them.I've enjoyed about 60% of the others, with G being my favorite, but I really don't care a whole lot about Kinsey. She's becoming even more bitter and nasty. I'd like to see some growth on her part. I've heard P's not any better. But, I'll give it a try. 26 books are an awful lot about one person, but perhaps Kinsey will find happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look into the past adds some fun to the Alphabet series.","review":"Its hard to keep things fresh after 15 Alphabet mysteries, but this book does have a lot to offer fans of the series. We get a look into Kinsey's past as she gets a chance to make up for a past mistake. We learn more of the background and situations that made her the private detective she is. The alphabet mysteries are kind of a fun read and though Grafton doesn't have the depth of other writers the stories are usually interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding example of the Kinsey Milhone series.","review":"I started reading about Ms Milhone along about \\"F is for Fugitive\\", but I caught up fast and have become a loyal follower. This one is in Ms Grafton's usual cutting edge style. You can see the characters form when she describes them and their personalities come through clearly. Her characters are such normal people. Both the bad guys and the good guys. I particularly liked \\"Dorothy\\". I think I would like Kinsey very much if I met her. She is smart and independent and not afraid to take a chance. Except with money of course. The book has humor, suspense, good characterization, a few chills and is just a great read. A perfect addition to the \\"Alphabet.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"O is for Outlaw","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Kinsey Millhone series!

The ending (as always) was great, with the final sentence prior to the Epilogue slamming the mystery to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"O is for Old","review":"I've been an alphabet fan since the very beginning, but the series is starting to run stale. Kinnsey's oddball ways are clashing with her middle class mania for cleanliness and order. None of the other characters are the least bit memorable and we don't even get a decent flashback of her life with her ex. The climax is a disappointment and that about says it for the book. If you haven't read the rest of the series, don't start with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This HAS to be her best one yet!","review":"WOW!

I was looking for a great karaoke album with the hits of Alicia Keys and I found it! SONGS IN THE STYLE OF ALICIA KEYS is a great set of instrumental versions of the songs that Ms. Keys is known best for. They include \\"Fallin,'\\" \\"How Come You Don't Call Me,\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You.\\" The only downside is this purely instrumental and there are no vocal examples to help guide you so you can maintain your pitch.

I'd really hoped to like this movie, I like Clive Owen a great deal, enjoy Charlotte Rampling, and love both Malcolm McDowell and Jonathan Rhys-Myers, but there's nothing to hold onto in this movie. Nothing that engages you. None of the characters gave me any reason to care about them (except Rhys-Myers, but he dies in the first five-ten minutes. And I cared about his death. But not about any of the people it \\"affected\\").It seems like it's trying to build for something, and, ultimately, yes, Will gets his revenge, but, really, motivation? Why did anyone in this movie do anything? McDowell's character (whose name I didn't even care enough to remember) had no motivation to bugger the boy, and there's an entire side-sub-plot involving guys that don't want Will in town that remains useless.Overall, a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing Is the Best Revenge","review":"If the tacky title doesn't put you off this British thriller, the absence of any real thrills certainly will. In spite of \\"Hamlet\\" and other narratives you might name, revenge is never a noble motive. Yet this movie invites us to root for Clive Owen to take down the villain \\"responsible\\" for the suicide of his young drug-dealing brother (who is truly to blame is subject to conjecture). The pretentious script takes forever coming to a conclusion.The real mystery here is why such dependable actors, Clive Owen and the utterly wasted Charlotte Rampling among them, signed on to such a cold-blooded exercise. The movie looks good, perhaps because we spend more time looking at the screen than concentrating on what is happening. To help in this respect, you will want to click on the English subtitles; everyone in it is as soft-spoken as the movie itself is hard-hearted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"Watching Clive Owen in Croupier and Arthur, I looked forward to viewing this movie even though I knew it was a bad sign that I had not heard of it. Ebert's and Roeper's \\"two thumbs way up\\" also sold me on renting it, but I wonder if we saw the same film. Boy, what an incomplete storyline!At the conclusion, I immediately went to see if there was a director's commentary to discuss what happened. My main complaint is the lack of explanation why Boad (Malcolm McDowell) committed such a heinous act. The reveal never came, nor did the desired backstory delving into what drove Will into isolation.On the plus side, I enjoyed the British dialogue and the setting. We are indeed two nations separated by a common language. This however is not enough to recommend this film.Here's hoping that Clive Owen will finally get a role that lets him use more of his facial muscles and a script that doesn't need an accompanying Cliff Notes to understand the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"Kept hoping/waiting for something to actually happen in this movie, and really, never did.

Could this really be directed by the same guy who made Croupier and Get Carter? A complete waste of talent, and one I think Clive Owen will want to forget, especially as he seems on the cusp of conquering hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible. One of the Worst.","review":"An enormously talented cast shows what can be done with a pile of junk script. While the premise of the movie is intriguing, the script is an undeveloped piece of garbage.I was astonished at the praise heaped on this movie, including the Ebert & Roper \\"Two Thumbs Way Up\\" (way up what?). Every actor in the film is wasted, nothing is resolved, we are offered almost nothing of the characters backgrounds with that pretentious directorial \\"wink\\" that's supposed to make the \\"hip filmsters\\" know what's going on. Yawn.Worst excuse for rape ever: When seeking vendetta for the rape (and eventual suicide of his brother Clive Owen's emotion-free Will asks \\"why\\" Malcolm MacDowell offers only a lame \\"He thought he was something special . . . the way he dressed, held a cigarette, the way women fawned over him, the way he walked . . .

Owen also returns because his brother Davey Graham, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Elvis, Alexander, The Maker), took his own life. Owen finds out that his brother was raped and he bled internally so that's why he killed himself. Owen, then sets out to avenge his brothers death. Clive Owen is always good in anything he is. If the movie is crappy, he's the only good thing in it. This movie is a sleeper which is really disappointing, I had high hopes for this one and the end kind of left me wanting more.

At times the pace was very slow and the momentum of the movie was lost in scenes that failed to propel the story forward. For a gangster film, there was very little violence or action. The journey that the main character goes through helps build the tension of the film towards the anticipated climax. Unfortunately, what we end up seeing falls short. Instead, I was left feeling confused and denied a sense of completion. The story was not told fully. It was like a whole chapter of the book was torn out and we are left with having to make up the ending ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very flat film","review":"the flattest film i have ever seen. there is no storyline, no suspense. no climax, no character development. there are a multitude of characters, most that appear for a short time, say a few lines, and are never seen again, and yet appear in the credits. 3 minutes before the movie ends, it gets very interesting, which left me saying to the rolling credits, \\"NO, no no! that can't be the end!!! it just started!\\"but judging by the fact that there are currently over 80 people selling this DVD on this site for less than a third of retail, i'm not the only one disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing and great characters","review":"Book summary: \\"In which the Reverend Bill Quentin, showing himself for once a man first and parson afterwards, woos the beautiful foreign lady in spite of her air of mystery and the wagging tongues of Rickaby parish.\\" I found the writing to be excellent, the characters believeable in their actions, and the presentation to be readable and approachable eighty years later.

The conversations are interesting the first few times, but will certainly be tuned out upon repeated listens.The absolute stunner on this album is \\"My Funny Valentine\\". Costello just shimmers in this song and is one of the best versions I've ever heard of this old standard. This song alone is worth the paltry $10 to get this great album.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good support, but needs padding for stitching","review":"This brace offered very good support for my arm while I was recovering from tendonitis.Other reviews mention how the stitching can bite into the skin.

A stunning cast with Charlotte Rampling, Oliver Tobias, Fabio Testi, and Antonio Falsi all simply gorgeous. The sets are incredible and the vision is other-worldly. All the beauty, drama, and violence of the Carolinian theatre.But this edition is dreadful, and utterly misleading. It is not the uncut 106\\" it promises, nor is it remastered. It is simply a bad copy of the horribly truncated 91\\" American VHS aversion of this classic. I have made better DVD copies than this from my old VHS tape.There is a beautiful widescreen version from Asia, in Italian without subtitles in English. If you know the film and love it, you won't care.

I originally bought this edition from Walmart; for 1 dollar! After I eventually found and bought the beautiful Asian dvd for this title, I put this one where it belongs; in the garbage.

And watch Stephane Audran sit and try to look sincere (or sincerely insincere) for a good portion of footage... Some other actors are pretty bad and uninvolved also...Masterful, but formally only.

This is Emperor's best sing-along, toe-tapping album (niether of these things would be possible on their first (and best) release In The Nighside Eclipse).

It is very heavy, very brutal, and very symphonic/melodic at the same time. Ihsahn's black cvocals are scary as hell, but I still think the only black metal vocalist who should be aloud to do the clean voice is Vortex (Dimmu Borgir, ex-Borknagar)My copy had three bonus tracks: a short instrumental, a remix of Curse you All Men, and a very industrial sounding track i didn't recognize. I'd recommend this album to fans of all types of black metal, as well as to fans who listen to vicious death metal. It was a wonderful listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Emperor were once this great band that released mindblowing morbid albums like Wrath of the tyrant or in the nightside eclipse. What the ... happened? This is the half-... release that set them apart from what the once stood for. The agression present on past albums is gone. The songs are very lame and unmemorable. The overall producton just adds insult to injury. Whats more stupid is Ihsahn trying out to outdo King diamond with his female vocal aproach.

But, that being a matter of personal taste, I will not diminish my praise for \\"IX Equilibrium.\\" As a whole, this is a very strong album; it's just not as memorable.

I had read all of the reviews about the glider and decided to take a chance. I had read that it was squeaky and the padding became uncomfortable. I used it occasionally before she was born and liked it. When she was born I have used it almost everyday. After about 2 months, it started to squeaking in the back of the chair and I couldn't get comfortable because of the padding. I had to sit sideways to get comfortable and after about a half an hour, I had to readjust to get comfortable again. At about three months, I sat in the chair to put my little one to sleep, and the chair snapped! Luckily, we didn't fall to the floor, I caught us before we got there. My husband tried to fix it, but was unsuccessful, now my dad is trying to fix it, but does not think that it will glide anymore because the track is worn out (I didn't think I used it that much!)

We order frequently from Amazon and have always been pleased with the products they offer. We were looking for a mid-range priced glider and reasearched them pretty well. We decided on this storkcraft for the style and price. While it was very easy to assemble, the size of the back of the chair is extremely short. My head barely could rest on it, while my husbands head went above the back of the chair by a good 18 inches. The seat cushion is extremely uncomfortable, very thin, no padding at all. We gave the chair about 5 minutes before my husband disassembled it and we returned it. Thank goodness the assembly was not difficult or time consuming, and that Amazon is so amazing with their return policy. I would HIGHLY caution buyers against this chair. We're going to consider a used better quality one from Craigs list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came stained and torn, also not very comfortable","review":"When we received the product, the fabric of the ottoman was stained and torn, even though it was still wrapped in plastic. Obviously, Storkcraft simply upholstered the chair with damaged fabric. In addition, the seat is very thin and stiff, so not very comfortable, and the chair back angle is very straight, so you basically have to sit straight up in this chair. The seat back is also too low to rest your head on, so all in all it is not a very relaxing rocking experience. We ordered it because it was inexpensive, but I say that if you can afford to pay a little more, get a more comfortable one!!!

It was delivered promptly and mostly assembled, which is different then how most Stork Craft products arrive. We purchased this style to match the existing wood pattern of our son's nursery. The blue wasn't our top pick but lower pricing prevailed.NO noise from it after 6+ months of use! It's comfortable but not something to fall asleep in because the back doesn't rise high enough. This would be the only thing I would consider if I were you - are you the type that falls asleep a lot with the baby or just there long enough to get the baby to sleep? Anyway, no issues with the fabric, no stains to test it but no worn spots either so it appears durable.Chances are great you're reviewing this for a nursery type setup. YES, I recommend this product. It need not be overly fashionable because you won't need it long term. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible squeaking!","review":"My son in 25 months and this glider was great up until a few months ago. The quality isn't the best, but it was a good price and it fit well in the nursery. Unlike many of the customers whose reviews I've seen here, the wood was not cracked or anything, but here is my big gripe: IT WON'T STOP SQUEAKING!!!! We tried oiling it, adjusting the tightness of the screws, you name it. Anything we tried would only make it stop squeaking for a couple minutes and then it would start squeaking again. At first, I could adjust my weight and position and stop the squeaking, but now the darn thing won't stop no matter what I do. THE SQUEAKING IS GETTING LOUDER too. I am ready to throw this thing out the window and set it on fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price","review":"Pros - Sturdy, easy to assemble, works great, good product for the priceCons - Sometime makes tick tick noise while gliding so it disturbs the baby.

I am returning the chair and would not recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for the price","review":"This set is great in many ways. You can't beat the value for the price- cushions are soft, glides very easily. Set-up/ installation is very easy- note that the arms are labled as facing, not as seated. I did notice, however, that there is not a lot of extra room in the chair. The side pockets will be very handy for quick storage and easy access for many things- they are roomy. I am small (5 ft), so it is not a problem for me, but my 6 ft husband has just enough room (minus baby). Also, there is not a lot of extra lower back support, so I would suggest a small pillow for that extra support, if desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"more pros than cons","review":"great rocker, very quiet.purchased for a new mother... the cushions could be more firm and there isn't much lumbar support at all. but is is built pretty well and came mostly assembled. probably had it put together in less time than it took to open all the packaging ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy and cute","review":"I love the glider and the ottoman. Took vey little effort to assemble, except that two of the snaps on the left arm cover were warped. My husband drilled and attached them with screws so I could use it right away. Funny instructions on the arms, as the right arm was labeled as left, and left arm was labeled as right. Obvious with the assembly though.

The wood color is a little darker than I expected but it still is a nice fit for our little girls room. The back cushion is comfy and the storage pouches on the side of the arms are nice.

It has been great and was worth the try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It might do the job","review":"We debated over going with an expensive glider or a cheaper one. We settled on the cheaper one. It arrived today and was easy for me to assemble. It is very small in scale - I am 5'7\\" and my head is above the back rest. The back cushion is pretty comfortable, but not the seat cushion. I already stuck another cushion on top of it, which raises me up even higher. I haven't used it yet with an infant, as we are not due for another few months, but I think it will do the job. If you are hesitant, I would definitely recommend going with a higher quality glider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chair seems to be good, but got wrong arm-rest","review":"Length:: 0:23 MinsThe package has wrong set of arm rests, the right arm rest is out of size and seems to be bigger than the left one (which is correct size and fits the base).

I had read the reviews and it seemed like a good deal. Let me tell you, after sitting many hours in this chair..it is just not comfortable. The cushions are just too small and thin to sit on for very long. I cannot find a thicker cushion to fit it either. Using a foam pillow under the cushion right now. Also, the seat cushion started coming apart at the seam in just 1 month of use. The ties that tie the back cushion to the frame ripped out in 2 months of use. The wood finish scratches easily. And it is just plain small. All in all I desperately wish I had opted for a more expensive chair that is bigger in size, more comfortable, and better built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glider","review":"Bought this for my daughter.

It says, \\"Beige Corduroy\\" in the description. The fabric is not corduroy in any way, shape, or form. It's some sort of mircosuede. Still a nice chair, just not what I expected to get when it specifically says \\"Corduroy\\" in the name of the product. Did the definition of corduroy change?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we were expecting","review":"We're very happy with the glider and ottoman. We bought the espresso with beige microfiber to use in our baby's nursery. It was not hard to put together, and it looks great with the other furniture. It's a great deal for the money.

It was as described - we liked the pockets on the side so we could have things handy during feeding. We were happy with the glider at first. Unfortunately the base broke 6 weeks into using it. I leaned down to grab something off the floor and it broke on one side of the base - there really isn't a way to fix it because the wood is cracked. I only weigh 150 so I can't imagine that weight had anything to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"I had to put this together on Christmas Eve, and thought it would take all night. It only took about 20 minutes, and was easy. My wife loves it. It is a little small, but so is my wife. Overall, great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!!","review":"First I'd like to point out that this glider is 130 dollars. It's not going to be amazing and the best chair you've ever sat in that being said....The wood is a good quality. If you compared it to my 800 dollar crib you'd never know that it wasn't top dollar. The bottom, ottoman and arm rest cushion are like memory foam ish. The bottom is a little hard but i think it will get better with use and if not easy to replace. The back cushion is very plush and comfy.I was worried about the size. I'm a little bit on the fluffy side. My hips are wide (wear a size 16) so I was worried I'd be to big for the chair. It wasn't a problem at all. I have a little wiggle room. I'm 5\\"4' and my head hits the perfect spot on the back.It is a tad bit creaky when I sit down or get up. Not enough to bother a normal person but I'm sensitive to creaks speaks and whines.Well see how it holds up but from what I can tell it really is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This chair is low cost and very nice.

It also does not take up too much room in our already cramped bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's Room","review":"The product is exactly as the picture depicts it. It is comfortable to sit in and it has a smooth gliding action. The price (we paid $129.00 shipping incl) was very reasonable considering that there are many comparable gliders available online for 2 and 3 times the price. Assembly was easy. We had it together in 15 minutes. It has roomy pockets built into each of the arm rests that are adequate for a book, magazines, baby rattle, baby bottle, bible, etc.The only point of disappointment is that product is made in China... but then so is most everything these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"It looks great in our baby's bedroom. My son loves to be rocked in it. It shipped quickly, got to my house in 3 days. It looks just like the ones they sell at Baby's R Us.

Overall we are happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glider & Ottoman!! (Expresso/Beige)","review":"After much debating and many trips to stores reviewing gliders and ottomans, I felt like there was a comfortable one at an affordable price somewhere out there. Thanks to all the other reviews of this chair, I decided to get this. And I feel like money well spent. I got this within days of purchasing it. It came securely packaged and very easy to assemble. It's very comfortable, probably more so than the couple hundred dollar ones I sat on at babies r us. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing part delivered :(","review":"The glider is good but there was missing button for the side pocket making it unable to assemble correctly like on the other side.

The cushions are thin and unsupportive. The build is insubstantial and rickity. Small children are guaranteed to get pinched or worse with the lack of protection on the the rocking mechanisms in both the chair and ottoman. My most valued input is from other reviewers but I guess that's not going to work anymore.....ahhhh, the photo makes it look like you really did good!What makes me think I can get a quality product at a rock bottom price?

It arrived very quickly and we had it put together in about 15 minutes. It's just the right size for placing in a corner. Even with the ottoman, it doesn't stick out too far or encroach upon the rest of the room. The chair and ottoman glide smoothly and effortlessly. With several different styles, (square back vs. rounded back), and color combinations to choose from, you're sure to find one that fits your motif. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one in the future. I wish I had had one of these back during my baby making days!~ jade ~"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price","review":"Like every other review, this chair is a bit on the small side.But, for the price, this was the perfect choice.It was easy to assemble, packed well.It arrived a lot faster than I thought it would.Some folks purchase the really expensive gliders and then hide them away in the nursery and then get rid of them.I can't see spending $500 on something like that. This glider was about $150 if I remember correctly. That is a great price for a new product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Price But GREAT Chair","review":"We got this chair almost a year ago and LOVE it.

And for the people who complain of the cushion not being comfortable...our mothers and grandmothers sat on straight wooden chairs.

It was a little uncomfortable to sit in anyway but the bottom screws snapped off on one side. My husband repaired it with new screws and some wood glue rather than go through the hassle of shipping it back. That worked great until it broke in two other places a week later.

I registered for this glider/ottoman and received it as a baby gift. I definitely would have chose differently, however, if I had known it would fall apart. One of the springs broke before we even had it set up for three weeks. Unfortunately, by the time it had been given to us and by the time we set it up, it was too late to return it. Once my husband fixed the spring, another one broke. Eventually he reinforced all of four of them and it seems to work ok now. This glider/ottoman did not perform as I had expected, and did not live up to my expectations. A couple pros though: it is lightweight and easy to move and the side pockets are very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of money","review":"The pre-assembled part of this chair falls apart regularly, sending me looking for the nuts and washers so I can put it back together.

One of the springs on the seat popped out and after i managed to get it back into it's place, about a week later the ball bearings piece broke while my wife was nursing our son, causing them to fall out of the chair (luckily neither of them was hurt). She is only 5'5 and 120 lbs so it's not like she is putting a whole lot of stress on the chair - this chair is very poor quality.

It is nice looking chair but not very comfortable. The material seems cheap and the bottom cushion lost its shape very quickly.

Compared to prices of gliders found in-store (easy $200+), the Hoop Glider is economical, easy to set up, comfy and quiet as can be. We plan to upkeep the glider with some greaser to prevent it from squeaking. Can't wait to use it with the baby :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Here are the major issues with this product:1. It sits way too close to the floor. I am 5'7 and my wife is 5'5. We both feel that the seat of the chair is too low. If you use the ottoman, it is not as much of an issue.2. The pads for the arm chairs are way too short. There is no slack.

The glider looks as pictured, and it is easy to assemble. The seat cushion is thin but comfortable enough. When we first bought it, the chair and ottoman both glided smoothly and quietly. After about 6 months the chair started squeaking loudly and the bolts started loosening and falling off. We used WD-40 on the chair and it didn't help. We had to stop using the chair because the squeaking kept the baby awake, instead of helping him fall asleep! We also tightened the bolts several times but they kept loosening and eventually bent, so we gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Glider","review":"This was simple to put together. It came with 6-7 screws and the allen wrench. It is a little smaller than what I expected, but comfortable and solid. The ottoman comes put together too.

Also, I'm 250---and when I sat down gently in it. I could hear crack, creek.

The front of the arm rests had come apart and one broke completely off. I was so scared when it happened that me and my baby were going to crash to the floor.

Thankfully there wasn't a mark on the wood so I was relieved. I put the chair together in minutes and was pretty happy. I was even happier that the ottoman didn't have to be built at all. That is, until I started pulling apart the plastic covering the cushion. As I was removing the plastic from underneath of the cushion, I noticed a crack that ran edge-to edge for the support part of the ottoman cushion. Basically, if it was ever sat on, it would just break in half. Also, two of the legs supports were cracked pretty badly. I hated to have to go through the trouble of disassembling it to return it, but there was no other choice. Stinks pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon customer service SUCKS","review":"I just recieved this glider as a gift and there were NO screws sent.

Great choice.","review":"For a very inexpensive and fairly easy to assemble rocker/ottoman, this is a great choice. The seat pad is somewhat thin, and the seat is a little narrow (definitely no side-by-side rocking with a toddler), but it's nice looking and an excellent value. One of the best choices in its price class, for sure. The only thing that I have reservations about is...where does the wood come from? Knowing where the wood was sourced by the manufacturer would have tipped it into a 5 star rating (well, as long as it was sustainably sourced, that is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good glider for a tight budget","review":"I purchased this chair because I saw it on sale thru Amazon. I have been shopping around for a while for a glider or rocker and didn't want to spend a lot of money. This was definitely the best price I had seen. Shipping was super fast and the glider arrived in a few days. It was very easy to put together. I will say that the chair itself feels a little on the small side to me (I'm 5'10\\"). It seems to be a decent quality, but not as nice as some of the more expensive chairs I have seen. You get what you pay for, right? I do think it will serve our purpose for now, and at a great price, which is exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"we priced this out and put it on our baby registry...at first i wasnt crazy about the idea of a glider but i am sure happy my husband convinced me. we live in a 1br apartment and this doesnt take up that much room..the glide/rock motion is pretty self contained so you can place it near a wall(as we did)..something you cant do with a regular rocking chair. It only has 6 screws..something that came in handy when my nesting kicked in at 5am and i assembled it. after it was all assembled it looks very nice ...and after a weekend of nonstop nesting when i finally crashed i spent hours in this chair perfectly comfortable! and it has great pockets in the arms so i put an extra burp cloth, wipes and my 'essentials'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squeaky squeaker","review":"This product was very easy to put together. Although the side bar clothe kept coming out no matter how many times I buckled it. I bought it when I was 35 weeks pregnant I am 38 weeks now and it already squeaks which I find to be super hilarious. I mean this furniture has no modesty. I buy it and it shows its true character within four weeks. Of course I read the reviews before I ordered the product and yet went for it.Its not exactly comfortable but I like the way it rocks it helps me soothe my Braxton Hicks contraction. My husband loves to sit on it and d his work when I lie on bed and can't get up. That way he tries and spends more time with me and the baby which I find adorable.Overall the product is a good buy and the squeak is not as loud not so far at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice glider!","review":"This glider arrived in no time.

Its already uncomfortable to sit in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken hardware (brass bolt) included","review":"I tried to assemble this glider chair, however one of the 6 small bolts included for assembly was broken. The end of the bolt (where the allen wrench fits) was not punched correctly at the factory, and therefore the allen wrench will not seat into the bolt head. Totally frustrating. I contacted Amazon to try to get just a replacement bolt but they said I have to return the whole chair, which I have already mostly assembled and would have to spend 30 minutes taking apart and packing up again. Just for a bolt. Totally frustrating, and too much inconvenience to return this bulky item. I will just buy a replacement bolt next time I go to the hardware store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Glider","review":"I bought this for my daughter-in-law who is expecting in March.

Yes, the finishing could be better, but the defects are barely seen.It blends perfectly with the furniture in the Nursery and is great to put the little one to sleep. It's so comfortable that I even fell asleep in it (NOT with the baby though).Overall: GO FOR IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This rocker is mediocre but then the price is very inexpensive. The rocker itself is pretty solid but the ottoman is relatively useless and you're likely to trip over the thing in a dark room. I set one knee down on the ottoman and the wood snapped in two and I'm not over weight, it's just cheap quality. There is also a heavy chemical smell in the cushions which is obviously the chemical smell from whatever material the Chinese manufacturer is using. We left the cushions out on the porch for a few days until the chemical smell aired out. Overall, it is what it is, a cheaply priced rocker for putting the baby to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Waste of money poor construction.

Would not buy a gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"Worked well at first, but after one year it wouldn't stop squeaking, and the ball bearings broke at two years, which rendered the chair totally useless. So after two years, off to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Glider EVER","review":"I bought this glider after reading the mostly positive reviews, however I should've paid attention to the negative ones.First, they sent the wrong screws in the package. I had to contact the company and they sent me the correct ones. Then the cushion wore after 2-3 weeks of use. I had to go out and buy another cushion. The glider started creaking about 3 months in, now it pops, grinds, clicks, and creaks. It squeaks so loud that I can't even use it anymore to rock my child. And, just this week, the arm part broke off. Fantastic glider.WORST GLIDER EVER. DON'T BUY!!!!!My grandmother's glider from the 70's is so much better and is in perfect gliding condition. Spend the money and invest in a glider that will last a long time unlike this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for price!!","review":"The glider arrived within 2 days - even during the Christmas rush! When you open the box, there is some very MINOR assembly. All it takes is an allen wrench (which comes with the glider set). Just gotta tighten 6 screws and you're done. So far everything seems very sturdy and the glide is smooth. The cushions are nice - the ones on the arms have large pockets on the outside for storage. I haven't had it very long...so we'll see how it holds up. At the moment, I love it! I'm hoping my pregnant sister, for whom it was bought, will love it too.The only complaint I have so far: when we were putting it together, there were a few screws that did not seem to line up exactly with their pre-drilled holes. It makes me a little nervous. It was difficult to tighten the screws flush with the wood because things lined up off center.All in all though - I'm very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, affordable glider","review":"Just received our rocker today. I am 8 months pregnant and put it together myself. Comes about half assembled-just have to put the back, arm rests, and cushions on.

They are too short to fit over the arms and one of the rivets was placed too close to a vertical piece of frame to get the snap over it. How dumb is this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chair for the price","review":"The chair is exactly as pictured, good quality wood and nice upholstery in a pretty cream color. It is comfortable and glides really well. There was some squeaking, as others mentioned, but one shot of WD40 solved it, so that's not really an issue. It was easy to put together too. I gave it 4 stars because the cushions are already sagging slightly after just one week of use, so I am not sure how well they will hold up long term."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective part","review":"One of the screw parts was not drilled out correctly. There was no phone number as to how to get a replacement part. The chair is now super glued!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for the price","review":"I received this glider as a shower gift from friends and I have no complaints about it. We've had it about two months now and it's great! It matches the other baby furniture perfectly and works very well for our small house with very small rooms. The ottoman has started to get a little side to side wiggle, but I'm sure that will stop once we retighten some screws. I use the chair everyday and night for nursing and with a small pillow added for additional lumbar support, I frequently fall asleep in it. Compared to other more expensive models this one is just fine. I sat in a lot of gliders trying to decide on which one I liked and there were of course some pricier models that were more comfortable, but also some that were a lot less comfortable. The fabric is nice and very easy to clean (so far all stains have come out with only a damp rag). if you are a budget conscience person then this glider is perfect for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and Squeaks","review":"The look and design of this chair is great. However, after having the chair in use prior to our baby's arrival the wood started creaking and squeaking. This is the ultimate reason why we returned the chair. The chair is a tight squeeze for Dad at 6'1'' 220 lbs, but fits Mom nicely 5'2'' ~125 lbs. The seat cushion is very thin and firm and can cause numbness in the rear and legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Quality Issue","review":"One of the wooden piece that support the chairs glider broke off within a few weeks of purchase....

Other than the white color which I treated the fabric with scotch guard, we were happy. Flash forward to a month later. On the glider, both wood support pieces on the right side cracked. I don't know if we just got a lemon, but I won't be replacing this item with another one from the same company. I guess I will go with the I got what I paid for, and just invest in a better one next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Are Deceiving","review":"Chair came with a broken snap and was too much of a hassle to reship back to company, so we kept it for our new infant granddaughter for mommy to rock to sleep at night and comfort.

Would not recommend this to anyone else.The manufacturers should fix the spring so that it does not come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice for the budget conscious","review":"I think this is a great option for the budget conscious. It looks good, it's comfortable, and does the same Job that $1,000 chairs do. The only negatives are that sometimes mine squeaks so I'm gonna try some WD40 and hopefully that will help. Also, the seat cushion could be a little more plush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This chair and ottoman are very comfortable and were easy to set up.

The color of the wood is just like the picture. Cushions are very soft and easy to put on the chair. An overall great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Remi","review":"Great chair! Received it in the mail & it was packaged nicely. It was also very easy to assemble & came with a small tool to do so. We are very satisfied with this purchase & look forward to using it in the years to come. I am only giving it 4 stars because the ottoman seems useless to use while nursing since the gliding action created by using both at the same time will cause a odd movement. I had to purchase a foot stool to use with it instead. Also the space in between chair arms makes it impossible to use the boopy pillow. Also I would have perfered the cushions to be a different color, the off white seems like it would get very dirty very easy & hard to clean so I guess I will need to replace them soon after the wear starts to show. Overall a great purchase with some minor flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty but poor quality","review":"Was comfortable at first, but not for long sitting/nursing sessions. Not cushy enough. After a couple of months, it starting squeaking and my husband had to buy some wood glue to help hold one of the metal bars that holds the spring base in place as it popped out of its hole. We will see if that helps. Would never recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK..","review":"Wish I had believed the reviews that described the faulty construction of this glider chair. The seat pad is hard as a rock. There is the feeling that the chair will tip over. Totally unusable for the new mother for which it was purchased. TOO much trouble to rebox and return. We will sell it (at a loss) on CraigsList."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"We purchased this chair about 5 months ago. After about 1 month, the chair began to squeak each time I rocked our baby in it. So, we oiled the bearings. That lasted for a few days. We have tried to oil it many, many times. It still squeaks.Now, the wood of the chair is making cracking sounds as though it is going to break any minute! I'm very concerned as I rock our baby in this chair SEVERAL times a day.If I had sat in this chair at someone else's house, I would have expected that they paid at least HALF of what we paid for this chair.Wish I had listened to the other reviewers of this product.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glider","review":"We have been using this for the past month, Cherry and beige color. So far, very happy, and baby seems to like it. Its a lot more comfortable than I expected. My wife and I are not tall people, so the size of the chair is perfect for us. It shipped in a well packed box, the ottoman was already assembled. Chair assembly was very simple. My only gripe is that the seat cushion could use a 1/2 inch of more padding, but that's just a minor detail. Also the back of the chair was creaking for a while, but seems to have dissipated. For the price, you can't beat this glider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Chair that Breaks","review":"Bought this for my wife for our infant to rock during feedings and sleep times. We needed to add an extra pillow because there is no cushion comfort. The bearings broke in less than a year. I took this apart to fix the product and out of 8 bearings 2 were good. I kept the parts for spares and broke this chair with a sledgehammer and burnt it in the back yard. We bought another chair in the $200.00-$250.00 range. We did like the pockets on the sides of the arm rests. Easy assembly and fast shipping. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Breaks","review":"This chair looks nice but we have had nothing but issues with this chair.

It was sent to my parent's house where the showerwas being held so my Dad could put it together. Whoever sent it to us sent us a box that had been retaped shut and missing all the hardware. So the chair could be ready in time my 71 year old father had to go to the hardware store to buy missing parts and he even had to make some parts... Luckily his past career as an aerospace engineer/nutty professor made himqualified for this task. I think it would have beenvery difficult though for the average Joe. They have said the chair is very nice but had I known that the companysells used opened products as new ones I would have not ordered. I tried to report it through amazon but there was nothing I could do since I was not returning the product.It would be nice for them to send my Dad a check for $20 which he spent buying parts for what they should have provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"Its so simple to assemble this thing.

Looks nice and has a smooth, gliding motion. No squeaks. Bottom seat cushion has a small stain on it, even though it was sealed in plastic. Not sure why. Just turned that side down & it's fine. Chair actually arrived overnight. Maybe it was shipped through a local vendor? Overall, nice chair at a decent price with free shipping. Good deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice rocker for the price.","review":"I like the rocker although it is smaller than I had hoped and the pads are very thin. It looks expensive but once your in it you realize you got what you paid for. I will keep this rocker but if I had a choice I would have gotten something bigger and more comfortable. It was easy to put together, shipped/packaged wonderfully and cherry color is pretty. If your looking for a bargain chair to use occasionally this is it, if your looking for comfort, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I really like it. It was easy to assemble. Easy to clean. I spilt a glass of wine on it 1st night and it left no mark. (I didn't buy it for a nursery item, I just wanted a glider rocker and I didn't want to pay all outdoors for it). A month down the road it did develop a tiny squeak. (hence the 4 not 5 stars). Another downside is one of the cats like it so much I have to fight him for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but small","review":"This chair is very cute, sturdy, and well made. The only thing is it is a bit too tight I'm 5'5\\" and 160 lbs during pregnancy it felt a bit tight on the sides. After baby was born its comfy, but would go for a bigger size or different chair. Other wise great chair for the price. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This is a good quality set that is nice looking and doesn't look cheap at all. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the seat cushion. It's not the softest thing in the world, but it's not bad. The back cushion is very soft. In addition, assembly was very easy, 10-15 minutes tops. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"Worth the money, I read reviews and don't understand some of them. I am 6'1\\" 220 lbs and I have yet to crush or break this chair or even hear squeaks thus far. Wife loves it, cushion is not a plush couch like cushion but for a chair it's sufficient. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"My wife loves this glider. It is the perfect size we have it in the living room between two couches. There wasn't room for a full sized recliner. This was the perfect size and she is in it all the time. She keeps her knitting in the pockets and is in it all the time watching TV and knitting. Perfect and Amazon makes it easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I was quite nervous to get this chair but once we got it I have no regrets!

Also easy to put together too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice glider, great price","review":"This chair seems to be good quality, it feels nice and solid and has a smooth soothing motion. I put it together in about ten minutes by myself and I'm 8 months pregnant.

I'm glad I went with this model instead of one from Target or Babies r Us."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap cost, cheap value","review":"I returned this after using in for a few days. It was clearly cheap and could be felt in the cheap microfiber which was very scratchy and the cheap foam underneath that held the impression of your butt and feet in the cusions. Not impressed. It's worth spending a little more for more comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Glider!!","review":"After researching in different websites, this particular glider kept coming above the rest. We received it in a timely manner, as usual, from Amazon. My husband put it together in 30 minutes without help. I love this Hoop Glider! It's very comfortable along with the ottoman. I'm 34 weeks pregnant, so I haven't actually used it to comfort baby yet. The ONLY Negative point I can see for this chair is that it is kinda short, perfect for me since I am 5'2\\". However my husband is 5'9\\", so he'd be more comfortable with a headrest or taller chair.

Much to my dismay, the first step in the instructions did not go to plan! The backrest is to be screwed into the base of the chair, but the sleeve anchors were not installed in the pre-drilled holes, so they wouldn't bite to anything. The fix requires (2) 2\\" bolts with nuts, not elegant, but the only thing I can figure will work. I moved forward with attaching the arms to the back and screwing those into the base, but that required significant tweaking as the armrests were poorly assembled and did not line up with the holes. After that, it all came together fine and is comfortable, but the poor quality build is extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap (and looks so), easy to assemble, serves the purpose.","review":"Okay this product has been reviewed a lot. Its decent for the price we paid (around 130). It's came well packaged and is easy to assemble. Some of the parts are not very precisely manufactured and hence the arm covers and seat cover won't fit very well. It make a creaking noise sometimes and looks kind of cheap, especially the cushions. However, I didn't want to pay 500 at the baby store for some other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!","review":"I'm giving this 2 stars because it actually does work as a glider..This is a terrible glider.

The outdated photos, and lackluster drawings make it hard to really get into the book, and the very basic grammar and vocabulary can be taught in about a week without the need of 200 pages. For international students the huge focus on American currency (with outdated photos) and the steps for getting a job in the states is needless information for 99% of the students. The book is written for immigrants who are coming to live in the US and are not savvy with language education.

I was looking for a nutritional pellet that they would both like and decided to try the Rainbox Chunky. It has been their daily pellet for over 2 years now. They also get seeds and fresh fruit. They are such different size, it's been difficult to find common food for them, but this is the first thing I've tried that they both love. The macaw goes after the brighter colors, but the African gray just devours the whole bowl. I always say \\"they vote with their beaks\\" and my birds love this stuff! They go through about 2 pounds a month. I've had the birds for 12 years and have tried many pellets in the past. Many they wouldn't eat at all! I discovered the 20 lb bag online and have been ordering it this way since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car lover","review":"Ordered this for my husband as he's a classic car and Beach Boy fan.

Some of them really resonate but overall, it's not so special. While the content is adequate to interesting, you'd be better off tracking these down on YouTube, which is what it looks like the producers of this disk did. The image quality is so low-rez that the chunkiness and artifacts are really obvious on a TV screen or computer monitor.

I can keep the non-base headset in the shop at 100 ft and it works fine.The 5588 starts hissing and popping at the back door -- one floor under the headset. I can't make it 1/3 the distance of the older model. BY the time I get to the shop the phone quits.So instead of ditching my old 2.4, I've maxed out the recharge ability of both 2.4s. This is really irritating since the 2.4 kills my Wi-Fi connection and the 5.8 does not.Time to buy another phone set and since I can't count on Uniden, it will be a Panasonic. Both Unidens go into the garabge (after recycling the batteries)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw Kakurenbo at Otakon - Wow!","review":"I saw Kakurenbo as this year's Otakon. I was blown away. It's been compared to Voice of a Distant Star because of its length and both were made by small, indepedents, but Kakurenbo left an impression on my a lot longer than Voices. That's why I'm writing about it today. I just learned that it's coming to DVD and I can't wait. It has some of the most beautiful computer graphics I've seen and the story is scary and gripping. I was told at Otakon Kakurenbo won awards at the Fantasia Film Festival, Korean Cartoon and Animation Festival, and Tokyo Anime Fair (where it tied Ghost in the Shell 2). Kakurenbo was something I had never heard of until its screening but its something I still think about now. I can't wait for the DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"For a 25 miniute short film, I thought it was really good.

That is their view, my opinion for such a short film, I thought it was really good.

I first saw it on Adult Swim and was impressed by how the players never once took off the masks that enabled them to play hide and seek in the first place. All a person gets to see is an expressionless fox mask. For me, that allowed more empathy of the characters as you didnt have facial expressions to rely on.Some people say that the movie didnt move them, but when one of the kids is running for his life, you feel his emotions as he desperately tries to escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"Visually stunning, but at less than half an hour for the asking price?

The only complaint I have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a Super Nintendo. Besides that the game is awesome.The basic outline of the game is that you race the USA from California to Washington DC. Each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry. Once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries. Each time you complete the whole entire racee (California to D.C.) you will earn a faster car.So, all in all Crus n' USA is a pretty enjoyable game. Buy and enjoy.HAPPY GAMING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The suckiest racing game for N64....","review":"Don't let any of the good reviews fool you. I was one of the ones who bought the N64 new, and at the time Goldeneye and Cruisin USA were on everyone's mind. I bought Goldeneye and it was awsome.........as you already know \\"Cruisin\\" sucked. The graphics and control are pitiful. It's like the game was put out early to meet a deadline. The cars turn on a dime. (meaning that the slightest touch on the stick spins you off the road or into oncoming traffic ) I'm not even sure why I gave this game 1 star, oh well. On a better note, Cruisin World and Cruisin Exotica are excellent. It's like a totally different company released the two......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I'm pleased that I received this game quickly, it was like the description said, in a box & the sender even wrote on the outside \\"Amazona order ####\\" so I remembered when I got it in the mail that I ordered this package, since it was from an unrecognized address."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrealistic but AMAZING!","review":"I am simply writing a review my 14-year-old nephew Michael told me to write so what follows is not my own words....I remember playing this game when I was very young and I still had N64. It was to me a visceral experience unlike any other. I admit, the graphics and music are quite substandard, the locales are not modeled realistically, and the racing is very fantasy-like. But, still, years later, it all seems like a very enjoyable cross-country jaunt at high speed. Even with racing simulators that are much more realistic and are modeled authentically, Cruis'n USA is a game that holds its own and really has power under the hood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating game for the N64","review":"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out, some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system, I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier, this is an early title for the N64, you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games, ignore it if your looking for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This game was not even worth buying. In my opinion, Mario Kart 64 was much better than this game. It only has one racing mode with a few courses, and its multiplayer [isn't good]. It is easy to beat in the 1 player mode also. This game is not worth its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"The frame rate is not so good and the resolution is horrible. If you want a 5 star racing game try Beetle Adventure Racing."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like the arcade version","review":"I always enjoyed playing the arcade version of Cruis'n USA and I looked forward to playing it when I heard it was coming to the Nintendo 64. Even the first previews that I saw in Gamepro looked pretty good and loyal to the coin-op version. When I finally played it for the N64, I was bigtime disappointed. The graphics and sound are the only good parts about the game. The control is not the best and it's only fun for a few races. What I really didn't like about it is when someone crashes in front of you, you can get stuck behind them with nowhere to go. There is no reverse in this game, leaving you stuck behind a car in the middle of the road with no way to get around it. Cruis'n World is A LOT better than Cruis'n USA. I definitely wouldn't recommend getting this game. If you have to play it, just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but only for a little while","review":"It is fun to drive across the country once, to see all of the different courses and whatnot, but after that the difficulty levels and selection of cars offer little enjoyment.

Thegraphics[are not so great] and the gameplay is too easy and too short. I beat the whole thing in like 2 hours the first day I got it. It is nothing like the arcade version which I have played too. In my opinion, stay away from this one and go for the Sanfrancisco Rush games. Those are real games. Don't be mislead by the player's choice label. Alot of people thought this would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH ABOUT CRUISIN USA!","review":"First of all, I just want to say that for the [price] you pay for this game, it isn't worth a cent of that money! Second of all, the graphics are o.k., but just like olers racing games, it just isn't fun riding down the road, and it doesn't even look real! But, if you like racing games, don't let my review shy you away, because I don't like racing games, and maybe this is the game for you. But I never really got into the game myself. Now I'm going to tell you, if you don't like racing games, this game isn't going to change your mind!

The idea is cool, but it just makes it dumb because it has STUPID graphics. Now this is one of those games where you have basically NO control over your car, and speaking of cars, the cars are all stupid too.

Only 20 pages are devoted to issues directly related to the meniscus, woefully less than I had already found with a 'google search'. And so much is mainly padding. For example, in 'Additional Resources' it lists a web site for 'Hospice Care'. (If you are ready for a hospice than the knee is the least of your worries!) The vocularies are also padded. For example, do you really need definitions for 'stomach', 'oral', 'cadaver', etc.? Do you need info on how to find medical insurance, or advice about telling the doctor where it hurts? I didn't. And don't expect to find any books listed under the Chapter entitled, 'Books on injuries to the meniscus'. However, If you will be satisfied with the few truly useful websites listed, then buy this book.

In this story, we see what happens when Dick is old enough to chafe at being the \\"boy wonder\\" while discovering the man responsible for his parents' death. The interplay between Dick's struggling to be a man on his own and Bruce's unspoken paternal affection makes for a solid story.Unfortunately, this tape is not recorded in the SP mode.

It seems to have been crammed into the collection because it was published somewhere. Most of these stories I forgot after I read them; some I even forgot as I was reading them.

The holes on the side aren't big enough for treats or to easily clean. The dog doesn't like chewing on the blue piece by itself. She does like dragging the dirty, frayed rope around and tossing it into the air. Prior to pulling the rope out, she liked to fling the toy around by the rope; be careful, the blue part hurts when it hits you in the head or shin. I wouldn't buy this again.

The mystery doesn't feel redundant and I really love the continuations of Eve and Roarke's relationship. For me, one of the most important aspect of the book is how Eve slowly changes in the book and how she dealt with it. If she stayed the same woman from the first book, I would have gotten frustrated with her. Instead, she begins to blossom, painfully so, but that's to be expected. As for Roarke, wow, what a man. His vulnerability, his complete acceptance of Eve for who she is and his strong yet tender ways of dealing with her is really the best parts of the book. Finally, much needed humor scattered throughout the book really brings a wonderful balance to the rest of the story. I hope the rest of the books continues to be this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eve Dallas rocks","review":"Dallas & Roarke are hot, the action is fast paced, couldn't't put it down!

I want to devour the whole series as soon as possible as I want to find out what happens next. I also like the touch of the future in the story as well as the clues that you are to figure out as the story continues.JDR also develops the characters well so there are certain ones that you instant ly like as well as ones that you hate. I like how the clues for the story are intertwined with the base case.I also like the human touches that Roarke and Eve have while trying to mesh their lives. And the butler is a giant hoot! I recommend this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle backup to Dallas/Roarke family","review":"OK. I'm a sap for this series.

Eve Dallas is trying to solve another serial murder in New York in the year 2058. Her new romance with multi billionaire Irishman Roarke is tested when his name is linked with the victims.Roarke and Eve are very complex characters with a lot of issues from their past. The more you learn the more you love. This is another excellent book and once you finish it you will want to move on to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"JD Robb/Nora Roberts needs to learn how to write a mystery","review":"Just like NAKED IN DEATH and all the others in this series, it is really obvious who the killer is and what motivated them. When I am reading a real mystery I hardly ever guess who the killer is and certainly not what motivated them to kill. This writer needs to make a decision on what she wants to write. Romance or mystery. I certainly like romance in my stories, but she spends half the book on the relationship and gives us a very weak mystery plot because of it. Also, the average mystery writer writes 1-2 books a year, but Ms. Roberts writes 7-8 per year. In my book that makes her a hack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book in the series.","review":"I have read the first book in the series \\"Naked In Death\\", and now have read the second, \\"Glory In Death\\". I found \\"Glory\\" to be just as good as I found \\"Naked\\" to be. Filled with deep characters, fast moving cases, and an interesting sci-fi futuristic backdrop, this series is a winner.Like some reviewers have already stated, this is a mix of Police Procedural, Romance, and Science Fiction all bundled up into one great series.Each book you learn more and more about the main characters, and can watch their relationships grow.I definitely plan on reading all of this series.I would start with book one and move on from there. That's what I'm doing.Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"I love this entire series!!! Kudos to The author. Its not to futuristic where you must spend time trying to figure out new wave lingo.

Eve Dallas with her strong personality, Peabody with her yes, sir / no, sir; and Rourke with his Scottish brough. Once you start listening to it, it's very hard to stop. To be able to visually see what the narrator was saying and with the different voices you could definitley tell who was talking. The quality is excellent, at least on the CD version. Even with the price of audiobooks this one was well worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"The second book in J.D. Robb's \\"...IN DEATH\\" series, followingNaked in Death (In Death), is another winner. The thing I love the most about this series, besides the awesome, fully-developed characters, is the fact that the mystery is ALWAYS thrilling and realistic.This time around, popular, well-known, outspoken women are being murdered - their throats viciously slashed. As Eve works to discover the true killer, she also finds family secrets, devious reporters, and new friends in strange places.GLORY IN DEATH features the first appearance of Peabody, a larger role for Nadine Furst, and the first glimpse into what Eve's childhood really entailed.I'm absolutely LOVING rediscovering my favorite romantic suspense series of all time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too pleasing","review":"This was used as our primary text book for two semesters of programming. Overall, it was relatively disappointing. The text is a good introductory text, as the reader progresses through the book, harder concepts become poorly explained. For example, his explanation on Object Oriented Programming is subpar. He relies more on definitions and less in explaining them, making abstracting OOP concepts more difficult. If you're new to C++ and have no background in programming, I would recommend this book up and until OOP, for that pick up another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table not as High as Advertised","review":"This TV Tray Table was advertised as 24 inches high, but was only 22.

I ordered her book and was delighted to see that it was filled with projects that not only taught me how to cheaply make my chair look like new again, but also gave me inspiration to make my curtains look new, redo my old throw pillows and dress up my lampshades.If you like to redecorate often, this is a must-have book because it's all about redoing what you already have or how to buy affordable objects and room accessories and make them look unique and expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"original ideas","review":"i found many new uses for simple materials such as leaves, shells,dried flowers, embroidery and even pebbles. the use of ribbons and braided trim was beautiful and modern looking. i have never used a glue gun before, but i just bought two. i intend to email the author -- she printed her email address in the front of the book so that readers can share project information and ask questions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goo-gah galore and not much more","review":"Nothing but how to over-decorate curb-side finds with glued on cutouts, thingys, and other junk.

Nothing new. The author shows many pictures of great looking furniture but in some of the more exotic pieces she doesn't share how she came about completing the project. I was not impressed by this book at all, especially with the knowledge that she has outside vendors cover her furniture and then she adds the trim to embelish a white cotton fabric.

I was craving to get away from the 'innocent virgin' genre and this fit the bill.I liked the chemistry between the protagonists, hate at first sight is a big 'yawn' but this was written in a tolerable way. If you are looking for Stephanie Laurens type bedroom scnese, don't hold your breath as this book is surprisingly conservative in that vein.The main characters were credible, the supporting characters I also liked and they are more fleshed out than in most books. All in all a great diversion for a Saturday afternoon when you are sick in bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first book.","review":"I picked this book up by chance one day. I've never read any of her books before, and I was pleasantly surprised, and pleased with this book. Lawless Lily as she was known to men and all of England was a rebel,who shocked her society with her wild ways. She gambled and took dangerous risks. She was bound and deterimed to stop her sister Penny from marrying Lord Alex Raiford a powerful and rich man. Alex on the otherhand thought Lily was a fascinating woman to him, and he was determined to tame her and bend her to his will. There was a lot more to Lily that really made her endearing to me and to find out you will just have to read the book. The side characters were also excellently portrayed, just all-around fun read.

What I particularly liked was the fiesty, distrusting heroine who is finally won over by the decent hero; Lily and Alex start out disliking each other, and the tension between them fairly crackles. Furthermore, Lily has a few flaws and has made a few mistakes, which makes her much more believable and human. The fast-moving plot keeps the reader engaged, and the ending is very satisfying.Well done, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best yet","review":"I've never read a book by Lisa Kleypas before but when i read this book i knew i found an author that i would love to read. This book was amazing. i loved all the characters especially Derek. I can't wait to read his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroine Was Completely Annoying","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. My main problem with the book was Lilly, the heroine. She was so reckless that I just couldn't relate to or sympathize with her. Also, many parts of the plot were unrealistic. For example, after a long estrangement with her family, they forgive her at the doorstep of their rich future son-in-law. Her mother is described as a social climber, yet she doesn't seem to care that Lilly's reckless and scandalous behaviour may taint their younger daughter and jeopardize her ability to marry the rich aristocrat. They just accept her into the fold weeks before Lilly's sister's wedding. It was also hard to believe that society would so easily accept Lilly after learning about her child out of wedlock and her purported liason with Derek Craven.The only positive part of the book was Derek Craven. After reading this book, I wanted to read more about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Then Came You","review":"I cannot believe these reviews. I bought this book because of them, I was a little more than disappointed. I love a tortured hero. THe plot had alot of possiblitlies. It was simply the writing. Absolutely elementary level.

That was truly an accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barrel scraping","review":"I gave this book one star only because there was no option for giving it zero. By page 83 I hated it but I kept plowing on hoping the book would redeem itself eventually. At page 151 it went into the garbage. Why do so few authors know how to create a heroine who is assertive without falling into a morass of obnoxious? She's supposed to be spirited not an overweening shrew. The reader should admire her not want to pour her into a pair of cement overshoes and dump her worthless fanny, regardless of how attractive, into the Thames. Lily Lawson is not a sympathetic character; she's a harridan. No more Lisa Kleypas for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely, Not 1 of Ms. Kleypas's Best!","review":"Some of Ms. Kleypas's books R written very beautifully & relatebly, but sadly, this just isn't 1 of them...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I'm reading this book right now - I'm about 2/3 done.

Lily is witty, passionate, and endearing, and Alex?

Oh and great sexual tension and lovescenes, too. Lisa Kleypas is amazing, I've just become a fan for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book...","review":"Alex is a great endearing hero, honorable and loving. Lily is a very interesting heroine and went through a great deal. The care and patience Alex has for Lily is so sweet, and it's very satisfying to watch Lily grow into the role of a loving wife. I don't know what people mean in saying the first half of the book was boring, it was the best part! There were some hilariously angry scenes between Lily and Alex when they first meet, and the adorable Henry (Alex's little brother) adds a great touch. It's a remarkable show of Kleypas' skills that despite the very implausible plot twists (easy acceptance of Lily by her parents, her scandalous behaviors, and society's attitude about it) that I happily went along with it: it's clear Kleypas is focused on the emotional plausibility of the relationship. A really great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful story","review":"I just regret that I waited so long to read this book. This was such a treat. I didn't want it to end.

This album is solid from start to finish. Taj Weekes has a soothing vocal style and incredible writing throughout the album. The musical arrangements hold up the integrity of the messages and find their way to your spirit in no time.The track 'MPLA', about Taj's late older brother, has an invigorating tempo and is very inspirational. 'Life' (my favorite track) has that classic hard hitting reggae sound with lyrics to get you out of your seat.There are no short-comings present in the album's 10 tracks and in all honesty, I wish there were more albums like this. Rather than flooding it with fillers to make a long patchy record, they provided nothing but quality songs worthy of keeping on repeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing collection","review":"I read this book a few years back, and gave it to a friend. I just came on here to look for a new copy to read again, to see if it still affected me as it did several years ago, now that I am further removed from the college experience.

It captured perfectly the state of being neither college student nor professional, not knowing where your life was going, but knowing that you had outgrown your previous life."},{"rating":"1","title":"but why?","review":"I'm left wondering why. Why put these stories together when there's no point to them, no sense of intention? Why is the main character so 2-dimensional?

The author says straight up on the second page of this book that this book will not help you if you want to move to Maui or any other Hawaii'an island for that matter. However, from reading the cover, it says nothing about referring to 'Hawaii'' as the Big Island of Hawaii. It just refers to 'Hawaii.' Annoying.

Yes, the Big Island has had a real estate \\"boom\\" in the past couple of years, but there are still some really good deals (I am in California so I should know!). I think my favorite message the book offers is about abandoning the mainland stressed-out attitude and embracing the spirit of aloha in this beautiful place.

What can be better than \\"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, thats amore.\\" Dean Martin has a rich romantic voice. I think he is much better than Frank Sinatra. The only bad cut on this CD is the 1st one which is a folksy Kingston Trio type number that doesn't fit with Martin's voice but it is easy to skip that track. The rest is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean Martin CD (used)","review":"Unfortunately the CD must have been defective because it was unplayable.

This cd serves as a fine introduction for new fans of the Dean as well as a nifty collection of hits for longtime enthusiasts. While the song selection is srong, I would have liked to have seen Until The Real Thing Comes Along, Just In Time, Ain't That A Kick In The Head and Canadian Sunset included here as well, as these are among Dino's all-time best.Regardless, this is an excellent compilation and a terrific reminder of why this performer remains so well-loved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed the devil may care attitude -the best voice","review":"I grew up listening to Dino and he's the first man besides my Dad that I was in love with....The Dean Martin show and the Golddiggers were a part of our life...

It's roughly the same as his other \\"hits\\" discs. \\"That's Amore\\", \\"Return to Me\\", and \\"You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You\\" are all on here, as well as nine others. The first half of this is classic Dean. It's such a refreshing thing to put on after listening to alot of the junk on the radio. I would say if there's one thing you need with your next martini, it's this cd. It will go great with your \\"Frank\\" and \\"Tony\\" cd's too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dino sure could croon","review":"yes, this is a \\"budget\\" CD, but there are some great selections here. This CD features Dino \\"crooning\\" as opposed to \\"swinging\\". For that I would suggest you pick up a copy of \\"Swinging With Dino\\", which has more big band type arrangments to accompany him. But this one has songs like \\"That's Amore\\", \\"Volare\\", \\"Sway\\", and \\"Standing On The Corner\\". If you get both of them, I think you will have a good overview of his music, the only cut on both of them is \\"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\\".

I read the previous reviews and I just wonder how many books of this kind they have seen because this one is average at best.

I normally go through a bottle a month. When I saw this 8 ounce bottle I thought I'd found a great way to save money......I was wrong. And that's because Natrol significantly dilutes the Melatonin. Their recommended dose is 400% larger than other packages because its mostly water. I found that dose wasn't sufficient and it took about 5 sleepless nights to get the right dose, which is roughly 30 mL. Normally I need 2 mL.This company has made the worst kind of mistake; they think their customers are stupid and mathematically challenged. They'd make more money by making a superior product with better packaging. Instead, they've made the worst kind of cynical decision: they pretend their product is more when actually it is less.I'll finish my bottle of their junk and then I'll never buy from them again. And that means ANY product they manufacture. Goodbye Natrol!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware ingredients!","review":"Ethyl alcohol is the second ingredient on the bottle, and it tastes like you are drinking rubbing alcohol.

Ever heard of people giving their kids Nyquil...cough syrup, etc to make them sleep. I for one do not want to give alcohol in any form to my little girl, so the bottle went into the drawer for me or my husband to use ourselves if we ever have trouble sleeping. Beware because this did not show up on the description online. I do see that lots of parents that are using this and praising it highly, have children with conditions such as autism...I am not judging them at all, it is hard enough dealing with a \\"normal\\" child who has trouble sleeping...I cannot imagine what they go through and God Bless anything that helps out even a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleep enemy for babies","review":"Well I should have listened to my Mom and not give this to my baby.

Issued in 1947, the encyclical focuses on the preservation and nature of the liturgy - including the mass, the hours, devotionals and sacraments. Interestingly, many of the examples used by Pius XII in the encyclical, such as going to a \\"primative\\" original eucharistic celebration, the return to the \\"table\\" style altar, elimination of Gregorian chant, the use of the vernacular and similar items were, within 20 years, adopted by the Church as part of the Vatican II reforms.

This album is a whole other kind of beast. Ayers and band do lay down the funk, but without electric instruments and effects that can actually overpower the musical element. Hancock always comes through with strong solos and Ayers' improvisation on \\"Wave\\" is nothing short of ecstacy. If anything, it suffers from songs that are a little too long and a disk that is way too short. Lush orchestration and top-notch musicianship are the staples that make this LP a solid effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL","review":"If you love the vibes, then you'll love this cd.

So a couple of the tracks \\"What the people say\\"(8.09) and \\"Wave\\"(7.59) are overlong. A couple of the compositions are weak- \\"A rose for Cindy\\" is not classic Ayers, and \\"Lil's paradise\\" was probably included because composer Charles Tolliver is the trumpet/flugel on the session.Somehow the presence of Herbie Hancock on piano,and Hubert Laws on flute doesn't save the session. There IS some good ensemble playing but the whole album is uneven and not representative of what Roy Ayers went on to do later."},{"rating":"2","title":"This soundtrack is one of the best ever made!","review":"I love this sound track.

Unfortunately, when I picked up the mat to wash the tub, the underside of the mat was covered in black and green mold that I wasn't able to wash off, even in the washing machine.

I'd say it's a self-help book for those of us experimenting with traditional media in a digital world.In the universe of the digital revolution we find ourselves sometimes flying without a net. The author does a great job of providing some security. Each essay brings the reader close to the real process of composition - using examples of music, art and design from some of the pioneers of electronic media, coupled with his own real-world experiences.The essays are historical, educational, inspirational and just plain fun recollections and viewpoints. A good read for \\"budding\\" digital-revolution musicians, artists and designers, as well as seasoned veterans looking to expand their craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fun parenting book!","review":"I loved this book!

Thanks Linda!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief overview of the tyrant Hitler","review":"First of all this is a childrens book.I read the entire thing in a few hours and thought it was a very concise and informative account of the life of Hitler. It starts with his childhood and youth, then in only a few short chapters it moves on to his education and young adult life. Then it reveals the politacal history and shows the dark side of the man and what he did. Shrirer is one of my favorite historians, and although not always completely accurate (I have not found or heard that he made up material, just had some wrong facts) he is an incredible author with an amazing ability to paint a picture. This book is no exception to that. The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler outlines, in words that are easy to understand, the story of Hitler.It is not overbearing and will not frighten the reader with the gore and hate that it could have had, but it does make you think about the evilness of Hitler.A good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit bottle","review":"We bought this product because we're supplementing breast feedings with bottle feedings at night.

We were travelling and thought this will be a good idea that I do not have to carry so many baby bottles and clean and sterilize them.The Slow Flow Silicone Nipple was way too slow, my 3 month old was frustrated and crying. She slept and didnt finish her formula which she normally does. She uses a no.1 nipple of Avent bottles which is comparable to slow flow so I thought I should get her a slow flow nipple of playtex as well. I tried sucking water from it and I myself can not get anything from the bottle.Now, I just purchased a Playtex Fast Flow latex nipple. I will review this nipple as soon as my baby tries on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow","review":"We had some Medela bottles and slow-flow nipples, and we were looking for extra ones that have similar flow rate and fit in the Playtex bottles that we already have. These fit well on the drop-in bottles, no leak so far. My son has no problem to switch from Medela nipples to these. However, the flow seems to be much slower than Medela slow-flow, so my son took longer time to drink the same amount of milk. At the end, he just felt so tired that he didn't finish the milk. I would recommend the medium flow from Playtex to use with the Medela slow-flow nipples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow!","review":"Finding the right Playtex nipples has been like a Goldilocks and the Three Bears experience for me. The latex Playtex slow flow NaturaLatch nipples that we got with our bottles were way too fast. My nearly 3 month old baby chokes because the milk flows so fast. When super hungry he can chug a 4 1/2 oz bottle in 5 minutes with the slow flow latex version. So I tried these silicone NaturaLatch slow flows and they are way too slow. My baby gets frustrated with how slow these nipples flow. It took him up to an hour sometimes to finish a 4 1/2 oz bottle! There needs to be some middle ground. Since these slow flow silicone nipples were too slow, I tried the medium flow version and it was way too fast. Strangely enough I found that the Playtex Orthodontic Latex medium flow is the perfect flow speed, but the shape of the nipple makes it difficult for my baby to get those last drops. Playtex needs to work on improving the nipple flows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but frustrating","review":"Ello is fun but the figures I make don't stay together, the head pieces fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry ello, Just not good,","review":"Hi, I am 8.

Either way this mix blows #1 out of the water!It's darker, harder, and nastier than the first. It has a more clubby feel than the europopness of the first, as well.One track in particular seemed almost devilish in it's chipperness. Carolina Marquez - The Killer's Song features the infamous dirge whistled by Daryl Hannah in Kill Bill V.1. Not only is it delivered over a fiercely shady dance beat, but Carolina's vocals and accent are seedy at best, and it makes me shiver to think about just how much I love the song.Another standout track is The Lovefreekz. The song is pounding, high energy, and very...positive. The lighter happier side of dark dance. I loved the song on Ultra Dance 6, and I love it here.All around, this compilation kicks boot-ay! The same boot-ay you'll be shaking after you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because you can....","review":"Listening to this mix of \\"All This Time\\" reminds me of the old days with the trusty AM radio trying to make out a tune from a distant station with atmospheric interferences.There are all kinds of reasons to remix songs, but generally you'd think the aim would be to improve them somehow. The incoherent racket inserted into these selections has done nothing but make them all but impossible to endure. I guess it shows that just because you can mix doesn't mean you should. And just because you do doesn't mean you have the talent to do so successfully.This CD gives its proud owner not the chore of choosing which selection is best, but which one is least lousy. This CD stinks to high heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"... gives real techno a bad name.","review":"When I bouth this CD I was under the impression that it was going to be techno.

Out of those emerging and highly influential bands (Tanner, Heavy Vegetable, Three Mile Pilot, Drive Like Jehu, etc.) Boilermaker was easily one of the most under-rated bands in independent rock today. In Wallace's Shadow, Boilermaker's second album proves once again why Boilermaker gave inspiration and influence to bands such as Jimmy Eat World and many bands that came to follow.This album was released on Goldenrod Record in 1996 and is no longer being pressed.

The writing is so bad that I could not understand what was going on. And, after a couple of pages, I didn't care. This so-called \\"novel\\" is nearly all dialogue which is not necessarily a criticism, but the characters in JR are so pretentious and boring that having to put up with their blather is like being trapped at the bottom of the ocean in that jumbo jet from AIRPORT '77 with a cabin full of literary critics. If you absolutely must torture yourself with a chatty novel full of bad dialogue, I recommend Thomas Pynchon's MASON & DIXON. At least that bloated masterpiece features talking clocks and giant vegetables"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicious and funny","review":"The man has a perfect ear for talk. The catch is, it's talk of the stupidest, most insipid kind, betraying in its every word the breakdown of community between men and women that Gaddis sees.Everything wrong with mainstream American society is exposed: the pomposity of the law, the vapidity of the educational system, and above all the corrupting and distancing power of money. And his characters do their best to cope, but it isn't enough.Not against this 700+ page verbal monstrosity of continual patter that reads like a distillation of every journalist, TV news anchor, Hollywood celebrity, high school cheerleader, politician, scientist, lawyer, doctor, CEO, and fool in the land.This book may be the most exhausting ever written by an American author. Nonetheless it is continually and nervously funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most sloppy book I have ever seen","review":"Other than copying and pasting from various Web sites, no attempt was made to structure the material or coordinate its flow in different chapters.

However, the field is moving quickly and things are changing ...with an abundance of data on the Ashkenazi and Icelandic ... which relates them back to Central Asia and the founders of the Aryan founders of the Indus Valley Civilizations.

As a member of a TPT that recently returned from a Bosnia deployment, I can tell you that we are far from the leaflet droppers and loudspeaker users that some would portray us as. We are involved in deception operations and surrender appeals that are very much in harm's way. Other than that, I really enjoyed the chapters on our Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Operations comrades.

We waited until she was back to normal, then tried again, just in case it was something else the previous time. Nope. She had problems once again.Then I decided that I would take them, to use them up. A multi-vitamin is good for everyone, right? Ha. First time I took them, I took it with a glass of water. I was sick to my stomach for 30min afterwards. The time after I made sure to take one with a big breakfast.

This is my first day wearing them and I haven't felt in any way compelled to take them off. They're extremely broken-in already. I wear a 10.5 D with flat feet, and these things fit like isotoner gloves.I bought them for the style and thought it was worth the risk if they didn't fit well. I was wrong, comfort has far exceeded those expectations I was reserving for style. The photographs do much to flatter these shoes, their finish is a lot flatter than I expected, but everything is as old-school as anticipated. Beyond that? A+ I feel good, I have a comfortable shoe that looks good and I don't have to be a label-whore about it. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it broke","review":"We purchased this vacuum cleaner in November 2006. We previuosly had a Kenmore canister that broke after 5 years. We loved the way the Bosch worked, the quietness and the ease of vacuuming. Our house has mostly hardwood floors & tile and the only carpeting is on our stairs and bedrooms. The vacuum is only used once a week. It lasted 6 months. That's when the fun began. Their customer service is lousy. There is only one service center in California. I live in San Diego and the service center is 600 miles away in SF. In addition, Bosch requires you to mail the vacuum cleaner at your own expense even though it is under warranty. This will be the last product I buy from this manufacturer. I expected more from them especially in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy piece of junk","review":"The first day we got this vacuum, my son broke one of the plastic pieces trying to change the attachments. Shame on us, we shouldn't have let him mess with it, but still we were amazed at how easily it broke. Fortunately, Costco was happy to exchange it for a new one. A few months later, I was adjusting the telescoping wand, when the same plastic piece broke! How could a vacuum so expensive have such flimsy plastic parts? Also, as other reviewers have noted, the attachment door opens all the time, the cord is too short, and it's really inconvenient not having the on/off on the handle. The suction is decent, but who cares if the thing falls apart?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is the second time this vacuum has broken. Who has the time to keep packing it up and sending it back. It is too light weight and flip over all the time. The cord is too short.

The bags are too small and the hose twists all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay performance but cheap plastic parts","review":"Bought a vacuum just over a year ago. Was used maybe 60 times and the power head brush stopped spinning. Opened the part and plastic gear wheel has a split in it and drags to the side of its casing.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and Flimsy","review":"I have used the Bosch Vacuum for over a year and would not buy it again. I am not sure what I would buy because I have tried several brands and they all suffer from flimsy construction.The good things are it does a good job cleaning both carpet and hard wood floors. It has good suction and does appear to trap the dirt in the filter system.But, here are the shortfalls:Both the hose and cord a very short. It is best suited to a small apartment or condo.The tools are tiny. They look like they come from a child's toy vacuum set and work just about as well.The biggest problem is the flimsy construction. The vacuum head has come off and the conduit covering the cord whichsupplies power to the vacuum head has come off. It uses two sided tape to stick which is ridiculous.I am afraid I will be forced to replace the Bosch soon. With its high price, it is just a poor value."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor craftmanship","review":"I loved this vacuum until it started to fall apart. It began with the very short cord getting stuck and then frayed. That was wrapped with electrical tape. Then the hose tore at the point of entry to the canister. Again we used electrical tape to hold it together. Finally, the hose tore at the other end and out comes the electrical tape again. Instead of a 2 year vacuum, it looks like a 10 year vacuum. It also flips over easily and the attachments fall out and we lost one. Soo, I guess the moral of the story is don't get a Bosch vacuum!! Also, it was overpriced for the quality and forget about the service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"After reading the reviews on this vacume on this and other sites I felt confident in purchasing it. However, this is the worst vacume I have ever used in my life! It is way, way, overpriced for what it will do and what you get. I took it back to the store the same day it arrived. I had already packed it up when my husband got home from work but he didn't believe me, so we unpacked it again and he tried it. It was so bad we just sat and laughed. I wouldn't take this vacume if someone gave it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"best for smaller homes","review":"This vacuum is ultra, ultra quiet, great suction power, very lightweight, nice exterior design, and the powerhead has a low profile so it can get under furniture. The minuses are the power cord is short, the hose tends to kink up and cause the suction to cut off and you get that high pitched scream, the hose is also too short to reach the top of curtains, and the crevice accessory is too short to get into crevices like frig coils. With a few design changes it would be the perfect canister vacuum. In the meanwhile, it's a well-made vacuum for a smaller home with low windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but...","review":"It is light weight, has good suction but as a canister it is lacking. The hose is too short, the handle is awkward to use and there is no extension pipe to use with the handle to reach things over shoulder high. We use an upright for the floors and a canister to dusting and hard to get at places. This product does not work for us which is a shame since it was so expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"who knew baths would be so interesting?","review":"I went to hear her speak in New York and was amazed with how passionate she was about baths and bathing cultures.

The cartoons and drawings of the characters are poor, no artistic talent was put into the creation of this series. The books also feature the same poor art work as well, so again nothing special at all. Also one has to think and 'believe' the creators of 'witch' somewhat copied the whole concept otherwise, the girl 'will' looks and is alot like 'Willow' from Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and this will is a poor copy of something that is great, that being Buffy The Vampire Slayer series, which is maybe too much for children, who enjoy cartoons, so for them and for their parents, I would suggest strongly, against this poor talent stuff, and go with something much better, like The Winx Club.~Amy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Judy fans","review":"yes of course you can hear the flaws in this CD but that does not take away for Judy these have been some of my favorite songs since i first had the Cassette tape in 1990.I just bought the CD again and will always love Judy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality!","review":"When I first played this CD, I was very disappointed at the sound quality, which sounded very hissy, and destroyed the sheer beauty of Judy Garland's voice.

There are no known recordings of his days playing with Coltrane.... but this early work is in some ways his best. It burns with the flames of youth and inspiration, and all the players interact at an incredibly high level. None of them found such \\"stardom\\" that their talents by rights should have earned them, which says more about marketing, narrowmindedness, and the pathetic need to be cool (followers) of the jazz audience, than it does about music.But this music shines brightly, 37 years on, and perhaps there are now ears to hear it, after the soporific Geo. Winston, and the solipsistic K. Jarrett (and their marketers) have persuaded audiences to sit still and listen for those overtones that hover above a properly maintained piano in the hands of a competent pianist on a good night.And Steve Kuhn is way more than competent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible construction","review":"I used it clamped to a shelf. Don't. The stress on the molded plasic prong that keeps it in the holder is too great, and it will break if you use the lamp pulled forward and down. I know. I've broken two.

The hinge is completely scratched, the box was full of dust and dirt, and there are scratches on the lamp base as well. Also - be careful when moving the base. Since the lamp arms don't swivel, you have to move the base to turn the lamp. Unfortunately something on the base ended up making big scratch marks on my desk, so make sure to put something under it.

She seems mildly interested in it despite the fact that the \\"paint\\" is some kind of very hard substance and doesn't come off on the sponges so making the fun pictures is difficult unless you're very persistent and have the PERFECT amount of water in your sponge. Also, many of the sponges are too big for the circles of paint provided so its hard to use those particular ones for your picture. It does come with a cute apron which she loves to wear but I wouldn't recommend this as a sponge painting toy. You just end up making a big watery mess on a piece of paper but don't get the satisfaction of actually painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Equiptment Needed","review":"I guess I should have read into this one a little further before buying. Apparently, you need to have a Barry's Bootcamp ball and some resistance bands. I have a regular stability ball but Barry's is almost like a 'canister' or 'tube' shape so a normal ball won't work. (In one of the first work out scenes they lay on ball on their backs with the resistance tube underneath for chest presses)It looked to be a pretty good workout but I honestly didn't get too far into it for lack of proper equiptment. :(I looked on amazon to see how much one of his balls were and was disappointed to see that they were $40-$50.

The mystery kept me thinking I knew the answer, but had all the right twists and turns to keep me guessing right to the very end.

It does include the history of the profession of architecture but is missing some of the important definitions of the times, such as \\"carpenter.\\" It gives credit to the buildings, but misquotes the names of the architects in some cases (no \\"John M.\\" or \\"Morrill John\\" Curtis exists as an architect in Nevada, for example). Even a few mistakes such as this cause the reader to question the validity of other information. (My advice to authors: if you do not know, then don't guess and certainly don't put it in writing! Check primary sources!).Overall, the book is worthwhile and a boon to historians with its pictures of old buildings inside and outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's charm is immediate.","review":"Idlewild's pop-driven rock shines with a crystal clear quality while still retaining that rough edge. This album takes no getting used to at all, it's charm is very immediate. This Scottish band churns out rock with a raw pop injection. Vocalist Roddy Woomble sounds like a young Michael Stipe but the R.E.M. comparisons don't end there. His bandmates harmonise with him on some of the choruses (such as \\"Mistake Pagent\\", one of my favourites incidently) in a way Mike Mills did with Stipe all those years ago. \\"I Don't Have The Map\\" and \\"Roseability\\" are very catchy although I still do not know who Gertrude Stein is, and just why she warrants a pop song. There's a youthful enthusiasm and energy going on here that's hard to deny."},{"rating":"2","title":"For once an album that is worth every penny and then some","review":"I don't write alot of reviews and I don't give out 5 stars easily but this cd is easily a 5. Each song is unique in itself yet they all jell together. Each song is one you will be hearing in your head for days and be glad you do. There are no duds or fillers in this album. The more you listen to this album the better it gets. That this band isn't huge in the U.S. is a shame because so many miss out on such wonderful music. Don't be one of those that miss out. Buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"technically good, BUT!","review":"I've only bought this cd (100 broken windows)from the idlewild albums, mainly because it was on special offer. I'm really into similar groups such as placebo, jj72, counting crows etc. Idlewild's new cd has great backing, although completely un-original, basically on a technical level, it has been done better by other contemporary groups such as the ones above. I was really disappointed after about 10 seconds of putting the cd on. The vocals are clumsy, superficial and too husky for the pitch of the backing. Moreover, apart from the excuse of having a severe cold and really trying to sing cordially (but failing), this has to be the most misjudged release of this genre this year. My advice is stick to the bands who do it best - if this is the best idlewild has to offer, their cd will be demoted from coaster to pooper scooper. DON'T BUY THIS ITS POSSIBLY THE WORST OF ITS GENRE THIS YEAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Idlewild just get better and better","review":"I wouldn't say that I've been the most avid Idlewild fan over the years, I've listened to their album \\"Hope Is Important\\" many a time and have really enjoyed it, their punkiness mixed with subtleties made them really interesting to listen to. However, with \\"100 Broken Windows\\", this could be the turning point where I become a totally obsessed fan. They seem to have taken a long hard look at \\"H.I.I\\" and chosen exactly what was good about the album and multiplied it by 20. There's melodies everywhere on this album, especially on \\"Idea Track\\", \\"Roseability\\" and \\"Actually It's Darkness\\", alongside punky, fuzz driven guitars (especially \\"Little Discourage\\" and \\"Rusty\\").Basically if I could give this album a better score then I would, it really is amazing. It's just a shame that at the time of writing this there aren't any clips available for you to check out for yourselves. Just go check it out, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic, distinctive Rock music!","review":"This one sent shivers down my spine the first time I heard it. After listening to tons and tons of music over the years, it's rare that something immediately affects me like that. It reminds me of the very first time I heard U2's Boy, many years ago. Idlewild carries that kind of excitement with this release. Some songs are stronger than others, but when Idlewild is at their best, with tracks like Little Discourage and Actually It's Darkness, it's difficult to find any other new rock music that sounds as dynamic or passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"best single of the last 5 years","review":"I don't mean to discredit the rest of the album but the song Idea Track has got to be one of the best feel-good-radio-pop songs of all time. You know, lik the Pixies' Here Comes Your Man and Head On by Jesus & Mary Chain??? Yeah. You'll bop your head to it in the car, you'll play it for all friends, everybody will think you're cool and they'll all want you to copy the cd for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically GOOD but nothing!","review":"I bought this album over year ago and this is definitely a very good album. The vocals may not be to everyone's taste and they may not be the best musicians that you've ever heard, but to me, that is the quirk of Idlewild. If you're into refined music, then this is not for you. If you want you're music mad, then this is it! DO BUY THIS AS IT IS POSSIBLY THE BEST OF ITS GENRE THIS YEAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful R.E.M/Blur hybrid - 4 1/2 stars","review":"Saw all kinds of good reviews on this one, so I downloaded 4 songs; really liked them and immediately picked up the CD really cheap at the store. Yes,it does sound somewhat like Michael Stipe fronting Blur, but that just adds to the music. Idlewild does show their influences, but add their own attitude andsharp hooks to the songs. The whole CD is fairly consistent, with \\"LittleDiscouarge\\", \\"Roseability\\", \\"Let Me Sleep (Next to the Mirror)\\" and \\"Listen to What You've Got\\" ranking high on the car stereo crank-up meter. The only minus with this CD is the lyrics get repetitious at times, but the music itself more than compensates. If you like early R.E.M., late-period Blur, Sebadoh or just need an antidote to the awful corporate pop or lame rap/rock scene, then by all means pick up this album and crank it up!

I don't even like R.E.M. Michael Stipe sounds like a goat, and so does this guy. I do like the actual music though. That's why it got two stars. I don't know. If you like R.E.M., then get this. You'll like it. But it almost sounds like he's TRYING to sound like Michael Stipe. For some reason, this makes me want to wash a car on an autumn day. This is car washin' music.

Although it never reaches the same heights of the previous lp, it is nonetheless more suited to repeat listenings. Autrex voix, autrex blues has a wonderfully consistent and smooth flow to it to maintain a sense of all-pervading calm throughout its duration. The music feels so effortless that the album ends before you really know it's even begun. Nevertheless, there's enough going on here (even some disco grooves on the third track) to keep the album from getting boring. In general, if you enjoy the final third of K&D's DJ Kicks set (e.g., the more relaxed, slower selections) or Nightmares on Wax's 'Carboot Soul', you should really enjoy this set of well-composed mellow, syrupy beats and vocal samples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiskeytown/Ryan Adams early album","review":"The first Ryan Adams Alt county album.

The historical detail is TOO painstakingly laid before us and the mystery disappears under the explanations of the intricate politics involved. This would still be forgivable if the novel delivered a good climax and denouement, but both were lacking. At the end of 250 pages, the writer abruptly leaves off and the heroine suddenly trusts a suspicious character for no well developed reason. However, all of the characters are shallowly developed and subject to capricious changes in behavior. After enjoying all of her previous series, I felt that MY trust had been betrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Ellis Peters Instead","review":"Any of the Ellis Peters Cadfael books delivers better writing, a more interesting storyline, more likeable characters and some kind of resolution. A Trust Betrayed has many elements of a good mystery, but some seem to have been thrown in to provide some kind of explanation for something else. Perhaps something is resolved in book two, but I won't be reading it. The one Owen Archer book I read was better than this, but not by much. Was looking for a good series to read, unfortunately this was not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, slow and lacking narrative drive","review":"I found it hard to slog through this book, which kind of ambled around in exasperating curlicues. The writing was adequate, but it lacked narrative drive. It just never seemed to go anywhere. It wouldn't have been so irritating if the characters had been interesting, but there was no life in any of them (and some were downright incredible.) I did not understand the motivation of any of them. I was frustrated with the perennial backing & filling of the narrative, and even began to skip-read to keep moving forward. It starts picking up about two-thirds of the way through, but by that time, not a single character interested me enough to have made it worthwhile. If I had not enjoyed the Owen Archer series, I would have put this book down unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for all","review":"In 'The 4th Dimension', Rudy Rucker takes a concept that could potentially be made frightfully technical and - through the use of snippets of fiction, humorous drawings (I believe the illustrator also did drawings for many of James Thurber's works), and down-to-earth language - makes it accessible to anyone. I've handed my copy to people who absolutely hated math, and they have been able to come away with at least a basic understanding.

Huh? No such beast in my machine!The number of times the illustrative figures do not show what they are supposed to is shocking and annoying. ( probably McGraw's fault, but that doesn't help the reader.)On the back of the book, there's a little reddish starburst which contains the extremely over-optimistic blurb: \\"Diagnose and fix problems fast with the companion CD-Rom!\\" Truly a ludicrous statement that the publisher should be ashamed of.On a positive closing note, the book does have some useful information, but only \\"some\\".If you buy it, be prepared to read carefully and warily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronnie Laws Retrospective","review":"I had the vinyl of this and it had Saturday Evening on it and a couple of others which made it a classic.

Geek the girl comes second right after Slide. Hard to say why..cause I think they're both her best albums. Geek the girl just touches something else. Maybe it's songs like Wood Floors and No Colour here that make Slide a little better. I'm just happy she's done as much music as she have.

With strong, full production and great sound, this is the best of the many Sugar Minott albums with great strength and variety throughout the whole CD. The lover's rock track \\"Is It True\\" is one of the classics of the genre and will make anyone get up and dance. Politics are not ignored with tracks like No Vacancy addressing the unemployment problems of Jamaica. \\"Give Thanks and Praise\\" is an homage to his Rastafarian roots and the hits \\"Slice of the Cake\\" and \\"Buy Out The Bar\\" are only a few of the very strong selections on this CD.

Understanding that this girl only has a quarter of a brain in her head but to not call the police even though she thought about it was idiotic and that includes her thinking she was safer with her carrying the sword and then blaming someone else for her killing a person.

Several times I cheated on exams by passing my answer sheet around the back of the room (as I looked at others' answers sheets). These mostly mundane matters would hardly be worth mentioning were it not for the fact that they point to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of maintaining a clear cut and recognizable observational or participatory research role.\\"Having openly admitted to cheating in this instance, how could anything he writes be accepted as authentic?

You can definitely hear that they were still developing their sound, but even the early ideas were not that great. I was bored the whole way through. I've read other glowing reviews, and that's fine.

A couple of the letters (G, N, and S in particular) look funny and not very well-shaped--it is hard to tell the G from the C, and my daughter calls the S a \\"duck.\\" 3. Since the letters are all different colors, it would have been easy and smart to make all the vowels one color; unfortunately, they didn't bother.

Other passages hi-lite the nobility and bravery that many exhibited in the most trying of times. The cast of characters is complete: Adams and his wife, Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Lafayette, etc. This book in fact does what other books for young adults only pretend - treating young minds as capable and inquisitive and able to handle a harsh reality.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"one-dimensional vocals","review":"I have read with interest about her supposed 5-octave range, and the rich eclecticism of her music, but to me it all sounded very one-dimensional, repetitive, and ultimately boring. I found myself quickly reminded of Macy Gray - similar irritating cartoonish qualities. It's obvious a lot of [money]was spent on production, but it all sounds uninspired. I was hoping for something along the lines of India.Arie, Nikka Costa, or Res - no [such]luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"Wow! Words can't even describe how awesome this CD is! I had never heard of Lamya until recently, when a post on a bulletin board convinced me to check her out. At first I was drawn in by her amazing remixes, but then heard samples from the cd which were even better! My favorite song from \\"Learning From Falling\\" is definitely Empires. Lamya's voice is so commanding you can't help but become addicted to this album! And the variety of songs on this cd also makes it a \\"must have.\\" For anyone who is debating whether or not to purchase this album, I say go for it! I promise you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"Don't believe it. This album does not deliver as promised.

I watched the whole video, waiting to see who it was and much to my surprise I saw the name Lamya. At 2 in the morning I typed in www.lamya.com on my computer and sure enough she has a website. I became instantly fascinated and read everything on the whole site. The site is through J records so I assumed she must be something special to have them backing her. After listening to \\"Empires\\" again, I immediately ordered her album \\"learning from falling\\" and it hasn't left my CD player since then. There's lots of cool stuff on her website and I cant stop checking it to see if she is gonna tour near me! The CD is great because it allows the listener to hear her wide range of vocal capabilities as she demonstrates her sound on tracks of multiple musical styles. She is definitely gonna be around for a while so grab the album and watch her evolve into a star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new and different in an industry of monotony","review":"In an industry that is driven by the same sounds and ideas, Lamya's \\"Learning from Falling\\" is a breath of fresh air. The entire album is one that you can sit through and at the end feel like you've encountered something truly unique. With strong lyrics on tracks like \\"Empires\\" and \\"Black Mona Lisa\\", Lamya gives you something to think about while her beats stay in your head all day. She's definitely someone to learn about and look out for in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Bed Eye Neva made","review":"lamya hasn't been unleashed to the australian public yetbut i've loved her for over 6 months now. i imported the album from us.and i wish it included the song\\"the bed eye never made\\"im dont really care 4 remixesbut itll be nice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!","review":"It's one CD that I could listen to over and over again.

I played it once and regret the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"tale of suffering","review":"This book appears to have been long forgotten. Yet in its time, it was of some significance, coming out as it did as one of the first in depth reports on the Soviet 1920-2 famine. The authors were Americans, who travelled as extensively as they could through the desolate troubled regions. Their route went from Riga to Samara to Astrakhan, and thence to the Ukraine, Caucasus and the Volga.The narrative is littered with tales of woe. Of populations suffering from town to town under brutal Chekist [= Soviet] rule. The upheavals in the society were massive, as the Soviets converted from a backward monarchy to a new socialist order. To an American reader of the time, all this must have somehow seemed so unreal. The American Civil War was a far less bloody affair.The current reader should keep in mind that far worse was to happen under the German invaders 20 years after the events described here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertisement","review":"I am very disappointed with this CD.

It stored around 90 songs in MP3 format with out using the expansion slot. It takes 512 SD cards but that would still give you around 180 songs. It allows you to scroll through your music and choose what you want to hear and what you don't. Yea - it's not a IPOD but for the price it's better- Affordable and it's a small device that straps to your arm or to your belt as it has a belt clip you can use. It uses a triple A battery that can be a rechargable - Another words Cheap... way more affordable and easier to use on your computer setting up your songs then an IPOD. Nothing wrong with this MP3player except people want name brand and this is not a namebrand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk--took it back","review":"Other reviewer was right. Product keeps quitting--and you have to pop out battery to restart it. This doesn't help me when I use product as a voice recorder--which was the main reason I bought it.Sound quality was better than OK, though. Plus earbuds were a (literal) pain to wear.

What a disappointment! It is not at all what I had expected. That the end is so forseeable is one of the minor problems - what is worse it that the characters, especially \\"heroine\\" Tracie, are so absolutely silly and unlikeable! No comparison to the strong, smart women in Olivia Goldsmith's former books!Goldsmiths strength were revenge stories - where the bad get their comeuppance and the good win. But in this one ... Perhaps it was meant to be a satire - but then it is a bad one.If a new Olivia Goldsmith book comes out, I will certainly not buy it impulsively!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"Awful! Awful! Awful! The girl lead in this book (Tracie) is a self-centered, shallow, egomaniacal b...h. She treated the male lead (Jon) like trash, turning him into something she thought was the ideal man. For someone like her, maybe he was. I agree that this book is predictable, but I kept reading hoping for Tracie to get some comeuppance, but of course in the end, Jon turned out to be as big an idiot as she turned him into and lowered himself to take her back. I don't care how long you have been in love with someone, if it took them completely changing you to find out they loved you, they never loved the REAL you to begin with and I thought the character of Jon started out that smart, but in the end the author turned him into nothing more than a horny, desperate man that would settle for someone that wanted to change him. Don't waste your money or even bother to check this out of the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the -1*?","review":"I don't know what the tape is like, but the book makes Whitney Houston's lyrics...sound good. And, I can't think of any lower praise than that. First of all, the author has never been to Seattle, and she should only write about things that she has intimate experience with, like the display table at Nieman-Marcus. Secondly, we would never allow anyone as stupid as Tracie to work at the Seattle Communist Times. Thirdly, any woman in Seattle would love to go out with Jon, because nice, rich guys at MSFT would look yummy compared to all the obscene Bad Boys that inhabit the underworld of Seattle, but no one from Hell-A would know that.Glad I didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"another JUST COULDN'T FINISH IT, IT WAS SO BAD","review":"The cover was the best thing about this book. Just don't bother to open it. Tracy and Jon are two of the stupidest people I've stumbled across in the Romance world, and believe me there are plenty. The only thing you can say is \\"they deserve each other but why did they waste everyone's time getting there?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT BORING!!!!!","review":"I ONLY SAY THIS BOOK IS GOOD, BECAUSE IT IS AN AUTOBIOGRAPY OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN WHO WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE. I AM ONLY 14 YEARS OLD, BUT IT IS NICE TO READ ABOUT A BLACK MAN WHO HAD GOALS AND DREAMS OF COLLEGE AND A CAREER WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP IN HARLEM IN THE 1940'S. BUT THE BOOK HAD IT'S BORING PARTS TO. I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK IF YOU WANTED TO READ ABOUT GROWING UP IN HARLEM IN THE 194O'S. RATHER THAN THAT THE BOOK IS JUST BORING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Make It Past Page 75","review":"To the reviewers who actually finished this book, I salute you. I have enjoyed Goldsmith's previous stories, especially \\"First Wives Club\\" and \\"Bestseller,\\" but I don't know what she was thinking when she wrote this pile of garbage. I can't speak for the editing mistakes since I didn't get far enough into the book to see them, but the major turnoff for me was Tracie. This so-called \\"heroine\\" was self-absorbed, manipulative, immature and annoyed me to the point where I wanted Phil to mistreat her because she deserved it. Also just how much research on Seattle did Goldsmith actually do, because all I saw was one overplayed cliche after another (rainy weather, Starbucks-type places on every corner, half the population are nerdy types working at Microsoft or a dot.com). I finally had to give up on the book because I felt like my intelligence was being insulted. I only gave one star because Amazon doesn't have a zero star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment for Goldsmith Fans","review":"Bad Boy lacks the attention to detail, juicy plotlines and page-turning twists that made Goldsmith's other books so much fun to read. Tracy is the most unlikable heroine that I've encountered in a long time--insipid and whiny; the shallow characters lead formulaic lives; dialogue is on the level of \\"The Babysitters' Club\\" series. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying characters, too much detail","review":"This is the first book I've encountered by this author, and I can say that I won't be looking for her other works. The characters were condescending, and frankly, the characters who were supposed to be \\"cool\\" reminded me of the socially inept people you desperately try to avoid at parties. The dialogue didn't come across as spontaneous at all, and the plot was very predictable. Goldsmith includes too much detail in her descriptions (e.g., do we really need to know every facial movement each character makes?), which makes the story drag. Although I like the idea of a male version of the makeover story, I was deeply disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Young African American Teens","review":"Teens can really get inspired through Myers words. I also think that many teens will be able to relate to the different situations that he went through as well as learn how teens grew up in the 40's and 50's. The best part is learning the culture of Harlem as well as learn a first hand experience about the Harlem Renaissance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Books can do amazing things","review":"Walter Dean Myers describes his early life and how he came to be a writer. Not an easy path, but one that I am glad he has shared. This book is pretty scary in some parts because with just a little variation of events in his life, he might not have made it out alive. Being poor, and Black, would have dictated a narrow and limited life for him if he had not found books; though then, as now, he had to be careful not to set himself apart too widely from the people around him. This memoir is recommended to mature readers or would-be writers, age 10 to 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Totally predictable and not worth the energy spent turning the pages. Granted, you don't expect Goldsmith to be Shakespeare, but this even falls below her previous works. \\"First Wives Club\\" and others have redeeming moments, are humorous and a diverting \\"fun\\" read .... but this is just awful, demeaning, page-filler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Olivia Goldsmith should be ashamed...","review":"...and so should her editors and publishers. This book is just awful. It would be good had it been written by a high school sophomore as an extra credit project. The subject material, the style are just plain frenetic, and it runs out of breath in about 35 pages. Actually, I suspect that this book was written by someone other than the author of \\"The First Wives' Club\\". It's that bad and that different."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash to the trash","review":"Based on the excellent, clever movie \\"The First Wives Club\\", I bought two of Olivia Goldsmith's books.

The boys mom died when he was 8 . years old. The boy was adopted and lived in a little town called Harlem. The boys name was Walter Dean. He was always in a fight at school in Mr. Conroys class. This caused the boy to miss so m up to write this book school that they were going to put him in a juvinele faciliy. The boy learned to stop fighting and that is how the story ends.I liked the book because I was like the boy in a way,I was always getting in trouble. I would get my friends to rend this book because the boy had a hard life and was adopted and poor and grew up to write this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love The Cover!","review":"Based on the wonderful early publicity on Bad Boy, I eagerly picked up my copy. What a horrible shock! I am pleased to see some more realistic reviews coming out. Bad Boy really truly is a bad copy of Sara Bird's \\"The Boyfriend School!\\" There is so much that is wrong with Bad Boy, I can honestly say the only thing I liked was the cover design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, A Boyfriend School Ripoff","review":"My stars, I am glad I am not the only one who was very uncomfortable by the incredible similarities to Sara Bird's wonderful book, \\"The Boyfriend School.\\" In \\"Bad Boy,\\" Goldsmith has indeed taken almost indecent liberties with Bird's work. I know that it is very common to borrow ideas, themes, characters and plots and recombine and rewrite them into a new story. But in this case, Goldsmith has so many things that are exactly the same, that it defies the explanation of \\"mere\\" coincidence. Perhaps Goldsmith read Bird's work years ago, and subconsciously kept the storyline alive, and it has come forth in a (barely) new incarnation. Don't know the answer to this question, but I do know that the publisher and/or editor should have sniffed this out before the book went to print. Indeed, Goldsmith and her editor and publisher owe an apology to first and foremost to Sarah Bird, and secondly to her fans, who have paid their hard earned money for this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which One of These is Not Like the Others?","review":"I look forward to a new Olivia Goldsmith novel. I know I'll find a block of time to cosy up and read for hours. Well, I did that today with Bad Boy.

Now I have 2 hours left to fill: maybe I'll start rereading The Bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot...","review":"I picked up Bad Boy on a whim, because it looked sort of fun. I knew that it wasn't going to be exactly Shakespeare, but I really do expect that a best-selling author like Goldsmith would be able to come up with something better than this sorry book! But no... The writing and dialogue were elementary, to say the least; the plot was dull, and the characters were two-dimensional. Basically, I could not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone with any sense of literature, or at least good writing, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurrah!","review":"Finally folks are getting the courage to say what I haven't had the guts to say! Why is it that bad books are published just because the author has had a previous success? Bad Boy is a perfect example where I feel my money was taken by a publishing house under false pretenses. It is time for publishers to JUST SAY NO to bad books! Bad Boy really is a BAD BOOK! I have been steaming for months over this very issue and this very book, and hope Goldsmith's editor and publisher stand up and take notice. Bad Boy isn't worth the paper it was written on, and it is clear that not much thought was put into the outline, completion and editing of the manuscript. As a serious and copious reader, I think I deserve better. Read Goldsmith's other books, they are pretty darned good. This one really is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sara Bird Did It Better and First","review":"I may have liked this novel better if it hadn't so clearly reminded me of an earlier novel by Sara Bird called \\"The Boyfriend School.\\" That book is now out-of-print but if readers really like this plotline of turning a nice guy into a bad boy so he can score with women, Bird does it better. The big difference between the two novels is that his romance author sister transforms her brother in \\"Boyfriend School\\" whereas in \\"Bad Boy\\" it is his best friend, who is a woman hooked up with her own bad boy, who undertakes this transformation. I wouldn't have even guessed that this was the same author as the one who wrote \\"Fashionably Late,\\" \\"Best Seller,\\" and \\"Flavor Of The Month\\" if her name hadn't been on it. I hope this is just a misfire and doesn't mean Goldsmith has run out of good ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've EVER read...","review":"I had never read anything by this author before, but I read a decent review of this book and decided to give it a try. I didn't expect it to be great literature, and of the five books or so that I read a month, I usually enjoy one or two that I label as \\"mind candy.\\" I knew that this book would fall into that category, but I didn't expect the writing to be on a fifth-grade reading level!

He shows how much how much effort he put in his whole life and how great he has become. He was known as the tough kid because he fought many kids. He never gave up though. Even after struggling in school, he really liked to read. He always put the booked he got from the library, in a brown paper bag because he didn't want anyone to tease him for that. The book also explains how he grew up in Harlem. He tells you all his problems he had with great description. His family also had a financial problem which made his life harder.

This is a bomb. I do not like one of the characters in this story. First of all it is too dragged out describing ever second of Jon's \\"transformation\\". Secondly, they make this guy a total geek, like he doesn't even know how to speak to a woman without \\"cool\\" Tracie's help. And Tracie is extremely annoying. If Jon is suppose to be Tracie's friend, why is she always laughing at his patheticness? I guess I will continue to read, but only because I don't have another book at this moment.

I'm not looking forward to reading the third chapter. As of this moment, I doubt very much that I will continue with this farce.

Not up to Goldsmith's normally witty style--seems kind of tired, and plods along at times like an old horse at the end of a hard work day. Needed major editing.

Read only if extremely bored, or while snoozing at the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down from this Goldsmith fan","review":"I love Olivia Goldsmith's books -- THE BESTSELLER is one of the best-ever books in its genre, and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB and FLAVOR OF THE MONTH were tremendous fun. So I couldn't wait to read this book. What a disappointment. Goldsmith is far better at capturing the lives of glittering, glamorous people than a group of fairly ordinary Seattle twentysomethings. The plot is predictable from beginning to end. And did Goldsmith even visit Seattle, or did she do her research long distance? At one point Jon goes to the Seattle airport because he thinks it would be a good place to pick up women. He zeroes in on a flight arriving from Tacoma. Uh, Olivia, the Seattle airport is practically IN Tacoma. That's why it's called SEATAC.Arriving only 11 months after the 500-page YOUNG WIVES, BAD BOY is a bad book that I can only imagine Goldsmith simply rushed to finish. Next time, I hope she takes a little more time and produces a yummy novel that's worth waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Pointless","review":"I was looking forward to a wickedly fun read, and was very very disappointed.

However, before I cracked the spine, I happened across a terrible review of the book. The reviewer said that BAD BOY was awful and nothing like Goldsmith's earlier works. Nevertheless, I started reading, but found myself glossing over the first 50 pages or so, and then skipping ahead and reading the last 10 pages. That did it for me. I didn't need to waste my time reading the \\"inside\\" of the book, since is was blantantly obvious as to what was going to happen from the book jacket copy and the first 50 pages.

Just because Tracie and her friends are stupid enough to stay with \\"bad boys\\" doesn't mean every other girl in the world is.

Jon was so gullible, I didn't know how he made any money. There were so many subplots (unresolved) that I don't know why she even bothered. What happened to Jon's father? He was dying, so okay, that'll do it? What about Tracie's boss coming on to her? Oh, that's okay, don't do it again? Her life at work seemed abstract and unrealistic.

Besides the fact that it is not a likely situation, there is no airport in Tacoma, Washington that can have a DC10 fly out of it! The fact checker majorly failed.Another glaring error is Goldsmith's lack of research on the Seattle area. One main reason I bought this book is that I love reading books about my home area. But 1, you can not get to downtown Seattle from Bainbridge, the Bainbridge ferry goes to West Seattle, a long way from downtown. and 2, it would take WAY over an hour to eat breakfast, ride to the ferry terminal, and get to Seattle.I am appalled by the lack of research that went into this book.

There is no way I would buy this book for over $3."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD IDEA...BAD EXECUTION---","review":"This was an eye-rolling, can't-believe-I-wasted-my-time-on-it story. It was supposed to be a geek gets his female best friend (whom he's secretly in love with) to help transform him in to a man women desire story. They succeed...he's a \\"hot\\", sought-after, sex-machine \\"Bad Boy\\"... then the best friend realizes she's fallen for him.The problems started with the fact that the characters were so darn unlikable. Toss in that the ultra-shallow best friend's definition of a \\"Bad Boy\\" was turning him in to a total jerk, the kind she liked to date, but few real women would find sexy. Then add that the story drug on and on over mundane details, bounced ALL over the place, resolved nothing, and ended boring and abruptly. It's a shame as this could have been a fresh, fun tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"So far, I only listened to one of the cd's. The adult sang some of the songs and he is awful. In addition, there were children singers but they are older children and can't sing either. Sometimes, as a special treat, both the adult and the children would sing (gee thanks).The music is terrible. The songs all sound alike with the goofy sounding instruments. It is hard to explain but it is worse than the singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mix Masterpiece","review":"I was driving back from the airport after a long business trip when a local college radio station played about 30 minutes of \\"Anti-Theft Device\\". I was so impressed that I pulled off the interstate and started hitting the major retailers looking for it. Didn't find it so I went home and mail-ordered it. Got it just in time to take it with me out of town on my next trip. Spent two days snowbound in Ohio listening to this on headphones. Incredible! It's so packed with turntabley richness that you'll hear something new with each listening - check out the soundbytes for examples. It was so dense I had to balance it out with Volume 1 of the \\"Shiggar Fraggar Show\\" by the Invisibl Skratch Piklz just to change the pace. This is something everyone should be listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Satyisfying","review":"This CD is great ! It has kind of an \\"end of the world\\" \\"spaced out\\" kinda feel to it. Many of the songs have a good beat to it especially the song Anti-Theft Device. There are no vocals so its kinda weird for some reason. Each song blends into one another forming a full 60 minutes of continuous MMM. I recomend u buy this CD. U must appreciate the art of DJing and Mixing or be a fan of MMM for u to like it. For some it may sound like noise but to me...its a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Avoid. Do Not Buy.","review":"I bought it on the strength of this guy's association with the Beasties.When you listen, you realize just how limited his role is in that band.Where a record like \\"Hello Nasty\\" brims with phat beats and imaginative uses of beats and samples, Anti Theft Device is dreadfully dull. The beats just pound away, no attention at all given to the drum programming. The scratching here is only virtuosic in the sense that it may be technically proficient. But it is certainly not fun to listen to. This may be one of the most unlistenable records of all time. I cannot express how much it S*CKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice beats.","review":"MMM is not the illest. Not even close. This ain't next level.

As you read, you'll started to discover Randy Morgenson's personality, his thinking, his job, and his personal life.

It was also interesting to know how SAR was coordinated among various agencies/organizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in the great lineage of Sierra books","review":"The book made a very valid point that brought much needed change to the way that backcountry rangers are treated. Next time you are in SEKI, pack in a chocolate bar for the ranger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long and a bummer to boot","review":"I found this book to be tedious and depressing and yet I managed to read the entire thing, wanting to find out what finally happened. Randy Morgenson grew up in an idyllic setting (Yosemite Valley), was raised by caring parents, yet managed to make a mess of his life due to what seems to have been an obsession for living alone in the beauty of the Sierra. He married, but was away from home at least half the time, and never had children. Although a legendary and exemplary ranger, he was unfaithful to his long-suffering wife in a three-year affair, became ultimately disillusioned with his obsession, and finally died alone apparently having drowned after falling through a snow bridge into an alpine pond while on patrol. Tragic and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book!","review":"I really had high hopes for this book, but it's not really an adventure and it-s not interesting at all.

Hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"Just finished this book, very good. It would have rated 5 stars for me if it was just a wee bit shorter as it did drag just a tad. I usually don't write reviews but I needed to counter some negative reviews in comparison where people contrasted it to \\"Into the Wild\\". \\"Into the Wild\\" is better written, to be sure. But contrary to some reviewers opinions, this man, Randy Morgenson, was truly someone who's life was \\"book worthy.\\" The kid in \\"Into the Wild\\" basically threw his life away and really never contributed anything to anyone or anything. Randy really helped alot of people and \\"the land\\" and his life stood and meant something. I did enjoy Into the Wild, it was compelling, but as far as the main characters, NO comparison. Randy is an inspiration, Cris McCandless was just a lost soul......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story, Fascinating Life","review":"My neighbor, Al Blake (former USFS), brought the book over today... His wife, Reni, took pottery class with Judi Morgenson at Lassen College. Of course, Al met Randy, on the rare occasions that he blew into town. So, it is strange, how we are all connected, in this tiny blue world. And anyone who has worked in the wilderness (I worked for Los Padres N.F. at Pacific Valley Ranger Station), or backpacked, can relate to the many different emotions expressed in this book. Well written, and engrossing, this is a book that, literally, I couldn't put down. Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I read this book cover to cover in 2 days because I simply couldn't put it down! I love backpacking and hiking, but not as much as I do after reading this book. I almost took a blow-dryer up to the mountains to try to melt the snow faster so I could get on with the backpacking trip I had planned in Yosemite prior to reading the book. It left me guessing till the end. The imagery in the book really made me feel like I was in the mountains, and probably painted a more beautiful image in my mind than I would have experienced with my eyes. The passion that Randy had for the Sierra was wonderfully portrayed by the author. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"This book came very very highly recommended by a friend, so maybe I expected too much. The author tries hard, but not convincingly, to glamorize the life/job of the back country rangers in national parks. And, the history and character development of the lost ranger became tedious. Otherwise, interesting concerning the life of park rangers in general, how rescues work, and the descriptions of the Sierras is good. I personally prefer something similar to Desert Solitude (Edward Abbey) to the author's description of the natural wonders. Overall, I enjoyed the book but it did not live up to my high expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last moments alone and the mystery left behind","review":"When someone dies alone in the wilderness there are questions to be answered. Eric Blehm took on a big challenge in assembling the material to write this book. For those of us who love the outdoors and go solo into the wilderness we always want to know what happened. . this book made me turn pages late into the night trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Randy.

The hole is so small that no milk will come out. My other slow-flow nipples do one drop per second. I tried to stretch out the hole but it closes back up every time. They were also a very odd orange color instead of brown like the others. Maybe it was a bad batch or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only nipple my babies would take!","review":"I used these nipples with my daughter, and they were perfect! It was an easy transition from breast to bottle and back. These never gave me any issues with clogging and were always easy to clean. My daughter loved them and the flow was perfect for her.Now, I'm using them with my son and he loves them too! I cannot complain one bit about these nipples. I have had nothing but good luck with them and would and have recommended them to friends and family. I love the Drop-Ins system, but I was worried about the other nipples and wanted something more like the breast. Thanks to Playtex for delivering such a wonderful product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast! Baby chokes on milk.","review":"Finding the right Playtex nipples has been like a Goldilocks and the Three Bears experience for me. The latex Playtex slow flow NaturaLatch nipples that we got with our bottles were way too fast. My nearly 3 month old baby chokes because the milk flows so fast. When super hungry he can chug a 4 1/2 oz bottle in 5 minutes with the slow flow latex version. So I tried these silicone NaturaLatch slow flows and they are way too slow. My baby gets frustrated with how slow these nipples flow. It took him up to an hour sometimes to finish a 4 1/2 oz bottle! There needs to be some middle ground. Since these slow flow silicone nipples were too slow, I tried the medium flow version and it was way too fast. Strangely enough I found that the Playtex Orthodontic Latex medium flow is the perfect flow speed, but the shape of the nipple makes it difficult for my baby to get those last drops. Playtex needs to work on improving the nipple flows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my picky breast fed girl","review":"We use the playtex dropin nursers for our daughter who is mostly breast fed. When we first started trying to give her a bottle she seemed interested then spit it out and had a cow. About this time a friend passed all her bottles and nipples on to us and in that stash was one of these. We were desperate so we sterilized it and tried it. She took it right away without a fuss. I don't know if it's because this feels more like skin than the silicone or if it is because these have a textured ring around them that the silicone ones lack. Either way our picky breast fed baby takes and loves these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even these will work!","review":"I've gone back to work and not even these nipples are \\"natural\\" enough to make my daughter stop refusing a bottle! The nipples are thrice as long as my own. The textured ring is barely noticeable! Hardly a comparison to a real nipple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only bottle nipple my breastfed baby will take!","review":"These latex nipples are the only ones my breastfeeding baby will take. We use it with the playtex original nurser which uses the drop-ins. We tried Dr Brown's, Breastflow, Nuk, and Medela bottles but he couldn't seem to latch onto the silicone nipples on those. I gave it 4 stars because the pack I received had one nipple that had melted a little which caused some of the cardboard packaging to stick to it. Boiling them doesn't seem to take it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Well","review":"I have been using these nipples for all of the first 6 months of my little man's life and we haven't had a problem.

Know how you're always looking for the perfect summer read--something fun that's not dumb? Well, this was it for me! You can read it in a few good sittings and you won't want to put it down. It's kind of like Melissa Bank's The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing meets Vibe or the Source. It's about dating and romance, but in a witty way. More than that, though, I think it's a book for music lovers. You can tell Wasfie knows her stuff. It's obvious she really works in the industry. There're even some transcripts from real interviews in the back of the book. I love hip hop, and this is the first book I've read that deals with the hip hop scene in a way that's real and exciting without being raunchy and overdramatic. It has a good behind the scenes feel and you feel like an insider reading it. Loved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Yawnfest","review":"It's frustrating when screenwriters, journalist and authors claim their love for Hip Hop and inject love stories to make their work more palatable for the masses.Hip Hop is raw, uncut and against the grain.

I love the original groups, such as the Amazing Blondell and Steeleye Span, but nothing should be held so sacred that you can't make fun of it. This really is a wonderful piss-take, featuring deliberately poor playing, fake regional accents, pathetic lyrics about elves and beautiful sunshine girls and all the wonders of the witchwood, with nearly every track marred to death by what sounds like a seven year old beginner on the descant recorder. On top of that the group on this, their second CD (believe it or not), feature some truly ghastly synths, an instrument that wasn't even used by the original bands (who, believe it or not, had taste). All presented with a dress code to match. What? Are you saying this isn't a parody? These people really mean it?

One could have expected, in spite of this exercise for voice, some sincerity or something. The voice is not smooth enough to be as a diva, and too sophisticated to be for popular songs...

You can learn the details of how Britain's House of Commons, or Germany's Bundestag, operate, as well as differences in their electoral systems and more.This is a great resource for Americans who want a basic handle on European political dynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"peep this","review":"I was exposed to this band back in '93-94 when they were a very undeground and unheard of band. This was back when alternative music was still considered underground, and the title \\"generation-X\\" was yet to be labled. This was back when jocks would beat up on skaters like me and my friends, but now it appears that jocks are skaters. Back when skate shoes were only worn by skaters and surfers, not by every body else and their mothers.Anyhow this band is has been one of my favorites for as long as I can remember. Their style is like no other I've heard. Their a very hard-edged band with quite a wailer for their lead singer, who has a throaty, angry way of delivering his lyrics. As for bands that sound like them I think of bands such as \\"fishwife\\" or \\"crankshaft\\" (circa 1990). Check out other Albums by Hemlock like \\"Give Kids Candy\\" but make sure its not the other band named Hemlock that is pretty much death metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Granted it is a little hard to turn, but I did opt for the jogging stroller w/o the swivel wheel. My only other problem was that the seat doesn't sit all the way upright, which is great for a young baby that has little neck control, but My 18 month old who loves to look around has to sit up unsupported to see. The seat has an adjustable strap that is used to adjust the incline. Even tightened all the way it sits pretty straight, but not all the way. Regardless, my son likes going for walks in it, it's easy to fold and unfold, it's light, and compact. If I had to, I'd definately buy another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"The InStep Run Around LTD is just not great. The front wheel is stationary, making it really hard to jog or even walk on a trail. In order for me to fit the stroller in my trunk, I had to remove the front wheel which is a total pain in the butt and is almost impossible to get back in the socket. The wheels also suck and do not stay inflated. I spent a few more dollars and got the Jeep jogging stroller, and I love it! It is more compact, has a built in MP3 player, and the front wheel also rotates. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stroller kicks butt for the money","review":"Bought this nearly 2 years ago when our second son was born. I will never go back to a regular stroller again.Though it can be a pain to transport, it's a must have if going to anywhere outdoors where a stroller is needed. It gets across all kinds of terrain with ease. No swivel for the front wheel so if you are making a turn you have to lean the whole thing back onto the rear wheels, but it's really sturdy for jogging etc (I rollerskate while pushing little Max around in his). Compared to the super pricey terrain/jogging strollers out there this one is the bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just hope it holds out before she outgrows it!","review":"Ugh! I spent so much time trying to find a decent and not too expensive all-terrain stroller. However, I now kick myself for not getting one with a front wheel that is not locked. We are always hiking and I thought the bigger the tires the better, but that is definitely not the case. It is horrible to steer. The tires are always flat and the rims have rusted almost completely. My daughter bangs her head on the side bars, so I have to strategically place a blanket around the back. The seat belt has buckles that are hard to snap and I always pinch my hands buckling my daughter in. The straps are not meant for a small child. Even with my daughter at two years old, I have to have the straps cinched down as far as they will go and she can still pull out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware warranty expiration and not repairable parts","review":"We were given an instep jogging stroller as a gift and loved it until one day it refused to fold. The latch on one side would not release. My wife runs mostly from the house and this stroller had been folded less than 10 times.The side latch that broke is inside the frame and cannot be repaired even by the bike store (this was confirmed by customer service). Unfortunately the stroller was six months out of warranty and instep will do nothing to help. I called and the bike store called and the company says no warranty no luck.This part is innacessible to replace and as I said the stroller had been folded so few times I am very very disapointed with the product and this company and will never buy from them again. For such an integral part to fail is a real shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bang for the buck","review":"Needed a starter jogger because we weren't sure of our commitment to the sport.

Overall, very good bang for the buck and the purchase process went without a hitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"True jogging stroller, needs more padding.","review":"A true jogging stroller has a fixed front wheel, this one does. I like the compartments, the wrist strap, the shade that extends to protect my son from the heat and the hand brake.

I wish the seat had more padding and a bar across the seat for toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jogging Stroller","review":"This is a great stroller. Easy to assemble and transport in your car.

Once you get the hang of it, you'll love it. I love that it has 2 baskets underneath and 2 cup holders on top, one for me & one for my 2 year old. It rides smooth and that's great for when they fall asleep. I had some problems at first when it was steering to the left. So I checked the tire pressure like it said in the instructions and that fixed it. I have mostly used it on paved roads. A few times I took it on dirt hiking trails & it still seemed to ride smooth except when I tried to go over some rocks. Then it seemed too bouncy for baby. So I don't recommend rugged terrain. I know Instep is a great brand because my friend had an older model that she let me use until I got a newer one. It lasted her 5 years and 2 kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"We had purchased this as a gift for a friend but she had already received one so we kept it. It was roughly 8 months before we took it out of the box to use it and the front tire was missing. I called their customer service as their instructions suggested and they refused it fix their mistake. Rather than making the stroller totally useless, we had to pay an additional $50 to get the tire and pay for shipping. Terrible company with terrible customer service. I am now just hoping the stroller holds up...if not, i will be back to finish this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, solid.","review":"Love it.

I called Instep and they offered a repair kit, for a brand new stroller. Also, the grips were uneven, one side was longer than the other. I know that this is not a top dollar jogger, but give me a break. It still should be better than all this for $100 on sale. I returned the second stroller also.

She wouldn't touch it! I was surprised because both my cats like to lick the milk out of my cereal bowl when I am done. I asked my Vet what the major difference was between cat milk and people milk, she said they are basically the same but cats milk has taurine added to it, a nutrient that cats need more of. The vet recommended to give the cat regular milk and a taurine supplement if she would eat that. Luckily, after second force feeding she started eating again so I didn't need to go that route. My Vet said that cat milk is way over priced for what you get,"},{"rating":"2","title":"PetAg KMR Beats Any Others Paws Down","review":"PetAg's KMR, (kitten milk replacement,) is, in my experience, the most highly recommended and best-tolerated formula for newborn and young kittens available on the market. I personally prefer the liquid, as the powder can be difficult to dissolve properly, though it is more economical and easier to make in the amounts you need at any given time. In my experience, kittens take to it well and don't suffer as many digestive issues as with some other brands. I recommend a specially-designed formula such as Just-Born with colostrum for the first 2-3 days for kittens who are exclusively bottle-fed from birth, as the colostrum helps establish a newborn's immune system, which most formulas don't, but after the first few days, colostrum is merely broken down in the digestive tract and gives no added protection, so then it's time for KMR. Follow feeding directions carefully and watch your little ones thrive on this superior formula! It's never let us down."},{"rating":"1","title":"it isn't very good!!","review":"This book HIGH TIDE was not very good and i think it was boring. usually i can't wait to finish a book but this one i don't even want to finish it.

I am a tanker in the U.S. Army and a WWII history buff and this movie made me smile. It reminded me of some of the soldiers I have served with in my years in the Army. The American equipment used in this movie matched the American equipment used by our forces in WWII. The only \\"sticking\\" point of the movie is the German tanks. They are modified M-36 Tank Destroyers with large Iron Crosses painted on the front. The M-36 was an American vehicle in WWII. Other than that, this movie is excellent and I would recommend it to anybody, especially tank buffs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best war movies of it's era.","review":"This was one of the better war movies of it's era. Like most of them back then, people die in one piece and it's bloodless. But that was standard for this time frame in filmaking. What wasn't; was the basic realism in approach and storyline. They used alot of Sherman tanks in this movie and did a fantastic job here. The movie just deals with a platoon of tanks as they struggle to keep alive accross France during the conflict. IT's well acted and even the story of the driven tank sergeant who mercilessly pushes his men to be the best AND Stay alive is a good one. There were certainly men like him in any conflict. This is a black and white movie but it doesn't hurt it in the least , although the fact that this is only on dvdr is strange. IN these days of cheap blu rays you could put three old war movies on one disc and they'd look better than ever. And this one has no regular dvd release it's only a dvdr but at least it's available I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the main points, please!","review":"I'm taking a research methods course right now and, unfortunately, this is the book that was assigned.

I do not feel that it is very well organized, and it is very tedious to pull out the main points. It's very wordy with alot of needless jargon. The definitions and vocabulary lack \\"common sense\\" and useful applicability. Visually speaking, it is a difficult read due to the way the text is organized and formatted.

As a PhD student in social work, I can assure you there are much better books out there. The chapters have no sense of organization. There are multiple unrelated topics within chapters. The excessive number of examples make reading the book tedious, as well. If I, someone with a research background, have a hard time reading this book, how in the world are MSW or BSW students supposed to understand the authors' logic and poor structure?Additionally, the authors' examples are offensive at time! In one section, the authors actually compare schizophrenic people to \\"normal\\" people. In another section, they use the term \\"hermaphrodite\\" repeatedly. This book was published in 2009.

The music on this CD is ballad like, and encourages your mind to escape with wonderful, dark or joyful thoughts. The lyrics are abstract and poetic is some cuts. This is what sets your thoughts aloft. The music is rock, not the kind of fuzzy, screaming rock that annoys you, but a directed, deep voiced and solid rock that affects your whole being with rhythm.

Read this Book.","review":"This book taught me just how influential the NYT is in addition to how to detect its techniques for distorting the news. You don't have to subscribe to the Times to be within its grasp. My SC paper Sunday had three NYT front page stories. A fourth, the CIA memo from anonymous sources, was referenced on TV news shows even though it lacked any serious analysis or verifiable source. Today's SC paper had four NYT articles. Now I read each with additional scrutiny, looking for the techniques identified by the book. What shocked me the most was how subtle the techniques are. I never would have noticed had I not read this book. I'm passing it on to my daughter who is writing a paper on media bias for her college government class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated - Broadly applicable","review":"I have several books on media bias in including \\"Weapons of Mass Distortion\\" by Bozell and \\"Bias\\" by Goldberg. Bias was a great thriller because it was written by an insider, but this book is the one you should follow with. I wish it had been as big and well known, because it's just as important. What makes this one so good is that it is focused on mechanics. You actually learn *how* they lie to you. Kohn demonstrates such a solid knowledge of journalism that you would think he was a professor in the subject. He just takes you through line by line, technique by technique and shows you how it is done. If you want to get people out of the web of lies it's helpful if you can show them the subtle methodologies using to deceive them. If you want to know that, study this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is a joke.","review":"As anyone who watches Scarborough Country on MSNBC can tell you, this man has zero credibility.

This author started out with a premise he wanted to prove, then cherry-picked facts out of context to \\"prove\\" them. This is sloppy logic that isn't even clever enough to disguise its brazen right wing agenda to \\"discredit\\" legitmate journalism. As Stephen Colbert said, \\"reality has a well-known liberal bias\\". Ordinarily it might be suggested that these kinds of poorly written, biased books are corrosive to the democratic foundation of our country, were it not for the fact that it isn't even very good at what it attempts to do. This book is likely to appeal only to those already converted to radical right wing conservatism. For those of us still prefering to live in fact-based reality: run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth reading for entertainment value","review":"The book tries to prove that the NY Times is slanted by picking apart sentences and finding fault with articles not because they actively denouncing republicans but rather because they don't have enough disclaimers attached.It's a rather tedious read that only is enjoyable for readers who want to see their prejudices about the NY Times confirmed, or for open minded individuals who can get a laugh out of the typical right-wing rants against any publication that takes a critical look at current events without relying on republican propaganda.I would suggest looking at Fox Networks or any other member of the heavily right-leaning Rupert Murdoch empire for even better examples of biased reporting - but that would probably not further the agenda of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEWS: A CONSERVATIVE DOESN'T LIKE THE NYTIMES","review":"I CAN SAVE YOU THE COST OF THIS BOOK.

Chapters 3 through 12 analyze in detail, with many pertinent examples, the techniques that reporters and editors of the Times deploy in order to insinuate the paper's editorial slant into what purport to be straight news stories.The only aspect I dislike is that Bob Kohn harps a bit too much on a theme song entitled \\"Mean Old Times Picking on Bushie.\\" Aside from that, I fear that the book may become an underground best seller in journalism schools. Read the wrong way, it is an ambitious young reporter's guide on how to move up from the Podunk Chronicle to the New York Times, in 10 easy lessons.Get it and, as Glenn Reynolds says, \\"Read the whole thing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been Frauded","review":"The interesting thing about this book is that its' meticulously researched, but poorly written and annoyingly repetitive.

In \\"Newsthinking,\\" a book on mental organization for journalist, I urge writers to seek out new and vibrant forms of structure to tell a story once they have reported it. In doing this, I cite Rule Number One: There Are No Rules, an edit aimed at craftmanship, not disregarding the truth. Kohn, to fit his purpose, interpreted Rule Number One as urging reporters to abandon rules of truth and fairness if twisting the facts made a better story. It is impossible to read \\"Newsthinking\\" in context and glean that. As a reporter and editor with 34 years in the business, it angered me have my words twisted in a way I would never tolerate or advocate. Kohn did precisely what he tried to condemn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack on the liberal press","review":"Kohn makes no bones about his intention: To castigate what he labels the \\"liberal\\" press. His general premise is that editorials can (and should) be slanted and new must be \\"objective\\" and \\"neutral\\". Unfortunately, his understanding of what \\"objective\\" and \\"neutral\\" should be, is tainted by a Republican understanding of the world, and according to Kohn, there is no place for a \\"liberal\\" press. It is therefore not surprising that he finds no room to complain about distorted reporting by other newspapers or TV News channels, and contents himself to castigating the NY Times. Instead of writing a book to \\"prove\\" how liberal the NY Times us in its news reporting, the natural consequence would have been for Bob Kohn to cancel his subscription.

America is in press trouble, and headed for disaster if this trend is allowed to continue. Maybe we need a constitutional amendment that states that a 'free' press is only free and held harmless from law suits if it's owned by itself only, and not a non-news corporation. Kudos for the NY Times. Keep on reporting the news that burns the pants off of 'seasoned' exutives of corporations who are changing our 'news' to their propaganda journals.

It would have been funnier without the language though. His cousin Eddie puts the icing on the cake when he shows up with his family and \\"puppy\\". Chevy's family reminds me of mine and probably most of America. I'm sure most everyone has had an Aunt Bethany. Of all the National Lampoon Vacations, I loved the Christmas one the most. Go Chevy......"},{"rating":"2","title":"NL's Xmas VACAction.","review":"Timeless classic holiday film. Gives you a real family holiday film. Not the\\"made up family\\" stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that Santy Claus?","review":"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is my favorite movie! I have loved this since the day I saw it. My family now has a Thanksgiving tradition of watching this in the evening. I have watched the movie so many times I can recite almost all of the dialouge and I laugh before something funny even happens. It is the best Christmas movie/comedy ever made. Fun and laughter for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"True... Sad but True","review":"This is so true, right? Everyone has those Christmas' where something goes wrong. I mean and that shaft from his company is not too far from the truth. My dad one year got 100 bucks to a grocery store. Can you believe that? Randy Quaid plays a laugh out loud character. I mean who in their family does not have a character like this? You are not an American citizen if you do not have some weird relative. This movie is my favorite holiday movie. Perfect for all year round. You will see every possible holiday mishap. Get it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest movie ever made!","review":"This movie is sooo funnie! Chevy Chase is great! This movie is always funny to watch. I own it, and have watched it over 50 times and every time i watch it its still funny! Basically its about Chevy chase wanting a good old fashioned family christmas. Thats not good. as usual everything goes wrong. There Christmas tree isnt just bright, its on fire! There are so many funny parts in this movie, like when Aunt Bethany comes. They ask her to say grace and she replies \\"Grace? She died 30 years ago!\\" When she arrives at the house is the funniest part in the movie. Its also very funnie when uncle eddie comes. He's great. This is Chevy Chase's best movie. The only thing I don't understand is why it's rated PG-13, because it should be R. There is so much bad language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless comedy no matter the holiday","review":"You don't have to wait until December to enjoy this film. Every time I watch this movie I find something else to appreciate - from the creative writing to exaggerate the sentimental traditions, to the hysterical performances of the entire cast. This is Chevy at his best. But the icing on the cake is Randy Quaids genius interpretation of that embarrassing relative we want to disclaim. Thanks for a timeless comedy classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"National Lampoon DVD","review":"Ordered as a gift. Recipent was very happy to receive it and to my knowledge all is well with the DVD. Got the order ASAP prompt. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING LIKE CHEVY CHASE VACATION MOVIES","review":"Bought this to add to my holiday collection and watched it several times. Forgot how funny this and the original were"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic That Deserved Better","review":"I doubt I need to add another review of the movie. It's been on a short list of required viewing every Christmas season. The disappointing part is thinking the upgrade from dvd to blu ray will reap improved audio and video. Sadly, the audio remains flat, compressed, and lacking in dynamics. Worse, the film transfer has to be one of the worst in recent memory. Every scene contains unacceptable amounts of grain and noise that's only magnified by the increased resolution. Granted, it's a silly comedy and not an Oscar winning masterpiece, but considering the number of copies the studio will sell every Christmas season you'd think they'd throw a few bucks into restoring it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Nat'l Lampoon","review":"We couldn't find this product in the stores andwe watched it during xmas and it was just like it aired on tv.Love it! My boys are 11 and 9 and they really loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"There is really no point or plot to this film. I would recommend that you go make some hot chocolate and play Monopoly instead of wasting your time on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD DVD Christmas Vacation","review":"DVD does not play on DVD or BluRay players. Apparently it's too old a version. Wish I would have known that before I purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We're gonna be the hap-hap-happiest...","review":"Chevy Chase did it again. Although this is the worst in the seris it's still phenomonale. In this one Clark invites all of the faimily, except Eddie who shows up anyway. He invites Ellen's aunt who's insane, i.e. wrapping up her cat and Jello mold as presents. Plus, her husband who's like a souped up Aunt Edna. All in all, very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHRISTMAS VACATION - WON'T PLAY","review":"I ORDERED THIS \\"HD\\" VERSION OF CHRISTMAS VACATION BECAUSE I HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED A DVD HD UPCONVERTER PLAYER FOR MY NEW HD TV. I COULDN'T WAIT TO EXPERIENCE MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIE IN TRUE HD. WHEN I INSERTED THE DISC INTO THE DVD PLAYER, I DISCOVERED IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AN \\"UP CONVERTER HDMI\\" DVD PLAYER. DUE TO AMAZON'S POLICY, THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO RETURN A DVD IN AN OPENED PACKAGE. NOW I'M OUT $20.00 BUCKS FOR A USELESS ITEM. PLEASE LEARN MY LESSON....KNOW YOUR SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES BEFORE YOU OPEN THE PACKAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for soft porn. :o(","review":"I'm all for silly movies, especially holiday themed ones that are just plain goofy. But the scene where Clark lies to the sexy mall clerk, saying he's divorced, as he drools over her breasts... then his son walks up as he literally looking up the woman's thigh and picking up on her. C'mon. That's not funny, that's sad. And later Clark fantasizes over this same woman (we get the view of him visualizing her showing up) at his new backyard pool and we get to see a very revealing strip tease? How is this family-friendly comedy? The pool scene really crossed the line. If this were'nt a movie for kids and family I wouldn't care, but how can you target that audience and then show scenes like that? Very poor taste in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, but never received my DVD","review":"I never recieved the DVD that I ordered!! I will never order from amazon again, and if I do never this seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Outdated.","review":"Predictable situations, with old and worn-out jokes, are loosely connected by a weak story-line. Perhaps it has sentimental value for some, but it is a very poor movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a GOOD HD DVD TO OWN","review":"If Your looking for a REAL REVIEW; this movie is HORRIBLEY TRANSFERRED; 15% of the movie seems near HD quality. The opening cartoon is horrendously hazed with VHS quality coating. The sound is Dolby Digital 2CH not 5.1.... Honestly stick with the DVD version and put 20$ towards a True-HD movie like King Kong.... goto hddvd.org to read better reviews. By the way I own the Blu-Ray version and rented the HD-DVD version same quality... almost unwatchable at some points.... I am a fan of this movie and sour at wasting 20$... on a final note is does look better than the standard dvd but you wont be impressed trust me... please leave comments if you OWN the movie in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, hate the DVD","review":"Will all of the reissue of old movies with enhanced features for DVD, why would this disc be released I the same format as the VHS release. I think this is one of the funniest movies around, but the DVD release should have included a wide screen version and restored the missing scenes. There are screen shots on the DVD jacket that are not even on the DVD version. I was very disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Lamboon's Christmas Vacation Blu-ray","review":"This is a terrible product. The sound does not match up with the way the lips move. I have sent one back and exchanged for another. The same thing occurs. I now have to send it back again. I purchased a regular one at Wal-mart (not blu-ray) and there are no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT true widescreen!","review":"What a dissapointment. This is not true widescreen. The image has been formatted so that it is surrounded with gray bars. When the image is enlarged to fit the entire TV screen, the quality of the image suffers greatly. Plus, there is something wrong with the color and contrast of the image. I'll stick with my VHS version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really dumb.","review":"I can't tell you how disappointed we all were by this. Everyone says it's just such a classic, but the three of us all agreed it was really lame. A couple of chuckles and that's it. Rampaging squirrels and exploding sewer gas? That's all ya got? No where near as good as Caddy Shack, Ghostbusters, Planes Trains and Automobiles, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this is by far the best movie of all and it is my wifes favorite movie to watch she loves it"},{"rating":"2","title":"NATIONAL LAMPOON","review":"One of the best National Lampoon's Vacation movies. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is thinking about getting this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ho Ho Whoa!!!","review":"Hilarious! Them National Lampoon films never get old. This one is a nice piece to own for the holidays. Those were the days when Christmas trees couldn't fit in living rooms, Christmas dinners were nice and dry and crunchy like that turkey, and Christmas lights were hung all over the house! A true classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie...second only to \\"Vacation\\"","review":"As number 2 of the 4 series of movies, it's definitely the second-most funny of them (let's not even discuss 3 and 4, agreed?).Just when you think you're going to get pulled into a sentimental sweet perspective on goofball Clark, he gets the floor pulled out from under him (literally).The scene of Beverly D'Angelo's hand-placement when the cops bust in the house is toooo much!Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation","review":"Chevy Chase did a great job in this movie as well as most of the cast. Not many slow places except for maybe when he is in the attic. An unfortunate amount of bad language which makes it not kid friendly and a few scenes they could have done without. Overall a really funny movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD equivalent of a lump of coal....","review":"(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary: Atrocious. Not only is Chase not there, D' Angelo doesn't shut up about her hair and breasts, Quaid has a handful of words to say, and Flynn---a sub, sub, sub-character---does all the talking like a bragging journeywoman actress.Overall: THAT'S IT???? No making of, no deleted scenes, bloopers (which are ESSENTIAL to a comedy DVD), no new interviews. This is the second DVD treatment of this film, what do we have to do, wait till the fifth time around for Warner to get it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My families Christmas Movie","review":"Some families watch one of those old classic christmas movies. Not us, along with \\"A Christmas Story\\", this movie ranks as the number 1 holiday viewing.A funny, funny, funny movie that I love. I have probably seen this movie 50 times and still enjoy it immensely!Better (IMO) than any of the other National Lampoon's Movies, by far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture quality, kind of 'meh'","review":"I'm not sure this was such a good transfer of the film. Secondly if I'd have known it was made in Mexico, using materials I could have done myself at home, I'd have not bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best xmas movie","review":"Bought this one cause it's my most favorite christmas movie.

Terrible quality. You will be disappointed when you play the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price.....","review":"I have been pricing the regular dvd but have seen it for no cheaper than 15.99. With this only 4 dollars more it was an easy choice. Some inside scenes and blacks are grainy but that can be expected with the age of the film. But overall it is a good blu-ray and great if you love the movie as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Very poor quality.
