Even better, you can record mp3's onto the MiniDisk players, you can also record your voice, your playstation/N64/Dreamcast, VCR, TV, Radio, Tape, everything! I almost bought an mp3 player, and im glad i didn't. MP3's are too expensive compared to Mini-Disks, and if you look at the Mini Disk trend right now, its exactly like the CD trend 10 years ago.

The animation is so well done that I find the distinction between it and the live action blurred in my perception. Our 5-year-old and 3-year-old rough and tumble boys love it and request it again and again.

I'm very glad I screened it first. The female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow, boring, and illogical. I'm not very PC with old movies, but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits. Choose one of the other Disney re-releases instead. There are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Don't bother wasting your time or money on this movie. I don't care about the quality of the cinematography, the quality of the story is what is lacking. From the elmination of Jack, one of the Robinson children, to the blatant disregard for absolutely any speck of information from the book, this film will make you cringe in horror. Rather, go get the original book, and curl up with your family and read. It's a better use of your time than watching this garbage. It doesn't deserve the one star I was forced to give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise hit with whole family","review":"Though it might strike some as corny, our kids, aged 5, 10, and 12 all loved it. The treehouse, the wild animals tamed instantly into pets, the thrill of fighting pirates - something for everyone.

Using the remaining recourses of the wrecked ship they build an elaborate tree house. They have a really nice Christmas scene. Then the adventure begins.This movie has a great family feel to it and I really liked the animal races; it is a classic Disney. Do not dwell on where all the animals came from. The pirate attack scene was suspenseful and gives new meaning to log off.

The men in this film have the ability to make a shopping mall with just a Swiss Army Pocket knife. No one eats or uses the facilities & the women emit make up from their pores. No one rips their clothes. It is a perfectly ridiculous Disney film. I would give this film a 10 if they showed something realistic. Even the Hyenas shown in the film which are shown as vilianary creatures about to attack a helpless donkey look like they need to go on a diet and should be placed on arthritis medication. I like cheesy films but this one sat on the counter too long. Do yourself a favor and save your money.

It's just a poorly made (and saying \\"poorly made\\" doesn't do the phrase justice) rip off of the Hulk, entirely shot on green screen with CGI from 1992. I assume they thought it was kind of like a comic book but the backgrounds were created by a six year old. There isn't anyone who can remotely act in this turd - and sadly, it's not even good as one of those \\"so bad it's good\\" type films. It's just bad. And when I say bad CGI, I do not exaggerate.

This is basically because it trys to cover such a large area. Therefore, travellers are advised to use this book as a guide only. It does not compensate for making your own enquies and going 'off the beaten track'. As usual, the book is well organised and reference making access to information quick and efficient.

The Trio comprises Ralph Sharon on piano, Lennie Bush on bass and Jack Parnell on drums, all of whom played in the Ted Heath orchestra at some time. Lennie Bush also played in Jack Parnell's ATV orchestra. The other CDs in the series feature the music of George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and Richard Rodgers. There are 24 tracks including one medley of three tunes. The last track is a composition by Ralph Sharon called \`Sorta Porter'. The tempo at which some of the tunes are played are not the ones we hear most often - like \`Begin the beguine', which isn't (a beguine) any longer but the music is none the worse for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glosses over reality","review":"In his noble effort to encourage peace, the author has written an indictment of US policies, while glossing over the realities of the present world order.

I just replaced my old Olympus mini cassette which was 11 years old and worked great till the day it died. This is one of Sony's take it or leave it products. Dealing with the customer support person was no great experience either. They are going to replace it but I have to pay for shipping back to them first (not reimbursable) before they will send me a replacement. Should the next one be junk (which I expect) I'm stuck.

Having watched both, I have a new respect for John Wayne as an actor.The image on Blue Steel is very good. I'd say about 95% is crisp. For example, Wayne rides a white horse that is a vibrant white. There are a few frames that are washed out and murky. Overall this seems to be a good quality copy. The sound on this copy though isn't good. There is alot of hissing and dropout. The story is engaging.Hell Town is Blue Steel's opposite. The image is dull and murky, but the sound does not have alot of hiss.

A lot of information is not organized logically so it's hard to follow... at least for an artistically challenged person like myself.Not recommended, although you could read it over coffee at your local bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did learn a valuable lesson...","review":"This book covers a lot of what the show says and has to offer. You might as well just watch the show, and have a pencil and some paper ready. It does however, cover a lot of topics such as grooming, decorating, fashion and culture. I bought the book for my straight brother, to try to get him to change some of his not-so-desired habits, and in the end, I realized I might as well just have told him myself. I have gotten out of this a lesson: (Straight) Men will be men, and the \\"Fab Five\\" can tell you the exact same things as five women, so if they won't listen to a woman, they are even more unlikely to listen to a gay man who sounds like a woman.

It helped that I have a few gay male friends who have taste, so it was not a tremendous step to take advice from five gay men. The easiset chapters to put into practice are on grooming, clothes, and culture. Who knew that plucking eyebrows (gently) and caring for one's face twice a day would have people notice? The chapter on clothes is helping to get me out of a predictable clothing rut, and the chapter on culture has some really action-provoking suggestions on going out, even if it's just you by yourself. The point of the book is to gently nudge you into a different direction. The first step is being open to new things. You'll find your confidence increasing and that you secretly covet other men's clothing and hair styles. Check out the music CD, also -- you can dance around while you get ready to go out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a low price!","review":"I needed am armband for my Zen, but all the ones I found were quite expensive.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and recommend this produt if you own a Zen V."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most useless thing I've bought","review":"I think this is the worse investment ever. The silicon case is nothing but cheap plastic and the belt clip that comes with it is even worse. It's so flimsy that I fear using it.

Ill Blood and their S/T were two of the greatest hardcore albums to come out within the last couple of years. If you're a fan of the old No Warning don't get this, it'll make you cry. I'm not joking either, it's freaking depressing. Don't listen to all the Projekt Revolution reviewers. Bunch of 13 year old girls who know nothing about hardcore. I can only hope that No Warning comes back to their senses and a.) gets back on a hardcore label, preferably Bridge Nine. b.)stop acting like they are linkin park(sum 41 for that matter). c.) stops printing this abomination. The only track worth listening to is Dirtier Than the Next. Even that gets pretty 'linkin parkish' towards the end. Disappointing.....very very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a major disappointment.","review":"I consider myself a new \\"fan,\\" of No Warning, having accidentally received their Ill Blood album from their old label, Bridge 9. Ill Blood was wicked. This, however, is completely disappointing. The change in label tells the tale: they went from all-hardcore Bridge 9 to the Linkin-Park-and-God-knows-what-else Machine Shop label. If you're a fan of Linkin Park or Sum 41, you may enjoy this, because it definitely incorporates elements from their music. More power to you. However, if you come from the Old School Hardcore school, like I do, and were really turned on by their previous albums, you'll see this one as a travesty. The worst part is that the songs are almost good, but then they break into a really lame melodic radio-friendly sound right where you think they're gonna let loose like they did in the previous albums. In short, if you were a fan of the Ill Blood or the S/T, avoid this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"All right, I am (or was) a new fan of No Warning, whenever the Hellfest 2003 DVD came out (forgot when it was), I bought it right away. I saw No Warning on there, and I loved them. I bought their S/T album, I love it. Then I saw they were on tour with Projekt Revolution. I was shocked. But oh well, I guess. Then they released Dirtier then the Next and Hopeless Case. Dirtier then the Next isn't so bad. But Hopeless Case. That song is horrible. You might as well call the song \\"Let's make music like Linkin Park\\". I figured that I'll download it before buying it (mainly because I finally figured out they signed to LP's label, which made me really cautious). I'm glad I did. That CD is terrible. If you want to hear what No Warning was before they turned their backs on hardcore, listen to their S/T or Ill Blood CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys should be jailed for selling out so bad","review":"When I first saw No Warning on the Hellfest 2003 DVD I thought wow this is one of the youngest, most full of energy tough guy hardcore bands I've seen in a long time. There music used to be tough as nails, and this album was supposed to be the album that put them up there with the rest of the tough guy hardcore kings. I had NO IDEA that this band got signed to Linkin Park's label, and also went on the POSER REVOLUTION tour. This is probably one of the biggest sell outs in history, any band that goes from making hardcore as hard as these guys used to make it to this AUTROCITY shouldn't be allowed to make music. I say if you're gonna completely abandon your sound and start ripping off Linkin Park at least change your name. The next time any of you hardcore kids see these guys be sure to throw stuff at them pathetic SELLOUTS"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I think that the stength to win album was very ministering to me.

He blames most world problems on the United States in any spurious way he can derive.There are some useful facts here, but read this book with a grain of salt if you have it, or buy a better book if you do not. It is one thing to take a position and justify it, like Jared Diamond in \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", an excellent book, though I disagree with his premises. It is another thing to do as Strauss does in this book and lbindly take a slant, possibly even unaware of the slant, and meander through a supposedly historical acocunt whilst rewriting it to suit your tastes.I wish there was more consistency in the quality of \\"Complete Idiot's guide to...\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The price is good, however the tech details say you'll get 2 times the image, which is not correct.

With most of these songs, Juber uses altered tunings. Overall, these fourteen acoustic solos, showcase his formidable fingerstyle guitar skills.I first heard Juber as a solo artist last year when I picked up a cutout copy of his second album Naked Guitar and was stunned by the beauty of his playing.

For that, I recommend a CD that is among the top 100 of my 10k CD collection: A Beatles Collection by Neil Hogan (Audio CD - 1989).For guitar enthusiasts, I recommend other Juber CDs over this one (even though he played w/ Wings).Also, checkout my favorite guitarist, Pepino D'Augustino, who is light years ahead of the pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!!","review":"Lovely guitar pieces by the Great Laurence Juber.

After struggling with the text, I cannot admit I am persuaded by this book, and, in fact, think it naive in light of recent scholarship in both philosophy and history.

Yet it is clear that neoconservatives are running the bush administration right now, and most sheepish conservatives do not even realize they are supporting people that are diametrically oppossed to them. What makes neocons dangerous is they are so motivated to be wrong. It is like revenge of the evil nerds. It's the battered wife syndrome. Jews get bullied so long they want to become the bullies.

As the opera goes on, his voice can be unsteady and a bit out of tune at times, but overall this is a very good performance. His acting is also very believable, as is Vaduva's. They both look and act the part. Vaduva's voice is somewhat strained at times, but for the majority of the time she sings the part well. Together, Alagna and Vaduva are captivating to watch.

THis is not the case with Deadline of my Memories.Billie wrote/co-wrote/or was involved heavily with each and every track. Her style is raw, creative, and edgy, and not to mention she has that unmistakable voice that is reminiscent of 60s soul Aretha Franklin. There are a few ballads on here which display her range, but then her more upbeat dance tracks really hit the spot for me.Greatest tracks are:Hands Up and AmenStill WatersSpace OasisImitation of LifeWe Shall be TrueYour Loving ArmsGive this a chance, as well as her more recent albums 18 Carat Garbage, and her new 2003 Demos album ([...]).....she's awesome and deserves more recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ol' southern Gospel: Easy Piano","review":"I ordered this book when I started taking formal piano lessons.

And the accompanying pictures, many in color, are by far the best selection of situationist art or anti-art available in print. Included for example are Guy Debord's most famous collages and psychogeographic maps, color reproductions of works by Asger Jorn, examples of the underrepresented German faction of the Situationist movement, a sample from Ralph Rumney's \\"Psychogeographic Venice\\", and many good-quality photos of the various contributors to the movement - with (sadly a key point) accurate captions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly written and understandable","review":"Very happy with this purchase.

It often happens when someone is making up explanation, they make the language so inaccessible that it lends the air of expertise.

Of course there is plenty that is immediately and demonstrably false, and all it take is a little homework to prove these claims false.Frankly, this book could have used an editor, it is a bad, bad read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care much for this super fast pace Bossa Nova.....","review":"I love Brazilian music but this CD didn't do the trick, the music is super fast, if you are like me looking for that groovy Brazilian music that makes you so happy from the inside out?

I liked the radio performance of an under the counter Emerson unit at a Target store, but we needed a shelf model. The reviews on this unit were mostly good and the size and appearance were good, so I bought it. The iPod playback is neat (worth one star) and I suppose the CD player is good, but the radio is not usable - the reception is terrible. Stations that come in well on two other small radios in our house either don't come in at all or are very noisy. There is a little wire for an FM antenna and no way to improve the reception of AM or FM with a better antenna.

No messing around trying to build an engine mount. And gluing balsa wood fins on a rocket can be a challenge for a beginner. This rocket has a 1-piece plastic fin piece which takes all the hassle out of building. So, easy way to get started and get launching. Also, because of the plastic it is very durable. No worries about breaking fins on landing.It comes with the added nose cone helicopter which I like a lot. It just makes the rocket do something a little extra special. This means that once it is launched you have to fetch two parts: the rocket tube and the nose cone. But to me and the kids fetching the rocket is part of the fun.Nice place to start in rocketry -going to give a positive experience both in building and in launching."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Live Audio Document From A Great Band","review":"I picked up a used copy of this disc at a local record store. After listening to the opening track in the store which features a stream of conscious style rant about dogs by The Fall's only consistent member Mark E. Smith, I knew I had to have it. Brix Smith picks up lead guitar duty while Marica Schofield covers the keyboards on this set. I was familiar with Brix's contributions from her work on 'Perverted By Language' which up to the point I bought '...Oranj' was the only other Fall album I had heard. The band plays flawlessly, and Mark E. Smith is in especially fine form on 'Wrong Place Right Time', 'Friendz' and 'Dead Beat Descendant'. The glossy booklet included has some beautiful, color shots from the performance, but there are no video files as mentioned in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"This is a pretty cool movie.

But the packaging is different than advertised and so I'm not sure if it's the real thing or a counterfeit copy. This series is advertised as a limited edition with only 150,000 copies issued and with the serial number stamped into the metal case. But I did not receive the metal case with stamped serial number as shown in the photos. Instead I received a standard double disc plastic dvd case with no indication that it is part of the limited edition issued by Disney. I have not played the dvd and will return it to Amazon so I cannot comment on the quality of the dvd itself. The printed paper liner for the dvd case and the printed books and ads inside the case look \\"like new\\" and maybe they are new. But I am not convinced that they are the genuine Disney product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way all DVD's should be","review":"This is a wonderful set.

This video brings back all those warm fuzzies. This is not my best Davy though. This has Mike Fink the River King in it. Davy is a passive mellow guy and doesn't react to Finks braggert ways. Fink trys to bait him over and over but Davy just keeps plowing on and always wins the bad guys over. Fink and Davy eventually team up to find the river pirates who are posing as the Indians and thieving boats on the river. I relived some good old memories and got to feel like a little kid. I remember wanting a gun from Disneyland so I could be like Davy Crockett. Its kind of funny because I'm a girl but Davy was a real important symbol to me when I was little.Lisa Nary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Davy Crockett: Nearly 50 years old and still good.","review":"I was born nearly 20 years too late to enjoy the Crockett Craze, but I still enjoy this DVD set. I have seen the movie versions; seeing them as originally presented, but colorized, was a treat. I find the 2nd Disc better than the first, as I prefer the Davy/Fink relationship as well as the beautiful river scenery. It does seem odd when the show slips from color to an odd black & white, but I feel it just reminds people of how it was originally shown.I was disappointed in the Fess Parker interview. Perhaps Fess was not up to it the day he talked.I did enjoy the talk about the Crockett Craze, as I found it fascinating. I did feel it was too short, however.I also don't understand how come 2 discs were necessary; 1 disc should have held all 5 episodes plus the additional commentaries.Still, a wonderful DVD.Now, if only they will releaee \\"Follow Me Boys\\" on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment- but Fess Parker was Good","review":"After seeing Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier ( when I was only 12 or 13), I thought that it would be nice to see the second feature film that Fess Parker was in as Davy Crockett. But, I was extremely disappointed, especially that the script was very poorly done, more like a cheap western from TV than the quality film that it could have been. The scenery was beautiful, Fess Parker was excellent in his role, as he always was, but everything else was not up to par. Actually, if I could have rated the film as one and a half stars I would have done it ... two stars is too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"My hubby was really pleased with the DVDs.

I have to agree wholeheartedly with Theresa who penned the \\"Dull\\" review. This has nothing whatsoever to maintain your interest. To me it's even worse than the Artemisia book which couldn't hold a candle to Lapierre's one about the same artist. Why do I get the distinct feeling that this was intended for a Young Adult audience? So many paragraphs merely one-sentence long, so much \\"made-up\\" dialog. I went about 28 pages longer than Theresa but put this into the \\"Life is Too Short\\" category. My husband was shocked when I told him I had chucked it. Also like Theresa, I try to finish books but this one had absolutely no redeeming qualities. Vreeland - unfortunately - for me is a one-book author. I'll not try another of hers. From Great to OK to Bad. Terrible progression."},{"rating":"1","title":"School obligation","review":"I had to read this book for school, but I would never have bothered to finish it otherwise. Most of the characters were not lovable or interesting, and there was no clear plot. The book never resolved at the end and you were left hanging.

I did NOT enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"I rarely write reviews. I bought this book because it was Susan Vreeland!

Vreeland deftly conveys the artist's passion for her work in spite of all criticism. While telling the artist's story, she also tells of the story of a much wronged people, the Natives of the Northwest. The imagery used is wonderful and filled me with a longing to visit BC. She also explores the concepts of traditional Christianity and athe challenging larger view of God as believed by the Native peoples. It surely makes you think. She also was able to convey Emily Carr's passion to be an artist above all, and explores the artist's reasons for doing so. The book makes you think on many levels and sparks the creative juices."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forest Lover","review":"I read this book for a class and can't imagine why it was chosen.

Can't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking in the life of an artist","review":"Vreeland's account of Emily Carr's life paints a visual conception of her life that feels like a personal experience. Her writing reminds me of Barbara Kingsolver, another favorite of mine. She is very descriptive in both scenery and characters.

It's live, not studio, live.That being said, it is quite fantastic. It documents the band when they were really at their best. It is packed with energy and emotion, something that often gets washed away with slick studio production. It is raw, as mentioned, and that is why it is so great.Camera work? I like it. It's natural, gives you some vantages you wouldn't have if you were there, and feels as raw as the music without being sloppy.For the most part the sound is quite nice..better than I expected anyway.

For a first espionage novel, he's successfully integrated all the ingredients of a typical spy thriller: a diabolical plot, page-turning suspense, interesting and dynamic characters, and meaningful dialogue. But there's more. Frieden has carefully blended the storyline with marvelous, off-the-beaten-path settings in France, Mexico, West Africa, Southern California and New York, bringing a refreshing international feel to the reader, while also avoiding super-human attributes for his characters, particularly the cunning hero, Nash. The book also offers something for the espionage afficionado--which I am not--including details that can't possibly be far from the truth. And if it is the truth, the Middle East is in for a rude awakening. Definitely an enjoyable, easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"headaches, but yeahh","review":"anyways, i was looking through for some games to play with... and found htis board game at my so's room.. and i was in love with scrabble at the time...and this was an awesome idea!!anyways, i thought it was grand, me being a genius in math and algebra was easy as cake. well, years after calculus.. oh man! it gave me a headache towards the end, but i was determine to win by a landslide.- the instructions were poorly written.. omg, trying to interpret it was a pain.- the tiles were kind of cheap and not that durable to me.- the board was like any other board, but if a deluxe version came out, i would totally get it- tiles slide easily on the board- it's easier than you think- it's an olllddd game, don't expect it to be awesome and new lookin'..

The movie was artsie, but very slow moving. Once the plot began to unravel, I was waiting for the movie to end. The only reason why I finished it was because I was watching it for a class. This movie is the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen. I would never recommend it to anybody. It is a sickening and disgusting waste of time.

The only thing and I mean the only thing in this film that was even worthy was Bob Hoskin's preformance.I will not be seeing this film ever again and I hope that Atom Egoyan has learned a very important lesson in making so-called thillers because this one was so dull.

I tried to seek out his other stuff while globe-trotting, with little success. I found 'The Sweet Hereafter' powerful, but much more straightforward, than 'Exotica', and thus somehow less satisfying.'Felicia's Journey' is arguably a step in the wrong direction - less obtuse than his previous works, it lacks menace, substance, passion. I am not a big fan of Bob Hoskins in the first place, and I did not find his performance convincing here.If you want to watch something creepy but intelligent, I recommmend Todd Solonz' 'Happiness', 'Pi', or Egoyan's truly mind-blowing 'Exotica'.

Not an accurate replica of the original LP jacket, but extremely nice nonetheless.When this 2008 Japan SHM-CD mini-sleeve, with a new remaster, was announced, I pre-ordered it, thinking it would possibly be even better than the Repertoire.Not so. Upon arrival and performing an A/B comparison, the Repertoire blows this Japan version out of the water. The Japan disc sounds muffled in comparison; the difference between the two is not trivial.The Repertoire was also a limited edition, and is now OOP, but there are a few copies left here on Amazon for sale, as of this writing.

(I also used J.G. Links' Venice for Pleasure for sightseeing advice. Don't go to Venice without it!) I found Steves' book excellent. I stayed at a recommended hotel (Hotel Campiello) and it was just as described. The walks and museum tours are uniformly excellent. Only once did I have trouble and that is because a street named in the Rialto to Frari Church walk is either wrong or the sign identifying it is no longer there. However, the map in the book makes the route clear so that problem was cleared up in about thirty seconds. The writing is breezy, a bit irreverent, and easy to follow. The supplementary information is great. I used Steves' book on Amsterdam on a trip last year and was similarly impressed with that guide. He has me hooked as a steady customer and I will purchase his Rome book before my trip next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"I was a big fan of He-Man as a kid.

It was first released in the 50s and the Long John (Robert Newton) character and Jim Hawkins (Bobby Driscoll) are standouts, and between the two leads there is real comradarie! I actually read the Robert Lewis Stevenson book when I was 8 years old (I was reading on a junior high level). Only after that did I see the movie. It was anything but a letdown; the book seemed to come to life! I honestly do suggest reading the classic first and letting your imagination people the story first. All in all this is a wonderful movie, and well acted in this version. It is not as accurate to the book, but it's enough to make you want to go find some treasure of your own. In fact you may discover, as did I, the tale itself is the true treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl G-Shocks suck.","review":"Like I said in my other review for girl G-shocks, they all seem to suck.

When we hear or see the words, Devil, Lucifer, or Satan, we automatically presume it must be based on evil doings, and Satan's plot to overthrow the Kingdom of God.This book was all about God.It offered the concept and thought in order for us to experience good and bad, peace and chaos, there needs to be something or someone to represent the good (God) and the bad (Lucifer).The story constantly reminded me that my thoughts, and beliefs are choices I make based on free-will and those become a creation of heaven and hell.Yes, it gave me food for thought, and it gave me joy and understanding and brought me closer to God.It was beautifully written, fast paced and a quick read. This book is motivating, inspiring and enlightening!Don't let the fear of what you think it's about hold you back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misguided","review":"This author does not appear to know the true God. These are personal beliefs written in the form of fiction. There is no scriptural basis, and the story is so against what the bible has said re: Lucifer, it is obvious she has not done any study ofher subject matter.

This story will keep throwing unexpected twists at the reader, just when you think you've figured out what's going to happen next.It's not necessarily a story which will linger with you for a long time afterward, and it is not much more than a novelette, easy to finish in one afternoon's read.

I especially liked the pictures of all of the labels and listings at the end of the book of all of the wineries from this area.

For warm but not hot weather I've got this bandanna and its working great. Most if not all the sweat is going somewhere else than my eyes. I kind of like the purple with lightening bolts, it doesn't make me any faster, the color doesn't run, and you can't see it under my helmet but I know it's there.On color fastness, seems to hold it after repeated wearings and machine washings.Anyway if you are looking for a mid temperature 50F and up solution for head sweat while riding this fits the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Material not so great","review":"This item did not really work that well for sweating.

Bird is a layperson describing events and accordingly provides a superficial account of Koream events. This is also a perspective of a Victorian lady with all the prejudices of that bygone era. The book is amusing from that perspective and is more like a novel; but it is hardly a scientic or sholarly study--if you are looking for a more scholarly work in your study of Korea and its history at this time you might instead look to more a recently published work and written from someone with appropriate educational background and training.Accordingly, this book should be read with a grain of salt as it is written by a layperson with all prejudices of a bygone Victorian era. It is hardly historical. It is perhaps like reading WWII American accounts of the Japanese empire and its people and taking that as the historical perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merlin The Return","review":"This is slightly different from the traditional King Arthur and the knights of the round table.

He asks if he can tell us what he wants to tell us before he tells us. He tries several communications techniques, including a few duds that work as speeches given over rubber chicken dinners but bog down in print.

And I should have expected it - this album was put out 2 years after Bradley's death. It appears that when these songs were recorded, it was never with the intention of placing them on an album, so don't expect studio-quality sound if you decide to give it a listen.To make matters worse, some songs are a lot shorter than their studio versions, and some songs are live recordings yet not labeled so on the case.

Saw Red, Boss dj, Mary, This train, Dont push, Freeway Time, and of course pool shark are all legendary trax.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Acoustic","review":"This is one of the most incredible acoustic albums ever recorded. Some songs have obviously been recorded at a coffee shop or some other venue in which live music is merely meant to serve as a backdrop for drinks and discussion. Though the constant buzz of people can be annoying, and the sound quality isn't the greatest, both of these things are also rather endearing, and add something to the album. A few songs, are taken from Sublime's other previously released albums (such as Rivers of Babylon from A 40 oz. to Freedom). There are a few songs that aren't to be found on any other releases that by themselves would warrant the purchase of this album.

This is a tribute to a the money the record company is earning with is name. This record is quite bad, not because of the songs but because of the quality of the recording... Many people all over the world only going to know sublime's music by this record and this is not a good way to remember Bradley. Sublime's records better come to an end. Lets keep the good things they did in the past in our minds and not making Bradley's death a business. That's my opinion of this record: a good business.

I have used Corelle dinnerware for most of my life but I found that I like Pfaltzgraff dinnerware better. Pfaltzgraff is a heavier dish and holds the warmth of food better. Because the size of the Tea Rose mugs are a little larger than most, they hold more coffee/tea. The mug handle fits either the female or male hand very comfortably. The only downside is that the Pfaltzgraff dishes have a tendency to make marks on each other when sliding over the surface of each other such as when stacking in the cupbooard.

They scratch very easily, dark gray scratches. The old style scratched also, but not nearly as bad as the new ones. I have posted a picture showing how dark the scratches are on the new plate vs the old plate. They sell porcelain polish that will supposedly take the scratches off, but who wants to polish their dishes with porcelain polish every time you use them?

I was also pleased to see that it contained two canned soup recipes. On the other hand, the recipes were primarily chutneys, jams and other items that were neither unqiue nor particularly varied. I was extremely disappointed with the inclusion of modified food starch in the apple pie filling - isn't avoiding modified or unnatural ingredients one of the great motivations for canning to begin with?

Not retractable, but 100% reliable.From my experience with retractable cords, I would guess that some of these will work, some won't.

Richard Petty, Jeff Gordon,Davey Allison,Alan Kulwicki and Bill Elliott are the main people in this story.David Poole allows us to get to know and care about all of them and those that Alan and Davey left behind.(long may they run) Read this book.You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting book","review":"interesting book on the final race of the 1992 winston cup series season, and going through the perspective of that day through all 3 major championship contenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better purchase individual phrasebooks","review":"You are better off buying multiple phrasebooks for all the countries you plan to visit.

Overall the layout is understandable. The overview of tones in each language (there are a few tonal languages in the region) is handled well, and the pronounciation is good enough that you can be understood when you try to speak the sentences.The book falls short in what it decides to translate. We found out, to our dismay, that the phrase, \\"where is the toilet?\\" was not to be found. This is the primary reason for the low rating. The first words presented in the chapter are basic introductions, which are good. However there are some emergency phrases that should be placed better. \\"Where is the pharmacy?\\" is a phrase that was cleverly hidden in the text.Hopefully these issues will be cleared up by the second edition. I would recommend against using this book as it stands now as your only reference when travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but feels cheap..","review":"I have been wearing these shoes for about 4 months.

This movie brings me back when growing up in a Spanish Harlem. It is realistic, from the beginning to the end. Each character in this movie is some one we know out there, they are so believable, that one could swear they've come across some of them at some point in their lives.The plot of the story is very realistic l, from the financial difficulties and struggles that some Latin people in New York City come bypass very day, to the love and romance in the two individuals feel for each other. It's a true example to how every day is a struggle to survive and make ends meet on top of all the discrimination that some go through out in the real world.Over all, this film will make you cry, laugh and re-think about the struggles that some people have to go through to get to where they are or they want to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this movie 1/2 a star, I would.","review":"I think Lauren Velez is a great actress.

To all those who actually liked this movie, I'm not too suprised. Your bought into what Hollywood thinks of Latinos, and you really don't mind if this stereotype continues. Maybe if the director knew a little bit about Puerto Ricans, he might had put some effort into making the Puerto Rican characters real enough to believe. As a Neuyorican with dignity and respect for myself, my family, my community, and my ancestors I give this movie an F.To the director, and producers, \\"Put your money to use, pick up a book about hard working, educated Puerto Ricans.

My dogs have chased, chewed, buried and played tug with this thing and there isn't a hole to be found. I just got done using it to play tug with my 65 lbs shepherd mix (a daily game in my house) and besides a little slobber it's in the same condition it was when we got it.

Let's see, there's this beautiful, talented, smart, and perfect girl who loves her Mommy and Daddy a lot...(16-year-olds DON'T go around calling their parents Mommy and Daddy!) There always has to be some guy who is a relative...or somewhat related that's in love w/the girl. He is unable to like any other girl, since she's \\"special\\". I find it very disturbing how that plot is repeated over and over again...Summer and the people around her talk using vocabulary and metaphors that normal ppl would only use in writing. Normal teenagers don't talk like college professors! There also is always some person who flips out, or is extremely religious... This book is so unrealistic. Harley looks like Kevin Bacon?!!

Seriously...they should get a better ghostwriter who can come up with original and realistic stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the girl on the cover ?","review":"In the introduction, the writer describes Summer as having turquoise eyes, ebony hair and slightly dark complexion with freckles .... so who is the brown-eyed, medium-brown haired girl with creamy white blush skin on the cover and inner jacket of this book ??? I guess details don't matter to anyone associated with the production of this novel. Artwork doesn't have to match the text and the publisher doesn't care if they conflict. This book is intended to quickly separate $$$ from our wallets simply because it has the name 'V.C. Andrews' emblazed on the cover. (And I'm really surprised they did manage to spell the name correctly.) My collection of these books stops today. And frankly, I wish I was smart enough to have stopped much earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"I started reading the Andrews novels over 10 years ago and was totally hooked. Rain was the first Andrews novel I'd read since the Landry series.I started reading the novels again because I wanted something fun to read while studying for the Bar Exam. The other books in this series were bad, but End of the Rainbow is one of the worst novels I've ever read. I kept reading the other novels because I kept expecting Rain to lose her inheritence or something unpredictable to happen.I really don't think the ghostwriter planned this novel very well. It was as if he had one storyline going and decided near the end to have Summer and Harley trapped in the basement. Ridiculous.If End of the Rainbow is any indication, the better days of the V.C. Andrews novels are over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommnded for little kids","review":"This really stupid if you like the original VCA books. I, for one, think the ghostwriter needs new material and better characters. Those who say Summer is a \\"strong\\" character need to read the Heaven series and FITA. Then see if she's stong. Oh, she was so deprived from good upbringing!! Her Mommy and Daddy tortured their little Princess when they gave her gifts and hugs and kisses. Such a horror story. I expected to find this in the children's section of the bookstore after reading it. Poor VCA, she must be so embarrased to have such kiddie stories written under her name!I'm sorry, but Summer was a weakling. Why would she go out to the guy's car to, um, talk. Yeah, right. She odvously doesn't know much about guys.So this book is good if you like children's books, the eleven-years-olds seem to like it... but if your a real VCA fan... it just a sad disappointment.Hopefully Willow will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"VC Andrews Must Be Turning Over In Her Grave!","review":"OK, OK. VC Andrews books are a guilty pleasure but this was unbearable. I can't wait to sell it on Ebay or Amazon Auctions. Talk about boring - all you had to do was skim the pages and you got the story. And the story is another rehash of mean people, inner/inter family love, etc. The ending made no sense and hopefully the ghostwriter will realize that the next time he is writing a series to stay out of the present time for the time for all the books. This book could have been written by a 12 year old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cure For Insomnia","review":"God what a horrible book! The ghostwriter should just stop now and quit disgracing the name of a very talented writer. If the name V.C.

If the straps were anything like the described \\"PowerWeb Plus with tubular edge design,\\" I might have been very happy with the product. As I received it, I was very worried that it wouldn't hold 200 lbs, much less 500 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Genius","review":"I saw him play many times,he was just an understatment of a genius, very shy and low profile guy, but what music!

This sauce claims to have a one million scolville unit heat range, which is completely false advertising. I tastes like a generic tobasco sauce that you might find at a 99 cent store. The heat is similar to tobasco sauce as whell. If you like vineger based sauces you might like it, but it's not worth the price, plus shiping if you ask me. I probably would have given it a better rating if they hadn't lied about the heat. It's just nothing special, the sauce actually started turning black in my fridge, and I've on had it for a couple weeks. The taste got worse too, I have no clue why. I'll close by saying if your looking for a good tasting hot sauce with some real heat look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat with flavor!","review":"I have tried many sauces, and I like them hot.

I watched the four episodes w/missing laugh tracks, and it\`s similar to watching a hilarious movie in a theater w/100 people, as opposed to watching the movie by yourself. It just SEEMS funnier.It appears that Paramount may have halted shipping & production of the season 4 sets, judging from Amazon\`s stated 3-5 week delay in shipping.

Well to that I say penny wise and dollar stupid. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful DVD release","review":"I was so looking forward to this season. These DVDs were to replace my 20-year-old tapes. I watched about 10 minutes of \\"Opie the Birdman\\" and was so disappointed I took the DVD out of the player and am returning the set to Amazon. The picture was worse than my old tapes. Furthermore, the episode, like all TV episodes that have a laugh track, is paced to allow for that track. The absence of the laugh track totally throws off the pacing of the episode. It's not a matter of \\"needing to have someone to show you where to laugh\\". It's a matter of being able to enjoy the episode with silence during the long pauses where the track is supposed to be played. The delicate pacing that is a hallmark of TAGS is completely thrown off by this absence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"One of the best shows ever. A classic!

The other \\"Life\\" song, \\"Street Life\\", is a classic that deserves so much better. When you redo a classic, even your own classic, you've got to really come with it. I'm still screaming for Randi Crawford and that image of Georgetown at 11:00pm on a Saturday night in June. Funny, I don't remember much more about this CD, hmmm.

The new DVD release is a joy: the incredibly cinematography looks gorgous, the award-winning soundtrack pops, and the commentary from William Goldman adds new insights to this unappreciated classic.Harper is a classic, very funny, character-driven private eye yarn with a great cast set against the hopped-up world of mid 1960's LA. Sure, maybe a few things are dated but this film stands up very well after more than 40 years. The truths of Harper (people are crazier than bedbugs, they lie, surface appearances deceive, but once in awhile honor prevails) remain valid. More important, this film is \\"a gas\\" (in 60's parlance) to watch. The only thing missing from this package is a CD with Johnny Mandel's complete score (I know this is out on vinyl but haven't tracked down the CD -- yet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harper - The Private Eye returns !","review":"\\"Harper\\" with Paul Newman is a great way to spend a quick 2 hours. Newman is surrounded by a great cast that includes Robert Wagner ( A very good role for him.) , Shelly Winters, Robert Webber, Julie Harris, Janet Leigh, Strother Martin, and Lauren Bacall. The screenplay, the first written by 2 time Oscar winner, William Goldman, is witty and fast paced. Some of the characters are quirky but the movie is fun to watch.I am a fan of the private eye films of Bogart, William Powell, Dick Powell, and so many others. For years, no Hollywood studios made a private eye film. The studios felt the private eye movie was \\"old hat\\". \\"Harper\\" marks the return of the private eye movie.Enjoy !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Newman","review":"This smooth, smart mystery film stars Paul Newman as Lew Harper, an LA private eye with a busted marriage, a down-at-the-heels Porsche, and enough attitude for three shamuses (shami?). Harper is a certified smart-#ss -- and no one does smart-#ss the way Newman did it. The movie is slick, cynical, and funny -- a pleasure that's downright addictive. Try it; you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harper on DVD in November.

Expect \\"Harper\\" to be loaded with features including an audio commentary from its screenwriter William Goldman who has already done the A.C. to Newman's \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\\" I can't wait and bravo to Warner Brothers for having the guts to release two important films from the 60's on DVD: This movie and \\"Petulia.\\" Hope \\"Any Wednesday\\" or \\"Kaleidoscope\\" would be next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soaring and Complex Harmony","review":"I have seen these folks at Irishfest in Milwaukee, WI.

I always thought Chicago's Philip Devlin did The Homes of Donegal better than anyone until I heard the version on this CD. This one is a close second.

There are several standout tracks including the title track, 'Born This Way', the ballad 'Arrested by You', 'Occupy Your Mind', 'Nothing Has Been Proved', and and the club classic 'In Private'.The album, bathed in late-80s technology, has aged quite well considering techno music from the 80s doesn't sound so fresh in the millennium .

Her phrasing is perfection from the greatly underrated dance track \\"Reputation\\" to the classy Tennant-Lowe songs \\"In Private\\", a Top 20 UK hit and \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\" from the British movie \\"Scandal\\".Rare for Dusty is a nostalgia track, the Gerry Goffin and Carole King song \\"I Want To Stay Here\\", impeccably updated for the 90s.

For a world traveler, Olsen is about as provincial as they come. He distrusts nearly all natives (except those with bongs to share) and encourages readers to travel to distant lands so they can hang out with other westerners and protect each other from the native population. Unadvertised as well, much of his tips relate to how live on $5 or less per day, which even most college students will find unappealling. His advice is overly simplistic and oft repeated.On the positive side, a few of his travel anecdotes are amusing and he is very enthusiastic about seeing the world. I recommend this book to anyone who's under 21, has no money and wants to get stoned in 19 different countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you're a doofus!","review":"If you're 20 years old and love to drink beer until you puke-- this is your travel guide.

After reading the love-it-or-hate-it reviews, I decided to borrow this from the library before buying. I am so glad I did.This book could be titled \\"the spoiled kid's guide to making Americans even more hated abroad.\\" There is a complete and total lack of respect for other cultures, and a definite sense of \\"I'll do whatever I want, whereever I want, and if you're offended and you feel like I'm spitting on your culture, then *&$^% you.\\"If you want to perpetuate the image of americans as spoiled, loud, rude, and culturally insensitive, please buy this book.I feel like I should apologize on behalf of all Americans that this book even exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good motivational read for prospective travellers!!","review":"I managed to take a short (7 week) trek through South America during my college days and am currently planning a larger-scale open-ended world trip. This book offers great motivation and shall help one to keep the dream alive as they slave away to save up the cash. Based on my own travel experiences, I found this book to be highly accurate in its descriptions of how the general backpacker circuit functions. However, the chapters on the various individual circuits around the world can be entertaining (On the Stoner's Trail), but they barely scratch the surface. This book should be seen as a general introductory guide to travelling and (contrary to the author's recommendation) should be supplemented with an up-to-date guidebook for the region or country of interest (Lonely Planet and Let's Go are good ones).This book is worth reading and, if nothing else, shall motivate one to complete the hardest task of travelling; setting off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you are affraid, or simply curious about backpackers","review":"Although I like the style of the author, direct, funny and full of personnal impressions and comments, I found this book quite innapropriate for wannabe travelers. Of course, I disagree with some of tha author's \\"advices\\" or comments... and of course I did not learn much reading his book... (and I doubt anyone who seriously thought about traveling would) However, I have to admit I would have loved to read that book in my late teenies and even my very early twenties. It is sometime disrecpectful, sometimes close to racism, sometimes just dumb... BUT it can help to motivate young people to find their way when they dream of a round-the-world travel. And lets be honest, most backpackers of the world share the same \\"disrespect\\" and \\"foolishness\\" as Brad Olsen... I am sure you can find better books than this one... but if you want to have an idea of what your road fellows might look like, read that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For First Time Travelers Only","review":"If you've ever traveled for more than two weeks in a foreign country - then this book will provide very little new insight. It covers only the very basics of travel - all the rather obvious learnings of ones first adventures abroad. The country/area guides are too vague to be of real use. However, if you are straight out of college, travel inexperienced, and looking for some general advice and practical tips in an entertaining (lots of cartoons) and lighthearted fashion - this might be a good pick. If you have any experience traveling overseas or consider yourself a mature traveler -- skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"VALUABLE Travel Book And A GREAT Read","review":"World Stompers is packed with valuable information that only an experienced, world-traveller would know!!!!

The book it can be useful for teenagers and college kids that have never wandered very far from home, as it provides a health excitement about world travelling and good anecdotes. However it is shallow, repetitive and opinionated. It is the world as seen from a rich kid perspective.

Let's lay on the sterotypes shall we?? To publish in a book sold round the world, the view that Aboriginals can be found \\"boozin\\" in any town in Australia, inclined to 'howl' that \\"I wanna piss-up now, woman!\\" is morally reprehensible at the least, and perpetuating yet more stereotyping, violence and black deaths in custody at the worst. This blinkered, narrow minded, patronising, attitude shows what little respect and sensitivity the author shows towards the cultures he visits, and I certainly wouldn't believe anything written except as the rambling of a little little man, let alone let it be my guide for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthy teacher?","review":"It's disappointing to read about an enthusiastic world traveler's unashamed lack of sensitivity to the culture that he's visiting. Included in the author's comments on Egypt was an incident in which he and his girlfriend were kissing under the dome in a mosque, for which they got kicked out. The author recounted this incident as funny and seemed to show no remorse for his offensive behavior and lack of cultural understanding. You know, it might seem like a tiny point to some, but this is exactly the type of behavior that has led to the closing of many mosques and religious sites to non-believers. It seems the author himself still has many lessons to yet learn from his travels."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Worthless Stupors\\" is a more apt title!","review":"I hope no one takes this book to seriously. All the author does is condense all those silly conversations that westerners have in \\"traveller's cafes\\" in places like Istanbul, Yangshuo, Pokhara, and Bangkok into a philosophy that fits between the covers of a book. It is not original, it merely repeats mantras that have been said many times in the past. I strongly suggest that not buy this book, instead buy one of the many alternatives out there on the market(\\"The Practical Nomad\\" comes to mind). If you want to hear this stuff inspite of my warning, go to one of those aforementioned cafes and order-- say some banana pancakes, maybe some museli, or because you are in an exotic locale you could shake a leg and get some vegemite-- and then sit back and listen.

This is largely due to the fact that the primary character for this book, Brujah Archon Theo Bell, is easily the most interesting, most sympathetic character that we've seen in the series. Granted, we've seen him in earlier books, and had a definite impression that he was a likeable character (if not one that I'd necessarily want to meet in a dark alley)even then.

Her voice is as a wonderful instrument and her rich contralto has never sounded better. Spoon is incredibly sexy, and Drama is mesmerizing. The funky tracks really swing and the ballads are beautifully sung. My only caveat would be that some of the productions are a little stale. This is noticeable especially on Drama which is marred slightly by the intrusive drum machine.I would have loved to have heard more arrangements like those of Between the Sheets on the Fourplay album, and Miles Across the Room, where she benefits from a more sensitive context for her amazing voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure it's not a Prince album, featuring Chaka ?","review":"I must say this is a disappointing album. I had read marvellous critics about it and I maybe was biased, too exacting, or I expected too much. The fact is that this sounds surprisingly more like a sub-product (that is \\"cheap\\", because of its lack of imagination and quality) from the Prince organization than a Chaka Khan album. A lot of machines, artificial sounds, and very little harmony and voice. Chaka khan only starts singing on track number 10 (a long wait), though she does it remarkably from there to the end. The rest, as I said, is quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Chaka's voice and sometimes like Prince tracks.

It has her trademark Funk, R&B, Jazz, Pop, Hip-Hop, & Gospel, all done with a sensuality and intimacy that only Ms. Chaka Khan can bring to the table. From the opening title track, you know that you are about to experience a full journey. This CD brings all of Chaka, in her various incarnations, full circle. There are no sleepers on this one and it is most disappointing when the CD comes to an end.

The story might not have been the most dramatic plot, but you could really read the feelings of the character Fanny in the book. I do regret that Fanny could not get more of a backbone at times as other reviewers have said, but I think that Fanny just saw that as part of her job in being a politician's wife.I did not know how I was going to like this book because it seemed more geared to middle aged women rather than someone in her early 30s, but I have to say again that I enjoyed it very much.I have checked out three more of Buchan's books from the library, and I hope I will get the same type of story from each of these as from The Good Wife Strikes Back.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a more mature chick lit type of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Disappointing!","review":"I finished the book this morning, and I'm still waiting for the wife to 'strike back' . . . and she never does.

So when \\"Fanny\\" finally gets some time to herself (after 20 years of thankless service to her husband and his political party) and goes to Italy for a few weeks, is this supposed to be the striking back part? Maybe British wives are more resigned to giving up their identity for the sake of the marriage - maybe they are just bloody fools. I don't know, but the book was a huge let down.

Their first album, At Rock Bottom, shows thet an independent release can maintain high levels of quality both in musicianship and in audio engineering. Scrappy's songs are reminiscent of a more gilded age, but maintain a very fresh sound. Creative impetus and guitarist, Scott Kinnebrew leads this beligerent new band out of the cellar and into your mama's lap with his rascally lyrics. Walker Young, Bill Smith, Mike Alexaneder, Isaac Stanford, and Aaron Spears round out the sound of these eclectic ragtime groove monkeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear vision screen","review":"This Timex is simply fantastic..Clear screen with a large easily viewable display.

I had another company inform me of this problem before he sold me a movie. Because of learning about this fact we cancelled that order and he refunded my money. How considerate of that person to be so honest. I consider the company that sold me In Harm's Way (Region 2) was really only interested in making money and, not caring about the customer.

While \\"Pearl\\" does a better job on effects, the \\"older\\" stars (Wayne, O'Neal, Douglas and others) in this film give riveting, no-nonsense performances. In fact, they fit comfortably in that \\"greatest generation\\" characterization: the characters didn't mince words, worry about feelings, but delivered their lines with confidence and meaning.One of my favorite Wayne movies that I watch over and over again. I good war film to show your kids before they see \\"Pearl Harbor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be \\"In Love's Way\\"","review":"This is NOT, repeat NOT, your typical John Wayne movie. It is NOT even a war story despite the title. It is a love story. In fact it is multiple love stories with WW-II in the Pacific as a backdrop. This is a reversal of a war story with a love subplot to keep the female audience interested: The war backdrop in this movie is intended to keep the male audience interested. Not only that, but it is lacking in a number of ways, beginning with Douglas's character -- an officer who is constantly in trouble, including starting a bar room fight, and still remains an officer in the military. The ship models for the battle scenes are not accurate either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc won't work in DVD players in US","review":"You must have a region 2 DVD player for this movie to work.....

Any US sold DVD player will be region 1 and the movie won't play....don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISUSED TALENT","review":"When this movie was released, Otto Preminger himself appeared in the trailer, stating that he wanted to depict the human drama of the American fighting man's recovery from defeat at Pearl Harbor and his eventual turning of the tide in the Pacific. Great idea for a movie, but the producer missed his mark. Why didn't this movie make use of the real places and drama? Though there are great stars, stark photography, and a Goldsmith score,it badly misses the mark. The sea battle is pretty clearly meant to be in the Solomons, but is irritatingly disguised with fictional names for islands. The battles themselves are portrayed in a non-realistic fashion. Too bad. The real ones were marked by great courage and luck. The ships very much look like the models they are. How about the story? Plenty of melodrama, a sort of Peyton Place set in the South Pacific. If you're a history buff with any interest in WWII, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"World War II Melodrama with 1960's hairstyles.","review":"A long and tedious WW2 soap opera that strives to be an epic love story and gripping War drama ala \\"From here to Eternity.\\" Where it succeeds it is also let down by implausible plotting and some phony heroics near the end when Kirk Douglas seeks to redeem himself following the suicide of a girl whom he raped and throws his fate to the wind in an against all odds mission in the service of his country. The movie simply loses credibility on that scene alone. Some decent acting by all involved doesnt elevate this film any higher than a bloated attempt at oscar nominations."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you NOT like a WWII John Wayne Movie?","review":"Ordinarily, a fictionalized WWII movie would drive me a little nuts. However, when you have John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Henry Fonda, it's hard for a director to mess things up. I guess my two favorite parts are when John Wayne is on the cruiser during the Pear Harbor attack and when he is promoted by the \\"Fleet Admiral\\", played by Henry Fonda as the thinly disguised Chester Nimitz (he played Nimitz again in Midway). It's definitely worth adding to any collection of classic war movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duke does the Navy","review":"Great movie for John Wayne fans. Classic war sequences and plenty of action but not as graphic as new millenium movies. There are many other stars in the cast including Patricia Neal,Burgess Meredith, Carrroll O'Connor, Henry Fonda, and Paula Prentiss. Award winning muscial score too. It has long been a favorite of mine"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Harms Way","review":"Bought this movie for a friend who likes the old action movies, he was very happy and watched it as soon as he got it in his hands...\\"nothing like those old classics\\" he said!

Recommends it to anyone who likes action, war etc...films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play Battleship Instead.","review":"Producer Otto Preminger doesn't have time for emotion and he doesn't tolerate any in his actors, even when a young ensign finds out his fianc�� committed suicide or another lost his son. They don't even get misty-eyed. Music that reminds you of whales suffering indigestion or flatulence is supposed to add to the suspense just before the battle. Some of the battle scenes look like they were shot in a bathtub. The captain of the cruiser in which part of the film was shot wanted to throw Preminger overboard several times. (Why didn't you, Skipper)? The actor who played the ensign also played the boy in \\"Shane.\\" Even greats like Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal, Burgess Meredith, Tom Tryon, and Paula Prentiss can't keep this movie afloat.I'm on a roll of bad war movies. Play \\"Battleship\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"I gave this as a gift to a friend. It was something he's always wanted.

The story concerns two Navy officers coping with the aftermath of the attack. The film has the look and feel of Naval officers suddenly shifting into a war footing, and their behavior in the sudden new environment. One of the bertter John Wayne war films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A balance of war and the drama it brought to people's lives","review":"This is a story one can watch and rewatch and be drawn in each time. If your idea of a war story involves Matrix type effects, you may find yourself very surprised to be pulled one that the acting carry's the story and not the effects. Yes, some of the effects were not as well as they could have been, but this is a movie to be seen and appreciated. John Wayne carries the story, but Kirk Douglas's supporting role is riviting."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Harm's Way-excellent","review":"I have seen this movie dozens of times and is just as good as the first.

I found this book indispensible in its informative snapshots of high school boys from different backgrounds. It is clear that the language arts do not suffer from irrelevance for boys but perhaps from being taught in such a way that does not connect the texts with the boys' existing literary knowledge. After reading this book, you will learn that there are many ways to engage boys in the teaching of the language arts. I highly recommend this book.

A nice blend of romance and mystery. The only minor downside was the vulgar sexual language. Not that I'm a prude - far from it! - it just didn't fit the tone of the story.

I wasn't sure whether there was a murder, two romances, filial confusion or simply a way to publish erotica under the guise of romance. Romance should reach far above explicit descriptions of body parts.Belinda's character couldn't make up her mind whether she was a good Catholic girl or succumbing to her biological clocks screaming 'hurry'. Seth on the other hand was described as a 'sweet, nice, thoughtful' man who apparently didn't know how to control himself or had a dual personality. On one hand he was considerate and caring - he tried to protect Belinda from danger. On the other hand, he used her body without consideration of the effect his leaving would have.The supporting characters are well described and add color to the stories. The mystery was buried but worth digging to find.

Fate throws them together when Billy is convinced that what appears to be an unfortunate death is murder and Seth becomes her partner in detective work.

The character design was very blah- although I did enjoy Gnorga The evil Queen of the trolls. The character that got on my nerves the most was Gus. (The little, fussy kid that was spoiled rotten to the core.) I usually like watching movies where i enjoy the main character- but this movie only made me hate him. I was actually glad at the near end when something bad happens to him- too bad it didn't last. The songs didn't appeal to me either. The little kids I know aren't fans of Don Bluth- and obviously- neither am I. If I were recommend a Don Bluth, The Secret of Nimh was pretty well done. It could be that I saw the wrong Bluth movies, but i'm tellin ya this isn't a 5 star, 4 star, or 3 star movie. Show your kids, or watch a a movie worth your while!

The troll is sent to the human world, kids find him, they sing songs,and so on. The story drags, and by the end you could careless about what happens to the troll. I think one of the reasons I never cared for this was because I compared it to Bluth's other films. I loved Land Before Time, Thumbelina, All Dogs Go TO Heaven, heck, I even enjoyed Rock a Doodle...but this? Not so good. It's as if he had run out of imagination when creating this stinker.

The final shots of Manhattan being strangled by these predatory lianas building by building look as a horror film culmination. I do not want to elaborate on the songs and gags - it's all very inferior.I am no big fan of Disney, but at least they have a basic idea of the quality control - I can not remember any obvious flops leaving their assembly line.

The editing is atrocious and jumps throughout the entire show from musician to musician. Rarely is any musician shown for more than 2 seconds and the editing is typical of the MTV herky-jerky, ADD/ADHD-type editing so prevalent in video music today. It was impossible to enjoy the play of any musician in this terrific band. Compare this type of editing with, say, the 1991 Paul Simon \\"Concert in Central Park\\" where the viewer/listener can savor the world-class musicianship of this crack band with reasonably sustained individual shots of the players. The Holland technicians seem obsessed with their technical prowess, acutely jumpy editing, and the DVD viewer's enjoyment of the musicians is left wanting.

His character, Chester, is riveting and achingly fleshed. 1959 Vaughn in a white dinner jacket...and the jail cell scene takes my breath away every time.The soul of the movie is good triumping over evil, even if it takes good a while to get there.

I'm sure they must have toned the film script down quite a bit from what the book was like, but it's still pretty raw.

These would include Villanova, Paoli, Swarthmore, Haverford, Radnor, etc. All very upscale and socially desireable communities. Rittenhouse Square (the opening when the wedding takes place) is in Center City Philadelphia. Also ritzy, but not Main Line. South Philadelphia is...well, South Philadelphia. The stereotypes are well-drawn, quite full of themselves and very over the top. Then again, maybe the rich really are that different. The acting is great, the stereotypes entertaining and the story quite enjoyable.

Also, the Vizio has several settings beyond \\"Custom\\". So after going through the video setup, I was not sure it had helped. I then tried some of the other settings after making the initial changes, such as \\"movie\\" and \\"game\\", and found one that made the adjustments look great, even at 480i.

The first book in the series was great, the second was o.K., but this book is a bloody mess! I don't even know what I've read half the time, I was so confused. The author's switching of p.o.v. every other page made me completely space sick. I lost track of much of the action because of this hyper active story line.

See series review on the Reality Dysfunction: Emergence page."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre story lost in long-winded tedium","review":"Two Stars - Two complaints:1) The book (and its successor) could do with some SERIOUS editing; they are way too long. I'm surprised that SO many words can say SO little.2) The sub-title should be Part 5 - that is what it felt like from start to middle. (It doesn't have an end - the words just sort of stop.) The book cannot stand on its own.Hopeful for closure to those dangling sub-plots (inventive and nicely interwoven), I pressed on through \\"FAITH\\" to be rewarded with a hasty Sunday-school, comic-book wrap-up. I guess Hamilton got as tired of typing the fluff as I did of skimming it.OK, maybe that is three complaints. I wish I'd got my hands on the \\"Condensed\\" version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space opera at its best","review":"Building upon the characters and concepts introduced in The Reality Dysfunction, this book is exciting and an enjoyable read. Though the very first novel in the series dragged a little, by the time you are a few pages into this you will be hooked! Suspension of disbelief has never been easier or more fun. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulfilling Finale!","review":"Anyone who has read the complete 'Nights Dawn' series by Hamilton will only be able to say 'Wow!' The scope of the series, in terms of number of characters and storylines, can only be described as awe inspiring. That Hamilton manages to contain all these threads in a coherent overall story is astonishing. 'The Naked God' is everything the final act of a series should be: it pushes the speed and tension up a notch, introduces even more characters and races towards the ending at breakneck speed. Some reviewers have complained about the sci-fi staple ending, that is the deus ex machina. But I feel there is no surprise here. The title of this volume gives it away from the start and right from the very first volume the reader knows there is something out 'there' that can help mankind solve the possession problem.'The Naked God' is science fiction on a grand scale and should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just Have to Give it 5","review":"I might be a little generouse in giving TNG 5 stars, but based on the past two books, I think I can give Hamilton a little slack. The series as a whole was jaw-dropping. I have no other way of describing it. I felt that TNG did get a little tedious at places, and the end was rushed. I felt that Hamilton could have used at least 100 pages just wrap it all up, instead of the 20 or so he used. His world-building was on a scale that I can only compare to Dune or The Hyperion Cantos. I was the perfect merging of space opera, nano-tech, VR, horror, fantasy, and 20 othere genres I can't even name. To be blunt, this series had it all, and TNG was a satisfying end to it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"After being floored by Reality Dysfunction, and entertained by Neutronium Alchemist, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this final book (through the delay). How disappointing it is, as the story seems to fall apart. Perhaps it's the slash-and-burn style, and some difficulty in maintaining interesting characters throughout. I don't know. All I do know is that I had to nearly force myself to pick it up and finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad slog","review":"I have to agree with the majority- it was a poor dwindling effort compared to the excitement built up so well over the first 3 books (the 4th started to get tedious). I could not care less for some of the characters ie Valisk, and found myself skipping over a lot of purely mundane description and tedious development. The only memorable thing was the xenoc development including Kiint, Tyrathca, etc. Like some other reviewers said, the ending/solution is just like a huge broom sweeping dust under a carpet- it lacked imagination and elegance. A pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed with the end","review":"I read all of this series and enjoyed them greatly. Five stars to all and worth the price - until this latest. After a wonderful world building and setting up the fearsome returned dead, the author solves all with a classic Deus Ex Machina. I was terribly disappointed but will probably continue to buy his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I started reading The Reality Dysfunction exactly two years ago. It has since been the most exciting voyage in Hamilton's future world. I strongly recommend the trilogy to anyone who likes a really good story combined with great characters in a fantastic, detailed world. This book has the most spectacular ending and it has been worth while waiting those two years..."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are not the Kiint","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I was a little disappointed with the ending. And I would have liked more about Syrinx, Tranquility, and the Lord of Ruin. But none of this takes away from the quality and readibility of the series as a whole. In particular, the possession of Lalonde and Calvert's escape therefrom was especially well written and riveting. As for humanity's ultimate solution to the possessed problem [dont read the rest of this sentence if you haven't read the book] -- what else, but throw the dammned beyond the beyond, whether they are ready or not. Nah, we are not the Kiint. Here, Hamilton got it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deus in the Machine","review":"Peter Hamilton manages to wrap up this series with a literal deus ex machina. (Insert complaints here) This is the only way this was going to work, really. He wraps up the story very well, but a bit too neatly. It's worth the read, but is not as compelling as the first two novels. I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleeping genie","review":"I can't escape the feeling that Hamilton got saturated with the plot and wrote quick-fix finale. It turns out sleeping god is in fact sleeping genie. Therefore 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least they spelled \\"God\\" correctly","review":"This finale also kept me turning the pages right to the very end. The book ties up most of the threads of the story at the end in a deft convergence of a bunch of story lines. In fact, approaching the last pages, you begin to wonder how any of these can be resolved by the end. Most of them are, but, as pointed out by others, a couple of the story lines are left hanging. Although I've enjoyed the series greatly, one thing kept jarring me all the way through: Why does every human in the known universe speak in British idioms like \\"bloody\\"? This definitely makes this an \\"alternate universe\\" story; it's not \\"bloody likely\\" in our universe! The other quibble is that I have never seen a published volume with such a multitude of typographical errors. The proofreaders must have been on holiday during the production. English and grammar purists, prepare for many, jarring speed bumps as you race through this final installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book with a lot to ponder","review":"I enjoyed this book. In \\"Exploring Heaven\\" Arthur Roberts covers a huge area of topics. He does so from a very reader friendly position. He admits that there is much to heaven that we can only speculate about. His speculations are based on solid logic and fact. This makes his ideas very plausible and believable. He even covers a bit about hell. I was especially helped by his understanding of how believers in heaven will have a new and perfected body. The social aspects of heaven being both in ways like a rural setting and in other ways like a city were also helpful. As we can only ponder the afterlife, we can here on this fallen world still find joy in following Jesus Christ. For Jesus is the only one who can get us to heaven. The love we experience here between people is a glimpse of what God has in store for those who love Jesus as Savior and Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible is too good a word","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen.

Sam Brannigan is a hero that every woman dreams about and I have always thought that Ms. Martin should write a story for Sam's younger brother and future Senator Peter Branigan.

Growing up in another state, this was my first introduction to southern Louisiana in any form and a teasing glimpse of the city I knew I must one day call home...at least for a while. I find the acting in this movie exquisite from the ENTIRE cast; this being almost the one time that I found any of Melanie Griffith's work to remotely resemble her talented mother's. As for the characters, having lived and travelled often in that part of the country I find them most believable and their dialogue quite adequate. True, some of the plot is a bit of a stretch, but this is a drama and even the Greeks jazzed up their work; no pun intended. This is a good glimpse into the world of a people who guard their secrets like they guard their family names and community status.

But that's what deceptive about this film, the title, The Drowning Pool, really have nothing to do with anybody being drowned in a pool. It is a lame and tired blackmail plot and Newman is trying to found who is doing the blackmailer and why. Like all two fisted detective tales, our hero was bound to run into some mysterious and eccentric characters (as well as run around half naked on the beach to show how virile he still is). Well, he did, in a way....a boatload of bores. The only interesting bit here is a very young Melanie Griffith (in her natural brunette locks) playing an oversexed Lolita.The end, which I will not spoil for you, is quite ridiculous. Something about filling a room with water.I am sure the book, which this movie is based, was much better. Why else would they even consider making the book into a film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"you will drown","review":"This movie was almost funny it was so bad. Imagine 'Chinatown' with worse acting, cliche one liners, cliche characters, cliche plot, cliche social tensions -you get the idea. For example: Paul Newman is a California private eye who goes to Louisianna for a job, so of course his west coast-hood runs into the cops and their southern-hood, a standoff of exchanging one line dialogues. But smooth ol' city boy talks his way good and doesn't get killed or shipped out of the state. The whole time I'm watching this, I couldn't find any way to take the police's threats seriously. The only thing that made me sit through this movie was I had never seen Paul Newman before, and it looks like I'll have to try another one if I want to see a character with some depth and less predictable personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long-awaited treasure chest","review":"This new collection of Gordon Jenkins tracks is something I've been waiting for ever since CDs first appeared.

The special effects are horrible and even though there are some good actors (Michael Dunn, Donald Pleasance) in the cast, they're totally wasted. Fans of the sword and sandal genre might be interested in seeing former Hercules Brad Harris in one of his post strongman roles, but this one is so bad that it makes The Fury of Hercules look like high art. Julie Ege is gorgeous and she almost makes a few scenes worth watching, but overall the movie is just terrible. The plot involves a mad scientist trying to bridge the gap between human and plant life. It should have been buried in the far corner of the garden.

It's very well written and makes you FEEL exactly what she's talking about when reading each poem.In addition, I've spent some time dealing with things like abuse and alcoholism in my family as well, and I think anyone that has can relate to some other poems in the book.And for any woman that has juggled career and independance and wondered if she'd ever find love, happiness, peace... I think you'd enjoy this book too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry???","review":"What the reviews do fail to get across is that this is a book of poetry.

It was a fascinating read and showed the reader how the process of songwriting was done for the 40 years of Mercer's professional career. The only issue I had with the book was the rambling repetitive quotes the author used from his sources. Obviously he interviewed people and recorded their responses. Unfortunately, the author quoted them verbatim instead of editing them for sloppy grammar, syntax and repetition. Otherwise, an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hommage Album.

While the story is a \\"moral\\" one, the cinematography mesmerizing, and editing pretty good, the overall film feels slow yet empty. It's very easy to follow, but you never get to feel for the heroine. Speaking of which, the actress is way too old for her role -- the character's supposed to be \\"between 16 and 18\\" at the beginning of the story!This movie is not a tragedy; it's a tribute to human dignity and the will to survive. Unfortunately it has a pretentious feel to it that, coupled with the rather harsh acting style, makes it a rather unsatisfying movie experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The characters bring this book to life.","review":"With what could be a true to life situation, these multi-layered characters bring Sweet Suspicion to life"},{"rating":"2","title":"this single was greAT but the video needs more work","review":"this single was great, they let the fans pick the single.

This band has a definitive retro 70's sound. Nothing wrong with that. Its done well, and I find several of the tunes to be original. They sneak in \\"The Girls Attractive\\" which is a hybrid of 80's synth, 70's guitar, with a touch of Talking Heads type lyrics- and it works- rather well!

However, this articulate, anguished, and witty novel is a delight for literate readers. Its complexity mirrors the modern world, and its hero struggles to do the least wrong thing, as right is not an available option.The many witty book titles, little jokes, and ironies alone are worth the read. Better even than MATING. Norman Rush has written a brilliant novel (How pleased Ray would be at that adjective!)--too good for most of the hack reviewers to appreciate, alas, but a landscape readers will want to explore through the entire journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death -dealing","review":"This sometimes briliant sometimes funny, sometimes fascinating novel.

I am afraid this book was a mortal blow to my desire to read any more of Mr. Rushes work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I read enthusiastically so-called 'novels of ideas' -- but this is bereft of ideas and really is junk. I am so mad I wasted my time reading 700 pages of small type text. The characters do not act or speak true to them themselves, especially the principal woman character, Iris. There's a one-chapter speech that at least is shorter than the speech in Atlas Shrugged, but must be on what people base the contention that this is an intellectual novel -- boring, boring, boring. The prose is fairly leaden. The setting is exotic, but one doesn't really learn that much about Botswana as a result (see Kapuchinski, Shadow of the Sun to learn about Africa). Maybe people like the fairly abundant sex or sexual content in the book.I could not more highly discourage you from reading this book. Amazing to me the positive reviews it has received. Read Madison Smartt Bell's triology on Haiti instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I enjoyed Mating so much, especially the first half.

He had long requested it and I finally gave up on the local used book stores and came to Amazon. Go figure - they had access to several used copies. As for the book itself I have yet to be able to pry it out of my husbands posession long enough to read it. I guess that's a good thing.My husband says that he now understands most of the harsh statements made about Askins. He from all accounts was not a nice man. Askins from what I've been told (via my husband reading passages to me), was a hard man raised by a hard man. He was more than likely to hold a grudge and yet seems to be able, in time, to admit that. While not agreeing with everything Askins says and does, my husband still acknowledges his skills and in some very weird way likes him. Maybe its the time and place, that makes Askins not so much acceptable but maybe more understandable.Maybe when I get to read the book - I'll have a better understanding and review."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fascinating Story of Charle Askins","review":"There is a tendancy in reading this book to judge Charles Askins on the basis of current political and cultural standards. This, I believe is a mistake and also unfair. Askins grew up in South Texas in the shadow of the old west. Gunfights were still not uncommon and crime was dealt with in a different way.Askins knowledge of guns, his skill in their use, and his experience in using them is something that you will not encounter in people of this era. His writing is not half-bad for a man of limited education and often quite colorful. The stories are fascinating.For all of his liabilites, upon reading this book, one often feels the world would be a better (and safer) place if men like Mr. Askins were still around and it is often worrisome, in this world of political correctness, how this nation would fare in a war of major proportions with a populace that is indocrinated against guns and violence and where boys are made to behave like girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the same color","review":"I purchased this watch for my daughter, her favorite color is red and she liked the look of this watch.

Sure, the paper airplanes, boxes, & cards are cool, but I'd more appropriately call these fun paper toys.

Why? Remember the domino theory that got us into Vietnam? Well, if tiny El Salvador goes Commie, then they'll soon be in Mexico. Be afraid, be very afraid!It didn't happen. The Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and we won the war against the Red Menace. But was it worth killing thousands of Salvadorian peasants?

The John Lennon Anthology box set is really a great thing to own, it has John in acoustic mood, live mood, drunk moods and even full band moods. With great performances of songs most of which remained unheard until this release. The book that comes with it is also full of interesting writings and details.

Most if not all of John Lennon's songs are on this box set.However, each of these recordings are all different versions from the original recordings. I like the more discoey touch on Whatever Gets You Thru The Night. The cover version of the Ronnette's Be My Baby is just awesome. And John's performances on future Ringo gems I'm The Greatest and Good Night Vienna are quite charming.A few clunkers here and there mostly on the first CD. Do The Oz is a bit grating and God is too repetitive. Some of the snipets of John talking are more interesting than others. CD three is probably the strongest although two is a close second.Overall, though this box set is very refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"John's in the sky","review":"This set shows us the real John, the passion and hard work that went into the making of each song, and fun and frustration he had while making all those beautiful records. There are four discs here, and each one individually is worth more than the total cost of the set.Chronologically, this collection takes you on a journey that picks you up at Working Class Hero, and leaves you with John whistling and strumming his guitar. When you're finally dropped off, you can't help but lament that the ride is over.The packaging is almost as interesting as the music. The set is decorated with John's art, and the booklet (a full 60 pages) is very insightful. I'm sure you're already a fan of the late Mr. Lennon, but these four discs will show you a side of him that you can't see anywhere else. This collection is truly priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long John Silver's Treasure Chest","review":"I read a lot of reviews before buying this. Once I got it and started listening I realized all those reviews, with their complaints about this or that, were beside the point. Just like this review is. If you want this man's music, then get it.

There is no reason for a victorious army to burn down a city which they had just liberated. Istanbul has more Greek influence than Smyrna, why didn't they burn it down as well?

The reader may think that these events happened out of nowhere. The author does not mention how the Turks were treated in Greek invasion of the city. He does not mention how the mosques were torched, peope were peed onto etc... Or, how the Balkans were ethnically cleansed from Turks which they hold a majority. Greek nationalism gave rise to Turkish nationalism. So, cause and effect principle. Greeks are the victims of a movement which they caused at first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smyrna 1922","review":"This book has been popular, because no one independently checked the statements in the book. Many of the facts came from the papers of Admiral Mark Bristol, USN, in the National Archives. To that extent, the book is accurate. However, Ms. Housepian is an Armenian hater of Turks, and she created some \\"history\\" when she wrote the book. I know, because I have boxes of original documents left by the man she credits with the rescue, Asa K. Jennings, my Grandfather. His assistant was my Father, Asa W. Jennings. Ms.Housepian does Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and Turks a disservice by not sticking to the truth. This is not a scholarly work. The best book written on the disaster of Smyrna is Ships of Mercy by Christos Papoutsy. That book contains some of the many original records of the events, and is a must read for anyone interested in Smyrna, Greece, and the Greek, Armenian and Jewish people.

In the real world, he would have been considered something of a gold digger, or moocher.KS tends to use the same names for her characters in her books.

However, the quality of the item is subpar to say the least. The panel is bowed in several areas, making it difficult to stand up. I purchased this item to use as a room divider and photography prop. I am still able to use it for both purposes, however it doesn't look as nice as I had hoped it would. The bowing of the wood really makes the item look cheap and cheesy and I probably won't have it for long because of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dachshund Love","review":"This book helped me learn more about Dachshunds.

After filling many\\"40 hour\\"1 Gb discs, and struggling for years, much of my work has been destroyed by this incorrigible piece of work.Sony should refund its users of this unit and openly apologize. The recording part is fun and seems as though it will work, like Sony says it will.

I'd hate to see the format die. Unless they start making bigger Hi-MD discs it probably will get beat out by hard drive based devices.The main reason I bought this thing was its ability to record a decent sound - and to play back well.

I have Freud, Porter Cable and Craftsman routers and none are as smooth or as quiet to use. I bought this router to fabricate MDF raised panel looking cabinet doors because it requires a plunge base with a vac system to remove the massive amount of dust produced with MDF groove routing. Setting the depth of cut was a snap and when I figured out how to adapt the shop vac hose, dust was almost non-existant! It is powerful enough and light enough to operate by hand and make repetitive cuts without fatigue. It also balances on the work well so you can watch the cut knowing the router is flat and you are in control. It comes complete with a hard case so it isn't setting on the shelf getting banged around between uses.

The centering cone/pin was missing, but since I have others this wasn't a show-stopper. The broken quick release latch on the fixed base was. It appears that the poorly designed molded case was the culprit for the damage since the routers are not firmly held in place. Also, accessories would not have secure places in the case.A call to the manufacturer offered the addresses of the nearest factory and service centers, both hours away. I requested that the missing pieces and broken parts be sent to me and I would do the repairs. Not acceptable to them. So much for excellent customer service.

Opened the tool case and found acrylic plates floating around out of their slots, which I don't believe could happen during shipping if they had been in their proper slots. Noticed small dent by power cord receptacle which was caused by something sharp like an awl. Inspected acrylic plates closely and found many scratches. One quick release latch was completely broken off which also couldn't have happened during shipping. After seeing these things I immediately packed it back up and ordered a replacement.

My actual total usage time was less than 20 hours but the warranty had expired (at the time the warranty period was shorter than the current period) because it just sat in its box for a long time.Took it to a local authorized dealer and motor replacement $ was as much as a new router. I seriously thought about buying a new router but I had a D-handle for this one that I really liked. Asked it to be repaired but wait!

What we have here is an intriguing premise that fails to recieve a compelling development, delivering a melodramatic, dull, repetitive and annoying love story between two uninteresting characters. Nicolas Cage spends half the screen time drunk, making his character an irritating and sappy individual, and Elisabeth Shue gives a fine performance in a movie that doesn\`t deserve it. \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" tries to be subtle, introspective, intelligent and moving, but it ends up being contrived, boring, patchy and disposable.This film deserves a skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaving Las Vegas (Movie)","review":"The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points.

Metophorically speaking, it's like coming out of a club at closing time, the bright lights come on and your true self is exposed. This movie captures the nature and mentality of an alcoholic. It's not depressing, it's a reality that has been confronted and candidly projected on film, and skillfully acted out by Nicholas Cage. He captured the essence of an alcoholic and brought to life the struggle of a lost soul who has given up on life. Elisabeth Shue also does an admiral job playing his love interest.

An insult to us all.","review":"I don't know what movie you all are reviewing, but the Leaving Las Vegas I saw was one of the most over-hyped, overblown, pseudo-intelligent movies I have ever seen. That's all I'll say. Perhaps I had overly large expectations due to the fact that this movie ran away with an Oscar or two, but this movie fell short on all possible levels. Frankly, I think its an insult to us all, a movie that tries to make a statement about how love can transcend boundaries but falls about 3.5 times short of a good story and plot. I've seen plenty of good movies in my day, and this is not one of them.

I can't stand watching movies so set out to impress, and so devoid of any emotionality as this. But, what completely shatters whatever hope you have left of the film, is the acting. Cage displays some of the most blatant, and pathetic overacting I have seen in my entire life.At times, watching his overacting was almost funny, but at times it was just gruesome. Shue just seems detached. See, the problem with all these so-called actors, is that I can actually see them acting. The plot is also riduculous. How completely gone do you have to be to agree to let a man you supposedly have feelings for \\"drink himself to death\\"??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"I laugh at those who call this an \\"honest\\" film...it is as Hollywood as they come.

That isn't an \\"honest\\" or \\"powerful\\" statement about alcoholism--it's just stupid. If he was REALLY an alcoholic, he'd have said \\"You are wasting my booze!

I thought Nicolas Cage's acting was exceptional. It's a pity he hasn't done anything this good in decades.A coupla things bothered me. I didn't feel Elizabeth Shue was quite right for the role of the hooker.She's a decent actress, but are hookers really that hot? I've never been with one, but from all the hundreds of police show mug shots I've seen over the years I don't believe I've ever seen one that hot. Maybe the police just arrest the ugly ones.And why was Shue��s street dress that high up? The top part was almost up to her tits. Didn't seem quite right. Overall the movie was great because I cared about the characters and wanted to watch the thing till the end, which is a rarity for movies these days.

It's, without a doubt, Leaving Las Vegas. The Academy Award committee has a long, extensive history of giving out nominations and wins to actors and actresses playing drunks and prostitutes. And what do you know? For their absolutely mediocre performances, Nicolas Cage won it, and Elisabeth Shue got nominated. Somehow, there must be a link between alcohol/sex and the members of the Academy. Let me tell you: anyone can play a drunk, and it takes no talent to pull it off. And anyone can play a hooker, and it takes no talent to pull it off. That's exactly what the two leads did in Leaving Las Vegas. There is no story either, and it is a one big nothing. All in all, there are way better films than Leaving Las Vegas such as Honeymoon in Vegas and Swingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, shame about the DVD!","review":"This has to be one the best movies made in Hollywood. But you can read the other reviews for the movie itself.My concern is about the quality of the DVD release. If this had been the first DVD I'd bought it would have put me off them for life. It seems that they have used a very low resolution MPEG compression, and then used some sort of noise reduction to cover it up, which just smears the already poor picture. It can clearly be seen in chapter 16. Just watch the wall behind Cage. And if you run it slow, you can see the smearing effect very clearly.A very poor quality effort. The laserdisk looks much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Overview; Bad for Small Details","review":"Preparing for a trip to Mallorca, I borrowed a German map from a neighbor.

Lightfoot addresses most of the major questions pertaining to the process of Scripture being written, copied, preserved and transmitted through the course of history. He is very economical with his words, avoiding pedantry and maintaining a readable style. While this book will lead the serious student to do further reading, one cannot ask more from an introductory text on this topic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarnished Scholarship","review":"Dr. Neil R. Lightfoot provides an overview of the collation of the Biblical text. He provides sufficient detail for understanding various components of such a complex history. However, the lower rating derives from repeated frustration at perceived apologetic overtones throughout the book. For example, on page 29 he discusses the fact that the original New Testament manuscripts were written in the contemporaneously common Greek language. He ascribes this to \\"the providence of God, since the gospel was to be proclaimed to every creature, that the New Testament writers made use of a language that was known throughout the Mediterranean world.\\" Such unsubstantiated assertions (and his near polemical treatment of the uncanonized status of the apocryphal texts in Chapter 15) mar an otherwise decent exposition. I would advise looking elsewhere for a less overtly-biased historical account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading for starters and advanced scholars.","review":"I read both Greek and Hebrew and I read all sorts of materials on bible studies. but every scholar needs a short concise book on these subjects.

This is somewhat understandable, but diminishes the worth of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good apologetic","review":"Simply terrible.

If you are looking for an argument for the validity and perfection of the Christian Canon, then this is the book for you. If, however, you prefer an actual scholarly account of the derivation of the Bible, you may want to look further. The author does not even so much as mention the Nicene Creed, which was probably the single most important event in the creation of the Christian Canon. He also mentions only the oddities existing in the non-canonical texts and fails to mention all of the striking similarities that would argue their validity. I congratulate Lightfoot on his completely biased and selective account of the history of the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christian apologist's view of Bible history","review":"Neil Lightfoot has written this slim, and I'm afraid rathershallow book to help Christians bolster their faith ratherthan shed light on the objective and all too obscurefacts surrounding the origins of the most popular bookever written.All in all, it's fine for a sunday school class that isn'tall that serious about the subject, but it doesn't do muchfor someone really wanting to know *all* the facts, positiveand negative, about the history of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Simple Study of How We Got the Bible!","review":"It is reported that Neil Lightfoot gave his complete speech to the University in New Testament Greek when he received his Ph.D. He knows the Bible from the original language and has thoroughly studied the manuscript evidence as well as the history of how we got the Bible and is eminently qualified to write on the subject.

It's scope was fairly limited, and while the premise appeared to be that medieval Christianity was developed by competing notions of prophecy and order, this work neither substantiated the claim with any truly academic prowess, nor did it really stand out in the long list of historical accounts of Christianity.

Freddie was an excellent comedian, and I would highly recommend this CD. It is observational comedy with an ethnic twist. If you are hyper sensitive and extremely politically correct, maybe you won't find the ethnic humor very funny. But things were different in the 70's and I find nothing wrong in the way in which this was done. Freddie was very funny and didn't say anything inappropriate as far as I'm concerned.

I am not saying that the score heard in the film was bad. I am saying that this is not the score I heard in the film. I am not sure what it is. It is reminiscent of soundtracks issued during the 1950s where composers rearranged their film scores for commercial record albums.Composer, Marvin Hamlisch recorded the music in the film very well and seemed to be quite intuitive on what was required for different scenes. I believe that composers writing a Bond score are given great liberty to call upon previous musical cues from earlier entries in the series and write them into the score. It is very possible that Hamlisch was permitted to include only his original compositions for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Blush!","review":"Love this blush!

I gave it 5-stars this time, so the average will be 4.5. I'm still not happy about the non-variable trigger, but this saw has noticeably less vibration than the Bosch. Even though the Bosch could start at lower speed due to the variable trigger, the Bosch still jumped quite a bit when transitioning from stopped to the lowest speed possible by slowly squeezing the trigger. So there was no advantage there. Once running, the Milwaukee was smoother. And everything about the Milwaukee's adjustments is just better. For example the shoe tilt is tool-less, the positive stops are better, and the non-marring shoe cover doesn't require a bunch of screws.So I'm now returning the Bosch to get back the Milwaukee again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I have used","review":"This saw is vibration free right out of the box. The supplied blades (2) provide a clean cut with little tear out. The saw is a pleasure to use and performs well using any of the 7 available speeds. The adjustable orbital action comes in handy as well for adjusting the saw to the material being cut. I grew up using an older B&D jigsaw and there is no comparison. This saw is well built, powerful, and easy to operate.

In this autobiographical \\"verbal adventure,\\" Nabokov delivers an amazing treasure which all writing enthusiasts should hasten to consume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak, Memory","review":"One of the best biographies ever written---evocative, moving, gorgeously written---and, with Pale Fire and Lolita, one of Nabokov's three best books. Do not miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"A guided tour of Nabokov's refined, humane sensibility: this book will make you think hard about love, human idiosyncrasy, and the role of aesthetics in our lives. There is no arrogance here, merely an un-American reserve that avoids the sanctimonious self-promotion of the talk-show and the newspaper column. Read it--it's worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This book is a fantastic recollection of the moments and incidents in Nabokov's life which so profoundly afffected him. Written in the usual Nabokovian style, so if you're expecting a dull, chronological recitation of the major events, you won't find it here. An enjoyable read, though I would probably rec it to fans of the man's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"great memory, bad book","review":"Obviously, I am the only philistine here, but I disliked the book, and gave up after the first 100 pages or so. The reviews here call the book tedious, irritating, haphazard, etc., yet they obviously found something to savor in it. Alas, I am not one of them. Perhaps it was the writing style that did me in, as I am not familiar with the author's other books. But I do think most memoirs benefit from having at least a rudimentary linear format. This book was like what the mind may do before you fall fully asleep - it plays hopscotch and images, people, places, etc. all tumble about willy nilly. I don't think imposing a more straightforward format on your memories necessarily destroys the beauty of them. It's just common courtesy if they're going to be out there for the public to cnosume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultured Discourse","review":"In Speak, Memory, Nabokov, who is known for crafting memorable sentences in his novels, attempts to apply his abilities to a story that mirrors all the elegance of the New York telephone directory. And he comes up short.If you open the book to any page, you are likely to recognize his rich writing style:\\"This final dachshund followed us into exile, and as late as 1930, in a suburb of Prague (where my widowed mother spent her last years on a small pension provided by the Czech government), he could still be seen going for reluctant walks with his mistress, waddling far behind in a huff, tremendously old and furious with his long Czech muzzle of wire - an ��migr�� dog in a patched and ill-fitting coat.\\"But you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

The hero's fianc��e is killed by mobsters. The hero suffers brain damage from the attack and can only remember the last fifteen minutes. He constantly makes notes to himself as he tracks down the mobster. The hero is played by Aamir Khan who starred as the kind nice teacher in \\"Taare Zameen Par,\\" which also he directed. The movie is well done, but violent. Not your typically Bollywood movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller !","review":"You will see a different side to Aamir in this movie. What a transformation! He worked out a whole year to get that amazing body. He delivers an amazing performance as a man suffering from short-term memory loss out for revenge on Ghajini, the man responsible for his condition. The music is wonderful because it is composed by the brillant A.R Rahman. Overall, I am well pleased with this movie. It is action packed, with good music and some romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I reviewed the movie on the other product, so I'll talk about the DVD instead.","review":"The packaging is refreshing and not anything huge like Om Shanti Om.The special features are just different subjects on making the film(making the action, making the songs, etc.).

What a made-for-the-masses, poorly acted (yes, amir sucks in it) movie that features one too many gratuitous scenes of pointless violence. We get the point - his wife died and he's a pissed off man. If I could give this 0 stars, I would - sadly I don't think that's an option.Soundtrack isn't half as bad, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after all the hype","review":"We purchased this movie after all of our friends and family had told us that we should see it. We also knew that it was the highest selling Bollywood movie ever. We had high expectations.We were very disappointed when we watched it. The story was implausible and unnecessarily violent. The actors did a good job and the music numbers were good but the movie didn't work. It was like a comedy/love story and a violent drama got put together without enough effort made to connect them."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING AND EMOTIONAL!!!","review":"OMG!!! I saw Ghanjini during Bollywood week on the IFC network. It was sort of by accident because I was checking the guide and read the description and became curious because it sounded exactly like a description of the movie Momento (EXCELLENT movie, by the way!!!). So, I decided to check it out. I was NOT at all disappointed! This movie is so incredibly executed and brilliantly acted out. I was literally on the edge of my seat during most of the movie! What an amazingly genius potrayal by lead actor Aamir Khan!!! Brilliant! I can't say enough about this movie. This Christmas, I bought two copies.....one for myself and one for my dad. He loves action-packed movies that are done with class, style, and gripping performances. Ghanjini fits that description PERFECTLY!!! Enjoy it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The songs are awesome","review":"Of course, Aamir's acting is certainly not as good as Surya's, and in his own words, he had a supremely tough time getting Surya out of his mind since he made the mistake of watching the Tamil version before embarking on this project. Surya is a bloody good actor and it is tough to live up to standards he sets.But whether you like the movie/storyline/acting or not, just buy the dvd for the songs. The songs are awesome. ARR scores once again.Though the storyline is basically borrowed from Memento, it is very Indianized, with a lot of good humour and really emotional, touching scenes, like the ones with the blind man and the disabled kids. These small things melt the audience's hearts and make them better people without them realizing it.Buy the movie. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollywood copies Hollywood (again!) but fails again!","review":"Another poor copy of a Hollywood movie the class movie 'Memento'.

On the other hand, if the circuit is not powered up, this circuit breaker finder is useless. If that distinction had been made clear in the item description, I would not have purchased this item.

It has an \\"continuous automatic calibration\\" function. According to the instructions on the unit, you \\"scan over all circuit breakers\\" then \\"rescan until the green LED only lights over one breaker. Rescanning causes unit to learn which signal is strongest.\\" I found this setup a bit tricky to use for the first time. It also means that it cannot be used to find other plugs on the same circuit, or to find wires in walls, as people do with the manually calibrated units.Also, the unit cannot really distinguish the two sides of half-width breakers.

Now I have gotten the second one and it does the same thing. I have emailed Zircon and asked them about it, but they seem to ignore my emails. I don't know what to do, it works with the light, but it does not make a sound like all the literature says it should. That includes the paperwork I got with the unit.

She desperately tries to appear witty and experienced only to come off as a preformance anxiety filled writer(2-3 stars at best). The physical layout of the book is a desk top publishing nightmare - with the margins so far in on all sides to give minimal words per page, yet streching the length of the book (perhaps an attempt of overconpensation, hehe). This book had huge potential and its a shame a better writer didn't grasp the idea between his/her hands before Hamilton.

However, this book was not up to Sue's talents. I very seldom don't finish a book - but I stopped reading this one half-way through. I became so bored with Tess and Jack fighting that I just gave up. Their adolescent behavior was irritating, and they continued to fight long after they should have come to some accord. I found myself not even caring what had happened to their partents. If you're looking for one of Sue's books that are full of off-beat characters and lots of laughs - don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted a Saturday for this??","review":"I'm not a big fan of Sue Civil-Brown's books to begin with; her characters are always way too 'flaky' for me. I had hoped that I'd enjoy Tempting Mr. Wright. I didn't, but not because of any 'flakiness,' although that was certainly there, just not as prevalent as in her previous books. TMW had *way* too much petty bickering between Tess and Jack, especially after they came to realize the extent of their feelings towards each other. Where was the romance?? Where was the emotional dialog? The whole story just dragged along; I believe Tess and Jack didn't even kiss until halfway through the book.If you're looking to read a good romantic comedy, check out Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Rachel Gibson, or the more recent books by Susan Andersen; don't be 'Tempted' to spend your money on 'Mr. Wrong.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"It WAS a frustrating book, on the whole...","review":"...for multiple reasons, most of which other reviewers have touched upon.

There was Mr. Gorf, (he was Mrs. Gorf's son and he can steal peoples' voices through his third nostril), Mrs. Drazil (Louis's teacher),Mrs. Smith (Jason's Dentist and a former student of Mrs. Drazil's), and Miss Nogard (she hated everybody and she could read everybody's thoughts through her third ear on her head).

Over the next couple of weeks, Dameon notices something different about Mrs. Jewls. She tells the class she is going to have a baby, so that means they're going to have a substitue teacher (or a couple). The first one, Mr. Gorf, can in-hale people's voices up his nose. The next, Mrs. Drazil, Louis' former teacher, makes Louis civilized and can really be quite mean. The last one, Ms. Nogard, has an ear on her head, and falls in love with Louis.

And remember, same price for 180 caps. Give your child two of the juniors, or one of the adults.It's basically a marketing rip of here. You're paying TWO TIMES for the exact same lemon-flavored omegas. This really irritates me, so I checked the labels for other kids and adult comparisons.

That's almost half the cost of a new one! I've had this thing for four months! Isn't it under warranty for a year? Well, the parts are under warranty for a year - but the labor for only three months. I said no way. They said they could cut me a break and charge me only $50. Wait, so this is negotiable now? Why don't you just fix it for free, considering it cost $200 and didn't last even six months?They said they'd pay the return postage to send it back to me with a customer service comment card.

I use macs, so much of what it can do, I can't use it for. I knew that and was perfectly happy to buy a replacement for my old one to record live music. Unfortunately, this is a new recording technology that is incompatible with my other minidisc recorder. This one can play my old minidiscs, but I can't play the new hi-mds on my old one. All I get is an annoying beep. You can record in the old mode with a computer (non-mac), but why wouldn't you just record on your computer then?

Sony messed up a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and spiritual","review":"No, this book does not have that heart-wrenching, sweeping dramatic quality of the Fionavar series. The conflicts and dramas here are more personal, smaller scale but no less moving. The story here is not so much about Crispin's physical journey but of his rediscovery of his own humanity and of his faith. There are no cardboard cut-outs in Kay's worlds, and no-one functions in a vacuum. The world changes his people; they change each other and their world. This is Kay's genius and, for me, the reason that his books become more rewarding with each re-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed fan","review":"Tigana, The Fionavar Tapestry and A Song for Arbonne are among my favorite books.

It has none of the heart-wrenching drama that made his prior work so unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mythic journey in a venal world","review":"The metaphore, Sailing to Sarantium, is a drum that beats through the entirety of this book. What is personal, becomes public. Beliefs become reality, what is good and great and politic is not necessarily the sensible choice. We, like the characters, are asked to suspend judgement, heed the metaphors as if they were oracles and believe in the integrity of a very few men. Sarantium blends Gavriel Kay's fantastic rendition with philosophic integrity. Sarantium is the Island of the Day Before in the Fantasy genre, and I believe that Umberto Eco would find elegance in this most recent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature development of Kay's talents","review":"\\"Sarantium\\" represents what I think is a new focus in Kay's writing. He's toned down the melodramatic elements of his storytelling to tackle the more sophisticated themes of art, beauty, mortality, religion, and fame through this examination of a pseudo-Byzantine Empire (the historical research is quite accurate in many places - e.g., Empress Theodora really was rumored to have been a dancing girl and patron of the blues before taking the throne). His protagonist is more concerned with the role of art and religion in his life, and his need to complete a great work, than with the usual fantasy quest of \\"saving the world.\\" Kay's treatment of his usual emotional themes - sorrow, guilt, and grief - is more delicate in this novel and all the more touching. Poignant and thoughtful, I don't think this book is for anyone looking for a \\"slash and hack\\" cut-'em-up. I'm looking forward to seeing what turn Kay takes with the story in the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment","review":"I read \\"The Fionivar Tapestry\\" by this author, and thoroughly enjoyed it, so was looking forward to reading this set of books. Although the books are very well written, they are not fantasy! I do not think you can call a set of books fantasy if all the author does is stick two moons in the sky (or whatever). He obviously wanted to write about the Roman Empire without having to stick to any history or facts. Fine, but these books are not fantasy. Also, \\"Sailing to Sarantium\\" is quite dull. I have not been able to summon up enough interest to finish the second book, and I am usually a fanatic about finishing a book series. The author obviously has things to say about life and art, but darned if I can figure out what they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Kay. I did not love this book. I was bored with almost everything. I hope the next half is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailing to Sarantium","review":"My 2 star review probably comes from the fact that I'm not a huge fantasy fan. A fantasy book really needs to be wonderfully written with a driving narrative for me to enjoy it. I think the Patrick Rothfuss Name of the Wind series is great as was Game of Thrones.Sailing to Sarantium never caught fire for me - it had an uninteresting hero with a rambling tale that I found hard to finish.I read all the reviews from readers who loved the series before purchasing the book - they must understand a lot more about what makes a fantasy book good than I do - I put it on my pile to go to GoodWill - I won't even lend it to friends or relatives looking for a good read.

Read misses some areas of this because of changing historical styles, and the availability of a wider range of sources.However the primary problem is his absolute lack of nuance in approaching the subject; the book lacks real insight, and is very blind to the politics and factional manoeuvrings of Elizabeth's court.

This manual gives the nuts and bolt with exact measures. However, even though the book is extraordinarily comprehensive, beautifully written, and with masterful scholasticism and didactic methodology, it doesn't obviate the need to develop the skills with an experienced practitioner.

From the standpoint of construction, the book has a number of contrived plot devices. I can't go into those without giving away parts of the story. Suffice it to say, they will be obvious to most readers. The author introduces one appealing new character who overcomes her psychological and emotional difficulties through force of will. In her earlier books, Ms. Kress explored the impact of both real and perceived psychological differences on groups of people. The message from this book seems to be that you can will away shortcomings and change your neural function at the same time. Had the first book of the series been of the quality of \\"Beggars Ride\\", I certainly would not have gone further. This was a disappointing end to an otherwise powerful exploration of social inclusion, exclusion, and discrimination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible let-down","review":"This was a terrible finale to an otherwise pretty good trilogy.

It is dry, there is NO puke smell and it looks nearly as it should have coming from the factory. I would recommend this to anyone.

Of course music DVD and sign language DVD are different, but this product is such a scamped work that has randomly shot play scenes of the same children (overly caucasian) and repetitious animations that do not even match the lyrics. It's annoying that they feature same girls and boys that it makes me think they must be the sponcers' children. Many of the songs are not really for kids, and are sang by so-so singers. I find it nothing attractive about this product. I recommend Baby Signing Time DVDs (even if you are not into baby sign language) for their quality and baby-friendly, interactive original songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"This is the worst dvd I ever bought. All the positive reviews must have been written by the makers of this dvd. First of all, this dvd was not at all engaging. Second, the music videos are just shots of children playing. Third, the main characters are (in plain language)crappy. Fourth, lyrics did not accompany the songs. Some songs are so fast that it was difficult to follow if you didn't know the lyrics. I knew most of the songs, but not my daughter. Aaaaghhhh, this dvd is so bad that I'm not going to spend any more time on this review. It's not worth it.

However, with this one, she starts smiling as soon as she sees the introduction screen.

It is refreshing to have such bold and in-your-face documented evidence distiguishing the Ancient Macedonians from the Ancient Greeks. Gandeto's exhaustive research of ancient chroniclers stands in stark contrast to that of the modern 19th century followers of Droysen's \\"Hellenistic\\" claims. Are we to negate the findings and reportings of the ancient biographers to allow political interpretations and propaganda to cloud the scholarship?

This is a more cerebral read than some with references to language, history and technology some might not get on the first read. There's plenty of cynical humor as well. The author's knowledge of this genre and his subject (FBI) make this a terrific, authentic and entertaining first novel with a solid plot, interesting and flawed lead character and good pace. Definitely worth the read. Here's hoping for many more chances to get inside the head of Agent Puller Monk and his demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt make the grade.","review":"I found this story to be arrogant and unrealistic. If FBI personnel are really this vain and flawed, we are in big trouble. Considering the hero is supposed to be a ranking FBI investigator, he takes time out from his high priority job to gamble away 11 thousand dollars which would have paid for his father's rest home bill. He is so proud of his ability to deceive people he brags about it. As a hobby, he practices lying on polygraphs. This novel is written with arrogance and insults the intelligence of the reader. My library is full of good authors like John Sandford, Stuart Woods, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, John Grisham, Robert B Parker, Elmore Leonard, P.T.

As Monk and his partner Lisa Sands look into the matter, their search leads them up to the highest reaches of government and directly into murder.Gene Riehl has written a well paced debut thriller. There is no skimping of characterization as both Monk and Sands are realistic creations. The complex plot has a very well conceived solution and conclusion.

It is a very solid first thriller. Monk is a terrific lead (and flawed!). Lisa is fairly well drawn. The other characters are bit two dimensional, but they aren't that vital.

After installation I found that a slight touch of a corner tears your skin open. Maybe if the corners were cut straight and aligned, there wouldn't be a sharp corner (actually all four corners) sticking out. I had to remove the trim and CAREFULLY file the corners and edges.

The manuals for these models still say use trim kits TK929SF or TK939SF, but those are no longer manufactured. Even Pansonic customer service (as of Aug 2011) will say use those discontinued kits. I found a single buried web reference implying the new model trim kit (TK-929SA) would work with microwaves \\"NN-SD987S\\" and \\"NN-SD997S\\" and so took a chance. It works GREAT.

Her characters are developed well enough, but are still lacking. I don't read fantasy novels to hear about abortion and I have no idea what would possess an author to insert current hot topic politics into a fantasy novel. Reading about it ripped me out of the story and brought me back into present day. It was disappointing. I had high hopes for this book but have read much better.

When I go to thesaurus.com I get a list of over 100 synonyms - many not close but at least tangentially related and a place to allow further investigation. I thought that was the point of a thesaurus - to find synonyms of words. I flipped through the pages and most words simply have a definition with a sample sentence showing use and meaning and one or two synonyms.

Cast a wicked, depraved villain and his greedy, lusty female accomplice into the fray, and you have 'Blind Aphrodite' -- an entertaining tale. Some violence and graphic descriptions of the beautiful as of the ugly side of the act called 'love-making' make for adult reading. Certain plot twists give this historical romance a gothic touch.

Doesn't this woman have an editor? There are no descriptive passages in the book at all - beyond that is the nominal descriptions of the heroine's dresses and \\"decolletage\\". It could just as well have been set in the present day, with the hero horribly disfigured in a fire or car accident. Colonial Savannah is described not at all. There is no sense of atmosphere or place in this book - all there is is \\"her secret passion\\" and \\"strange yearning\\" type of purple prose.

Most of the color illustrations give a clear depiction of the steps required to tie each knot, but they are nothing special compared with other guides.What gives this book added value, I think, is the brief discussion of the history and development of each knot. I also like the categorization as to sailing, climbing, and so on with the cross-references as to use.However, I think that the chart at the front of the book would be much more useful if were in alphabetical order rather than order of appearance. I must also take the author to task for failing to include the sheep shank. This knot has been a favorite of mine since Quint (Robert Shaw) asked Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to tie one to prove his seamanship in the movie Jaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked this book up to learn how to tie a couple of the more obscure climbing knots like the trident and triple bowline and to have fun with the rest. The book is well organized (except for the utterly useless directory of knots), and the diagrams are large. My gripe is that he skips steps, and magically produces extra slack halfway through a knot. There are cases where I have thrown the book down and had to figure it out by trial and error (not what I paid $20 for). Furthermore some of the methods he uses to tie knots (such as the butterfly) are flat out strange, or clumsy. When I'm up 100 feet and my life depends on it I need more efficiency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knot so good","review":"I found this book very confusing.

Ms West avoids the cliche elements of most fantasy adventures and concentrates instead on the characters and their development.In this book, the action moves from the Dominion to the Empire, where the players who will oppose the self proclaimed rulers of the Dominion are being identified and assembled. The book uses a contest of 'warrior's skills to develop and illuminate the character of both familiar and new personalities. It also broadens the scope of the impending conflict by making it clear that more than the rulership of a single nation will be decided. I enjoyed the fact that we were not subjected to endless pages of fight or chase descriptions. Instead, the actual physical events were used to deepen and enrich the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, but....","review":"I have read both this book and the broken crown and there are many similarities in them. In both i found the beginning to be confusing and/or slow. The middle of the book became very confusing when they mentioned things from the past (guess i better read the hunters books) abd i couldn't figure out what was happening. But then at the end, maybe the last 200 pages or so, it got really good and interesting and i realized why i like this series. I sometimes got the idea that West put some scenes in quickly because i would reread them about 4 or 5 times and still never understan what had happened. overall though i find this to be a very interesting series. Just sort of sad that i didn't get to hear more about Diora, though i liked Kiriel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but Tas...","review":"Good book. I wont say much about the book, but i want to say something about an old character: Tas.I hate to say it but Tas is really beginning to annoy me. I ALMOST wish he would stay dead. The problem is that he aint that funny anymore, and nothing he does now really surprises me. I think I'm sharing the same opinion as many of the old heroes of Krynn. Tasslehoff is really annoying, and sometimes I wish I could have been in the book to strangle him myself. But when he is gone, something is clearly missing. The authors should make Tas do something really surprising. In the Chronicles, the things he said and did were surprising and funny. Thats what made him so interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll love this book","review":"An Extremely good book!A fine read.

Most of this story talks about The elven nations for about 3/4 of it that really gets boring after a while well not borning but monotonous. the other 1/4 of the book talks about the things that is more interseting like Palin, Dalamar, and Tas. Although i do tend to dog on this book it's still pretty darn good.

I know it must be hard writing two books and many other short stories, the secret project, and campaigns and the like for the new game system, Sovereign Stone. The second book in the WOS trilogy is just about two hundred pages shorter than the first book in the series. And it leaves many questions unanswered. Yes we find out who the one god is, but even that is left unclear. We meet old characters, some old characters die. The elves start an exodus but their fate is also left unclear. I do think MW and TH could have gave us a little more but again the writing style in the book is the best and again they give us a great story. I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Back!","review":"It took Weis and Hickman some time to warm up in the first book, but now they're all back.

A third of the way through all it took was a couple of late-nite binges and I was done. I literally couldn't put it down, and could not BELIEVE what I was reading! W&H have revived what had become a somewhat stale world. The first 1/3 of the book was a little slow action-wise, but it was easy to see that the groundwork was being laid for the last half of this book, and probably the next book. It has all the feel of the original trilogies, with a perfect mix of the old and new characters. By the end of the book you'll know the identity of the one god (if you don't already), and how it relates to events in the first two books. But that question only leads you to a dozen more, in true Dragonlance tradition. This is a MUST read for any casual Dragonlance fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons of a Lost Star (The War of Souls, Volume II)","review":"This was a very good book that was part of a series.

New characters are fleshed out (Gerard, Mina, Medan) and old characters are included (Tasselhoff, Palin, Laurana, Dalamar, Cyan Bloodbane). All this and no intrigue. This book bored me, much the way part 1 did. Mina's knights continue their amazing success in battle and the origin of the Silvanesti shield is revealed. Mina defeating the Solamnics by scaring them with the dead souls was lame in my opinion, and the revelation of who the One God is was so very predictable.

I read alot and forget most of the minute details from long ago series but the revelation of the one god was starkly obvious and I had hoped my guess was wrong. I was disappointed. The portion of the book dedicated to Qualinesti however was well done and the result surprising. The epilogue was well done and left a couple cliffhangers for the reader.

Two albums, and then a best of? Obviously a marketing, money-making move.As someone who has both discs, and who loves African dance music in general and the Kutis specifically, I completely agree with Fuchs's review.However, as I seek to introduce Femi to those not initiated to Afrobeat, this seems like a good choice. It really does have my favorite tracks from each CD, without question.If you haven't heard or don't own Femi's music, and aren't sure you can handle two CDs, this is a great selection of FANTASTIC music by Femi, the crown prince if Afrobeat music: that blissful fusion of traditional Nigerian Yoruba music, classic African pop music, reggae, jazz, hip-hop, and a large dose of funk.But if you already have either Shoki Shoki or Fight to Win, forget this and just go buy the other one. It's even better than whichever one you already have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"How do you justify a \\"best of\\" disc for a guy with only *two* previous CDs?

Some of the places are not described well, as a tourist would who just rode by in a speeding car at dusk. Love and knowlege for the banks is deep. Alot deeper than one can jot down, or interview locals, or record in one trip. David Stickor Charles Whedbee are true BANKERS. If you want to know the banks read theirs. You would be as well off to grab the latestweek long, first time visiting tourist to tell you about his vacation as to buy this. Bailey writes well, but, needs more expertise on this subject. I'm not an expert on the BANKS, but more than once during this read I found my head shaking, thinking \\"What is he thinking\\". But this book is largely his opinion on foods, state of government, and people of the banks.But then again, I love OBX, and when there, I do not want to go home.

It's not screaming GADGET GEEK. It's got a nice clean simple look to it. The animated dice is perfect to give the watch a little bit of life and character. The leather watch band supplements that look to make it more than just a watch. It's one hell of a cool look.The watch feels pretty good on the wrist. It's not hard to get on or take off.

And of course, when you mix 'anime' with any merchandise, prices are usually ridiculous--not with this.The quality is superb on this, something you wouldn't expect from anime merchandise. It's been very durable for the past month or so I've owned it, and I carry and bang this thing up more than it deserves. It's both fashionably made and strong. Not to mention the Laughing Man Logo is a big plus. Doesn't look cheesy at all, and makes your bag look really unique compared to most.It also has plenty of pockets and a lot of room, I'm very pleased with the size.

Contours and all other data are clear, and, so far as I could tell, accurate. Benchmarks are numerous enough to do the job and mileages are indicated in bold along all trail segments. Trails in GUMA are well engineered and maintained, with little or no route-finding involved, but the visitor will nonetheless find this map helpful when visiting the backcountry (and this park is almost all backcountry). I would only remark that the coverage extends a mere mile or so north of the Park (and Texas) boundary, so if you venture into Lincoln National Forest and the pretty canyon country in the direction of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, you'll need to get more topos or use a GPS device.

The rest of the album continues to bridge the gap nicely between great pop and good ole blues based rock and roll.

I expected the DVD to show actions along with the rhymes so my 2 year old would watch and learn to act along.

The scenes change too fast, they're not coordinated with the rhyme, for instance, when the rhyme goes \\"the cat takes the rat\\", the scene shows kids on a pony or kids running around. The bonus CD has many additional songs but it seems like a cheap production where the singers don't sing the words clearly.

It did this well also, although frankly a bigger tank would be better suited for any major projects, but this wasn't why I bought it. Regarding the loudness of operation as mentioned in other reviews, the first time out I made sure I was working in the garage with the doors up, and prepared for rock-concert volume. I had to laugh when I switched it on. If your idea of a rock concert is Neil Diamond, then yeah, maybe this unit will seem excessively loud to you.

The birth of Situationist concepts such as \\"psychogeography\\", \\"derive\\" and \\"detournement\\" are amusingly chronicled by Mension, who was Guy Debord's close friend and drinking buddy.Readers of Greil Marcus's \\"Lipstick Traces\\" may remember Mension as the \\"human billboard\\" with offensive slogans scrawled on his pants, in a mesmerizing photo by Ed Van der Elsken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Photos of Exotic Sites","review":"I have not yet travelled in Turkey, but it would take months of difficult itineraries to see everything depicted in this book.

I would have given it 0 stars, if it was an option. The DVD does not promote effective and long-term second language acquisition. All it does is translate. Unfortunately, translation does not help most people learn a second language because there is no long-term understanding. When words and phrases are translated, there is short-term comprehension, which is erased (from the brain) almost immediately, once the input stops. In class, a professor once said that translating words/phrases makes the brain lazy. The brain will not store the information for long-term use because it knows that it will immediately be translated into something it already knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS..","review":"This product had great intentions, but disappoints severely.

I figure with a name like Dewalt, I could not go wrong...but that was exactly what I was, wrong! Now the router will not even start. To Dewalt - nice look and features, but very unreliable.

The spindle lock is useless with plastic piece attached to a metal pin. You have to be Hercules to push the pin in and hold it in while trying to tighten the collet. Then if you DO press it in hard enough to tighten collet it has a habit of being bound and not releasing. Absoluite junk design that certainly won't last a weeks worth of work. The best part about it was that it only took 3 screws to remove the whole lock mechanism that will give you better access to using two wrenches. Of coarse Dewalt only provided one wrench so you have to use your own.The more serious problem was that the motor has a lightenig storm inside it brushes. The unit gave out over the coarse of about 30 minutes of ON time over a weekend. The thing sstarted squeeling like a banshee and then it started slowing down in easy material. Back to the depot.

While the 8th edition does not disappoint, nor does it rise above all expectations. For one who is a neophyte in the area, then I strongly suggest this work, as it provides one of the most comprehensive overviews of our industry that I have ever seen. For myself, I felt the book needed more coverage in the cost effective area.

It also had 2 megs of RAM, which in Palm life is huge, it had the James Bond type flip cover and it's tiny. It fits everywhere. The screen doesn't scratch easily either. It has simple connectivity to PC and Mac. It doesn't have rechargable batteries built in, but the batteries last forever. I believe the OS is Palm 3 because that is all that was out at the time.

But when I read there is no backlight, I immediately ditched the idea. Just what is Palm thinking by releasing a model with no backlight? They should price this unit at half the price, then it may be worthwhile to get, but at $99 this unit just does not cut it. Pay a few dollars more and you can get a Sony Clie with 8MB and full backlight, plus a memory expansion slot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Worked for 3months, then stylus just never registered again!

Customer Service was an absolute nightmare. Over the course of a week, I spoke to four representatives. Each of them was barely able to speak English and was unable to solve the problem. Each call lasted about 30 minutes.....Once the rep realized that he/she didn't know how to fix the problem, I was put on hold for 10-20 minutes then eventually disconnected. The PDA ifself is satisfactory, but I had such a wretched experiance with their service that I will never buy another Palm product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the first-time users","review":"There are a lot of PDAs out there with more power and features.No doubt about that, but for [the money], I think it's a good buy. I just bought this for my mom, and she loves it because it does what she needs, using it mostly as a organizer + a few programs like Avantgo that allows you to read news and programs for her shopping list, etc.I would have liked this unit to be a little cheaper since you can probably buy a refurbished PDA or older models w/ a bit more features, but if you need rechargeable batteries and you want a better looking PDA that does everything it advertises to do, I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if it was $75","review":"Even [$] is a little much for this little PDA. The screen is small, and there is little space for additional applications with only 2MB RAM.

Sadly, the screen was very very small and the stylus rather flimsy. What really hurts this product is the inability of the software to recognize the Palm writing, 'graffiti'.

This WAS a great PDA, with many features found in far higher priced handhelds, but it is of no use now that it has simply died after 5 months with no warning. Palm's warranty is a short 90 days, which says a lot about how long THEY thought it might last. Next time, I guess I'll have to look at the warranty in making a purchase decision"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Palm with no bells and whistles","review":"I've used the Palm III for a few years. My wife got the Zire for her birthday and I checked it out for her. Not bad. It doesn't have the features a lot of us would spend a premium for, but it does what my wife needs it to do; store basic information. I agree that the major drawbacks would be no light and little memory. But to be realistic I rarely use my light and it should be plenty of memory for what she is doing. I also really like that it has a long battery life. These new ones witht the bright screens eat the battery up in like a day. Pretty good choice if you can be satisfied with not having a PDA, camera, video player, MP3 player, phone, tv, radio all in one unit. I'm just kidding, but you get my point. This would have been incredible 3 years ago. All the basics in a tight little package. Its a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its basic and it rocks!","review":"Anyone complaining about a lack of features in the Zire just doesn't get it - Palm intends this to be a basic unit with rechargeable batteries. For those not doing email or using complex add-on programs, this unit is awesome. Its small, light, and inexpensive. My wife syncs it with her laptop via the infrared port, so there is no cable to mess with. She recharges it with the adapter once a week or so.Yes its slower than the average Palm, but for a basic user, who cares? Yes it has less buttons, but for someone who uses it mostly for calendar and phone book, who cares? Yes it \\"only\\" has 2 mb of memory, but considering a basic user will be lucky to use 1/3 of that, who care?If you are a basic user, mostly focused on calendar and address book, with no desire for email and stuff, then get this. Its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME for low techies!","review":"I love my palm zire. I have been wanting a palm for a long time, but did not want to pay $$ for a fancy high tech item that I would only use for a few things. So, when the zire appeared I new this was for me. It is perfect if you don't need all the gadgets that the other palms offer. I just wanted a date book, calendar, and to do list that I could carry in my purse at all times and this fits the bill to a T!! I also love the alarm function so that it can serve as a travel alarm.So, this palm is perfect for those who don't need internet and color display and all that jazz, they just want to be organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"First PDA","review":"I had never owned a pda before, and was looking for something to eliminate some of the items I carried in my purse (date book/planner, phone book, mini notepad, etc). I am a full time college student, own my own business, have 2 children, and a husband that works shift work. This was perfect. It took a little time to get all of the information into it (I had a lot of info to input) but once it was entered, it was very convenient and easy. As far as storage capabilities, for me it works. There are also programs / games that you can delete to give you additional space."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"I am a stay at home Mom with a busy schedule and a large address book. I needed something to organize my life a bit. The Zire did just that! I love it and I use it all the time. If you only need it to jot down notes, keep appointments and as an address book...it's ideal... and the 2 MB of memory is plenty! I debated whether or not to get the Zire 21 instead- mainly because of the memory (the 21 has 8 MB)and I think I made the right choice. My only complaint about it is the cover. It doesn't stay open and it only protects the screen. Regardless...it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.For someone thinking of buying a PDA for similar purposes as I need it for...I would recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No backlight!!!","review":"This product would be great except for one thing: no backlight. I don't know about you, but I often find the need to use a device like this under low-light conditions. No backlight makes it far less useful for me.

This is my second Zire, the first one I had less than a month, so I could exchange it. When I tapped the stylus, it would not respond or it would bring up the wrong item...very frustrating. I have had this Zire about 4 months (not returnable) and the same thing is happening. I also would like it back-lit, it's hard to read in dim light.

Someone purchased one for me for Christmas and there was a dead spot on the screen. Since I was visiting family out of state at the time I have no recourse to return the item to the original vendor and while Palm will repair I have to have to shell out to ship the item to them.Not sure it is worth the money to have repaired.

However, I question the Zire's planned product life. The Zire only comes with a 90 day manufacturer's warranty, as opposed to the one year warranty on all other Palm handhelds and most personal electronics. The display stopped working on the Zire I purchased about two weeks after the warranty expired. It was still in excellent condition otherwise.If you have not purchased an extended service plan, the repair costs and shipping are practically enough to buy another Zire.This may have been an isolated incident, but be aware of your service options before investing in a product that may fail shortly after it's sub-standard warranty period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and durable!!","review":"The Zire has really helped keep me organized. It is a good starting place if you're interested in PDAs. I accidentally dropped it outside during a rainstorm and didn't find it until the next morning. I thought it was ruined because it wouldn't turn on. I went home and tried to charge it up. An hour later I checked it and what do ya know...it worked!! It reset all of my info.

But unfortunately it is a bad PDA. Let me to tell you why: It has a bad screen very dark no light. It is boring. It is dull. Small memory and limited usefulness because it has a weak alarm.

After 95 days, the thing will not synchronize with any of the PCs that it used to work with. I am disgusted to find out that there is only a 90 day warranty. I should have expected that since it's one of the cheapest (price) on the market that it would be one of the cheapest (quality) as well. I have been rooting for Palm in their battles with ...Microsoft CE-based products, but now I'm going to have to admit that staying with Palm was a huge mistake. My kids are now happy because they now have a new toy, and I'm going to go shopping for a better unit- and I guarantee it won't be another Palm product.

However, a word regarding Palm support...After a couple months - the screen went completely black and I needed to call tech support. What a nightmare. It's obvious to anyone that Palm has exported its help desk overseas (India most likely). The five different support engineers I talked to ALL had very thick accents, could not understand simple English sentences, could not make logical decisions (they follow a very formal script) and made the whole experience VERY frustrating, time consuming and expensive (they don't have a toll-free number anymore). The point is simple - sooner or later you're probably going to call tech support for help - and in my opinion, the \\"help\\" desk at Palm is horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect.","review":"This CD is great! Each track is about 5 minutes long except maybe 2 tracks. There is plenty of intricate drumming and guitar work here. And what really impresses me is the noticable bass guitar. There are possibly two or more tracks with bass break downs! The vocals are harsh and but the music is melodic. Occasionally their guitar player or drummer come in for some backup vocals which adds somewhat to the songs. The lyrics are great! Dealing with the human mind and also politics today. My only gripe, and this is me as a analytical person, but in track 10, Reign, there is an error in the production and it skips briefly. It's noticable but to the casual listener it may not be noticable. Maybe it's just my copy...who knows.

Iyengar is one of the original teachers who brought yoga to the west, and you can tell by the way he explains everything. It's a serious textbook though, it's not for a casual person who's just interested in flexibility. There's amazing pictures and detailed descriptions of the philosophy behind a yogic lifestyle, including background on the 8 limbs of yoga, but most of all Iyengar describes how to get into each asana properly, including proper breathing technique, where your weight should be balanced, where you should feel a stretch, when you should/should not do different asanas...Light on Yoga is best for someone who wants to dig deeper into yoga and learn about the total package. I would agree with my mom, it's the definitive authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definative Guide","review":"If you are interested in yoga, this book is one of the must have books in your collection.It covers everything from the philosphy of yoga to an extensive range of asanas for your practice.

It describes how to get into and out of each pose, provides photo \\"plates\\"...old timey ones with Iyengar himself, has numerous appendices including a suggested schedule for incorporating various poses from beginner to advanced. Includes background on yoga...its a wonderful reference for me as a beginner. Only drawback is that it doesn't seem to include too many variations for beginners (use of props et cetera, which is weird given that Iyengar is really known for its use of props."},{"rating":"2","title":"the BEST yoga book","review":"I use this every day. It is by far the most comprehensive yoga book I have found. I know some people might be bothered by the lack of color photos or English names for the poses, but there is something to be said for authenticity and the photos do what they are supposed to do--show how to position the body to successfully do the poses. The book is small and lightweight enough to fit in a purse. There are YEARS of yoga lessons within this book. If this book has one flaw it may be that it could be a little intimidating for absolute beginners. I did have a few false starts when I went through the beginner course, but I always came back to it, and I am now doing poses I never would have thought possible (and I have never enrolled in a yoga class). The author has many words of wisdom and encouragement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important difference in later edition.","review":"I second all positive comments so far, but please note: the pictures are no longer all together at the end of the book; they've been well- placed throughout, in proximity to the appropriate descriptions.

Once you make it through the introduction the asanas and the purpose behind them becomes more clear as envisioned through the author's mind. The listed health benefits from each asana are quite helpful when designing a program for your personal or professional practice. The only thing that could make this a better resource is if the illustrations more closely aligned with the descriptions. The code in the descriptions regarding difficulty level takes a bit of time to find, decipher and relate to a photo. Not a big deal, but it could have been better organized by the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anyone who does yoga or for anyone who would like to take up yoga.","review":"I've been doing yoga for 5 years now, starting when I was \\"older\\".

Mr. Iyengar's deep insight into the fundamental structure of each asana provides the best foundation possible for deepening one's personal practice. Also very useful is discussion of the therapeutic benefits of many of the asanas, including series of asanas that can be used to to address a number of ailments.This book is not a replacement for a qualified yoga teacher. However, the level of understanding of hatha yoga this book provides make it indepsensible. This is a great spiritual book for the modern age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Job","review":"Many people have a flawed understanding of yoga -- they think it is just on a physical plane.

In that regard, it is totally comprehensive and complete. However, I bought it on a recommendation from an acquaintance who said it was a great book to get started with yoga. It is certainly NOT THAT!!! I am a beginner yoga student and if you are or similar you could hurt yourself trying many of the poses in this book. Further, the book doesn't progress from easy poses to more difficult ones but rather skips from advanced to easy back to advanced, etc. I would NOT recommend this book if you are a beginner or are looking for a simple intro to yoga. Just looking at some of the poses hurt me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for everyone","review":"Even if you are not a yoga, yogi or especially if you are. It is incredibly well indexed and annotated so the book may serve as yoga instruction and a guide to applied yoga for medical conditions. Mr Iyengar, now in his 90's used yoga to gain his health when he was 30 or so. It is a very open document for the beginnner. It took me 9 months to complete the first two weeks of the books progression. A must have, like a bible, it should be in every home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trained Photocopier Wanted","review":"This is the fifth book I have purchased from MOML as a photocopy of a book outside of the copyright protection time frame. Three were acceptable but had many pages that demonstrated that the person conducting the photocopying process was inattentive and allowed some pages to be nearly unreadable. One book was sent twice and only had a handful of pages indicating that MOML has little quality control over its products. This book \\"A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading\\" from the Yale Law School Library has some pages with handwritten notes which were carefully photocopied. It also has many pages that are such poor copies that they are unreadable.

It grills chicken perfectly and cleans easily. I make tasty low-cal grilled cheese sandwiches by spraying the sandwiches with Pam and pressing them on this grill. They come out delicious. My favorite thing to do is marinate chicken breast in buffalo wing sauce, grill it on this pan, and then put it on a sandwich and grill the whole sandwich in the pan. Best of all, it cleans easily with hot water and a plastic brush. I haven't had any problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indoor Grilling","review":"I have used my grill pan twice. Once with marinade and once with dry seasoning. I sprayed a healthy dose of PAM in pan to reduce sticking and though my steaks were very thick there was very little sticking except for the very end. To clean the food/marinade/grease that was stuck to the pan I filled it with super hot water and soap and let it sit on counter for a day. Most of the baked on stuff was gone except for a little bit here and there so I took a small dish scrub and got the rest off. I have not experienced any rusting however, if that's a fear you can always fill the bottom a pan with water the place on stove top to boil...once done and cooled you should be able to get the food off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but worth it.","review":"Was difficult to find a power supply which had good reviews.

If you're a runner, don't miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very British humor but observations apply to US runners too","review":"Taylor is a professional British comic writer, which shows: the book's well written, funny, and British. British in a P. G. Wodehouse, not a ribald way. Much of the humor derives from his observations of runners' everyday peculiarities, most of which may be seen in the new world as well. The book is also a bit sad, because (I think) Taylor tried to overcome middle aged unfitness too quickly - to run the NY Marathon - and paid a price. The price was all post-NY so I'll not reveal details. But check his 1/2 marathon time and his NY time: the former predicts over 20 minutes better than he ran in NY. Check also his training heart rates: too high. It's fair to assume he ran the marathon before he was ready. But as he writes the \\"marathon\\"'s a unique brand; who'd want to read about his travails trying to run merely 13.1 miles?"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Ford's message film with over-the-hill cast","review":"Ford gives his take on how law and order came to the western frontier and it is believable if you don't know much history except what you have seen in Westerns. It may also be his answer to High Noon and the theme of one man having to take on outlaws without help from his friends and neighbors. A statehood issue is shoehorned onto this theme. John Wayne is in his usual western character and costume and James Stewart plays his usual B movie character; both are too old for the parts they play; but do give their usual very professional performance. The doctor and newspaperman, as in most westerns, are the town drunks. The plot and subplots are stale, the townspeople are stereotypical of early to mid-20th century westerns. Sadly one scene even confuses the Declaration of Independence with the U.S. Constitution. This movie is vastly over-rated by most reviewers on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this movie","review":"This movie has a different twist to it. Plus it has a great cast of stars.

Great performances by John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin. One of my all-time favorite movies, well-witten, well-directed, well-acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best westerns and one of John Wayne's best","review":"One of the great westerns and one of Wayne's best. Lee Marvin is perfect as Liberty Valance. Come to think of it, Stewart's not bad either.However,this is no shoot em up - it's a western with a message. Spoiler Warning! If you haven't seen the movie, read no more.The man who, ostensibly, shot Liberty Valance, gets the girl and is elected to Congress to boot. The man who actually did shoot Liberty dies in obscurity.Sometimes, life is like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ford Masterpiece","review":"This film really showcases Ford's brilliance as a director.The way the film draws you in and commands your attention without the use of grand vistas or gratuitous violence. You follow along and watch the story unfold, while spotting bits of humor along the way. The characters are full and it is interesting to see the way they react and inter-react. Wayne and Stewart are excellent. And you'll fall in love with Vera Miles. You'll love this film even if you don't care for westerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Really Not a Fan of Westerns, But............","review":"John Ford's \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is a marvelous movie, regardless of how you feel about Westerns. This isn't a movie about outlaws, or something violent, but a study of the fight between old and new in our society. John Wayne's rugged cowboy represents the old, untamed west. Jimmy Stewart's refined and educated lawyer represents the order and civilized nature of a new west. Both clearly love the land they live on in different ways, and when the time comes to protect the people of the west from the evil Liberty Valance (played to perfection by Lee Marvin), they team up to save the day. In the end, Stewart's way of life, the way of progress, wins out. However, as can be seen by the memories the major characters have at the start of the film, the old west never really dies. The movie is just brilliant, with all the leads in top form, especially the forgotten Vera Miles as the woman both Wayne and Stewart love."},{"rating":"2","title":"john wayne is the true hero of this movie","review":"I loved this movie. John Wayne sacrifices his heart and his pride and turns a territory into a state. Great acting all around, especially Lee Marvin as a despicable gunslinger. Still, John Wayne emerges as the true hero of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite western ever","review":"I don't care if this lacks the elements that some people associate with a classic \\"western\\", this is one of the most watchable and re-watchable movies ever made. Wayne, Stewart, and Marvin all give perfect performances, as well as the many fine supporting players. The themes of sacrifice and the bittersweet nature of victory in this movie are always moving. This is one of the very rare films that I can watch every couple of years all the way through, and enjoy it just as much every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Finest Western Ever Made.","review":"After watching this film AGAIN, and thinking of John Wayne, John Ford, James Stewart, Lee Marvin, et al, and all the things one could say, I am reduced to the following statment: This is the finest western that was ever made. It has everything a western should have, and everything a great timeless Classic movie has. How I wish it was in DVD....Note: Magnificent 7, High Noon notwithstanding, this has everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a classic western","review":"Overall, \\"The man who shot Liberty Valance\\" is a disappointing film - especially when you consider the vast array of stars that are in it. Compared with other westerns that John Wayne and James Stewart starred in, this is way below par. The story is ragged, the action is minimal and the excitement is low. This is not as good as it is supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Print The Legend","review":"John Ford hits on all cylinders, Lee Marvin plays a classic bad guy, and John Wayne plays the stereotypical John Wayne character in a very non-stereotypical manner in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.Wayne plays the same basic character he'd played in so many other westerns. But, instead of being the young stud settling the Wild West, Wayne plays an aging dinasaur, his kind of justice increasingly unwanted and outdated. Easily Wayne's best performance.Stewart and Miles are good, though a bit of the lovey-dovey glazed looks could have been edited out, as far as I'm concerned.To me the best performance here comes from Lee Marvin. His Liberty Valance is a dirty, slimey, bullying psychopath. Brilliantly done.But who decided to give the bad guy a goofy name like Liberty Valance? Sounds like an 18th century piece of furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got wrong Region ...","review":"I do not blame the seller for this mistake ( which was clearly stated in the item description ) Just makes me wonder why a U.S. seller would sell a DVD for Region 2 ( Europe ) I was able to play the DVD on my PC and is an excellent movie !

I just don't understand how the other reviewers liked it so much. I almost didn't finish it. I actually put it down for a few days and picked it up only to see if something near the end would draw me in more. It didn't. The guy I really liked was a black detective with blue eyes. He was interesting for a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away! It should be zero stars!","review":"This is an absolutely awful DVD, and I'm not talking about the film itself. I can't say anything about the film, because the technical quality is so bad I couldn't get 15 minutes into it. The video has no midtones and no sharpness, and the audio is muddy in the extreme. If I had to guess, I'd say it was made by placing a video camera in front of a television showing the film, with a microphone placed in front of the TV speaker. The result: clumsy editing (for TV time, no doubt), bleeped words (likely again for TV) and unlistenable sound. Women's voices are lost, as are any male voice that isn't loud. In short, this gives every indication of being a bootleg -- and not a good one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"shitty","review":"Very unhappy, the product I recieved did not have the items promised in the product description.

Besides these twin destroyers, Em also has unending relationship problems with the men in her life.Finally, the basic premise is silly. Since other reviewers have outlined the plot, I'll just say that the idea that someone would get a totally unqualified geologist (as opposed to, say, an art historian, curator, or someone else who deals with art for a living)to authenticate a painting is rediculous.I found this to be a very negative,pessimistic book.

The whole plot was just too melodramatic for me to believe in it and get caught up in it. I should have felt sorry for the hero, losing his past loves, but it was hard for me to take the plot seriously.

While this information IS helpful to the co-addict, it was given almost equal time as was the topic of the co-addict and her recovery process.I think this book would have been MORE helpful if it had given more time to the issue of codependency, and women involved in relationships with sex addicts.With that aside, the book is well-written and thorough. You might want to skim the chapters about sex addicts and society and get to the real meat of the issue: co-sex addiction and, especially, recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to it......","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the authors didn't pay much attention to who the target audience was for this book.It starts off like a C++ book, then you have some .NET stuff thrown in (ofcourse, you are not told why you need them, its like \\"This is a .NET book, and there has to be some .NET material!!\\"). I have been programming in C++ for quite long, and I thought I could progress to .NET with this one. I was wrong. The book doesnt even take time off to explain what \\"Managed\\" C++ is all about.

Note in instructions says overload of power supply will shut it down and initial power up showed that to be correct. Problem traced to \\"balun\\" coupler on \\"DB4\\" quad uhf bowtie antenna being used which really shorts out the power supply because of it's design.

It mainly consists of either death or black metal bands maiming classic Priest songs. However, there are a few noteworthy efforts. Cage's cover of Freewheel Burning is by far the best one on the CD and is one of the best covers of any Priest Tribute CD for that matter. Sean Peck is an honor grad of Halford U. He has a style all his own though, which is obvious when you listen to other albums by Cage. Seven Witches does an excellent cover of Diamonds and Rust. They throw in a Victim of Changes riff in the beginning and a Breaking the Law riff at the end of of the song that actually works pretty well. Burning Inside does a good cover of Green Manalishi as well. Those three songs were worth what I paid for the CD but the rest of the covers did not round out the rest of the CD well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant tone obscures probably useful information","review":"When my doctor diagnosed my hypothyroidism, my wife bought me this and another book on thyroid disease to help me understand what was happening to me.

I must admit I was mostly put off by Dr. Langer's admitted prejudice against vegetarians.

Not only do I believe this opinion is wrong, but I also feel it is irresponsible for Dr. Langer to make such claims.I also expected more indepth information concerning the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyrodism, but this book is not nearly as comprehensive as Mary Shomon's \\"Living Well with Hypothyrodism\\" or Dr. Shames' \\"Thyroid Power\\".

I eventually found the cd and bought it for the new experience. There is one other remix of this song which is less trancy and more instrumental rock from an action video game's option menu. If i were to compare this U.S based band with the sounds of other bands; I'd say: (reminds me of) Stereo mc's, the Farm, and Scooter.

With that said, I did not really recognize some of the songs midway into the set list showcased in this concert. If there were more tracks from NIN's first 3 albums I would consider purchasing this blu ray because it's an AMAZING concert DVD. The director did a fine job of shooting this in a way that has the viewer feel as if he/she is actually at the concert. I watched this on Blu Ray, and the picture quality is stunning along with the audio. Performance wise, Trent gave it his all along with his new friends. The performance of 'hurt' was very touching.

Pros: folds up nice so you can use your trunk when you need it, the sections are adjustable (awesome for groceries). Does not slide around in a carpeted trunk. Cons the sections are a bit flimsy, great for groceries I would not put anything heavy in there though like a package of bottled water, or free weights, pretty much anything heavier than a two gallon jug of milk is a bit to heavy and can warp the sections. I'm currently planning on reinforcing mine with rigid fiberglass. Overall great product, if it were a bit more durable I'd give it 5 stars, however I got it for groceries, not for lugging heavy items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"This system is very convenient.

I actually purchased it as an interior organizer to sit between the front and rear seats of my auto, but it is too large, so I will use it for storage in the trunk of the auto. If the manufacturer was inventive, they would produce a smaller model that would be about 12 inches wide and would straddle the drive tunnel in an auto between the front and rear seats. It would provide great extra storage space for travel.

It was like the lost album i've been looking for. This album was like Jack Johnson but, dare I say, better. More musical power and some very strong rythmic sounds. Xavier Rudd is like a combination of Jack Johnson and Iron and Wine on digeredoo's and a slide guitar. Or, something like that. After being skeptical of the album it is now gold to me. Hope to hear more from Xavier Rudd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great talent and album","review":"I first heard of Xavier through a cousin and was hooked. Saw him live in Wis. last year right at the stage and its a sight to see him play and hear his music.

That is, the right to property is based by the method by which it was originally received. A simple example, if the property was stolen or it the original deed is false then the property is rightly not yours.John Locke had something to say about this but that was a long time ago.But in this book, the author is silent. And for good reason, for if he did discuss it, the topic would be embarrassing for North Americans for they would have to transfer land back to those they had stolen it from - i.e. the Native Americans.In total, while I can agree the owning property is a good thing, it is only good when it has been acquired by the proper methods.

But, shortly after I got \\"Night Train\\", I went on a Duke Ellington kick, and it didn't take me long to figure I wanted to have a look at how one master of jazz treated another. So, although I've only delved briefly into this book, I expect it will be providing me tons of ideas and licks to insert in my own weighted-toward-the-standards jazz repertoire. And when I can finally play a little of what Oscar actually played, I'll know I've arrived. Anyway, this book is well organized, contains a great selection of songs, and is true to Peterson's and Ellington's work, making it a very valuable piece of written music for any jazz pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Difficult!","review":"This is a great volume of sheet music to get, it includes many classic Ellington tunes as perfomed by Oscar Peterson. I didn't realise when I purchased it that, the version of C-Jam Blues here is an exact transcription of the recording on the Night Train album. This alone makes the purchase worthwhile.Naturally these transcriptions are very difficult and will require a lot of time and effort to get anywhere near the original recordings.

The main thing that I like about it and why I bought it was the ability to monitor high and low temps and set the alarm if the temp goes above or below a certain degree. The allows me to monitor my smoker temperature to make sure it doesn't get to high or to low.

I ordered it and when I got it it seemed to me that considering the materials involved it was somewhat over-priced. That may very well be the case, but considering how well it works, the cost will be forgotten long before I quit getting use out of it. An added benefit, that never occured to me until after I started using it, was that everytime I have to enter a new address instead of having to lean way up to do it, I can just grab it and bring it to me and then throw it back up there.

Looking at the number of thefts and car breakins, I wanted something that can be safely tucked away from prying eyes. The portable friction mount did exactly that. I haven't really taken it for long trips or experimented its stability on different road conditions. But so far, so good. Wonder why garmin wouldn't include it as part of the gps package.

IMO, this mount is dangerously distracting, compared to a windshield mount. I'm going to keep using it, though, because it's the law in Illinois.The mount slides all over the place in my Acura 3.2TL. When the light changes and I'm in line to make a left turn, I can be going slow enough to get honks from behind, and the thing will still fly off the dash and onto the floor.The dashboard mount also places the GPS farther away, making it harder to reach than if it were mounted under the rearview mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my Product?","review":"It's been 2 weeks and I haven't received my product.

It's much better than the window mount that falls from the windshield without any warning. It's very easy to use and no matter where you place it, it stays put.

We were unable to find a flat spot in the minivan for the glue-down disc that came with the Garmin unit. This no-skid dashboard mount was supposed to solve the problem. The Ford Windstar minivan's dashboard deck has a textured friction surface, so I had high hopes. Still it slipped around too much for my wife to use it. And no, it's not the way she drives that causes the slips.May we'll try one of those air vent mounts, but I'm really tired of spending money on a device that never gets used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless with Garmin 1490lmt","review":"When purchasing a Garmin GPS, this mount was suggested for the product and at a reduced price. Mount is too small for the GPS unit and the power plug is in back and interferes with unit as it sits on mount. GPS does not stay on mount and keeps falling off. Basically, the mount is useless and since this is my first GPS, I have a difficult time envisioning this mount to be of any use with any GPS. Also, there were no instructions or suggestions for use, which makes it difficult for first time users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold well but kinks cable","review":"I bought this for my Nuvi 680. It does stay where you put it. But it does put a tight bend radius in the cable. My advice is use it without the power cable that came with the unit or plug in the USB cable in the side of the unit to power it. The price of a replacement cable for the Nuvi 680 is over $200, if you buy the OEM one with the radio receiver built in. I have no idea how long your cable will last with such a tight bend radius but I anm not taking any chances. Truly a poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this for the Garmin 1490LMT model","review":"We brought the Garmin 1490LMT model and this mount at the same time but it just simplify DOES NOT fit the Garmin. Yes we should have read the fine print (keep scrolling to the bottom of the page) which only says its compatible with the 1490T model but we saw the 'suggested' purchases with the Garmin 1490LMT item to be this mount. Why suggest something Amazon if it doesn't fit? Given the cost of the item though, we decided not to return the item and now stuck with a not fit for purpose mount. We can't find a similar type mount either to fit this model which is a real shame as we love this item when we rented a car with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best holder for GPS","review":"A lot of GPS holders out there and read reviews that this one is higly rated for the money.

I instantly recognized this was poorer quality .. and took it so as to leave her the better. As I feared, the pseudo sticky bottom (rubberish stuff stuck too fabric) deteriorated quickly such that a couple months ago my wife threatened to throw the whole thing out gps and all.

After updating to a Nuvi 1450LMT I found my GPFM missing. I know where it went missing, but that's beside the point. Just remember to always check 'your stuff' after having your car serviced ... live and learn. By the way, the GPFM was still in great condition. Anyway, since I was so pleased with my previous GPFM I ordered another one. The only 'minor' complaint I 'might' have is the GPFM ball head was very hard to insert into the 1450 bracket, and was stiff to position. Though, the Garmin does stay in place over rough terrain. So, didn't mark down for the ball head/bracket connection. Would buy another one if the situation required; however, I don't think I will buy another Garmin. Mobile phone GPS apps are getting much better, and who knows, perhaps the next car I buy I'll opt for the GPS option."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS !","review":"I have used the winshield suction cup mounts and was not happy at all,they all would fall off.I read reviews and decided to try this.It works Perfectly! it does not slide around and it is very easy to remove when parked.there are no signs of a gps in car."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS Mount","review":"Great Gadget!

(Of course, some could argue that the suction-cup might release in a collision as well, but I digress. I would like to see how Consumer Reports might test this.)Anyhow - great for easy transfer and no suction-cup marks (and if you have an oddly slanted windscreen or one too far away that renders the suction-cup mount useless).I hope that helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely heavy","review":"This Friction Mount is estremely heavy.

I also work downtown in a major city... not an area where you like valuable things being visible in your car. Well, thats another area where this thing rocks... two seconds and you have it off the dash and out of sight and unlike with a suction method, there is virtually no evidence of your GPS system! As much as I have grown to view a GPS system as a must own device, I think the friction mount for one is just as essential. My girlfriend has a different Garmin unit without a friction mount... it NEVER stays stuck to the windshield so most of the time she just has it sitting on her dash unmounted... rocking and rolling all over.

Unfortunately the new mounts do not come with an additional power cord but it is much more stable. You can see it has four 'feet' not three and it is much lower to the dash. It sticks like glue without taking up any view of the road.If it came with the replacement cord I'd have given it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honda Civic 2007","review":"I use this mount in a Honda Civic 2007. While it has not fallen off the dashboard (which is not flat in the 2007 Civic), it does move around a bit whenever I hit a bump and I find myself reaching over to make minor adjustment from time-to-time. It also leaves marks and lint on the dashboard which is caused by the materials used to construct the Civic dashboard. I have not found that to be a problem in other cars.I've found that it can be placed in the storage bin beneath the radio which gives the device a built-in look and is convenient to the power and radio input plugs. It also makes it easier to discretely remove the device after parking. The only downside is that one has to glance downward to view the device. But I prefer that to making adjustments every time I hit a bump in the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off great and gets slippery after a few months","review":"I have had several of these and they all start out great but the bottom smooths out after a while and the unit slips all over the place.

I like all the other features of the mount but the slipping problem makes it dangerous and eventually not usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not move!","review":"Between the heft and the rubbery bottom surface, this Garmin mount will not move! The little beanbags on the 4 corners adjust to the shape of your dashboard. We tested it by setting the mount on a trunk and opening the trunk lid. We achieved an 80 DEGREE tilt before it even started to move! It also fits in the storage space between the front seats in my car. If you have a small glove compartment or not a lot of storage, you may need to hide it under your car seat. But we should all be hiding our GPS mounts anyway, so that our cars don't get broken into. We had bad luck with our old suction cup mount after a while, especially trying to use it in a rental car. This will be much easier and cleaner! So glad I got this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item, no more circles on the window","review":"This item works perfectly for my family using a garmin nuvi 350.

It really does stay on your dash board and is so easy to assemble and disassemble when you want to put your navigation system away.

I love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is really good!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the Garmin Friction Mount. IT DOES NOT SLIP! I got the friction mount because the windshield suction cup mount used on my Ford Focus puts the Nuvi 350 at an uncomfortable distance to reach from either the driver or passenger seat. I've used the friction mount on the Focus's relatively sloped dash for about 1,000 miles, including steep curvy mountain roads where stuff on the back seat slid around and the Garmin did not move. Like other reviewers have said the friction mount makes it easier to hide the device on the front floorboards when stopped and out of the car for a moment and makes it easier to move it from car to car. If you are going to spring for the GPS device in the first place, do yourself a favor and get one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I bought this after reading all the great reviews and I concur. After using the suction cup mount for a week, it no longer stuck, so I started looking for an alternative.

The unit also has a push-button quick release so you can take your GPS off the dash and put it somewhere safely when you're not in your vehicle. There are four \\"bean bags\\" surrounding the attachment \\"L\\", and the whole thing has a contiguous rubber bottom on it.

I bought this mount with \\"frustration free packaging\\" and it wasn't exactly frustration free. It didn't come with any directions. I had to go back to the product page here and look at user submitted photos to figure out if I was missing pieces or not! Luckily I figured it out, grabbed the Garmin holder that came with my GPS and attached it to the GPS. Then I had to take the round piece off the mount before attaching it to my GPS to get enough leverage to get it on there(push hard) and then reattach it to the mount. So the setup was a little frustrating without any directions but I can't wait to use it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes driving with Nuvi so much better","review":"Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for N��vi Series enables you to place your GPS wherever you want It and makes its use so much more convenient.

Despite the angular configuration of my dashboard, this friction mount stays right where I need it to be and doesn't lose it's grip around it's grip while going around tight corners.

First is that a lot of people use the suction cup and end up having their units stolen. Also, some states don't allow the suction cups either. So, this was a great alterantive. Was surprised at how well it stays put on your dash. Doesn't move. You could take a sharp turn or even do a 360 and it stays put.Another plus was the price. Just a little over half the price of what you would pay at retailers like Best Buy or Ciruit city. (I paid appx $26 and in the stores it's around $42) Defintely a great bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"With an odd-shaped console and dashboard in our vehicle, I really needed more versatility than a permanent or window 'suction' mount could offer. Enter this product. The weight is enough to keep my unit where I choose to set it. The non skid rubber-like base is slightly moldable, to further enhance the \\"stays put\\" character of the product. The mounting stem locks into the base with a quick-release key. As an added safety feature, there is a locking lever which disables the quick release latch, avoiding unintentional releases from the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the suction cup","review":"Mount sits easily on an uneven surface. There is not room on the top level of the dash on a Toyota Avalon for the mount and GPS antenna to flip up; but on the next level down, even though not very deep, this mount sits firmly. The only issues (almost non-issues): yhere is not much space between the release button of the GPS and the base. Also, the wire from the GPS is a little tight against the base. I turn the GPS so that both wire and release are in the recess between the four feet of the base. No regrets on the purchase - far superior to the suction cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for Nuvi 650","review":"This mount works great for my Nuvi 650. I had my old GPS stolen because I stupidly left it in the car exposed when I parked my car. Now with this mount, I just put the mount underneath my seat whenever I park and take my gPS with me. This thing is easily removable and it's remains really really stable when you drive given its weight and design. The mount doesn't shift or move at all and is a great alternative to windshield mounts because it's easily removable and does not leave a mark. Highly recommended for Garmin GPS for safety reasons"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mount","review":"we use this mount all the time to move the gps between cars and also to quickly pput it out of view. just used it 8 days on vacation and it works seamlessly, a great buy and better alternative to windshield mount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Nuvi series","review":"It's a great product.

Its a great little GPS mount that I can just grab and throw up on the dashboard. My only issue is that it doesn't fit into the glove box very well and leaving it out on the dash board is like putting out a sign that says there is a GPS in the car, come steal it.

After only a couple of trips, the touch screen on my GPS went crazy and Garmin said there was nothing to do about it --- so I purchased a Nuvi 265WT. It is listed as a device that this works with, but there was no way whatever I could fit it onto the ball mount. The ball is too large. Since this is listed for that device, I don't know what to do to replace it. The way the Nuvi hangs on my windshield is very distracting, as the cord is much closer to me than it was with the Street Pilot. I have a curved dash, so I can't just use anything that sits on a normal dash. Too bad it doesn't fit all the advertised devices, as it is great when it fits.If you're thinking of buying one, I'd suggest taking your GPS to the store and making sure it fits rather than ordering online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I use this with a Nuvi 750 in a 2008 Odyssey.

Plus, it doesn't leave those suction marks on the windshield and I don't have to worry about it falling off in the heat or the cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Friction Mount","review":"Very useful device for placing Garmin GPS in a variety of locations within viewing distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the original.","review":"The window mount suction cup that comes with the Garmin GPS unit is not really practical. After touching the screen a few times the mount loses its grip and the unit falls, usually while you're driving. The friction mount isn't perfect, but a much better option. You need to make sure your dash has a relatively flat section large enough for it to sit on.Nothing compares to having the GPS unit built into the dash, but this is much better than what Garmin provides as original equipment. Why don't they just make it an option when you buy the GPS in the first place, so you don't wind up with a suction mount that you'll never use after getting the friction version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Best thing I did next to buying a GPS unit. Easy to put it down under the seat and prevent any one from knowing you have a GPS unit in the car. Prevents theft and break in's. GPS unit is easy to remove and take with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a PERFECT way to mount your Nuvi GPS!","review":"I had read all the positive reviews of the Garmin Portable Friction Mount and I agree 100%! I bought one of these for both my husband and myself. He loves his just as much as I do.In California we are not allowed to mount anything on windshields, so this is an excellent solution. In fact, even if we were able to use the windshield mount, I wouldn't. I much prefer this sandbag-type mount.It's portable. It stays up on the dash board without falling off. You can position it easily. I like that you can take it down and hide it under the seat so no one realizes you have a GPS when you're parked.All in all, this is a great product and I give TWO thumbs up to whomever invented it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"The friction dash mount works great. It's grippy on most if not all surfaces and keeps your device where you need it.

Would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Base","review":"The Portable Friction Mount works as advertised. It is very stable and makes it very easy to mount/dismount the 255w. I did not want to permanently mount the 255w on either the windshield or the dash. In fact, we use the 255w in more than one vehicle so the portable mount makes sense for our usage. The portable mount also makes it convenient to place the mount and the 255w under the seat when we stop for lunch, etc. It is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth having!","review":"Definitely worth having. Easy to move from one car to another. Easy to adjust the angle of the GPS to see more effectly while traveling and not distract from driving. Leaves no marks on windshield or dash to indicate the presence of a GPS when absent. I am able to stash it under my car seat when I leave the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Accessory to my Garmin","review":"This Portable Friction Mount for my Garmin makes using the Garmin even easier. When I'm out of the car, I just tuck it on the floorboard close or under my seat. Keeps it out of view when the car is empty but takes only a second to set back up on the dash. So convenient and never slips or slides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Design","review":"Very well designed with good quality. The Garmin Suction Cup Mount kept dropping and I replaced it with new one (suction cup) and it kept happening again until I replaced it with this new design. Excellent product. Now I dont need to worry about it while I am driving and can keep it anywhere I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"I got tired of suction-cup-to-windshield GPS attachments. They sometimes block my view when traveling on twisting roads, and have lost suction and dropped on the floor too many times. That's dangerous safety lapse, to me. It doesn't matter how hard I break or how sharp the curve, this friction mount keeps the GPS where I need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works in all my vehicles.","review":"It seems to stay in place.It makes it easier to remove it from the dash when exiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder why...","review":"...this is not included with the car mount.

Convenient to store out of sight when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable Fiction Dishboard Mount","review":"I was with my neighbor some months ago and saw the Garmin Portable Fiction Dashboard Mount and it made lots of good sense to have one. I was so excited about it, I ended up getting two more for friends. It is great, you can move it around on the dashboard. You can take it apart and or set it up with ease. In fact, I carry a see thru box in my trunk for the mount. I put the Garmin in my pocket. I worry about someone breaking in to steal my GPS. I also am concern about someone seeing I have a GPS mount and breaking in to look for the GPS. With the system of taking it apart with ease, you can not see I have a GPS.I was also pleased with the ease of ordering and how quickly it came in the mail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This Garmin mount was suggested by a relative who had another model of garmin gps. The mount was even better than described. Couldn't do without it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Having","review":"I would agree with most of the positive comments others have made about this item. For me, it is certainly much better than windshield mounting as I was never able to find a spot that was close enough to use comfortably but still allow safe outward vision (two-seater convertible, small windshield). This thing solved that problem for me.That said, with sharp turns and the occasional pothole, it will move around on my dash a little bit - my dash has a pebbled finish and very little in the way of flatness. I am certain this beanbag would become a projectile during a crash, at least in my vehicle. I'm keeping it nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Never go back to window mount!","review":"After having my window mount fall one too many times and once hit my ignition key and turn my car off while driving, I wouldn't use the window mount. This is the perfect solution. It stays put and doesn't leave any marks. It is bigger to store and doesn't fit in the console but it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"All positive experience with this beanbag mount. It does not slide around on the dashboard. It is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I bought this few years ago and all that I can say it is very amazing! A must have for all the GPS owners. Hazzle free and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mount!","review":"Very good mount, doesn't move around and is just an all-around a good product. It's the 1st thing you should buy after you get your GPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't slip!","review":"I bought this mount for my Garmin Nuvi because with the hot summer weather I couldn't get the suction cup to stay on the windshield. No matter how you go about it, if your car was manufactured before GPS became a common tool, it's going to be a challenge to \\"easily\\" stow the GPS when you leave the car. That said, this mount makes my life so much easier. Even though it's technically bigger than the standard suction mount, I can literally unplug it from my cigarette lighter and toss it in the backseat. As far as stability, I have been using the mount for over a week, leaving it on my dash even when I don't need it, and the thing hasn't budged an inch. I drive a 1997 GMC Safari, so my \\"tank\\" doesn't exactly stop on a dime or have a smooth ride. I am SO pleased with this mount, and at such a low price and PRIME shipping, it's a no brainer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I love this dashboard mount. The one I had was always falling off my window. This is so easy to connect and it stays put without any sliding at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin GPS Stand - Quite Effective","review":"This is quite a nice product. I have used it for about 2 months now. It firmly holds the Garmin GPS on the dash board. When done, I simply disconnect the Garmin and put the base on the floor. This way, no one knows I have GPS, so the thieves leave my car alone. There was never a time that any type of driving on my part caused the base/Garmin to slide off the dash.Go buy it. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wish I had purchased it sooner","review":"I love this. I hated attaching the suction cup thing to the window and the ring it left when it fell off as I went down the highway. That thing is a real safety hazard. The bean bag garmin holder is awesome. Easy to use. When I stop I just put it under the seat. It really stays where I put it. I love that I can take it so easy to any car I am in. Don't wait, get it now and save yourself a lot of headaches with that stupid suction mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable Friction Mount","review":"Arrived when promised. Does a great job of staying in place and holding the GPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the most from your Garmin","review":"This item completely solves the positioning of your Garmin. It's easy to set up, and doesn't require a flat surface to attach. It removes in a hurry and can be stored either in the trunk or under the seat, in such a way that passers-by won't see it. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable friction Mount","review":"It is just what I need, safe and out of ny eyes view. It was packaged well and also instructions included . thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bean Bag\\" Mount for Nuvi","review":"It works fine, and was as expected. I would have given it five stars if it had a up and down swivel on the post like the suction cup mount has. I knew this before the purchase, however, so it's not a complaint. It stays put during all \\"normal\\" driving maneuvers, and some abrupt ones as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accessory","review":"This is a great accessory for a GPS unit. It is easy to adjust, stays in place well, and best of all can be taken off the dash and put on the floor of the car when not in use without disconnecting the power cord. Then easily replaced on the dash when desired. This latter ability is very helpful because it gets the unit out of sight of anyone looking to steal it.The only thing I would have liked to have come with it is a \\"visor\\" that shields the screen from sunlight while sitting on the dash. However, one is easly made from black paper and Scotch tape and it slips easily between the support and the back of the GPS unit.A good purchse--I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable Mount","review":"We bought this mount along with our Garmin nuvi GPS just a little over a month ago just before a trip. I really like this mount because it is so easy to move around and it's very stable. It kept the GPS still no matter where I put it or what kind of road we were on.I like having the mount on top of the dashboard instead of the window or down below. It's easy to see without taking my eyes off the road. Very please with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Alternative","review":"This is an excellent alternative to the window mount that is cumbersome, annoying (at times) to mount and dismount and always leaves a telltale mark. This mount is easy to use, stays in its place and stores easily. The first one I used came in a rental car, so I was pleased to find one at Amazon. I bought four and they are used by family members in a truck, SUV and sports cars - all are pleased with the change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect GPS mount for dashboards of all shapes.","review":"At half the price as compared to buying it from Garmin, it is hard to beat. My dashboard is contoured and with the \\"Wings\\" on this mount it sits just right. Also the mount is securely attached to the base, so there is no Suction Cup to come loose. Does not slide with even a sudden stop. I wish I would of found this item, at this price, before I bought my first \\"donut\\" shaped, bean bag mount, which I use in my other vehicle that has a flat dash. This is a great product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Friction Mount A+","review":"This item works much better than the suction type or the soft tacky backed one that sits on the dash. It is stable while driving and shows no vibration of the Garmin unit.Purchase from seller Beach Camera thru Amazon. I have purchased items from Beach Camera in the past. Excellant place, great values and very fast shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable Friction Mount","review":"I like this Garmin Portable Friction Mount. I had the Garmin Friction mount attached with Nuvi 1490LMT on my dash board and works great. No sliding of what's so ever. Although if I do have a choice again, I would choose the venting mount which cost $7.00 less. The GPS would be much closer for a better view and access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This item is stellar. A lot of states we frequent do not allow window mounting, so this is the perfect alternative without using adhesive on your dash (who wants that?). It is stable, never moves, and is the perfect alternative. Much cheaper on Amazon than at local retail stores as well which made the purchase an even more stellar deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sandbag mount","review":"Big and bulky... says \\"I've got a GPS\\" but functionality is superb.

I own a jeep, and with the small windshield it may interfere with driver visibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"It doesn't slide around at all. The suction cup to my window stopped working after the first year, this product is very appreciated. It's also easy to throw in the glove box if you don't want it so obvious to the rest of the world that you have something so valuable inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"This product is perfectly fine. Works great! I bought one for my Garmin 660 & bought this one for my Garmin 800 series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Mounts: Portable Friction Dashboard or Another Mount?","review":"First, this is a fine product (with a minor exception) and does exactly what it is supposed to do. That is: be portable and hold your Garmin firmly. The exception is the \\"angle\\" of the actual mount stem protrusion. It is almost 90 degrees, which is fine for the dashboard but nowhere else. You cannot tilt your Garmin upward very far for better viewing when placed at an elevation lower than the dashboard. Perhaps if the stem were smaller so the mount point was almost fully spherical, that would help. But, simply changing the angle of the stem would make more sense. I now prefer to use a flexible cigarette lighter mount approximately 10-12 inches long that includes another lighter socket for the power supply. Further, this device is much lighter for travel and use in rental cars than is the Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Garmin nuvi models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Works great!! Have a 2007 Nissan Xterra and this sits great in the little cubby hole spot in dash. Never moves even when driving in traffic and having to slam on brakes occasionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Sandbag Mount for dashboard","review":"I love this little mount. I didn't want to use the adhesive mount that came with the Garmin and I didn't want it sticking to my windshield or my dashboard. This is perfect because it doesn't move around on the dashboard, and because it isn't stuck down to anything, I can move it to hide it when I leave the car in a parking lot. I definitely would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solution for that ugly black ring left on windshield plus FREE THEFT PROTECTION!!","review":"I bought this friction mount immediately when I got my Nuvi. It makes the Nuvi completely portable from car to car but the best feature is that you can easily put the whole thing down and under the seat when you leave your car for long or short periods. One of the biggest problems with GPS units is their popularity with thieves. Even if you take the suction mount off when you leave your car, the telltale black ring is still there providing an invitation to \\"come look in my glove box\\". It also pays to shop around. These things are selling for more than TWICE the price on some websites and at stores. Give yourself some peace of mind and convenience all in one smart package. BUY IT!! YOU WON'T REGRET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I use the friction dashboard mount for my nuvi. It stays in place on my dashboard as well as those from several rental cars.

Of course the mount on these cheap scopes makes lining up small objects difficult but once you do the view is pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin friction dashboard pad","review":"I'm pleased with this -it does not slide around on the dash.I have noticed that you see the GPS unit take every bump (when the car hits bumps) vs. when it was stuck to corner of windshield.I decided to purchase a gymbag to carry this thing and GPS unit in- in order to hide it out of sight when not in use.I also keep the little bracket on the back of the unit attached to the GPS unit. The ease that this snaps on is great but this thing has detached at times unfortunately when I was doing some manuever(moving around) inside the car.I also will put this thing on the seat if there's no passanger and found that GPS will work if on the seat & away from nosey people in town,etc. I rate this thing as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I bought a Garmin Nuvi 350 for both my wife and mother along with this product.

I wasn't convinced, but hey, I'll try anything once. :)So, I found the friction mount on Amazon and gave it a shot. Wow! I am impressed. I drive a Chrysler Pacifica.

Unfortunately, it does not work in my truck, at least. It works on the counter at home-and on the seat next to me somewhat-but not on my dash. I had two friends also try to position it so it would hold and I could see the navigator. No luck. I'm not sure if it's because of my particular dashboard or not but I'm going to have to try to find my receipt and box and return it since I cannot use it at all. By the way, it does sit on the dash well and not slide-that's not the problem. The problem is that I cannot see the navigator screen when driving because it is positioned in too much of a slant. Again-it may be because of my dashboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I bought htis for my wife and she loves the item. she puts it on her dash of the car and it doesn't move.

The friction mount makes it easy to transfer the unit from vehicle to vehicle, and in the past I have had the units fall from the suction cup mount on the windshield, plus it alway leaves a little curcle to have to clean.

Holding the joint with your left hand and the mount with your right apply firm pressure against the joint until it snaps in place. Make sure the GPS is off the mount When you take the mount off from the joint. Twist and pull at the same time and it comes off easy. Also, Just make sure the GPS is not attached to the mount when you first attach it to the joint or it might break. Attach the GPS when mount is on the joint.

I read reviews on this 'beanbag-type' mount, most of the reviews were positive, but there was an occasional problem where they claimed it slid. My experience has been positive, in both my car and truck. I know many people use Armoural protectant, and that makes vinyl very slippery. I wonder if the people who had trouble with the dashboard mount sliding had used this product? My truck dashboard is not flat or level, it is curved with a lot of texture on the surface, but this product stays right in place!

My friends have had one for a while without the friction mount, and were FOREVER chasing the thing around the dashboard and on the floor. I thought I'd give this a try since I have two cars and don't want to mount the GPS permanently. With the friction mount, the GPS stays in place unless making a radical turn at a relatively high speed.

I had it perched on the flattest area where access was reasonable (above the radio) and it slides forward towards the windshield. Where it slides to leaves the unit farther away than when I use the suction mount on the windshield. I may get some double stick tape to see if that helps hold it in place, but if the unit is not close enough to reach, why use this bean bag?I tried taking one of the tabs and extending it over the leading edge of the dash, but the bag non slide surface is so stiff that the tab does not bend enough to help. I have considered taking some of the \\"sand\\" out of one of the tabs to see if I can get it to fold over and then tape it in place, but that negates any security benefits of being able to completely remove the unit.

Now that GPS systems are so cheap, I don't know if theft is still a bid issue.Downsides:It seems like Garmin is always changing the brackets on new GPS models, so your old mount won't fit the next generation GPS and you have to buy a new one.They are a little big and heavy, so they are extremely portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin friction mount","review":"The Garmin portable friction mount is great for California use because it allows you to have it on the center of your dash where the driver AND the passenger can see it.

Read other reviews for more details. Fits just about anywhere, and stays put. The only criticism is that the rubbery \\"underpart\\" material holding the mount in place starts to show wear almost immediately.

They phoned me to tell me that it changed their lives. They were able to hook it up, throw it on the dash and make an 11 hour road trip without any slips or slides. This thing will keep your GPS in place. When I went to visit them again for Thanksgiving, I made it a point to do some amateur stunt driving to try and get the dash mount to move but it stayed put.

Half the time I can't get them to work or if stuck to the window they leave a stupid ring on the glass that never seems to totally go away. And using a permanent sticker is out of the question for me! This mount solves all that. It is VERY stable. Doesn't move around tight corners or fast stops. If I had one issue with it, is that the base is a bit large and so maybe in a smaller car you might have problems with placement. But I'm guessing it really will be fine.

Folks, it does an excellent job! it stays in place no matter what, it holds our Garmin nuvi 660 with no problem on our Audi A4 board. And I don't consider it too bulky.

However, in my wife's Murano I could not reach the GPS without unbuckling my seatbelt and sliding forward. This little gadget was just what I needed. It offers the additional benefit of being super easy to remove the GPS when you've stopped or reached your destination. I highly recommend it if you cannot reach your windshield from your normal seating position easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Friction Mount for Nuvi holds gps steady","review":"This mount works great. It also is not as large as ones I've used in rental cars. Still, it is a hefty size to hide. It's easy to attach/detach my Nuvi 360 from it. Initially I had problems detaching the unit. I misread the instructions! All you need to do is pinch the bottom tab and grab the top of the unit (at the same time) to easily remove it from the base. I recommend this mount as an alternative to the windshield mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Dashboard Mount Great so far","review":"This has been a great buy so far. It integrates the friction base with the attachment bracket. No more dreaded suction cup to pop off at inopportune moments and scare the crap out of you! It is solidly attached to the friction base. Very pleased so far, a great enhancement on an already good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compatible with 1490 LMT","review":"The product works really well and does what it says. If you feel the bottom it seems to adhere to the dashboard through a sticky coating that might wear off with time. I read a couple of reviews where they said that it wasn't compatible with the Nuvi 1490 LMT. It absolutely is! I have the 1490 LMT and after having read the reviews of this mount I was doubtful if to get it or not. I got it anyway because I thought that since they were both made by the same manufacturer that they probably would be compatible. I'm glad I did. Buy with confidence"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with 1490LMT","review":"I have seen a few 1 star reviews claiming the ball joint does not mate up properly with the mounting bracket on a 1490LMT unit, and indeed in the list on amazon the 1490LMT is not included. Only the 1490T. But according to the Garmin website, the only difference between the two is functionality; Lifetime Maps and Trafic - LMT VS only Traffic - T and they specifically claim this mount (part number : 010-10908-02) will work with the LMT so I decided to go with the amazon suggestion for this mostly highly rated mount.There are no issues with the ball mount it fits perfectly. The ball is exactly the same size as the one in the suction cup mount that came with the unit as measured with a caliper. I would suggest that possibly some people received the wrong part or a counterfeit part which is why the ball does not fit.It seems to work well, if it starts to slide or other issues crop up I will keep you posted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Portable GPS Mount","review":"Works well to hold my GPS up on the dash.

When new, it had a decent grip on the dashboard. Now, it slides all over the places when turning and if I have to suddenly brake, it may become a dangerous weapon to the passenger. On sharp turns, it would slide on the dashboard to the extend the GPS will come off the mount. The bottom of the holder has lost its grip over time that I am considering using velcro to provide a mean of stabilizing it when I placed on the dashboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This mount does not budge!","review":"I have purposely tried to get this mount to slide, move, just budge, and it won't. It's a bit large on the dashboard compared to other mounting devices, but it works and it's quite mobile. My vision isn't too great, so I can I can pick the entire mount and unit up off the dash and replace it on the dash without a hassle. I can also put it on the divider separating the two bucket seats if I want. I can put it anywhere without detaching or reattaching anything. It's sturdy, makes no marks on your dash, and serves its purpose better than any dash-mounting device you're likely to come across. I thought it was a bit pricey at around $22, but I'm sure Best Buy would sell it for over $30, so I'm not complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded expectations; don't be skeptical about this product","review":"I was skeptical about a bean bag mount for my Garmin nuvi 50lm. Surely it won't stay on my dashboard without any adhesive? Well, I was wrong. This thing is the perfect solution to what to do with your gps system. The suction cup on the windshield idea is annoying: you have a wire hanging down and you have to remove it (tricky if your windshield slopes sharply) each time you park your car. This thing stays where you put it no matter how you drive. I suspect you would have to drive nearly upside down to make it lose its grip. The base is a super grip type of material that isn't sticky. Slide your gps in and plop on your dashboard and you're in busness. Really works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute necessity if you use rental cars often","review":"I often travel via plane for work and never know what kind of rental car I will get and don't want to pay for the GPS provided by rental agencies. So this tucks easily into my bag and allows me to easily find my way around the city without worrying about the GPS sliding all over the dash. Since the flaps are flexible, it hugs onto almost any shape dash. When not in use, it can sit on the floor tucked away against a seat so it's almost invisible to the outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Portable Friction Mount","review":"The mount base is heavy enough to stay on the dashboard even with sudden stops.

The Garmin Dashboard Friction mount works perfectly. You can position your GPS exactly where you want it at the angle you want it. If you are on the road and have someone traveling with you they can pick the unit up set it in their lap and program a new location or search the database for a destination without removing the GPS from the mount. This is much easier than reaching forward in a moving car to do these activities.

Gps pops on and off easily and the mount head is removeable and both will fit under any seat to be hidden from prying eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvement","review":"I previously had a similar mount, a suction cup to a flat weighted base, and I hated it. This is far superior. The suction tends to fail and this has no issues like that at all. Very quick and easy to set up, and can be adjusted to fit your needs. The only down side is the size, but all mounts are the same in terms of weight and dimensions. It gives them stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friction mount works well","review":"We already owned a friction mount so we knew it worked and this one does as well and for a good price.

I have no use of this mount because the body is so bulky and it doesn't mold onto the shape of my dash board. In fact, the Garmin GPS itself came with a small mount that we can use and it fit perfectly on our dash board.

It is without a doubt, the way to go if you want to be able to transfer your GPS from vehicle to vehicle or simply secure it quickly in the trunk. The mount stays where you put it, and easily conforms to different dash boards. I now have one of my own and could not be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternative","review":"I received a Garmin for a Christmas gift and found the mounting device that was included insufficient.It would fall off the windshield and this baby costed too much to bash on the floorboard every mile or so.I found the friction mount on Amazon and decided to invest.This product is awesome.It gives my Garmin plenty of stability and is a quick stash out of the view of car thieves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Functional Mount","review":"The friction mount works pretty well on various dash tops. Because it is just simply a friction mount that sits on top of the dash, it may shift a bit when the car hits a bump or when you brake abruptly. Depending on your dash configuration, it may be difficult to find optimal location to place the friction mount as some dashes are shallower than others and a suitable flat area to place the mount may be hard to find in some vehicles. The good of it all is that there won't be any tell tale sign of a GPS system being stored/used in the vehicle and can simply be stored under the seats or in the glove box. Overall, a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE FEATURES THAN I EXPECTED","review":"Great product for your GARMIN.

Today, unfortunately, I made a turn from a stopped position at a stop sign (not sharp or sudden at all) and the unit and holder slid off the dash yet again. Unfortunately, this time the screen cracked and the touch screen is no longer usable at all to operate the unit. I would NEVER trust this product again, especially for holding a higher-end Garmin.

If the dash is flat, such as on a pickup, you're good to go. I attached the regular mount that came with my Nuvi, using Velcro, as the adhesive did not stick properly, due probably to the surface of my dash.

It never slides around and it is nice to be able to position the GPS where ever I want with ease. You can't do that with the suction cup mounts! When I park my car, I can move the entire thing - GPS, arm and bean bag - and put it on the floor of the passenger side. I cover mine with a hand towel that matches the color of my car's carpeting. It takes just a few seconds to do, and I beleive provides a good, quick solution to making my GPS less visible/desireable to steal. I took away one star because the GPS sometimes detaches from the arm/base when I pick it up holding the GPS. This only happens when I pick it up fast. This is not a big deal, but it would be better if it had some kind of button to push to detach it. Overall, I highly recommend this mount!

Never had it slide off the dash as many might fear would happen. The only thing you want to be sure of is that the surface under the mount is completely flat. If your dash doesn't have a decent square foot of flat space, you may want to look for a mount with a slightly smaller footprint. I would also like to point out that the mounting bracket can prove to be a bit stiff to rotate, but once you have it positioned, you rarely need to adjust it again anyways.

I travel extensively and have used this mount in various cars and terrain. It has a good grip and does a good job of holding the gps in position. Obviously it cannot override the laws of physics and a sudden deceleration will cause it to slide back. One important thing is to realize that higher the surface area of the mount's base is in contact with the car, higher is the mount's stability. If one/more pads of the mount are bent, you will notice that it's easier for the mount to slip. My advice is to always pack the mount in such a way that the pads don't bend. This will decrease the likelihood that the mount and gps will become a dangerous projectile on sudden braking at high speeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, really works.","review":"The Garmin portable friction mount is excellent.

It's now relagated to being on the seat next to me or held by my passenger. The foam material has completely dried out and lost all grip ability. I've read that the heat that builds up in the car when parked may have caused this. I say to expect a driver to remove with them when they exit the car is a little more than unusual. It should be designed to withstand the heat and remain a functionable item.

Did some research @ Best Buy & Amazon on \\"friction mounts\\". Although it was a little pricey compared to some, we pulled the trigger on the Garmin friction mount. Great decision !!! Although our 2010 Corolla does not have a flat dash, the mount holds our 1450 perfectly. Very easy to attach the GPS unit & just as easy to seperate. Ideal when making a pit stop - can quickly remove the GPS from the friction mount, and hide both & then reassemble to continue the trip. Just one heads up - we have noticed after long trips the dash looks \\"scratched\\" where friction mount sat. These \\"scratches\\" buff out easily - not permanent damage, just slight scuffing that disappears with a little elbow grease. Bottom line, buy it - you'll be very happy with this product.

Windshield suction cup mounts can leave stubborn ugly marks, and depending on the design of your car they can place the nav unit at an inconvenient distance from the driver. Clips designed for use on dashboard air vents place the unit at a more convenient location, but they are unreliable and not suitable for all cars. The Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount suffers from none of these negatives.

It has a nice size, and is easy to set up. I started driving, and was impressed with how stable it was on the surface roads. However, then I got on the freeway, and the stability went out the window. With the window mount, the GPS didn't shake, and stayed put. I had driven over 8 hours without an issue. Unfortunately, I learned that the dash shakes a lot more than the window. I had trouble following the GPS while on the freeway, because it bounced around quite a bit from the vibrations in the dash. The friction mount didn't do much to dampen the vibrations. Also the friction mount slowly drifted across the dashboard as I drove no more than a few minutes on the freeway. So I am back to Amazon to buy a new suction mount for the window.

It's big and hard to conceal - if I don't want to remove the GPS from it every time I park, that means I have to tuck the whole thing as best I can under the seat and hope nobody sees it. It's not terribly hard to remove from the GPS if you do it the proper way, but it's very easy to do it another, improper way (removal of the ball from the \\"GPS holder\\") which after a few times results in broken plastic strips on the \\"GPS holder\\" and the mount no longer mounting to the GPS holder (which I've now had to replace twice).But, I don't know of any other options - there might be some generic ones.

It stays on the dash and the GPS does not \\"droop down\\" as the suction cup windshield mount did with my old, bulkier GPS. That is probably because the large, overhung weight is not as great. I still don't expect the ball-type socket that makes connection between the GPS and dash pad to be able to hold the GPS upright over time but for now it is working. There is a provision for quick removal of the GPS mounting stem by pressing a lever and, once positioned, a locking ratchet mechanism hold it securely. It is quite heavy and has a large footprint so it may be awkward to find a suitable place on your dash. I think this is because of the \\"X\\" shaped bottom.

I just bought it a few days ago. Ever since hearing it on the \\"Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life\\" soundtrack, I had to have it. It has many amazing, upbeat, slow, etc. tracks.1.) Bad Girl: 9.9/10. This song is extremely well done. The song from the TR soundtrack, a new sounding song that all will enjoy.2.) No Vacancy: 9.5/10: Another upbeat song. This song is a lot of fun, and has a lot of beat.3.) Edge of the girl: 10/10: My favorite song on the CD. This is because it goes from slow and intriguing, to fast, upbeat and FUN. Very catchy as well.4.) Guilty: 9.7/10: Another great song. Slow, yet intriguing.5 - 11.) All of these tracks are 9-10 star ranks. Slow, and fast tracks, fun and amazing songs....She sounds a bit like Fiona, only a polished, much better version.Buy this CD if you like Fiona Apple, or if you like talent.Rock on Alexandra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is a waste of money it is the same that you can find online in PDF file.

Excellent find."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holy Grail of Live Rush","review":"I recently moved to Australia, and finding Rush here is like pulling teeth. So when a friend offered to pick some CD's up for me in my home of Canada, I was elated. Different Stages was all I needed for their entire collection on CD. When I first put it on, I was all smiles like a kid in a candy store. I was at Rush's final two concerts, in Toronto, and Ottawa, and it was a pleasant drive down memory lane for me. This is the best live album to date. Rush have outdone themselves. If your a long time fan, or a new fan just gedding (hehe) acquainted with them, your in for a treat. I can't put into words the overall feeling of this live album. Stunning is close. Buy it, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RUSH LIVE CD EVER ! A MUST FOR CHICAGO RUSH FANS","review":"As a long time Rush fan, I am very impressed with this CD. Being from Chicago, I am proud to see so many tracks were taken from the World Music Theatre show. The band sounded great. I really like the songs from Test For Echo; by far the best studio CD since Moving Pictures. Fans love Test for Echo because there are some real jams. I just wish Rush would come realize from their live shows that their fans demand the type of music that made Rush famous (Limelight, Freewill, etc.) Some of this type is on Test For Echo. I just wish that Rush would put out just 1 more jammin hardcore studio CD before the band calls it quits. Different Stages proves that Rush can still do it lets hear it ..1 more studio CD that Rocks!! The fans would eat it up and Rush owes it to their great fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for prog rockers and music fans alike","review":"This 3 CD release is Rush's latest live collection (they usually release a live CD after every four studio records).Two of the CDs are taken mainly from the 'Test for echo' tour, and include mostly tunes from their last four albums ('Presto', 'Roll the bones', 'Counterparts' and the aforementioned 'Test for echo'), but also includes a few fan favorite classics, such as 'The trees', 'Closer to the heart', '2112' (a portion of it, anyhow), 'Freewill', 'The spirit of radio', 'Tom Sawyer' and 'YYZ'. There's also an updated drum solo by Neil Peart that will make you drool.As for the third CD, its taken from a concert in 1978 in London's Hammersmith Odeon, from some tapes *rediscovered* after more than 20 years when Geddy and producer Paul Northfield."},{"rating":"2","title":"2112!!","review":"I would recommend this album just for the live version or part of 2112. They straight up rock. You can go through and listen to each band member and be impressed. This is a band built on integrity. I was very much impressed with this album especially the earlier stuff they covered. I saw them on tour and once again they freakin put it down hard. If you listen to Neil, Alex, and Geddy on this album you will understand these guys are true musicians who aren't concerned about getting their faces on magazine or some music televison show!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush still delivers power","review":"I have heard only one song so far, the released-for-radio single cut \\"The Spirit of Radio.\\" This live recording reminds me why I enjoy Rush so much: the music is driving, powerful. The song, also found on the live 1981 album \\"Exit . . . Stage Left,\\" has weathered the years well; the band is still sharp and, moreover, willing to expand and create a different kind of sound rather than try to mimic that of 17 years before. Peart's drums are brasher; Lifeson's guitar runs still demand attention, even if slightly slower; and Lee's vocals still reach their incredible heights. (Though it must be noted that while Lee always hits his notes, he does take a moment to find them, especially on the opening lyrics.) I look forward to adding this CD set to my collection and letting the music do what it has done for years--fill me with the energy and vitality that is the music of Rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is terrible.","review":"Rush came highly recommended. But this album is the worst... I ever heard in my life. Especially \\"Resist\\" which could have been written and performed by Marvin Hamlisch.

C'mon, does Rush have to release a 3CD live set of already previously released live material?!?! The majority of these songs have beeb released on their previous live discs. How many versions of Closer To The Heart do we need!! And to top it off, Rush released a double greatest hits package in '97 (which also contain the SAME songs that are on DS). The sound quality of DS is poor. One would assume that the amount of money Rush is pulling in -- they would hire a professional producer, not an engineer or their own singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save you money...","review":"This is the second worst Rush live album. First being AWAS. This is Rush's way of buying themselves time. Different Stages would have been perfect if it weren't for those annoying fans (Chicago) who constantly keep screaming comments as though Rush had come to see THEM perform. This disc proves how talented Rush is, but this is all recycled material. In '97, they released two compilation discs of their past material. The only \\"difference\\" with Different Stages is that you not only bring Rush \\"live\\" into your home, but you also invite the melodramtic/annoying fan who has to make sure he/she is heard. Too bad Geddy didn't edit those idiots out -- then it would have been a \\"different stage.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs! Bad quality","review":"I've been a Rush fan for years and have loved every album (especially their live CDs), however, I felt pretty uneasy about this one. First the BAD NEWS: The production (I feel) is very poor. I think the guitars are too loud and not mixed in very well with the bass and percussion. It seems as though at times you can barely hear Geddy Lee's vocals (sometimes that's good though - just kidding!). Here's the GOOD NEWS: An excellent choice of songs!, especially \\"Natural Science\\", \\"Bravado\\", and \\"Dreamline\\". BOTTOM LINE: Great concert clips from over the years, bootleg quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"If you have Exit...

The last expectacular one was \\"A Show of Hands\\". But this record lacks the intensity and musicality of clasical Rush. The third cd on the boxset, recorded in 1978, is more than enough to compare the radical and unfortunetely change in Rush live performances. It is really a big loss for rock live music."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about milking the fans !!!","review":"This release is an absolute rip-off to the die hard Rush fans.

This is not their best album, but one could easily start a collecton here for these reasons. The band even threw in an enchanced disc and extensive album memorabilia, which unfortunately looks like a parting gift.This is easily the best of Rush's four live albums. It has three discs and includes nearly every Rush song that matters besides some of the longer pieces and most of the late 1980s, though most were eager to get out of the period anyway. What will really excite fans is the third disc, a long lost 1978 show. It has nearly the entire Farewell to Kings album plus several other songs from the era. The first two discs include a lot of recent material and most of the classics, including the entire 2112 and Natural Science suites."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rhythm Method is incredible","review":"Rush in their prime packed arenas and stadiums as well as any other rock band. Different Stages three disc set captures the prog rock power trio at their best. Lee, Lifeson and Peart put out a terrific sound live as these CDs demonstrate. If you don't own any Rush CDs, this set may be just what the doctor ordered as all of their big hits are here in one package."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSH: Different Stages","review":"Read the other reviews for a song by song analysis of this GREAT live 3 CD set. I think the mix is really good. You can clearly hear each member's contribution with the crowd's reaction present but not overpowering it. I wish the actual sound quality was this good at the concert, especially if you've heard them at any indoor arena where the reverb off the walls is so distorting. (Catch them at an outdoor venue if possible).If you are relatively new to RUSH and want a broad taste of their live music, buy this and \\"A Show of Hands\\". There are only 2 duplicate tracks; Neil's solo, The Rhythm Method, which is from different tours and similar, not identical; and Closer to the Heart, which both have a great jam at the end. I prefer the version on \\"A Show of Hands\\". Together that's almost 5 hours of live RUSH for a ridiculously low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great raw live Rush","review":"This is exactly how it sounds if you were to attend the show. I prefer these live cuts and recommend this \\"box set\\"...Three discs in this set. The sound quality is really good and I recommend adding this release to your collection. This release seems to have an added energy missing in other live releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live release by Rush","review":"The best live set to date. It captures Rush from thier early days(before Neil) until thier latest release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full five stars!!!","review":"Totally worth the not-so-high-price it costs.This three disc album is a one-set yesterday and today live compilation. It shows the listener how the canadian trio evolved through twenty years of musical career without loosing a bit of its power and strength.Cover art is also wonderful, especially the inner pages containing images of a full set of collectibles any Rush fan would love owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"They can still outplay and outrock anybody!","review":"I grew up on 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures. This live set took me back to those days and reminded me how much I love this band. If there are any \\"old school\\" Rush fans like me out there, do yourself a favor and buy this three CD set. It'll transport you, I guarantee it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Live Performance","review":"Rush has been around so long, that its hard to rate this album against other Rush live performances. However, I will anyway. A Show of Hands is still the best live release to date. Stages is really very well produced. You can hear individual fans in the backround, and the sound production makes you feel as though you are at the concert. Listen to it in surround sound. But, the performances are not as energetic as I have come to expect from Rush. This is probably becasue they are in their 40's now and albums and tours are numbered. Hey, how many times can you play Tom Sawyer like you mean it! But a mediocre performance by Rush is still better than the bubblegum pop-rock that intrudes on the radio airwaves and passes for music. One request from Rush, if you are going to make this ambitious of an offering of a live recording, please put some tunes that we older fans would have liked to hear. (AKA Subdivisions, Superconductor, Ghost of a Chance, and for gods sake Big Money)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Live Album, But Only One Song From Presto?","review":"This is a good live album from this very talented trio of musicians. Rush is truly an excellent group. Although I'm not a very big fan of their '90s material, I still enjoy almost all of the songs on Different Stages. I have only one complaint: why did Rush only play one song live from Presto? When I first got this collection a few months ago, I was disappointed about that. Presto is in my opinion one of the best albums from Rush, and their last truly great album. They could have at least played two or three more tunes from Presto. I noticed that they included songs that have already been on past live albums. That's fine, but Presto deserved more attention than it got on this live album. It would have been nice if they had included the songs \\"Presto,\\" and \\"Available Light\\" for instance. Oh well, this is still a great hits album that I recommend. On the whole, well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD,a real treat","review":"What else is there that can be said about this band that already hasn't been said.

Geddy's rendition of 2112 is a must have, as it stays true to the Rush sound and yet is fresh and new. Yet another masterpiece by The Masters. \\"Suddenly...you were gone...from all the lives you left your mark upon.\\" \\"In loving memory of Jackie and Selena\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding production!","review":"I think I much prefer these live recordings to the more sterile studio productions. Disk 1 contains a light and sound sculpture software program called \\"Clusterworks\\" by Hisashi Hoda. You have to check this out! It is indeed a \\"wonderous accompaniment to the music of RUSH\\". Recommendation: Install this software on the best multimedia machine you can find, grab a cold one, turn out the lights, and crank up Natural Science or 2112 while you experiment with this program. (TIP: on Windows NT, you have to run it from the screen saver preview in the Control Panel display applet.)An incredible visualization to the lyric: \\"Wheels within wheels, in a spiral array, a pattern so grand and complex...\\".Neil - our prayers are with you - may God grant you peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For any RUSH Fan","review":"I have been a lifelong Rush fan and I had been turned off by some of their recent CDs. Of course seeing them live is a different story. They have many live albums which are also required by a true fan. The big advantage of this one is that you get bits and pieces of some of their recent work as well as a live performance from the seventies as a third disc. In short, see them live or buy this CD set and you will be greatly pleased either way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great people!","review":"OK everyone here is massive Rush fan and I am no exception (fanatic since mid-eighties) but these songs are sloppy! Listen to the meter. They seem to speed up and slow down all over the place! I think us fans deserve better. Maybe it's just me but I think a professional band should be TIGHT and you can say that's too \\"sterile\\" for I live recording, but I just disagree. Give that new Journey live album a listen if you want to hear a tight live act. Also Geddy's vocals are way down in the mix..what gives? I know he doesn't have the greatest voice in the world but it is the one that's defined their sound for over 20 years.

It was a \\"nice\\" present, but what 7 year-old is going to pickup a toy that will teach him to spell. When school started this year, I decided to do some research about the LeapLink feature. I decided to give it a try and ordered it from Amazon. The service I received from Amazon and LeapLink was wonderful. It was easy to setup with a little help from the Leaplink customer service (call them before installing the software). After I downloaded his spelling words, my son thought this was a \\"cool\\" toy. Now all his friends (and their moms) want one. He is even playing with it on the weekends after his spelling test. Way to go LeapFrog and Amazon! As for the cost...the customer service rep said 6 months were free and they are still working out what the charge will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for elementary school age kids","review":"We bought the Leapfrog to spelling and my daughter loves it.

These are great educational products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor User Interface","review":"Beware if you hope to download your child's spelling words to your LeapFrog product. The LeapLink requires you to enter the weekly spelling words on their website and then require you to buy this list back for download. They do initially give you enough credits to buy several lists.If your child's spelling words are not on their approved list, you can't download that word without sending an e-mail requesting the word be added to the list.The user interface with this product is horrible. In order to download content, I had to answer four screens of information about me, and then register my child. There does not seem to be a way to personalize the child's name until after he has downloaded content, played with it (all the while being called \\"Dude\\"), and then uploaded. Each download/upload deducts from your credits.I am normally a techno-nerd, but the complexity of this product frustrated me to no end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for spelling practice","review":"I recently purchased this toy with the leaplink for downloads.

Hohenstein stumbles through 200 akward pages rambling about baseball. It seems like he tries to encroach on the reader that he has learned from his mistakes- all he has learned is the proper way to malinger. At no point does he acknowledge his role in his past crimes. Rather he seems to want to sugar coat it with what a great person he really is deep down. There is no evolution of character. We do see the demise of a man, but by his own accord. He fails to at any point to admit fault for his actions or how they have effected others. Even in the role of a coach he has flaws. I wonder what he really learned from little league after all. Additionally, the stories have no flow with one another. The entire books seems to merely be a lament over a lost existence. The only purpose the book does serve is to reinforce that individuals such as this should be kept behind bars for the betterment of society."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful and engaging","review":"I was given this book as a gift by a Tupac fan (I'm not a huge fan myself).

Gobi traveled with Tupac for a few years up to his death, and has great insight about this man who is deified by his fans. . . this book (Gobi is a huge fan himself) gives you some \\"under the surface\\" perspective about why people think so highly of Tupac.

Since seeing it the second time around, I've collected some of the film's memorabelia (the poster, the CD of the score and this interesting novelization of the screenplay). It's written mainly for 8-12 year olds but I'm 24 and I happened to really enjoy it. Having seen it twice, I remember much of the details of the film which the book remains faithful to.

I love horses and thought this would be a good gift for my nephew but after I got it I changed my mind. The story is kind of interesting but it seems from reading stuff on the Internet that it's really not true after all. So I'm not giving my nephew this book (which is labelled as \\"a true story\\").

Christy Brown was indeed an inspirational person who overcame a lot. However, Brown's writing style is simple and on the surface, lacking real depth and detail. He tries to be deep and intellectual at times, but it just comes off as overly dramatic and cheesy. It felt like I was reading a 13 year-old's diary...interesting enough stories within it, but not well-written at all. The only redeeming factor is that the book is short and a quick read. However, I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, well, whatever","review":"Ok, yeah I didn't buy the DVD. The show was okay though. It obviously didn't live up to the hype, as many of us were expecting surprise appearances from the likes of Hogan, Austin, Mick Foley, or Bret Hart. As far as the extras go? I was hoping for better. Doesn't seem worth it. I would have wanted the 5 nominees for match of the decade to be featured instead of just the winner (TLC 4), which I rank 4th among the TLC matches there have been. As far as the extra RAW moments go, I've got most of them on the Best of RAW DVD's. Now there's what you guys should buy. Don't bother with this. Get the Best of RAW Vols. 1,2, and 3. They've got better extra features, and they highlight the really great years of RAW that mattered (late '97- late 2000)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tease, Tease, Tease...","review":"Most of the reviews here are accurate, I'm a hardcore fan, and in the weeks leading up to the show, they teased some surprises. Do we get any? Not really, unless you count The Rock as a surprise. The choices of moments that were awarded were suspect too (especially Greatest Raw Match), but others were good (Shut Up and Kiss Me). But, if you want a faithful look back at ALL 10 years, this isn't the video. You'd do better trading for old RAW episodes than blinking through them in those video packages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"The Raw X show was a complete let down and nothing special. The show was supposed to be a celebration of the first 10 years from raw, however, the first 6 years are mostly ignored! Only the more recent Raw moments are featured. A complete waste of a show and further proof that the wwe ship is sinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Way To Celebrate 10 Years Of Entertainment","review":"Title says it all. I mean there were no surprise comebacks. The one thing people wanted to see. On the ticket it said it would feature over 50 people present AND past. No one. Not Bret Hart, not Mick Foley, almost half the nominees didn't show, and they didn't have people who did have signed contracts there like Kevin Nash, Steve Austin, and even The Rock (you can't count a pre-taped segment that they showed on the tron there). The only thing that was worth watching was the tributes to deceased legends and clips from old school WWF (I, for one, refuse to call it 'WWE'). My heart was beating right before the show, expecting old school wrestlers to show up, after the show I my heart was plain and simple dead with dissappointment. So if you want to catch a few glimpses of old school wrestling, then purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Geez, was this a horrible \\"anniversary show\\".

Invest your money on other worthy wrestling events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Tenth Anniversary For Greatest Wrestling Show Ever","review":"I don't own the DVD so I can't comment on the special features, but this had to be the biggest disappointment ever. At the time Stone Cold Steve Austin was on hiatus from the WWE after walking out the year before. WWE kept bringing notions on their television show that Austin would return at the special but after the superstar of the year was announced we all were left in disappointment. Plus WWE seemed to only award athletes who were in the organization at the time of the show. I can't see why they called it the tenth anniversary when all they did was really show highlights of the Austin era to time of release. Another reason why professional wrestling has lost its fans is this show. A huge disappointment and not even worth the one star for the lowest rating that it can be rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"WWE raw 10th aniversary","review":"this was the worst dvd i ever bought, it is just a show that was on tv in 2003, the extras suck, and they skip alot of the early days of raw, if you just have the urge to get it then do it but i do not reccomend this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk Doesn't Work","review":"I've wanted this movie for a while, so I finally ordered it.

It was shallow and disappointing. For one thing, I thought it was unrealistic that a woman would have a freight run in the \\"olden days\\". Also, the ending wasn't complete enough, like the other reviewers said. It also seemed inconsistant that a supposedly Godly man like Seth would fall for a snobby city-slicker like Rebecca (before she had her change of heart). And was Sarah ever going to marry Boyde?

I also think placing bait in it is awkward to do- i.e. you can't do it easily if the trap is on the ground as your hand/arm can't bend that way into the trap so I had to hold it up which often resulted in bait falling out as the bottom is not a solid sheet of aluminum.

I ordered this trap so I could relocate the culprits. I have caught and relocated two squirrels to a nearby lake/park, and now I have the joy of eating all the vegetables from my garden. I did have to put the trap in a 5 gallon bucket to prevent the squirrels from eating the peanut butter from the back of the trap. This ended up working really well for transport as all I had to do was pick up the bucket with the trap inside and put it into the car. I did not have to worry about the squirrel pea/pooh in the car.
