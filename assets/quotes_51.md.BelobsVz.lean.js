It has been difficult to find though - Walmart has them for a great price. I'm on their email alert as to when it comes in stock and then its only a few bars. Not every Walmart carries it. It seems to be in stock in more predominantly African American areas. It's well worth the hunt though.

Also I think it is offensive to other religions and cultures. The character dying over and over is just boring. I had a couple questions, like does every one get a chance to go back and try to save the life. But on a good note the book had some good points too. Like it was very descriptive like when it told how Peter's (the main character) puppets looked and the set that was made for them.

After he comes back to life, Peter finds out that his parents are going to have a baby and that he is adopted. All Peter wants to do is prove to his parents that he isn't a good for nothing kid, and he does, but how? I want you to figure that out by yourself.

He is given a chance to save himself so he can live but he ends up getting hit by another car.

They are rich with deep thoughts, insights, verbal beauty, humor. There are so many really great poems in this book ... but I'll pick one piece to mention: \\"Hurricane Bea\\". When I feel down or isolated, I read \\"Hurricane Bea\\" to make me feel connected to humanity again. That piece has so much richness to it. It's like a beautiful prayer and a love poem rolled into one.I re-read Finney's books all the time.

It might be on the Conan The Barbarian CD, or maybe Basil didn't compose it.Crystal Palace is the best track of the lot and the second track is good, too -- the love song.

What they should do with the Conan CDs is the same thing they did with the Star Wars ones -- release them with the complete musical background as it was in the film. That would be impressive.Another thing to note is that while The Barbarian Soundtrack has better music, the tone of the music in destroyer is more fitting for the themes in the original Conan stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice kitty-cat...","review":"Delightful bar of soap which should appeal to any feline fancier.

This book is similiar to Noam chomsky works in that the author has taken his credibility in one field and tried to pawn it off in another namely politics.The Author Makes broad generalizations About Conservatives and Liberals, which while interesting, are merely opinions from a Berkeley hermit. Lakoff Villanizes Conservatives, While flattering Liberals with sophomoric rational. Such narrow mindedness and hubris is something best left for Moorish Political propaganda for the masses.This Book is self affirmation for liberals, as Hitlers Racial ideology was for Facist. But beyond the warm fuzzy liberals will get from reading this, and the extra cash in Lakoffs pockets, there is little substance or anything new to learn here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy The Moral Mind Instead","review":"I bought this book a long time ago, and it made sense to me, I based my politics on this viewpoint, until I read The Moral Mind. The morality in this book, and with most liberals, and for a long time me, is seriously truncated. Read the reviews on The Moral Mind, a book that will open your eyes to several dimensions of morals, which this lacks. It is why conservatives understand liberals, but liberals are totally confused about conservative positions. After you read The Moral Mind, you will begin to understand what conservatives are really talking about and you will begin to understand the false logic so prevalent in this book.I know this doesn't actually review this book in any depth, all I can say is save your money.

One only has to read the Apostles' Creed, or heck, listen to the words of \\"O Holy Night,\\" to know how wrong Lakoff is. I think I sense a bias.

I suggest he stick to Cog Sci and Linguistics; and peer-reviewing isn't a bad idea either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Premise is the Problem","review":"I found this book very shallow in its understanding of both political ideologies. While he has a good understanding of the liberal point of view, his conservative side is lacking considerably. As a conservative I found out I have been close-minded, hateful, racist favoring segregated neighborhoods, supporting of moral strength regardless of outcome, classifying morals not my own as evil and a host of other deficiencies which do not describe conservatives at all. The premise is the problem however, not his motive. Since he is a liberal, he views the world through his own moral compass, however conservatives do not view many issues through morals. Facts and reality play a much larger part than morality. So while I cannot fault him for his effort, his substance was off the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Simplistic","review":"Lakoff aptly describes two personality types. But, when he applies them to the labels \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative,\\" his premise quickly sinks in a pool of irrational simplicity.It is the nature of human diversity that refutes this concept.

The political landscape is littered with similarly inapt labels that purport to explain human behavior in the context of the political decision-making process.Contrary to the claim that the book is a full-scale application of cognitive science to politics, it is a highly selective, overly subjective and largely unsubstantiated view filtered by the author's assumptions and experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral Politics","review":"Received this book for Christmas from my unsuspecting daughter and even though the author, George Lakoff purports to be unbiased, the opposite is true.I thought this to be an interesting topic, but as an awoved liberal, the author is biased right from the get go."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic crap","review":"This is basically just a book built to indoctrinate liberals.

It states that the debate today is to simplistic and leads not to negotiation of parties but instead making all arguments as simple stories that are easy to illustrate. The book then goes on to say that there are only to simple world views.I have never seen this style of writing and I feel fortunate for that. To break it down as simple as the author does with out using 200+ pages...The author asserts A=bad, B= good.

Useful NOT in understanding logic of modern Liberalism, but helpful in understanding Bush derangement syndrome, their fear and loathing of truly religous people, and even those who love and respect the Founding Fathers and the truly unique and incredible system of self-governance they created. Not an honest or comprehensive comparison of the two schools of thought, nor the history of how Liberalism of this kind has always failed and worsened the lives of those they espouse to care about, as contrasted to how American Conservatism has worked every time it's been attempted WITHOUT too much (see Bush 1 and 2) watering down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for the weak-minded who want to pretend they are something more","review":"A compendium of weak, foolish arguments disguised as scholarly thought.

The author makes unsupported assertion after assertion, creates straw men, makes silly characterizations of the positions of those he disagrees with, makes faulty inferences and draws faulty implications throughout the book. The author claims to have carefully kept his political leanings out of the book. In fact, the entire book is an exercise in moral sophistry through redescription, and one more failed attempt at building a moral metaphysical system. Lakoff's underlying theory (assertion) that our metaphors control our mental conceptualization of the world is finally being critically examined and reviewed.(For a devastating critique, read \\"Concepts as Metaphors\\" by Matthew S.

Now half way through the book, I now realise that the political spectrum as laypeople see it contains many, many shades of gray. For those who think of themselves as liberals somewhere on the left of the political spectrum, Lakoff's work will help you understand why liberals and conservatives believe in the things they do.

Though I still wholly disagree with them, I now better understand where they are coming from, and that is so important in our current political situation. It is vital that we understand rather than demonize the other's view in order to debate and question ourselves and eachother. We have definitely lost touch with objectivity and this book made me question conservative ideas in a new light, but also rethink my own progressive values.

It's uplifting, and firmly reminds us how we're supposed to feel.At the same time, it's beautifully arranged and composed, and the compositions themselves are memorable and evocative. Jerry Goldsmith's score is designed to lift our spirits, and although it's a bit overripe for its own good, it does just that.

The problem lies with the misleading marketing: It is presented as a Tyrone Power double feature and I bought it hoping to see a lot of Power in his young and gorgeous days. Well, caveat emptor: the picture \\"Girls' Dormitory\\" provides Power with ...about all of three minutes' screen time. And ! it's all at the end of the picture, obliging one to sit through a rather turgid and sappy story.The second picture, \\"Cafe Metropole\\" features Power in a starring role - and he is beautiful.So, my advice is: if you are a Power fan and want to see him, be aware that you will really only be getting, in effect, one picture.If you simply enjoy classic pictures from the '30's, you will probably appreciate this double feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Pillow","review":"Bought this pillow for my mom as a Christmas gift.

The only thing more beautiful than his gorgeous guitar playing, is his always distinctive voice. 'The Way She Really Is', and 'Resolution #1' are stunning highlights.

I thought that the switching back and forth actually added to the novel rather than being a distraction.If I had to have one complaint, I'd have to say tha the main villain's demise is a bit disappointing but that didn't take anything away from an otherwise fabulous novel.

I also sent them three e-mails, but they never responded. I returned it to Amazon, and they sent me a replacement about a month later. Amazon initially said that they would replace it in a few days. If they told me up front that it would take a month, then I would have asked for a refund. I have had the replacement for about a week, and it is still working. I'll update this review if I run into more problems.Overall, I don't recommend this unit. It just isn't worth the risk, and the customer service is awful. If you do buy it, then please save all of the packaging and don't hesitate to send it back for a refund if you encounter any issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"You only get a 4 inch screen","review":"If you're expecting to actually use all 7 inches of screen, you will be sorely disappointed. While this product has a 7\\" 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen) screen, you can't actually use the whole screen to watch widescreen movies.You have two choices: watch the movie in it's original aspect ratio (so everything looks normal) with big black bars on all sides, providing only about 4\\" of displayed material, or watch the movie in \\"Full\\" mode, where it stretches the 16:9 image to the full width of the screen, but doesn't stretch the height, so everything appears too wide. It's as if they never tested the thing with a real movie.Took one look at two movies (Shrek 2 and Star Wars Return of the Jedi) and it's going right back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is the second Mintek portable dvd we have purchased in 2 years. We have had difficulty with both machines reading \\"no disc\\" and not playing at all or only reading the disc sometimes. The first one we purchased began start acting up after about a year and the last one has lasted only 6 months. Fortunately the second time around we purchased an extended warranty and it will be replaced. We will not be replacing it with a Mintek.The first time I would have accepted as a lemon purchase but now that we have a second one with the same problem I would say it is a problem with Mintek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I too loved this unit when I first purchased it but mine too failed after about 10 uses!!!

Took it back to Costco a few weeks later for an exchange. Exchanged unit same thing took it back for a complete refund. Unit never handled roughly and no scratches on DVD's. Will think twice before purchasing this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Picture, Sound & Battery Life. Bad Mechanics","review":"This player has a metal case with a nice picture, good sound and about 3+-hour battery life. Sold for $149 at Costco in a package deal with case & 2 Headphones. Went threw 2 different players which showed the same problems it would freeze after awhile and you could hear the motor grinding. I thumbed it with my finger then it would skip a track them play for awhile and freeze again but more often. Gave the first one 4 days then the second 3 weeks to work the kinks out but no good so returned it. Not a Dependable Player and gave up on it and Mintek."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but poorly made","review":"I had this machine for about four months, then it would not recognize any of the DVDs we inserted. I had to ship it off to Mintek for repair. It took about two weeks to get it back. Also, the door that is supposed to pop up with a spring is very weak and takes some coaxing to open. The image is good when it is working (like most all of these players) but the quality in manufacturing it is fairly poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"After reading all the positive reviews for this unit, I bought one for the 5 day vacation trip. Sure its a great value as long as it worked and now it wouldnt read original DVDs and sometime the screen flickers. Also there were couple of occasions where the screen would just go blank... Now it would'nt read any dvds. The unit simply died... Do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks for a branded one instead. Its now a great paper weight not to say an expensive one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good At First, Especially for the price but broke","review":"I was initially drawn to this model because of the price. It is very inexpensive relative to other port dvd players out there. However, with low price comes lower quality. This became evident within 2 months of use. It simply died; stopped loading any DVDs. I returned it and got a toshiba, which was a little better (I had to return that model a few times as well). My advice, spend a few more bucks, get the better quality plyer unless you are looking for a disposable player that you are only planning on using for a couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Junk Junk","review":"Do not waste your money on this, do not be fooled by all the extras that come with it.

Easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Picture After a Few Uses","review":"The dvd player was used less than 10 times then it stopped showing picture while the sound is still good.

The product worked okay for a while, but then we had a problem where the unit wouldn't power up whether we were using AC power or battery. We tried contacting the Mintek customer service number several times. Each time we called during business hours and instead of getting a person we were directed to leave a message in the mail box. Twice when we tried doing this, we got a message that the mailbox was full. Finally on another try we left our contact information and a description of the problem and have never heard back from anyone at Mintek. I would strongly advise against purchasing a product from a company that provides this type of shoddy customer support. I can see from some of the other posts in this forum that I am not the only one to share this viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Customer Service","review":"This was given to me as a gift. The owner's manual and rechargeable battery pack were missing. The case was the wrong size and the DVD player did not fit. All I wanted to do was exchange the kit for one that was complete. When all the 3 different stores told me they were out of stock and did not know when more were coming in, I wrote the company hoping to get the problem fixed. I never recieved a response and will never buy a MINTEK item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Just Junk-Worthless Junk","review":"This was the worst item I ever paid over $200 for. Maybe got 20 hours of use-at most. Mintek Digital did not back their product. I cannot believe that the positive reviews did not come from employees or shills for the company. Sent the unit to be fixed. Told me it couldn't be fixed and I should buy a new one or pay $10.00 to get this unit back. I recommend all users contact the Attorney General in their state to file a complaint about this worthless product and company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems right out of the box","review":"I received this DVD player as a Christmas gift. The picture is great, but the first time I used the player I had problems with the movie freezing and the DVD player not responding - I tried it with multiple brand-new DVD's and always got the same result. After a couple of weeks I became so frustrated that I returned the player and exchanged it for a Toshiba SD-P1400, which is a few bucks more but also comes with plenty of extras - Hopefully it will turn out to be more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD weak - screen went black","review":"I was very excited when I purchased this item. What a great deal - it comes with all the accessories so no need to search and destroy for additional gadgets. The battery has a decent life and if it dies, there is a car adaptor to pick up the slack. Only thing is, it stopped working out of nowhere. I had it on for my daughter in the car - all was well. We went shopping and when we came back to the car and turned it on,the screen was black. You could hear the movie but couldn't see anything. Tried the monitor adjustment but it didn't do anything. Having read another similar review from someone, beware of this weakness. I returned it and now am in the market once again for a good portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after three days","review":"I read all the reviews for this player, including Consumer Reports, and was skeptical as the reviews were so mixed. But it was a good price, had everything with it we needed, and so I went ahead and purchased it on faith that ours would work. No such luck. After three days of use, the video screen went haywire and refused to display the movie. I didn't even bother with trying to get it fixed or replace it - I'm sending it back and plan to purchase another model. Note: a friend bought the same unit and hers works fine. I think it's a hit or miss product. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality dvd player","review":"Sent this back the first day picture skips and could not get battery to connect securly. Headphones and bag are cheap don't waste your time or money on this one pay a little more and get a better player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player for the money!","review":"I just ordered this based on the reviews it received. I was in the market for a DVD player and had been doing some research. I can't believe how fast it arrived, in less than 4 days!!My mom has an Apex 7\\" and the colors on the Mintek are much better as is the quality. It makes a little noise once it starts a disc but otherwise pretty good. My mom paid $278 for hers without the headphones, jacks or bag.My only complaint is that in the car if the sun is especially strong you will have a hard time adjusting it for the passengers to see. My minivan has tinted windows so it is alittle easier but my husband's car does not and it made it hard to see the screen for a little bit. All in all a great player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM MINTEK","review":"If you read the reviews carefully, you will notice a pattern that the positive ones are written by people who have had their products for only a short period of time. The people who have owned their units for a while are the ones who are negative because they have learned how unreliable these products are. My Mintek died after only 6 months of regular non-abusive use. No wonder the warranty is so skimpy -- 1 year parts but only 90 days labor, which is 90 bucks plus shipping. It's not worth it considering you can by another unit for a little more. DO NOT BUY A MINTEK! You definitely get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a name brand","review":"I bought the Mintek MDP-1720 for my son for Christmas 2004. Within weeks it was not working properly. It was nearly impossible to reach anyone at Mintek. After several calls, we were finally told to send the unit in. In March we received a replacement unit. Within a few months, that unit quit working properly as well. I've usually gone with name brands. I would suggest that you follow that advice. This is NOT a quality product or company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it-- sent it back","review":"I ordered this player less than a month ago and sent it back the next day. The picture quality was nice. The features and accessories were very nice too for the reasonable price point. However, when attaching the rechargeable battery pack I discovered the latching mechanism is POORLY designed and doesn't keep the battery attached. I checked to see if the latch was broken but that wasn't the case. It is just cheaply made of a low quality plastic composite and not designed to hold the battery securely. The battery moved from side to side and just fall off at will.I too like so many others appreciate the customer service Amazon offers and the return service in particular. There was a UPS driver at my door the very next day to pick it up and I was notified the day my credit card was credited on the return. This item was a loser but Amazon still sets the pace for efficiency and solid customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this brand!","review":"Bought the 7\\" portable for 199. Sept 04. It died this month. Returned for full refund,thanks to Costco's policies,and got the new 8.5\\" for the exact same price. Used exactly 1 week, and now this one won't work either! Thoroughly disgusted. Will return this one,but now I refuse to buy the brand again. By no means was I rough with either unit. The refunds cashier told me that \\"they get alot of them returned\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit of Miss","review":"I originally bought this DVD player because I believe that Mintek has one of the best looking TFT LCD displays on the market (although, it does look a little too dark with certain movies). I was also glad to see that you could set the audio equalization to different setings. What you get for the money is really impressive. Now, for the bad news. I have had this DVD player for almost a year now and suddenly it won't read any discs, it just spins a little and then says \\"No Disc\\". Never mind cleaning the lens, or your discs, it won't solve the problem. Luckily, I purchased an extended warranty with mine (I don't trust delicate equipment like this to hold up for very long). Judging from all of the reviews I've read on this website, I would say that you are lucky if you get one that doesn't break down after a few months of use. The question is, do you want to gamble with your money, or not. Its up to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Give More Than a Year","review":"This is a great kit for travel and otherwise.

This brand is cheap and should not be bought by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another thumbs down on the Mintek.","review":"Score another Mintek 1770 with a screen that went black. I am single, middle aged, no kids, and treat all my electronics exceptionally well. No spills, no jolts, no abuse, so I figured I'd take a chance on a portable DVD player with questionable reviews on the quality. Dummy me. The unit never got taken in a car, so it was never exposed to extreme heat, cold, jolts, or power surges. One day I turned it on and the screen was black. Huge disappointment and I go away feeling like a sap for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"yep-junk","review":"I really wanted to like this player. The first movie it played was great. But after that, it has progressively gotten worse. First, the screen started to be distorted for a few seconds at the beginning of each film...now it is up to 15 minutes into the movie before it actually presents a clear image. second, once the movie is going it is fine with the exception of a few random flickers through the movie (which. But if it does make it through the majority of a film...don't be fooled. The laser track gets lazy by the end of the show and freezes on a single image. attempt to jump to the next chapter...and it chooses to go to the menu. the only benefit it has presently is to play some CDs (if desperate because the speakers are terrible) but if you want to hook it up to a tv, that seems to work fine and probably the only redeeming feature of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD PLAYER","review":"We bought this last Christmas for a 4 hour drive. It actually worked until May -- so for five months. Then it got to the point where it would just say loading after putting a disc in and it never would come on. I went to their website and it actually says if this is happening to your unit, it is defective. So, I packed it up and have sent it back to the company with my fingers crossed. I've heard so many horror stories about this company that I am not expecting too much. Also, the thing that I REALLY didn't like about it was having to turn it off before turning off the engine of your car. My husband forgot once when he got gas. The screen went black and it took a long time for it to come back on. Definitely not something to use if you are running errands. So, don't waste your money on a Mintek. Buy a brand that has been around and that you can trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great picture, poor audio","review":"I recieved the MPD-1770 as a Gift, in Dec, 2005 and the unit was rareley used, except on short trips, Two weeks ago I bought a new DVD and decided to play it in the 1770. The picture plays fine, I don't have any audio, I can't reach Mintek or find anybody in the city where I live to repair it. I thought this was a reputable company, now I am wondering if they really stand behind their products. I really like the design just wish it had been more reliable.

It works well, is reasonably priced, has a handy-dandy carrying bag that hooks to the back of the carseat, and had pretty good sound and picture. Unfortunately, based on our own experience and that of the other users, its expected shelf life is probably 10 uses or less. We used the player only for long road trips, and were careful not to damage it or use it roughly. Between trips, it was carefully packed away in a closet. After using it a half-dozen times, the picture stopped working, and only displayed black. At roughly $25 per use, we would have been better off renting one each time we needed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great.... for a week..","review":"I left another review about how great this product was.

I didn't want to keep it and wait for when the display would go (like everyone elses).**I would not recommend this product, but if you purchased it and it is still within 30 days, Amazon will take the return.

The player stops at different place every time after I cycle the power. So we called customer service, but an agent with sleepy voice told me that it's covered under one year parts warranty :-) but I need to pay $90 labor since it passed 90 days :-(( Besides, I stil need to pay shipping to mail the defected player to Mintek!!! it's more than half of the price of the player!!!

Then after it was opened and charged, it was used maybe 4 times before it froze up and would not play anymore. I called Mintek, and wouldn't you know they only have a 90 day warranty from date of purchase. I am going to have to shell out more money to fix it!!!! I feel totally screwed over for my 170 bucks.

I own it, and I've listened to it about 5000 times. (if not more) The music has an innocence to it, and it seems to tell a story by itself...I highly reccomend it!The only thing I wish they did with this album, was include the song that they play over the end credits of the movie, and the song that plays in Mary's musical box.

Of all the soundtracks I have purchased in my life and most of them I have re-sold for much less money, I am sure I will never sell this one. The music composed on these tracks is the most unique, poignant music I've ever heard. It compares to the music from \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" which starred Nicole Kidman.

It has a comprehensive list of words and each entry has valuable information that is provided. The dictionary should help the reader in learning and understanding modern French.The author uses various typefaces, sizes of type, symbols and abbreviations to present information. Common expressions in which a word appears are often shown which assist the reader in the learning process. The phonetic expression of each headword is given which is very important since the French words often sound very different from similar English words.Key words, for example those which occur frequently or having several different meanings, are emphasized and indicated. I like the dictionary because it is very compact yet packed with valuable information as well as containing almost all the words one is likely to encounter when studying French."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"In my Language Arts class we had to do a book report.

It provides straightforward overview at any time revisions become necessary.However, the downside of it is that it hasn't been updated for nearly ten years now.

I'm a huge fan of their first album and I know all the songs by heart. This new album continues on with great soulful music that made me fall in love with their first album. My favorite song is \\"Anything\\" and I hope it's made into a single but only after \\"Chasing the Sun\\" is made into one. This is the perfect summer-song! I think if it has a great music video to back it up, it will be a smash hit for the next three months. I love all the songs but I gotta mention \\"If Only\\" and \\"Somebody Out There\\" because those songs are just amazing. I love the album. 5 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two is a must have...","review":"I have been a fan of The Calling since Camino Palmero came out and since then I had been waiting for their second album eargerly (but not patiently).

There are two songs that have a different sound in comparison to the rest of the songs produced by The Calling but I guess it is good to try new stuff. It is nessesary to change in order to grow. A lot of songs on many other cd's tell of love gone bad/good. I really like how this cd sings about totally different things in life ranging from life and death in \\"One by one\\" to a night of adventure (if you will) in \\"Surrender\\". For the most part, I think there's at least one song that everyone can relate to; that's what makes this cd great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Matchbox 20","review":"After listening to this album I found that this album had a familiar feeling; The Calling sound a lot like Matchbox 20 on this release. That would be bad but they sound like the better version of Matchbox 20. There are the rock overtones but this heads right down the middle of the Adult Contemporary aisle while still sounding good. Now this oculd be bad news if you absolutely loved the band's sound before but if you're a fan of the band and not just their sound you'll be saitsfied. As for me I don't necessarily like this sound because there are so many bands that go here. I'd prefer some newer bands that are trying something a little new like Interpol, Stellastarr or Snow Patrol. At least this album is good for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth your money","review":"I have to admit I didnt get Camino Palermo (although I will soon) so I cant really compare the two but this is still excellent in its own right. Best tracks in my opinion are 'One by One''Chasing The Sun' and 'Somebody Out There'. I would say that if you like music that you can stick on repeat and listen to over and over - then this is for you. Its very catchy with each song having its own stand-out chorus that makes you want to sing along. I would say that 'One By One' is the 'Wherever You Will Go' of this album and is my personal fav.

'things will go my way' is a particularly good showcase of their power. 'if only' is hauntingly beautiful; while the good, solid rocks songs, 'chasing the sun', 'surrender' and 'dreaming in red' are really something to get your teeth into. the first single off the album, 'our lives' set an incredibly high standard and the rest of the record certainly follows in its footsteps.

This is a compliment to the amount of information she provides about the plants that ARE in the book: where the plant came from, how to get rid of it, how it propagates, various musings of someone evidently quite familiar with the species, and more.Also, there are a number of species that only occur in southern California, so if you live further north like me, this information is not especially useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards?","review":"When comparing this with \\"Invasive_Plants. Weeds of the Global Garden\\" it would seem logical that at more than three times the price this book would offer considerably more. It does offer more text, and color pictures that are a little bigger. In addition there are small maps of California, showing distribution and small line drawings. This book would gain in accessibility if each new species started on a new page, if the line drawings were of a size and quality more aimed to facilitate recognising the species and if a more consistent format of color picture had been used, preferably showing some characteristic details.By the way I do worry about the way both books recommend the use of herbicides like glyphosates (roundup and the like): it sounds as if the cure may be worse than the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Historical Perspective","review":"A comprehensive historical account of how Prohibition came to be complete with vivid characters, noteworthy events, and corrupt politicians and public officials running wild! An effective account on the temptation of alcohol in the 18th and 19th century is used to lead up to the pre-Prohibition era. It was interesting to read that 19th century saloon keepers were often seen as the most cultured political influences in a time void of radio and television. From Carrie Nation to George Remus, whose life and times was a loose inspiration for Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, everything is here.

Fans og hid Star Wars or Dune work might want to contemplate a bit before buying this, as it is aradical departure from his usual.Ellison purists might not be too happy at the short story sequel to \\"Soldier\\" written by Anderson, but I thought it was decent. My favorite was an adaption of the episode, \\"The Man Who Was Never Born\\" from the original series.That, by the way, is the maindrawback. These stories (except for the \\"Soldier\\" sequel) are adaptions of existing episodes from the original series. Fans on the new one might want to steer clear.

No? Important Stratfordian scholars would have you think so. They also say there is little \\"book learning\\" in the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Then Ogburn lists all of the learning and various subjects Oxford was more or less an expert on...or had firsthand experience with (like travel, the law, falconry, botany, science, music, art, classical literature and philosophy, jousting, the military, etc.).

Unfortunately, Volume 4 did not deliver on the precedent set by Julian Marsh and Tony Moran in Volume 2. Where Volume 2 offered a incredible variety of masterfully remixed sounds (everything from Madonna, to Nanci Griffith, to spanish guitar, to Delibes) Volume 4 churned out a bunch of monotonous remixes of unknown, mediocre artists. While there were a few tracks I really enjoyed (Sunshine Day, Expand, and Daylight), I felt they were lost in their mundane surroundings. The rest of the tracks sounded the same, with similar styles and vocalists I couldn't differentiate from one another.

It is amazing we are a republic and not a territory of England - makes one realize the revolution for freedom was driven from above. also see John Adams"},{"rating":"2","title":"the crossing","review":"Overall a very good movie, but not completely accurate. Hamilton was not Washington's aide at that time, the outpost before Trenton contained many more Hessian soldiers than the four shown. Also, they managed to get to Trenton and put up a small resistance with the other troops. Four colonial soldiers were wounded at the battle, not none, and Gen. Rall died a day or two after the battle, not in Washington's presence that was depicted. Overall,I thought it was a well acted movie, highly entertaining, and worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Family Film","review":"Why is it that people feel the need to use so much foul language when trying to express themselves?

What a wasted opportunity for a realistic, accurate family oriented history lesson!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A crossing not worth making","review":"This low budget film about Washington's surprise attack on the Hessians in Trenton is probably as bad as it get's. Jeff Daniels is miscast as Washington, and what's with the Cap'n Crunch hat he's wearing? Though this picture could be nit picked to death the attack on Trenton is a huge disappointment. The Americans walk unopposed into Trenton and even have time to set up their cannons and place their troops just right. The fighting starts after the Americans practically have to wake the hung over Hessians up. It's sad that this myth was made part of the film. How anyone could give this more than two stars let alone five is mindboggling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed....","review":"Being a big fan of Jeff Daniels' acting and Revolutionary War drama, I ordered this movie and was very disappointed. The sequence of events is historically accurate but the characters are not very well portrayed. The crudity and obscenity were unbelievable in an unrated movie--in at least two places Washington uses the a-word to refer to someone's behind. Right! In the 1770s they still used that word to refer to a donkey. And we still have a copy of Washington's orders that his troops were to refrain from profanity. It is known under extreme provocation Washington used an occasional four-letter word, but never in casual conversation like in this movie. Stick with true history...try Jeff Shaara's books on the War."},{"rating":"1","title":"No African-Americans?","review":"Although most reviewers found this movie to be very accurate, I find one glaring error.... NO Americans of African decent. THE FACTS: George Washington himself requested two black oarsmen to accompany him on his boat. The biographer of \\"The Crossing\\" made sure he included the action between Henry Knox and General Washington in reference to swamping the boat, but again, no blacks. Please understand, I was excited to finally see a positive portrayal of my heritage displayed on the small screen. Can you imagine my sadness when seeing we were purposely left out?

I would not be so certain about the accuracy of the movie either--few movies are. The general course of events may be faithfully adhered to, but no movie based on a historical event that I can think of has not taken liberty with the truth for one reason or another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched; poorly cast","review":"I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: \\"how many killed?\\" \\"None\\" (correct). \\"How many wounded?\\" \\"none\\". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled","review":"I really wanted this to be as good as the other reviewers said it was, but I was really disappointed.

Any history buff will love this film - that's why I bought it after I saw it on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriotic Revival","review":"Good films on the Revolution are hard to find. This one was packed with action and the drama of Washington's last roll of the dice when the odds were so severly stacked against him. The film is truly worthwhile, if only to further instill some patriotism in your kids and remind yourself what our ancestors went through to gain our independence. And Washington would be a hard character to play: unless your Jeff Daniels. He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter","review":"I love this movie! Except for the exploding shells I find it to be very believable and extremely enjoyable. The dialogue is interesting (Howard Fast's work) and the acting is good. The settings and props add to the authenticity.I noticed that the \\"making of\\" documentary shows that the movie was shot in widescreen. I am disappointed that the DVD did not have this version.I hope A&E or others will make more Rev. War movies like this one. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful portrayal of Washington","review":"My girlfriend and I enjoyed this film and felt as though we'd really seen George Washington. The film begins in 1776 and ends with the conclusion of the surprise attack on Trenton. This is one chapter of history we feel intimately acquainted with now. Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution. Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical movie...a little slow in parts.","review":"I enjoyed this movie and show it to my American History classes. The kids liked it. It is very historically correct. I have to admit that I kept thinking about Jeff Daniel's Dumb and Dumber character when I saw him as George Washington, I dont think the students noticed. Other than that distraction.. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and informative","review":"Although it has some minor errors, overall the true story of what these incomparable men did still amazes me. Where could we possibly find such citizens today? I think that anyone who has studied the revolution and has tried to imagine the sacrifice and hardship these people endured would, or should, have a deeper respect for our nation. Sadly, given the present attitude in America, this isn't the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done in all respects","review":"This movie was well done on every level. Good script, believable acting, excellent editing, great direction. I really liked the way Jeff Daniels portrayed Washington -- strong, understated and always believable. This movie works on every level and absolutely makes you feel like you're \\"there\\". When a historical drama is able to make you feel transported back through time, it has succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside view","review":"This book is as in depth as it gets into the wild life & good times ofthe 1980's. There is so much more into the making of Duran Duran thanone could have imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"notoriously bad writing","review":"I was so excited to get this book, I pre-ordered it months ago. It arrived and i sat down to absorb it. I have finished it and here's what I think: The wretched thing reads like a text book and an extra boring one at that! Mr. Malins has recycled 20+ years of print and T.V. about the band into one agonizing manual. There was no new information...my god there was no gossip even! Finishing this white elephant was an exercise in patience. Any Duranie will think it a snore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for seasoned fans...","review":"This book is nothing more than a hodge-podge of hastily gathered interviews and reviews from the thousands of articles already written about Duran Duran. Steve Malin's account of the band from its early years to the present day is adequate at best, but there is hardly anything in the book that the seasoned Duran fan does not already know. Malin claims to have interviewed over 50 people close to the band for this book, but there seems to be precious little of any personal accounts in the finished product. If you know nothing about Duran Duran, and are curious, this book is a good start. Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore","review":"As a 20 year Duran fan I was anxious to read this. It does have some interesting tidbits but I found Mr. Malins writting style rather a chore to read. The detailed recap of reviews for every song of every album seems like just page filler.

An EP that has no slack or filler. Sweet short and simple. Although, this music is by no means simple or sweet on face value, it is haunting and synthesized. This strikes the same vein as the Kid A - Amnesiac saga -- and could be viewed as a chilling addition, expect that it's not Radiohead here, but Thom Yorke! This man continues to amaze me with the effects and extensive use of synthesizers all by his lonesome. This album is a very impressive effort that stands proudly next to its predecessor, _The Eraser_. I think it foreshadows more good things to come from Thom Yorke's solo career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Electronic","review":"I love this CD. When away from Radiohead Yorke goes VERY electronic, more-so than when with Radiohead. I like it in small doses. But then ultimately after a few songs I just start jonesing for the whole band. These songs work well within playlists, especially The Drunkk Machine, and A Rats Nest. Worth getting for anyone who is a fan. Do You LOVE eraser? if so you will LOVE spitting feathers. The video is OK, Plays fine on my OSX machine but the viewer window is quite small Approximately 6x4\\" which was a disappointment. The content of the video is of typical Yorke political imagery.

But there is no such thing here plus it is completely out of date and talks about building web services using different mediums, which I don't really care for.

The next best thing is actually being briefly taken in by the idea that you can self-inflict stigmata by reading the word 1000 times. Then laughing at yourself. Not a worthless book by any means, but a 10 minute read if you don't want to experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This novel or as the author descibes it as an \\"antinovel\\" is just mind boggling. The book is filled up with repetition and certain specific research about the history of the stigmata. The stigmata is fascinating and I have always wanted to know the background and history involving it. This book really just gives the reader dates of famous stigmata recipients and then just repeats the word stigmata hundreds of times with little pieces of the authors opinions hidden in the text. This book is very much its classification as experamental..but maybe a little too much and not enough focus, interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"With an album like this can you really blame music pirates?","review":"Who are the theifs now? Making anyone pay money for this noise pollution is a crime. Seriously, I suggest downloading this album if you want to hear it, but even at that, it's still not even worth the effort. The production was poor, the musical composition was pathetic, and you could feel yourself getting dumber just for having listened to the lyrics. You'll be better off in life having never heard this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I am sorry, but I have to inform all of you that this CD is a waste of time! I am a big fan of Metallica, but St. Anger is terrible. There is one or two \\"ok\\" songs, but the rest of them are riddled with annoying tin can sounding drums, and very little guitar solos. Not to mention the lame lyrics, tic tic tic tic -- come on.Buy the latest Nickelback instead!Wishing the next CD is way way way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, this one really sucks.........","review":"I would give this negative stars if I could. I heard this one at one of those listening kiosks in a music store and it was just so painful to listen to. Near the end of one of the songs it sounds as if Hetfield's having his nuts pulled off or something but we all know that those were long gone since the court case against Napster. It just sounds like a bunch of drunk guys beating on garbage cans. I never thought I'd hate an album more than one made by Madonna but here it is.

I can't believe it, but I did not like one song the first time I heard St.Anger. Why does the production sound so cheap? Lars sounds like he's playing a kiddie drum set and his drums mute the sound of the guitars which don't sound that great either. These guys should have worked with the producer that produced System Of A Down's Toxicity for a better sound. That is what an album should sound like. Crunching guitars and heavy drums that don't block out the guitars. Hetfield can't sing anymore. There are some good riffs on the record, but no solos? Also what happened to songs in the style of Unforgiven. I guess they just wanted to prove that they could play harder than anyone. They just forgot that its not only how fast or hard you play. You have to write good SONGS and Hetfield can't write those anymore. This record sounds like it was made in the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saint Aweful","review":"The only thing i can say is that I just wasted [$$$], Jason Newstead took all the talent with him when he left the band !!The worst garbage i have ever heard.

Deal With It.This does not mean they have no taste, just a different one.Personally, I think this album sucked. The first few songs were okay, but the rest was just bull. All the songs sounded the same, there were no solos, nothing to hook you for the full eight minutes or whatever length of the track. \\"Some Kind Of Monster\\" is okay, though too long for its own good with a weak ending, and entirely too much exposure on radio and such. Played out entirely. If you want Metallica music, try out Master of Puppets or something like that.

It's like Lars forgot to turn on the snare on his snare drum. Pretty annoying but I can make it through one track . But now it's in my head and it's really bothering me and I can't ignore it. And what the [heck] it's the same on the next track and the next one. I keep thinking this has got to be a joke. That snare is part of what keeps this band tight! The rest of the band is right on but the drum keeps ringing past the cut-offs.I am so bummed. Maybe Bob Rock got so into ghost playing his bass parts that he forgot to pay any attention to producing.

Is this what has become of the greatest metal band of thier time? Kirk Hammet doesnt rip at all on this album, resorting to power chords. The lyrics are weak and repetitive and the vocal part does not present any sort of musical ability. The MetallicA that created \\"Ride the Lighting\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" is long gone and this album proves it. On the other hand, if you like Limp Bizkit and Slipknot and the rest of that death metal/rap garbage then you should enjoy these 11 tracks of trash.

So....after the horrible garbage they put out in the 90's it is no suprise that this cd is terrible. They saw their heyday 1983-92ish. I saw them in Foxboro, MA 7/6/03 and was disappointed. Half the show was the new [bad] album. They are done. Hard core fans will stand by them but I still wish I had seen then in 91/92 when everything they did up to that point was great. They are now a horrible band. A [bad] 2003 version of \\"Spinal Tap\\". At least Jason had enough pride to walk away when he knew they were only milking the machine for retirement money.

They sound like some cheezy metal band, that's just starting out in their garage, that listens to too much Metallica.And if that wasn't bad enough, the recording sounds like it was done with one mic on a boom box! (Does anyone else hear that annoying bell in the snare drum?!?! And why are the vocals so frickin' loud?!?!

It's apparant from the \\"Some Kinda Monster\\" DVD Metallica are just spoiled rich guys, not putting any real creative intensity into their work. Since they've collectively \\"lost it\\" as artists, perhaps they should go their separate ways...after all, this album is not Metallica. It's more like Lars puking on the mixing board. Kirk is nowhere with guitar lead (doesn't want to be bothered). I'm not sure whether to feel sympathy for James or not...perhaps he shouldn't have been trying to do an album while he was in rehab.

The sound is AWFUL, the lyrics are juvenile, and the tempo sounds like Lar's had a siezure!! Gone is the musical and lyrical genious of Metallica's past...the heavy rolling thunder that I know to be Metallica has been replaced by the worst sounding garage clanking I have ever heard. Sitting through this album was physically painful! If the 'Talica boys want to experiment with some ridiculous cathartic attempt at death metal, they should keep the tapes to themselves and use them for therapy. But the paying customers, the loyal fanbase that catapulted metallica from sleeping on U-Haul pads to mansions deserves far better than this. This CD will sit in my collection and collect dust....if I could get a refund I would!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this an anti-piracy tactic?","review":"'Cause what a brighter idea than to release an album that no-one would bother downloading, let alone BUYING!! I won't go into further details, Metallica was done, well over a decade ago and this embarassment has only put the last nail on their glorified coffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ping - pang","review":"Because of the awful drum sound I can hardly force myself to listen to every song in it's entirety. It's like when your out to eat or at a movie and there's a baby in the distance crying and screaming. You try to ignore it but it slowly eats at your ears and into your brain until you want to scream and run away.However, the drum sound may be better than the lyrics and volcals. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is up with those drums, Lars??????","review":"I will make this short: This album is God-awful. Every song has this crappy hollow-echoing drumming by Lars that overpowers even the guitars. It sounds like a child's drum set being played by a spastic. If you haven't heard this album yet, don't bother. I listened to it twice, and those stupid drums just made me insane. What were they thinking?I hope they can make a comeback with something else. The album should be titled \\"St. Piece of Sh-t.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the Good reviews","review":"Reading the reivews of sait anger, i have found out alot of people say they just like the album because they suport metallica, or they feel we need to give them a chance to like the new music. but i feel they are all rong. We need to show metallica that we (the public/fans)do not like the new music, so they will change the music style on the next album to a style that more people will enjoy. for all those people out there supoting metallica's new album just to suport metallica should stop, telling them you like it will just make them play more of this sh*ty ass music, i just want to let them no they made a bad choice, and will hopefully they will learn from it... now who's with me?P.S still a metallica fan, and will die happy just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mettalica is over (sigh)","review":"This album is really crap!!! Is (...)!!! is NEW METAL, guitars drop tuned, horrible drums sounding like cans, stupid riffs and pseudo rapper vocals... they're selling out, whre is the trash metal?

Metallica gets no respect","review":"If you're not into Nu-Metal (uN-Metal) don't waste your money... even if you think you're getting a good deal because of a discount. I was broken-hearted to see that my former-#1 band released this steaming pile of dogsh*t. I like Metallica's old stuff the most... it kicks major @ss all the way up to \\"...Justice...\\". Hell, I even like Load, Reload, & S&M, but this is simply intolerable. The guitars are tuned down extremely low (w/drop tuning) and the drums are annoying. James Hetfield sounds out-of-key half the time. There ARE some parts of songs with great potential but overall, I'd say that Bob Rock & Lars Ulrich have butchered this band... Oh, & this album (if you want to call it that) also lacks the guitar solos that Metallica has been praised for on previous records... Kirk looks so bored in the DVD-Rehearsal session."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE F.....?????","review":"James Hetfield once said that Metallica could crap on a record and everybody would buy it. Guess what? You did and nobody did. Unlistenable garbage. The worst thing to come out since Nirvana."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is metallica?","review":"What? Hello!!!! This album doesn't even sound like the Metallica as we knew it!!! If you read the lyrics, they aren't that bad, but the way they perfomed it, the way they made it sound, its terrible, just terrible. I really liked metallica, the old metallica. People may say they like this album, but you've got to wake up and smell the coffee (the rotten old coffee i might add) and realize how this album has just brought Metallica down. Don't buy this CD, I thought it was going to be great, and after i bought it, i was totally dissapointed. Its a waste of money and there are better CD's out there to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paiinful","review":"I know alot of people complained when Metallica started to go more mainstream and are probably content with this album (if you can call it that), but I thought that songs were supposed to sound at least descent if not, shall we say, good? The songs are thoughtless, the drumming is god-awful, and the overall sound is painful to listen to for more than about 2 or 3 minutes. Maybe next time Metallica will write music, not noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"They quit","review":"Let me tell you this:it's obvious that some people will like this album and others will not.Everything in the world goes like that.You can see here in Amazon who liked this one:it's people who make lists recommending Linkin'Park,Coldplay,Bruce Springsteen and so on.You can see here who didn't like it:it's people who make lists recommending In Flames,Opeth,early Metallica,Devin Townsend and so on.I join this group,proudly,of real metal fans.This is not true metal,the recording is badly done,lyrics are not interesting and it's boring.Metallica is worse than ever.I hope Iron Maiden's \\"Dance of Death\\",to be released in September,doesn't disappoint me as Metallica did since \\"And Justice...\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME KIND OF MONSTROSITY","review":"Please kill me now.If you want your music collection to sound like this all you need is a cat, a red-hot pole and an empty biscuit tin. Metallica have fallen from great heights and are gaining velocity. I thought they'd hit rock bottom with Load and ReLoad but they're still digging. Someone said they were going back to their roots but they must have taken a wrong turn, for they missed the mark completely. The guitars sound pretty bad - where are Hammet's solos? Hetfield sounds awful; the lyrics make me cringe. Don't get me started on Ulrich's snare. And the new guy hasn't impressed me much either. This is an abomination, an insult to metal.Buy this if you want to kill yourself but don't have the guts. It will give you that extra nudge."},{"rating":"1","title":"god this is offensively shit","review":"metallica arent really my fave band but i got into them after hearing one from justice, i borrowed this album form my local library and i couldnt beleive just how awful, crap, sh*t, w*ank, poor this album is. god its bollocks, notjing vut everyone attacking the strings. dont waste your time, money and sanity with this crap. ITS PISS POOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent!!!","review":"I remember the first time I heard about St.Anger. I was thinking it was going to be their heaviest release to date, man was I wrong. With all the hype it had, it let so many metal freaks, who were expecting some old school metallica down. This cd is acutally worse than Load and Reload put together. St.Anger has nothing to offer to the hardcore metal head. The singing is pure bull$hit and doesn't sound anythhing like James Hetfield. It actually sounds as if they recorded the singing from James shower. The drumming is one of the biggest letdowns. Lars please stick to the sound that made you famous in the first place. The bassist is a monkey who cares more about dancing on stage than acutally playing. And where are those solos from Kirk Hammet, I mean come on guys what were you thinking. Other than that, I don't recommend this album to anybody except for those nu metal punks who think St.Anger is the greastest thing metallica put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End Of Metallica","review":"I bought this album not long ago and I have to say that this is the worst Metallica album yet. The lyrics are meaningless and every song goes off beat and jacked. Metallica died in 91 but they are definitley selling out. I listened to it over and over and watched the dvd countless times and tried to enjoy it, but I just can't. Do not waste your money on this album it sucks. I am a loyal old skool Met fan, but this is ridiculous. Don't buy it. Go listen to real music like CKY, Malevolent Creation, Old Metallica and Black Sabbath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad casing, awesome CD!","review":"I hate digipak casing. First of all because the CDS get scratched up easily. I got the St. Anger like that and 24 hours later the CD is all scratched up because of the case. Anyway, onto the CD. IT ROCKS! IT IS SO GOOD! I LOVE IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just another nu-rock album","review":"i dunno if i gotta cry or laugh at metallica for releasing this album, hetfield voice is not the same and the songs are really messed-up i'rather st.anger to be an instrumental album, there is something wrong about 'tallica. im really dissapointed. try to listen to it before buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mettalica goes back to its roots!","review":"Blow me away!!! Mettallica Rocks! This album is on the edge between thrash and metal. Hard Core fans rejoice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is a bunch of overpaid, untalented, business men.","review":"I think when Metallica decided to make this record and have the movie come out documenting the recording process, it was clearly a business move. Because Metallica, knows it has loyal diehard fans, and they could release anything and people would buy it. This record was a desperate attempt to make a profit at any cost. Don't let them steal your money for this piece of garbage. There's no more integrity in their music. It shows you the kind of people Metallica really are. A bunch of overpaid, untalented, business men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably HORRIBLE","review":"This is the most pitiful thing I've ever heard. Up until the \\"Black\\" album, Metallica were amazing, and even little bits of \\"Load\\" were okay, but, WOW.... Put it this way, if you put third graders with potty mouths into a room with guitars, told them to write about what makes them angry, add in some \\"cool\\" swear words here and there, and then put a retarded, deaf kid in the producers chair, you'd make a better \\"metal\\" album than this. When did Lars start playing on tin cans? It's 3 years now since I first had to turn this album off (midway through \\"Invisible Kid\\" I had to break it in half and go vomit), and I'm still pissed. F--- YOU, METALLICA!!!! Way to turn your fans against you even more, idiots!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The downfall of the empire","review":"This cd is pathetic. The first time I played it I waited till I heard it ALL to pass judgement. Which I think judgement was made for me by the fact that I only remembered ONE song off of it!!!!! and that was because it had the same name as the cd. I remember when I first started to work at my job back in the day and I had Master and Lightning on a tape, one on each side. It played over and over and over till the car died before the tape did. You WANTED to hear the songs over and over. Even though you knew every riff, every word by heart, you wanted to hear it again and again because it was soul crushing, mind destroying METAL and you NEEDED it!!!!! I DONT NEED THIS!!!!!! NO FAN SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SUFFER THIS!!!!!!!!!!!! Hey James,Lars,Kirk,and Rob...... since you clowns have everyones money....how about you GIVE IT BACK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm....yea.......ok","review":"I picked up this album because a friend told me to. I had always kinda liked Metalica but never been a huge fan. This record's purpose was to change that. It did just the opposite. It reinforced my opinion on the bands suckiness. What happened to the Ride The Lightning days? They sure the hell ain't here. The only good songs are Frantic and St. Anger, and even so, Frantic's Fran-tick-tick-tick-tock chours gets very annoying real quick. Don't waste your time. Not even worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a greatest hits album","review":"The main reason that Metallica survived from the 80s into the 90s was because of a remarkable ability to come up with a seemingly endless stream of heavy melodies. Those melodies were used for riffs and vocal lines, giving a wonderful sound to ultra-distorted guitars and Hetfield's gruff voice.Well, folks, that ability seems to have gone the way of Jason Newsted. Instead, we have a cacophonous piece of garbage with nary a vocal note to be had. Hetfield, ever of limited range now reverts to simply screaming, Hammett seems to have died, and Ulrich plays on a drum set stolen from a Times Square bum.I was never one to say that Metallica sold out with Load, and I'm not saying they sold out now. They simply have reached their limit as songwriters. I would be very surprised if they were able to come back from this debacle with another decent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can only wonder what crap is next","review":"yes this metallica cd dose indeed suck... Bo Rock messed with the snare tuning, James can't scream any more, there are basicly no solos, and rob is just an ass. take my advice DON\\"T GET IT!!! if u want a good tallica cd get kill em all, ride the lighting, master of puppets or and justice for all"},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Piece of Junk!","review":"Yes, I'm angry. Angry by being fooled by this once beloved band. Angry with Lars. Angry with this lack of production being advertised as a \\"comeback to the old sound\\".

And thei had PRODUCTION and they DID NOT HAVE Bob Rock.That's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELLCOME TO NU-METAL GARBAGE CLUB.","review":"We are Metallica, we forgot our past when we are a THRASH band.Now we are in the same team of bands like korn, limp bizkit and linkin park.

So buy this piece of junk and make us even more rich!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album I've ever heard","review":"I can't even get past the 3rd song before I have to stop and put something else in. This CD gives me a headache. Give a kid some pots and pans and let him bang on them and see how long you can go before you get a headache as well.I would try to trade this disc in at the used CD shop, but they won't even take it since they already got a boatload of used copies that other people already traded in.I'm ashamed to even have bought this CD. If I would've known what I know now, you couldn't pay me to download this crap online."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT VERY GOOD - ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY BAD","review":"I used to love Metallica. I still listen to the older stuff and I have even come to embrace the first 6 tracks off of Load. It's been over a year now and St Anger still flatlines my enthusiasm when listening to it. It really is a poorly made CD. From the horrendous sound and production to the poorly crafted songs, and finally the silly 4th grader lyrics. There is nothing here I can endorse. I see Lars and James promoting their movie that is coming out this month and I feel they have become wealthy detached people. I have no interest in paying 10 bucks to see Lars and James bicker like little kids. Who wants to watch over two hous of that ? They truely have become clueless..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Crap","review":"Metallica craps yet another turd with St Anger.

ST.Anger is absolutely the worst album I have ever heard. Number one it sounds so different than any other Metallica album that came before it. It also has the worst lyrics I have ever heard. Bands like Winger and Quiet Riot come up with better lyrics than these. One of the biggest problems with St Anger is that they stretch out the songs to long. Many of the songs could have ok if they were around 3-4 minutes, but at the 8-10 minute mark most of the songs are extremely annoying. I wish I could return this album! I'm thinking about running it over with my car, I think that would be the most joy I could get from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"how could anything be this bad","review":"i love metallica with the exception of this album. How could metallica let themselves be this terrible. The guitar riffs suck and the guitars are tuned down incredibly low. It is just a bunch of grown men making talentless noise. unless you are a redneck who drives a big truck you will not like this cd go buy one of there earlier c.d.s like ride the lightning, MOP, Kill em all or a megadeth cd possibly a nirvana cd dont waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Death Of Metallica and Hopefully Corporate Metal","review":"Let St Anger seal the fate of Corporate Metal. After this miserable failure , hopefully all the major labels will be afraid to sign any metal bands and maybe the underground will start producing bands that can write original talented music. Music generes seems to turn stale and sour once the major corporate labels get involved in the scene. Metallica has been long overdo to fall into obscurity, and maybe finally now Metal can start fresh. St Anger might be just what true Metal needed. A end to corporate rock and hopefully the begginng of a new underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid...","review":"It's better than anything they have done yet post black album and thus far (Lulu) post St. Anger. The editorial reviewer obviously hasn't heard the album as dirty window is not an instrumental......damn paid reviews...... idiots. Listen to Lulu then listen to this again and you will have a greater liking for it or any piece of music. As a whole this album is an epic failure in every aspect. The riffs are decent in places but are very uninspiring, repedative, the vocals suck, the tin can drums are aweful, the lyrics are laughable, the cover art is a jolk, and it has no solo's.....but then again solo's wouldn't save this turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't!","review":"don't buy this album.. just don't. its not worth the money. both the album and the dvd sucked. some songs like st. anger and frantic are good, but they aren't worth buying. i suggest you burn a copy off someone who paid good money for the cd when it originaly came out. someone who had higher expectations from a band who gave you suck abums as master of puppets and ride the lightning. so don't buy it or else you'll regret it like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Metallica","review":"If I could give this album a zero I would... Metallica started out as playing REAL Heavy Metal Load and Re-Load were OKAY by my standards not bad not good..... but this new album is just trash they have gone from bad to worse... Nu-Metallica is total commercial TRASH and has not one shred of good in it! Total utter TRASH... So do yourself a favor dont buy this CD EVER.... if you want REAL Heavy Metal look into the following bandsHeavy Metal- Helloween, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Sonata Arctica, Panteraand if you like extreme stuff look intoDimmu Borgir, Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem, Dodheimsgard, Immortal etc....LONG LIVE THE TRUE METAL SCENE!!!!DOWN WITH COMMERCIAL TRASH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Metal junk","review":"What do you expect from a Metal album?Rap? country vocals? the same boring riff over and over and over... again? the most stupid lyrics as possible? an idiot banging on trash cans? no guitar solos?If you like this kind of music buy st anger now, the perfect album for nu metal fans.If you want a great Metal check out Exodus new album Tempo of the Damned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY","review":"If you are a Metallica fan, then stay away from this CD. I have listened to it several times in an attempt to find something enjoyable about it, and it is just a waste of time and money. Hetfield's vocals are terrible, to much emphasis on Ulrich's drums, no Hammet solos, and the bass playing of a producer and not a musician. Forget the other reviews praising Trujillo's arrival into the band. His involvment with this CD was that he joined the band in time to have his picture taken for the insert. Bass was actually handled by producer Bob Rock. To sum this CD up, it blows. Cliff Burton must have been psychic because he actually took the easy way out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"DIE HARD FAN OF THE BOYS HERE BUT I LISTENED TO THE ALBUM TWICE ALREADY AND IT SOUNDS SO WEAK!

Metallica, Slayer, Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, etc.; were my heros. In 1991, Metallica released the 'Black' album and they lost me. I didn't buy 'Load' because I knew it was another Bob Rock production, nor did I buy 'St. Anger', but I did listen to them. For an album that's over an hour long, there is not one guitar solo on 'St. Anger', or at least a memorable one. What was Kirk Hammett's role in this album? It sounded like it was recorded in a garbage can. No rhythm, no grove, nothing. I've heard that Metallica is know working with Rick Rubin, I don't know if that's true, but I don't think even the best record producer of all time can breath life back into Metallica. They've lost their original fans, and I don't think any effort Metallica tries will win us back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow just wow.....","review":"I honestly don't get how they could even be the least be proud of this hunk of junk.

Firstly, it sounds like it wasn't produced at all, sad given the excellent production standards of the previous Bob Rock produced albums (starting with the Black Album). The drums sound like they were bought at Wal-Mart and James' vocals are grating.The songs have no sustained melody whatsoever, it's all very syncopated (title track St. Anger is a good example if you've heard it). Not like early albums like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets, but unlike anything I've ever heard.There are maybe a couple songs I had any interest in listening again but if you take the worst song on any of the previous Metallica albums they all rate better than the \\"best\\" here.The bonus DVD is pretty cool or otherwise this album would only rate 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"As I have been an ardent 'Tallica fan since Justice, it hurts me to say this...St. Anger is awful. No discernible riffs, no solos, and what happened to James' voice? Even though their music has changed over the years, the one constant was the power of his vocals and now they're just powerLESS. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Raw experience.","review":"Metallica once again raised the bar in new metal. This album is unlike the prior 3 albums they released. There is a ton of metal and not much else. It sounds like Metallica really wanted to just play hard and fast and express themselves as the leaders in Metal. This is not an album for the faint of heart, or those who like to listen to audio at a low level. I find the louder I crank it, the better it sounds! The best word I can think of to describe this album would be Raw. Thanks to the Mighty Metallica for delivering yet another CD that will undoubtedly change my life!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bang and scream","review":"They have really fallen.....Once a great band that played awesome guitar rifts. Not and single guitar solo on the entire disk! What's up with that?????? The whole album is nothing more than 3 guy's grinding their guitars and one guy smashing his drums. Oh yes, and screaming, not singing, screaming...... I just shook my head in disbelief throughout the entire album. The ONLY reason they got a 1 star rating from me is because you can not give 0 star or negative star ratings.This is a sad performance from what used to be one of my favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dissappointing","review":"This cd is somewhat different than what they have done before. I like the music instrumentally except for the lack of Hammet solos. That is severely missed!! The biggest problem I have with this cd is the vocals. Don't get me wrong I love Metallica, but this cd the vocals just aren't there. The songs are a little too wordy and James tries to get to high in most of them. I don't think that is his strong point. I think they got away from what really makes them so great which is outstanding guitar and drum play and songs that never ever get old. Overall, it is ok, but nothing really new or ground breaking which I usually expect from Metallica. The included dvd is nice though."},{"rating":"1","title":"no room for this album on theCDshelf of a real MetallicA fan","review":"the CD is okay if you are a fan of Slipknot, Drowning Pool, even Limp Bizkit. i dont mind mrtallica creating something like this...it's a good thing that they're not afraid of trying something new. but the problem is that they are forcing this album so much, and trying to persuade their fans that tihs is the best that's ever come out of the band, and it's worth having. this CD belongs to the new nu-metal generation, not the real heavy metal fans. after listening to 2 or 3 songs, the album gets boring. there is NOT ONE guitar solo part in the whole album, and there is no need for 2 guitars. the guitars are tunned low like any nu-metal band...they sound trashy and its hard to hear any melody. most of the songs should be made 3 minutes, instead of 9. overall this CD is a pretty big dissapointed for a loyal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep! It still sucks!!!!","review":"I bought this drink coaster called St. Anger 3 years ago. Listened to it. And went a pawned it at Half Price Books to buy something better.

Flemming Rasmussen has got to be laughing hysterically at Bob Rock! What a chode! Thank God they have a new producer. Let's hope the next one ACTUALLY takes them back to the days of Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets. If not, you can't blame Bob Rock anymore! Then I say, fire Lars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica....WHAT THE HELL!!!!","review":"What is this garbage you call music, let alone metal???? Seriously, this is pure trash, the only reason for my one star rating, like the other comments before, is because there is no 'zero rating' or I would have put that. This album is a complete and absolute disgrace to metal. This is as bad as playing something from Backstreet Boys or Nsync. Did you honestly think your fans would enjoy this...this...this...I don't even know what to label it, it's that terrible. I very strongly advise anyone and everyone to stay clear of this album, don't even look at it, it will give you nightmares!!!

I'm not going to be like the other people and say \\"after I listened to this CD 5,000,000 times I started to like it.\\" This CD was the worst CD since the load/reload series. Lars' snare is horrible in this CD, he spent a lot of money on a snare that sounds like a trash can. I think Metallica might have just set the standards too high when they made all their CDs with Cliff. The new bassist Rob Trujillo is pretty good though, though Jason Newstead will be missed. Rob is really aggressive, but they used his skills and not enough of their own. Poor Metallica, better luck next time boys, I'm only giving this a 5 star because I couldn't bear to rate it any lower because they're talented.RIP Metallica1983 - 1989Nu-Metal just isn't the way to go anymore, minus Deftones. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer \\"The Thinking Man's Metal\\"","review":"I understand that Metallica has always been about the evolution of their sound, but this sounds more like a few steps back. As one reviewer put it, you can listen to this CD and it might sound like one long jam session. There are no cool intros, no catchy riffs, and not a single guitar solo. I would say that the newest Godsmack CD displays more progress and polish than this album, and those guys have no where near the talent that the 'tallica boys have. Nowhere. I am only 21, and didn't witness the rise of Metallica first-hand, but I miss the emotion and skill displayed in the first five albums. Those were the albums that blew you away, like listening to Van Halen. I still love Metallica, but I expect much more. Oh well, at least we have Garage Inc to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Demo Version...NOT!","review":"Some good riffs but overall I am very disapointed. The mixing on this album is absolutely terrible. The drums sound like it is a demo studio album. I used to be a huge Metallica fan, but this album is by far their worst work.

James' vocals need SERIOUS work and I dont know why they had Kirk sing at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"St. Anger is the first original album that Metallica has put out in almost 6 years. They have changed their style over the years going from a hard, solo heavy sound to this ridiculous piece of tripe that resembles the Korn, System of a Down and Deftones [junk] that doesn't have any melody. Kirk is far too good a guitarist to let him not show up and show off after 6 years of silence. All of the songs sound the same and James Hetfield doesn't even yell on key. Back in the old days he did at least that. I have been a Metallica fan for almost 20 years and have been more and more disappointed with the music in the past ten, but this is just garbage. The solos are what made them great, not hard, muddy and toneless (read: repetitive) garbage. Heart breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something New?","review":"Few solos, heavy bass & drums, attempt at rap-metal... What was Bob Rock trying to do with these guys?

I have never purchased a Metallica album that I flat-out hated (I have all of them). Some I like more than others, but I find something about each one that I adore.I put this CD in my system to find that song after song was just bad. The lyrics were subpar. The guitar work, while heavy and loud was missing the solos and originality. The production was bad. The songs seem to have little or no groove or feel. Its hard to describe, but not one of these songs \\"felt\\" right. They all seemed to be chaotic and messy...So far, I have found nothing on this CD that indicates a quality piece of work. IMHO, this CD flat-out blows...HOWEVER, the CD does come with a DVD with the ... songs being recorded live :-) HOORAY!!!The ONLY reason I gave this 2 stars (instead of 1_ was the concert MP3 filesthat I was able to download from their site.Those were pretty cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason Newsted's got the last laugh...","review":"Horrible!I've been a fan of METALLICA since I first bought \\"Kill 'em All\\", and I actually bought \\"Ride the Lightning\\" on the 1st day of release. METALLICA was the epitome of the classic hard rock/metal band with crunching guitar riffs, excellent guitar lead breaks... great lyrics... awesome songs. .....Now... fuhbeddaboudit! This new album is a sorry attempt at pleasing the \\"nu-metal\\" crowd... absolutely NO guitar leads! Down-tuned songs...... Yeah, the songs are long, but they go nowhere! You kinda wish the songs would end! Horrible......

Especialy if you still Hate Metallica because of It's thing with Napster.It was gonna happen sometime. You know you shouldn't have gotten all of that music for free anyway. St.Anger was a CD filled with new ways of doing things. There was also a lot of aggression put in it. It had a lot to due to with what they were going through at the time anyway. I like 5 of the 11 songs a lot and the rest are OK. I bet half of you haven't even listened to the CD. So unlless your band hits it big and you sell 15 million records you can't say anythig about this Cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm what the heck happened.....","review":"Why the heck did they even release this CD...? I was looking for solos, driving beats, attitude, and generally good music. That is not what I found. And I'm not stuck in the 80's because I'm 17, but I guess wanting solo's could come from the fact that I play guitar. It used to be that Metallica was the holy grail of rock music, now they are the most outrageously horrid bands ever. I personally think this is the biggest waste on the face of the earth. THIS IS A DIFFERENT METALLICA THAN ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER DONE. I really don't know how to describe this travesty... Anyway, the drums most of the time have no musical beat, kinda like horrible punk music-just beat on it and who gives a *cough* about musical quality. The guitars are basically the same throughout the entire album, and the bass you really can't hear because of Lars killing his drums...I'll take it back if I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"For a long awaited album that was going to return to the darker, more pounding agressiveness of yore, this was a serious kick to the groin.I got a copy of this from a friend and felt horrible that I wasted $.25 for a CD to burn it on. It literally was the single most painful thing I have listened to in a good long while.Maybe Jason was on to something when he bolted. I no longer have any animosity for his decision. This album lacks songwriting, musical integrity, and production. They should have named this one, 'Basement Days'. That is the closest comparison I can draw to the sound.This is for Lars.... What in God's green Earth is the kind of drum you seem to have fell in love with? It is terrible. Kinda like a bad Jamaican kettle drum. The fact you bang it over and over and over just made me almost psychotic when I heard each song...."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Garbage]","review":"As a big Metallica fan i had high hopes for St.Anger. This is a total disapointment. I cant get over Lars' snare! The reverb from the snare overwhelms everybody and everything. What happened Lars? Forget how to tune a drum? One other thing is missing. Kirk! There are absolutly no solos on this album. What ever happened to the kick [rear] solos? James' lyrics could stand some improvment, all the songs kinda sound the same and get predictable. Overal a big disapointment. Load and reload are better than this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally ... It's METALLICA ... not AlterniticA","review":"I'm shocked and surprised. I came close to not even buying this given how awful their recent work has been. The \\"Black album\\" their peak? Try Master of Puppets!It's clear they're trying to return to their old style. It makes sense, the long-dead art of the heavy metal sound is starting to come back into the mainstream. I just question whether they're doing it to satisfy the fans or if it's the direction they really want to go in. Hetfield's voice sounds a bit strained. It just doesn't seem as sincere as their old work but there's still some good head banging material here.I give them 4 stars if for no other reason that we finally have another high energy room-thrashing heavy metal album from Metallica and not some sedated watered down version of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger is a major disappointment","review":"I've been a fan of Metallica since I first heard Master of Puppets, and I've bought them all since. I even liked Load and Reload. Garage Inc., wasn't bad either. But St. Anger truly is bad. One of the other reviews I read said that all the songs sound the same; they do. They sound poorly produced, the guys sound like they were each in separate, sound-proof rooms during taping (i.e., everything is disjointed like they didn't know what the others were playing), and Hetfield's usually powerful vocals are flat and uninspired. I've listened to it repeatedly to see if it grows on me. It doesn't. In fact, I keep skipping songs to see if the next one is an improvment. It isn't. I normally listen to a CD before buying it. But this is Metallica -- so its got to be good right? Wrong. What a disappointment. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because they are least trying something different. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking...","review":"Okay, I've been a good Metallica fan for a while, but when I listened to this album, I was disappointed with the sound. Metallica has lost its sound. Its lost its feel. They tried to copy what they had and it just didn't work. At most I see two songs on the album that would be close to the Metallica Sound. Beyond that, they are searching again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Fleming Rasmussen","review":"Bob Rock is a terrible producer and an even worse bassist. James sounds like he's going through puberty in most of the tracks, Lars sounds like he's playing to a different song and Kirk just doesn't get any solo time. They have obviously lost their touch with the world and music that is being put out now. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because pushead is back after about 16 years. I'm not a new guy to Metallica at all, I bought Ride the Lightning on tape the day it came out and all the other albums the day they came out so I consider myself old school Metallica, but this is just [awful].If you want to listen to go really good new music, check out Anthrax's new album \\"We've Come For You All\\" awesome album, or check out Type O's new one, just don't buy this one. Get one of us who spent our money already to copy it for you and let it sit around after you listen to it once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lars' Ego Finally kills Metallica","review":"It appears that Lars' ego has finally killed Metallica. There is a lot to like on this album, but it is hard to hear since Lars decided that he needed to be out front and drown out everything else. The annoying hollowness of the drumming is just too distracting. Too bad it was Jason who left and not Lars.If this album were re-mixed to tone down the drums, it would stand above Load and Re-Load. As it is, it is just too painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"YES to going back to heavy, NO to horrific drum sounds!","review":"I'm sorry, but as much as I want to like this album, I cannot. I am very excited about Metallica going back to the heavy, aggresive stylings that got them to where they are today, but when Mr. Rock (producer) thinks he can blatantly increase the volume on certain bass drum hits (using Pro-Tools software) while Lars is playing amazingly fast double bass drum beats, and leaving in the snare drum ring on most every track that no honest low-fi producer in his right mind would ever do, is a sad day in rock n roll.It seems as though this album was just a little rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different But Decent","review":"At first when i listend to the album i was confused, was this really Metallica, but after a few times, it really grew on me. Tracks like Frantic, St. Anger, My World, and Sweet Amber are very good. The only reason im not giving the album 5 stars is because I miss Kirk's solos, but I guess you can't have everything. If you want to hear something different from the the greatest band of the last 20 years then definatly buy St. Anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the metallica I remember!","review":"I was very excited for this album. I kept hearing comparisons to Master of Puppets and the metallica of old. I was horribly disappointed! James vocals sound like they don't fit the music and the drum sounds haunt you in your sleep!

I was pleasently suprised when I found out that not only [was it not bad], it was in fact pretty good. I am a little disappointed that there aren't any three-minute guitar solos, but I also realize that that is kind of an 80's thing to do. I do gladly sacrifice the solos in the name of having a really heavy, driving album, which this is. No, it's not \\"..And Justice For All\\", but how many albums are? And who's to say that anyone would like a \\"Justice-esque\\" album anyways? If Metallica would've released a solo-heavy album, they would've been critisized as rock dinosaurs. No matter what Metallica puts out, someone is going to be disappointed, but when you take it for what it is, \\"St. Anger\\" is a very, very good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Crap is by ???","review":"When I heard Metallica was coming out with a new album, I was excited. I'm a huge Metallica fan, but this album absolutely draws the line. I cannot believe anyone would waste their money on this, much less ruin their hearing with it. This is the absolute WORSE album that Metallica has ever done. There is not a single song worth listening to on it.Metallica used to be Gods. Now they've fallen, and they've fallen hard. There's no way they'll ever be able to grasp what talent they once possessed. They're nothing but sellouts now. Money-hungry, obviously deaf, sellouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica has crapped in our faces again","review":"This album contains 11 crappy and poorly mixed songs.

The riffs are repetitive and simple, downtuned and boring. The songs are painfully obvious there was a solo placed there and then taken out later in fear that their non-metal audience would dissaprove, thus countering all Kirk Hammet's statements about never putting in solos and not needing to prove himself.

I was ready for James to start screaming and someone to come on with a rap solo. Ugh.Go and get the Black Album, Load, Re-Load, Ride the Lightning, ...And Justice For All, and Kill 'em all. Then find some other band. Metallica's not worth it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than I Expected","review":"After two mediocre studio albums, I was afraid that this one would be more of the same. But I was pleasantly surprised. This album is definitely not what I expected. It is extremely heavy and there are no slow songs. I don't remember hearing any guitar solos either. The songs are full of massive riffs that evoke memories of ...And Justice for All. The production, however, leaves much to be desired. It often sounds like a $99 drum set was used for the recording. The snare drum is perhaps the worst sounding I have ever heard. Oh well, at least it wasn't yet another typical Bob Rock-sounding affair, even though he produced it. For those fans that may have thought that Metallica had gone soft (I'm one of these fans), think again. They have re-invented themselves and re-established themselves as the kings of metal. Buy it now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch...","review":"This is not only the worst Metallica album thus far, it is also some of the most forced sounding material ever written. I'm not sure why after not releasing a studio album for 6 years Metallica has produced something as talentless as St. Anger. Many people hated Load when it was released, well you'll cherish Load after hearing this album. Every song sounds similar to the last, and it's not a good similar, trust me.

Metallica have truly gave up on their fans, why else would they want them to spend their hard earned money on an album so poor. I realy wanted to like this album... I listened to it time and time again trying to let it grow on me, but I could handle it no longer. Everything is dissapointing- the production, the lyrics, the vocals, the drums, no guitar solos. Who cares what the band was going through (for all those who said this album had alot of deep thought and meaning behind it)because they are millionaires. Most true Metallica fans are not going to buy an album because of Hetfields psychological state and meaning. Metallica need to move back in the slums, grow their hair back, and return to true metal.

I usually don't like a CD the first time I listen to it so I tend to listen to a CD several times before I make a judgement about it, but after listening to St Anger numerous times I have yet to even remotely like it. The songs on the CD lack depth to the music, every single song is basically a guitar riff, a bass guitar riff, add in basic drums and then vocals, rinse, repeat. The music really reminded me of any garage band out there that just got together and were trying their own stuff. You would think with the many years they have been playing, they would be able to put out a better CD but this is not the case.If you want raw, unrefined, garage band style music, then this is the cd for you.If you want developed music with depth (like I do) then look elsewhere.

Hopefully they'll be back again, but not with this one. Too bad. Technically they still seem good, but need more work on the songs. Not vocals, just plain song writing. I'll probably give this thing away to some tallica head that comes around. Not going to get much play from me. I give this one star because this is Metallica. Not some average band.

It's like nothing they've done before - doesn'teven sound like Metallica. It's the firsttime I WANT to turn the music down because I'm notsure at times if it's not just noise. Lars isannoying with his banging on the drums, and I hearnothing of Kirk. James, I love, but at times hedoesn't even sound like he's singing - merelyscreaming and off-key at times too.I miss the ballads. The whole CD is too much ofthe same.

Look back at Metallica's musical carrer and you will see that what made Metallica constant in the past, and what has been missing for so many years, is Cliff Burton.Cliff had started writing And Justice for All which set the mood of that albumn. After that, Metallica started to depart from what brought them to the dance. Sure, the BLACK album was great, but it started the departure from what Cliff had always focused on, the best metal going.Metallica needs to change their name, just like they have changed their style.

Gone is the great melodic \\"metallica\\" rhythm. They grew so much as a band that this seems like such a setback. All this despite the fact that Bob Rock is still producing their albums. I didn't think there would be much of a dropoff when Jason left the band. He's probably is not the main reason this album disappoints, but it may be a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the????","review":"I listened to it once, then I listened to it a second time and I am incredibly underwhelmed. What is wrong with it? Once you finish listening to it you go away not remembering a thing but a sonic assault of noise. I bet these guys weren't all in the same room when this was recorded nor did they listen to what the other musician had lain down when they put in their parts. The first album I ever bought by anyone where after 24 hours after buying it I gave it away to someone else. I just couldn't stand it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it","review":"This isn't just bad - it is AWFUL. \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" were disappointing too, but they were not bad because of the music. The music was actually pretty good - but it was not METALLICA. That was the problem. On this new album, they try to get back to their heavy roots but they have nothing left. This album is boring and worthless from beginning to end. They are trying to mimic the younger bands out there and come off like old men trying to play kids music. If you are a Metallica fan, save yourself the disappointment of listening to this [cd]."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NEW METALLICA STILL RULES!!","review":"METALLICA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 21 YEARS AND THEY STILL KICK ASS!

The sound of the album was an obvious attempt to come up with a new sound that goes against the grain of what they have done before. Anyone thinking that the album was produced badly is wrong. At the level of popularity and prestige Metallica has a badly produced album just doesn't happen. They did this on purpose, folks. Unfortunately, the experiment failed. The album comes off amateurish and uninspired. You have to remember Metallica has made some of the best metal albums of all time. In context, this one just doesn't cut it. They will move onto something else.So as a fan of thrash, I just can't recommend this one; but a fan of experimental music might really like it. Honestly, listen to it BEFORE you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica's mistake","review":"This was Metallica's mistake, no doubt.

Some o my favorite albums are metallica albums (master of puppets,ride the lightning. etc)i however was reall pissed off when i purchased St anger. What the hell is up with these guys?

Believe the hype, it's bad. I don't know.. Maybe it could be better if the production wasent just god awful, and if they fixed James vocals, and my god... If they put a real snare drum on this cd instead of whatever Lars happends to have used for one. Thats what just kills it. The snare drum makes the cd pretty close to unlistenable.Just a drum you say? No... I don't think it is a drum at all. Its really that disturbing. I wanted so much to like this cd. I give it 2 stars over one because it comes with a full legenth dvd where they play the entire cd live, and it dosent sound half as bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dvd","review":"This review applies to the bonus dvd.

People complain that there are no solos, production is lacking, repetitive etc...People expected a return to MOP but this is not it. It is something totally different and great in its own right. It's such a brutal album where the louder it is, the better it sounds. Hearing Metallica put some speed to these songs is awesome. On the title track, you can almost feel them slamming on the accelerator as the slower section transitions into the their tribute to damage inc. Oher songs like the unnamed feeling, sweet amber and all within my hands make me like this cd more and more every day. This is a cd that deserves multiple listens. It truly grows on you; I like it so much more then when I first got it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not alone!","review":"I am yet another long time, die hard Metallica fan who anxiously awaited the release of this album. I bought it the day it came out without having listened to a single note. BIG MISTAKE!This has got to be one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. Needless to say, the worst Metallica album. It was a challenge to make it to the final track. I couldn't do it in just one sitting! From the terrible lyrics, to the extremely poor production, to the solo-less guitars, this was a total disappointment! Is this really Metallica? Is this some Milli-Vanilli hoax? Whatever it is, it's a lousy excuse for an album.Save yourself some time and money, stay away from this album!If you're a \\"new\\" Metallica fan, go spend your money on \\"Ride the Lightning\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\", you'll get a alot more bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Metallica hates their fans. That is the only explanation for this. Napster drove them over the edge, and they've decided get their revenge by releasing and album that totally sucks so that people would waste their money on it. I was able to find a couple of tracks that I like, but for the most part the album is generic and low quality. Most of the songs sound like demos rather than finished songs. I mean, you know these guys are talented and they can do better, but it's like they weren't even trying. I have nothing else to say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"St Anger isn't half bad...It's ALL bad!","review":"This is by far the worst cd Metallica has ever done. Production, songwriting, playing, drumming, singing...it's all pure caca! It is a very BORING cd. The songs are all long, repetitious and there isn't even ONE solo. Why even have Kirk around? The drums...well...it sounds like a marching band. Very rhythmic but they just go in circles. There is no imagination on this album at all. And it seems to be as if James and the boys just said, \\"Well, Im bored. Let's churn out some crap..You know kids'll buy it cus it's US!\\" The fans got screwed...royally screwed on this cd. I was so mad...I kept hoping (PRAYING) that it would grow on me. I desperately hoped that, in a world where we have rappers on one side and pop drivel on the other, Metallica would come to the rescue. Alas! Metallica is dead. This album deserves no stars and the band should all end up with monkeypox! Cliff is surely spinning in his grave. Thank God we still have Pantera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No solos = No good","review":"St. Anger is definitely not worth buying just because there is not one guitar solo on the entire album. I have no idea why a band with one of the greatest guitar players of all time(Kirk Hammett) would leave out solos. I know Metallica was trying to write \\"heavy\\" music again, but they forgot to put any thought behind their songs. The lyrics are terrible, the drums sound like trash can lids, and the bass is undetectable. Although this album isn't as cheesy as Reload, I'm not sure if it's any better.

Sorry guys, you broke my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...waste of 12 bucks...","review":"I heard this would be their hardest album since MoP, well maybe it's hard, but the songs blow. Rolling Stone gave this CD four stars...that completely baffles me...4 stars? This album [isn't good], plain and simple. It was a bitter letdown for me. I am totally confused by the production. Sounds like it was recorded on a $20 tape recorder while they played in a garage or someone's basement. How could they listen to this and think it sounded good? Have they all gone deaf? Do they think it sounds \\"raw\\"? Well it doesn't. It just sounds horrible. The drums sound bad, the vocals are too loud and sound like [garbage], and the bass is washed out. Add to this the fact that there is only one song on this whole album that I would care to ever hear again, and you get the picture.

I have the utmost respect for Metallica, but I do not understand where they were going with this particular album. Most songs start off in true Metallica style but by the time the vocals and the tin can drums start you might as well be hearing fingernails on a chalkboard. Don't get me wrong, I am all for band re-inventing themselves but when I hear that this album is being compared to \\"Ride the Lightning\\", that could'nt be farther from the truth.

This is not a return to metallica being a metal band... The title track is a summary of the entire album, terrible sounding fast drumming with too much double bass, then breaks into clean guitar and a lame attempt at off time drumming, with a transition that doesn't work very well. The vocals are totally weak, and sound like Hetfield can barely keep pace with the speed of the music. Lars' snare drum sounds like he's playing a coffe can and the bass drums sound like ice cream pails...and his playing isn't even worth mentioning! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"First off, the lyrics are simple. There's no true heart to this album. I'm not sure what the deal is with the tin can drums, but I'm sure Stewart Copeland from The Police could help them out in that department. I'm glad that there isn't bass distortion like on their previous albumns. Certainly miss the guitar solos that would sound sweet to your ears. Also every song almost sounds the same, but the tempo changes help....When you hear Metallica, you should be put back in your seat. This is not the case on St Anger.

Very dispointing indeed man, it sounds like they're trying real hard to sound like new metal style, the lyrics don't really flow or even have significance like they used, his voice is terrible, drums are sloppy and ... and where the ... is hammet in all this. This album has terrible orchestration, why won't they wake up and see that their true fans want the old style speed/thrash metal Metallica back, NOT what this. Truely if you compare Kill 'em all to this , there is a HUGE difference. Lets hope they'll change their back somewhat(or at least better) someday(when ever that is)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just face it guys","review":"I'll admit they were never my favorite band, but never denied that they had a talent and something different. I can see the disapointment in most fans. But those of you who say \\"SO WHAT\\" to no solos and production quality don't know jack-s*** about metal. Maybe this is all a prank from Lars to punish people for tapping into his profits from online downloads. No excuse for such a poor production, in a time of Cakewalk and Pro-tools anyone with half a brain could have gotten a decent mix. But again, they decided to go on tour with Stinkin Park and LAme Bizcut, two no-talent bands, instead of touring with another metal band. As for those trashing traditional metal, you all know in Europe and the rest of the world it is thriving, just here in the US with Record company owned radio stations do we only hear the crap thats out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listened a couple of times, threw away.","review":"OK, I actually didn't throw the disc away, but this release is simply bad. If you like those nu-metal bands like linkin park and such, you might like this cd. I still think this is below even linkin park though.First off, nothing makes sense at all. For instance, in past Metallica, you could SEE that Master of Puppets was about drugs and manipulation. This one just has no meaning. Secondly, every track sounds exactly like the rest. The only saving grace is the title track, St. Anger. That one sounds kind of reload-y, but at least a little more like Kill 'Em All. All in all, Metallica is a done band.They've alienated their audience, and then tried to make a gimmick album to win people back. I fell for it. I swore I would never buy another Metallica album after S&M; without listening to it all the way through, but I listened to the hype machine and got it.Well, at least I can rest my drink on this coaster.RIP Metallica, 1982(yes, the band was formed in 82)-1991."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Ridiculous!","review":"I have given it my best effort, but I cannot stand this Album.

Great guys, I'm glad you can still play really fast. Unfortunately, that is about it. I liked the start of the title track until I heard Trujillo barking on it. Who is he, that dude from Cypress Hill, it would have been better to hear Scooby Doo! Anyway, quit trying be the guys you're touring with and hang it up. I'm going to go throw on Master of Puppets and relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Metallica, once thought the hardest, most kick..band around has sunk to a lower level than Hansen will be at. Talk about bad music. This album makes Reload look like Master of Puppets. It seems that the band not only lost a key member of the band in Newsted, but aquired some weird spider-like bassist from Ozzy in trujilo. The music created on this album is half...and terrible, they try to recreate speed metal when in fact they all bang on their instruments with little or no rythem and then break to Linkin Park like chorus' that in fact [IS BAD].

After all these years of great music they take away guitar solos and meaningful lyrics.Also what was lars thinking when he took a steel drum out of the dumpster.what a sorry excuse for music. Is metallica trying to ruin their career. I thought they had learned their lesson when load and reload bombed miserably. But they went and tried to do it again. I'm sorry to say but the almighty metallica his hit rock bottom. Do not waste money on this terrible album, it's not worth the headache.

However, I am at heart a lover of good music and I have to say that when I heard this album I was very disappointed. The drumming is terrible and off beat. It sounds as if Lars is playing a 55 gallon drum at a construction site. There are no guitar solos (which is a waste of one of the finest guitar players ever). The bass playing is just straight out bad. And James has lost his emotion, his anger, his passion and his voice. All around I can't even say one of these songs is anywhere close to the caliber of music that they have done in the past and cannot stand up to todays bands.

The whole album just sounded like a bunch of noise and screaming vocals. It's not very enjoyable. I like a little melody in my rock music. Their BLACK ALBUM is by far the best that Metallica has ever done....and after this I am convinced that it will be hard to beat it.

It's like when you go to a resturant and order a meal, and the serving is HUGE, but unfortunately the food sucks, so whats the point. No hooks, lousy singing, the playing is uninspired, uninteresting, loaded with obscene language to impress the twelve yr. olds.

The sound and drums alone just stink. Where are Kirk's familiar guitar solos? The lyrics alone are poor quality in themselves?Maybe the loss of Jason Newsted from the band \\"did\\" have an effect on the material Metallica have decided to put out this time?

I had no idea what to expect other then the single i heard on the radio. ... To me all the songs pretty much sound alike, just like jazz music.

Rock's overproduction does little to hide the fact that these songs are bad, boring, and poorly constructed. Like the last two albums, the vocals sound horrible as Rock encourages James Hetfield to sing like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Segur. There's nothing heavy about that. And there is no anger to be found on this record, only angst, a poor boy's substitute. Metallica is simply a thing of the past, back when anger and agression didn't have to be faked. Stick with the early material and stop wishing for a good new record. It will never come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh","review":"I bought this cd in the hopes that Metallica would follow up their claims that they were Quote, \\"Returning to their Roots\\".They liedThey detuned their guitars and thew away all their musicianship.This is Nu-metal crap.

While it is true that the album sounds horrible, the songs are good. Frantic and St. Anger are both great songs, and so is \\"The unnamed feeling\\", just to name a few. The drums are very loud, but don't sound as bad as some people say. It's really the guitar-sounds that really(...). The guitars sound way too muddy, so at times it's hard to hear what is actually being played. This album is not the melodic Metallica of the Black album and (Re)Load, and it is also not the pre 1991 Metallica. This album is something completely new. I just wish the album sounded better.

James,why aren't you writing proper and traditional lyrical structures with proper verses,choruses and bridges? Lars, why does you drumming sound all metallic, and not like real drums? And why did Metallica use Bob Rock for bass? James and Lars shouldn't allow Kirk to be involved with any of the writing for the next album. They should make him play crazy solos on every song again. What ever happened to the melodies, harmonies, and ballads that they created many moons ago? Please come back for me and the rest of the Metallica fanbase on this entire Earth! One other thing that needs to be done is for Bob Rock to be ditched. Metallica needs a guy like Phil Spector or Mutt Lange to produce their next album.

Metallica pretty much lost me on Load and all of their later offerings(just not the same).After skipping reload and S&M,I had heard of the HYPE surrounding the new cd.I bought it and the only Anger expeienced was with myself for buying this!It was so bad that I gave it away.Buy if you must have it to complete your library,but you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like good thrash you are in for a real dissapointment!","review":"This is absolutely the worst album I have ever heard!!

What happend to these guys, they used to be so amazing. On this album James sounds like a dying cow when he sings, Lars sounds like he's hitting garbage cans, and where the hell is Kirk!? Come on man, Kirk is one of the best guitarists ever, I don't care what ever anyone else says about him, who cares if he uses a wah pedal a lot, he's still great, but on this album he just sits in the background, he probably hates this album and thats why he doesn't play any solos. Stylistically this album is riding the nu-metal bandwagon AFTER nu-metal was in. Bottom line, you want Metallica (or you like rock music), get \\"Master of Puppets\\", that album is so amazing it's not even funny. This album sucks, DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange...","review":"Funny how everyone thinks Rob Trujillo is a great addition to the mix....yet he didn't play the bass for the recording of the album.

Jason Newstead...that's what they need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best since Black!!!!","review":"Not a bad album. It is a lot heavier than any album previous to this one. Do not expect it to sound like their 80's work. If you are a Metallica fan it is well worth buying. It is the best album since the black with the exception of Garage Inc. Disk 2.The biggest problems with the album are the lack of Hammett guitar solos and the fact that it almost sounds like you are listening to one song.Lars' Drumming is hard and fast, James' Vocals are O.K. (better than Load and Relaod), and new bassist Rob is a great replacement for Jason.The Bonus DVD is cool and is agreat bonus, making this CD a good buy for any Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Metallica I grew up with...but oh, well....","review":"Yes, I've been a fan since highschool during the 80's and Metallica has evolved over the years. I've liked songs from all their releases so far but I'm hard-pressed to say I like a whole song on this one. Just when I start to like a riff or part of a song they do something so annoying that I have to go to the next song. If I had to pick a favorite song it would be \\"shoot me again\\"....but it doesn't sound like a \\"Metallica\\" song. Now that James is sober, singing is really different...esp the clean parts...not so good. The snare sound is really bad. Kirk sounds like he didn't show up to record this album... I appreciate that they are trying to move in new directions but this is not really the direction I would have hoped for...I'm sure that newer fans will like this but old school fans will be disappointed for sure. It's not the Metallica I grew up with but oh, well ...they can do what they want...It's Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Metallica is not Good Metallica","review":"This album is a disappoinment to anyone who who has ever been a fan of Metallica. Shoddy production values and not one ounce of creativity leave the band exposed as a tired bunch of has-beens. The lyrics are worse than even those on \\"Reload\\" and Kirk's guitar playing is a hard to spot as Jason's bass was on \\"Justice.\\" If this disc had been recorded by any other band, it would be the last thing anyone ever heard from them.If you decide to inflict this album on yourself, listen to the DVD version first. The production, although weak, is still a hundred times better than the actual CD. And if you really want to listen to a good metal album, save your money for Superjoint Ritual. I guarantee you'll get a pure dose of authentic American metal, not the watered-down Nu-metal of a band that is no longer relevant in the scene in helped to create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...","review":"Totally disappointed...Not a bad metal album, but not a good metallica one...I do not agree with the other...The sound is to far from metallica's sound (remind me a bit RATM's sound...But fits more to RATM than to Metallica)...No real melodic songs, no real powerfull one too, no change of rythme (they all seems written with the same bit and same rythme)...Where are the songs like \\"The things that should not be\\", \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"One\\"???...No really not a good metallica album"},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly bad!!!","review":"I have followed these guys for alot of years.

First of all, Hardcore Metallica fans who loved ...And Justice for All, Master of Puppets and the Black Album: Take my advice and don't by this \\"new\\" Metallica.

There is not a single song that i can honestly not remember after listening to this cd like i could w/ Master of Puppets. (who doesn't know that song? :P) Some of Ulrich's drumming is pretty cool and Hetfield busts out some good rifts but everything else is pretty bad. If u want the best Metallica, get anything made from Load to the start (Kill Em All i think). However, if you've never heard of Metallica and like some heavy rock, you might like this.

Guitars are really heavy and loud, drums are fast and loud with lots of double bass thrown in, and the bass work is excellent considering Bob Rock did it. If you like metal get this album its the heaviest thing Metallica have done since ...And Justice For All. Only 2 minor complaints, no solos and lyrics are, at times, repeated to often. On the solos thing though, only a few songs could use them,not all. To bad you can't give 4.5 stars. In a word \\"crushing\\".

I popped ride the lightning into my cd player just to remember what they used to sound like. This isnt a return to anything, just another.... attempt by the band to evolve into something more mainstream. This cd has no solid intro's, no good guitar solo's, and no good lyrics. Some people are saying the drums are really good on this album, but all it sounds like to me is a five year old banging on a pot with a spoon. Even the best song on the cd, St. Anger, is worse than anything they've ever produced before. Hetfield's voice is just horrible. I can't stand what they've turned into; a bunch of money grubbin' has beens. I own every cd they've ever made but I refuse to buy this one.

I am guessing that this is what happened to many critics (like Kerrang magazine and Rolling Stone) when they gave such glowing reviews to this piece of garbage. However, after listening to this CD more than once, I concluded that it was horrible. No guitar solos. The songs are so repetitive that I find myself bored with them about 30 seconds into the song. The drums sound horrible. The lyrics and vocals are simple and at times very annoying (after hearing James yell \\"shoot me again I aint dead yet\\" 50 times in a row I wanted to throw this CD out the window).I appologize to anyone to whom I recommended this CD.

I decided, just in case, to listen to a few tracks before I would buy this album. Boy, was that a good choice! I saw the video for St. Anger, and that was also the first time I heard the song. I absolutely could not believe what I saw and heard! Horrible drum sounds that don't even classify as music, guitar riffs that made you scream, and terrible vocal harmonies, if that's what that is. If an album does not strike me as good at first, I give it some time, and eventually, I grow into it.

Then you have Lars, what were you thinking? The drums were not only too loud, but just sounded off. It seemed as if during the fast areas of certain songs Lars would get lost and just bang around til the next section. I am glad that James is off alcohol and out of rehab. The band is still \\"together\\", but I wish I could go back to ragging on the guys for the Load/Reload ordeal.

Please don't waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"this is the most underproduced piece of [stuff] i have heard from a band with the resources and talent that metallica has. if they were going for a raw garage style they seriously exceeded their goal. the riffs are unclear, the vocals are scratchy, the base is nonexistent, and the drums sound like tin trashcans (listen for the snare). this thing was horribly mixed and i am in awe that metallica actually could be proud of this effort. the saving grace in this album is the promise that is shown in the songs however they sound like unfinished demo riffs that are cut and pasted together at the last minute. the disappointing thing is that i could hear the beginnings of an album that could be something good. but i have to say that metallica really blew this one. those people who were upset at the load albums (i wasnt one of them) now have something to be really irretated with. don't buy it. just don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not MOP, but no Load either","review":"First off, this is not RTL2 or MOP2, and it is not Load 3. This has elements of both. Grooves in places like Load, but a lot more aggression, like RTL. No solos, but I really don't miss them too much in these songs. There is a lot of tight riffs and rapid drumming. The drum sound is garage band sounding (on purpose) which some hate, but I have gotten used to it. Lyrics are good, spewing agression w/o sounding like mindless hysterical ranting. If you like Metallica, give it a try. If your still mad about Napster, suggest you pass because you will find enough fault with it. Not as good as MOP, but the best Metallica in 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh yeah","review":"throughout Metallica's history they've released alot of music which they happily describe as being not produced, i've always found that to be where the real excitement lies. this new album smokes to say the least, but it's heart lies on the live dvd that was filmed in their rehersal space that comes along with the cd. good lord, those guys emit rock from every pore (what's new). it's always been a real treat to see Metallica play in a live setting, seeing them play in their own living room is just too much. you should get this album, you should get it soon and you should turn it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it","review":"This albun really suks, I can't believe how bad these guys are geting, remember ride the lightning?"},{"rating":"1","title":"R.I.P Metallica","review":"Thank god I downloaded this CD first. YES Lars, I downloaded it! This is the most pathetic CD I have ever had the misfortune to listen too. Somebody please get Bob Rock out of the music business. Ol' Bobby has managed to ruin some of the best metal bands around and on this one, he sets a new low that will probably never be matched again.Can I please give this a zero-stars rating?.. or maybe a -1 stars?As everyone has already stated, the production is horrendously shameful. The vocals are pathetic, the drum sound is what I have termed \\"Toys-R-Us\\" drums. Kirk has spent too much time playing his ESP's and needs to lock himself in a room for 2 months straight with just the first 4 Metallica CD's and his Jackson Randy Rhoads guitar.They should have just retired. My local radio station won't even play any of this junk on the radio..... it's that bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"What is going on with Metallica? I'd give it negative stars if I could. This CD is straight garbage, I borrowed it from a friend and knew from the moment I heard the first lame ass songs on this CD that I wasn't going to buy it. I'm a fan of Metallica too, but they changed too much and for the worst. Like one of the other reveiwers said buy \\"and Justice\\" instead if you don't have it already. The guitars aren't cool the drums are boring same crap over and over again. The lyrics are dumb and lame. What Metallica needs to do is go back to their orginal sound like from \\"ride the lightning\\" up to \\"and Justice\\" becuase this new stuff just isn't cool.

I am a huge metallica fan and it seriously disapoints me to hear how they could have succumbed to this. There are zero guitar solos, No melodies, Very little harmony and the final mixing is awful. The least they could do is make the instruments sound good.

Not only is this by far the worst Metallica album. Its quite frankly the worst album ive ever heard. Not even Shakespeare could write a more tragic story than that of Metallica's.

My wife bought me this new Metallica album as a gift because I still listen to their older stuff. But I have to tell you, St. Anger was a very unpleasant surprise.I don't dislike this album because I have a rigid vision of Metallica \\"should be.\\" In fact, their music has evolved considerably over the years. I don't like this album because the songwriting is terrible, the vocals are awful (is James trying to sing?), and even Kirk's semi-shoddy guitar solos are missing.It would be a shame if future albums sounded anything like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindergarten Snare Drum or What?","review":"Apparently on recording day Lars forgot his drum set and broke in to a local kindergarten to steal their wooden stool and tinny snare drum to use instead?Maybe someday I'll actually listen to the whole album and give it a better chance. For now, however, I can't get past the first track without laughing.Sorry guys, but compared to The Black Album and others this is like giving away a Harley to ride a tricycle.Honestly, I can't believe Metallica actually allowed this album to be released. You'd think Lars would have killed people in order to have stopped it. Ah well, try again boys, we'll forgive you.Seriously, though, Lars take the snare drum back to the kindergartners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Step Backwards","review":"Despite giving this album/CD another try after shelving it for a few years, I still agree with my original assessment that it is just not that good. I first listened to this CD on a long drive through Northern California. As I listened to it, with all the excitement that a new metallica offereing brings, I could not get over how uninspiring the music was. I still think that all of the songs sound the same, which unfortunately is not good, because they are each rather mundane. I guess this CD and its creation were musical therapy for Metallica, as depicted during Some Kind of Monster. It's too bad for us fans that we got brought along on the journey.Two stars for Metallica's worse album."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Craptacular","review":"Im wondering if im listening to the same CD that the fanboi's are listening to. Saying that, i guess im considered a fanboi, been listening to the group since '82.Im open to basically all types of music, but it has to be GOOD. This CD is filled with pure nonsense. The cords dont match, the beats are off, the lyrics are dull. What the hell happened during the timeoff? Im almost positive that what you hear on the CD is played for teh very first time. I cant belive Kirk, who has classic guitar training from the Juliard, has abandoned all his former knowledge and is cranking out the same worn out riffs.NOTHING IS GOOD ABOUT THIS ALBUM, except the 2 coasters it came with.1.

Buy this album and you will hear lyrical gems like \\"tick tock tick tock tick tock\\" and \\"It's my world, and you can't have it....sucker!\\". Then there's the song \\"Invisible Kid\\", an angry song about someone who doesn't fit in...The songs are long and directionless, the lyrics are boyish, and the recording sound is novice.

Absolutely terrible, words can't describe how bad this ... really is. Bad composition, bad production, bad singing, etc. Lars' drums sound obnoxious. Hetfield's singing is terrible. Hammett is a phenomenal guitarist but his part on this album is blase, what a waste of a great guitarist. He should follow Newsted's lead and jump ship. Totally uninspiring and lacking any of the awesome sound that was Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaaah!","review":"Okay, given some time to reflect on this CD has found me trying to avoid listening to it at all costs.

Stay away from this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I love Metalica, but I don't know what happened with this one. It is so disjointed and just thrown together. No real thought behind the lyrics, no layering of the sound, no awesome guitar licks...

If this is where they've come than I think they are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Crap","review":"After being a dedicated Metallica fan for many years I am finally done with Metallica. Load and Reload were disappointing but not bad CD's. Metallica with St. Anger has decided to record their incoherent jam sessions and put them on a CD. No more solos by Kirk, no more depth and perfection, the days of Master of Puppets are over. We are left with a washed up band who left a legacy in music. Now they should cut their loses and retire and at least spare us the pain of another St. Anger. Dream Theater now sounds more like metallica with Train of Thought than metallica does. Good bye Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"hello","review":"i'm lars, I bang on pots and pans, and by this i call a beat.James hetfield is getting too old, Metallica.. is just plain getting too old.

This stripped down Metallica sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Rock, please retire !","review":"I was really looking forward to this one, after I have read all Pre-Release Reviews and I couldn't wait any longer for the Release. I really thought and hoped that Metallica will return to making good music, but after inserting the disc in the player and listening to track number 1 I got dissapointed by them again. Who in Gods name does allow Mr. Bob Rock to produce records? He did an awful job, the sound of this Album is HORRIBLE, especially the drum sound is really bad. I wished Metallica would release a new Classic Album, but they only proved once again that they're gone. The only Highlight is Rob on the Bass. I saw their Concert from Rock am Ring, and he is a real great Bass player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is dead! Long live Metallica!!","review":"It's \\"Metallica\\" written on the CD but where is Kirk? Cant hear his guitar! Where is James? Mumbling from the background!

Hope to see you on tour ... playing the old stuff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Metallica I remember?","review":"I grew up listening to Metallica and this just isn't the Metallica I remember. This sounds like a totally different band. I really think they have been out of it for so long, they forgot how to play! If you're looking for a good old fashion metal CD, buy the new Black Label Society with Zak Wylde. Now there's a really [great] CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a Metallica Cover Band","review":"This is the worst Metallica album ever! It sounds to me like a bad cover band. The single release of the title track and Sweet Amber are probably the only songs that remotely sound like what I expected when I bought this. Save your money...this is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me again - please!","review":"I was unnerved by the touring info, and it made me fear for this album. When I saw the coverart, I wasn't reassured, but I decided to listen with an open mind. Now that I've heard it for myself, I have to say this is possibly the WORST listening experience I've had in my life, and I couldn't even force myself more than halfway through some of the songs. Even if you like the newer Metallica, which I admittedly don't, this album is a travesty, and an insult to any fans who were indeed expecting a \\"return\\" to roots. Mindless repetitive music and talking lyrics and choruses (come on guys, memories so bad you can't remember more than a few lines repeated ad nauseum?), no edge, no solos, and all the appeal of a buzzing chainsaw. Way beyond a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"st. too much anger","review":"St. Anger is probably Metallica's better album since \\"justice\\" but not good enough. Production is not good, songs sound long and really streched, James has some serious singing issues to work out, why didn't Kirk play a solo? As far as Metallica standards go, this cannot stand up to it. As a fan since '88 I am dissapointed. It is heavy, aggressive, angry all of the above, but it just doesn't shine. Buy \\"We've Come For You All\\" by Anthrax or \\"Viva Emptiness\\" by Katatonia."},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 worst album of the year.","review":"This has got to be the worst set of songs on a single CD.

But I also know they have said that about every album since Master of Puppets. So I was a little skeptical as well.Is it heavy? Sure maybe in some parts. But when it is heavy it sounds awful. The guitars are so distorted you can't make out what they are trying to do. Lars' (never one of the best drummers anyway) drums are tinny sounding and he seems to play worse than ever. The vocals are what bother me the most, James is \\"trying\\" too hard to sing. His voice is shakey and almost seems to give out at times.If you make it past all of that, is it still good music? Honestly I feel the music is some of the worst they have ever put together. I guess my wife said it best when she said \\" Umm I thought you hated Linkin Park. Why are you listening to them.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD BUT TRUE","review":"This album is just AWFUL. The production is just bad(even for a Bob Rock album). The drums sound like trash cans. There are NO guitar solos. The songs are long but their are no memerable riffs. It's like a wall of mush. And James has to revert to swearing because his lyrics are stupid and make no sense.Metallica are just trying to copy many nu metal bands like Korn, Limp wristed & Fear Factory. For a band that claims to do whatever they want. They sure have copying down to an art.Do yourself a favor and save your money for the new Maiden album coming out in September. You know they won't let us down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising -and very welcome- return","review":"Metallica has gained and lost fans in recent years because of their 'new ways' to deal with music. St. Anger is something very different... it is not a return to the Metallica of old, but it has nothing to do with the recent productions like Load and Re-Load: it is raw heavy metal, thought and played to make you bang your head. Pretty good, musically speaking. There is, however, the inevitable downside: very very few of the songs have good or at least interesting lyrics: too repetitive, to shallow and sometimes too disconnected. A sad downside, since most of us expect intelligent lyrics with strong music attached. The companion DVD is a smart move and a great addition to the CD. My final recommendation is: get it, it is a very nice CD and hopefully the start of a tendency for the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on!","review":"This is a product of pure shameless greed. Metallica were once gods of mainstream heavy metal then they slowly spiraled downward. When they quit drinking and decided to make nu-metal they ruined it all. I'm not saying they should get back on the wagon but now that thier drug and alcahol free you would think they would have more than enough money. This is what happens when musicians get greedy. Perhaps it would be better to stick to underground music."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst metallica album ever!!!","review":"i like every album metallica made from kill em all through and in cluding death magnetic except for one,..and that is s.t. anger!!as many other metallica fans here have stated this is easily metallica,s weakest album..from the awful drum sound to the half cooked state of most of the songs..except maybe some kind of monster, which would have benefitted from rick rubin,s production sound techniques used on the greatly improved follow up to this album,death magnetic.another thing lacking on this album is the absence of kirk hammet,s trademark guitar solos.as a metallica fan i,m glad they returned somewhat to form with death magnetic!! i would avoid saint anger unless you are a diehard collector that just must have every album this still great band has ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete & utter garbage!!!","review":"This band has hit a new low...Terrible mixing, production, writing, singing, drum sound (almost like Lars is playing on pots & pans)..etc, etc!I did'nt think they could get much worse than Load & Reload...but they have in a big way.....Yes...\\"It's sad but true\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Trainwreck In Metal History","review":"How could an album like this actually be released? I feel like they are just cashing in on the hype of the long-awaited new Metallica album, and hoping the early sales carry them into profitability. There's certainly going to be no word-of-mouth sales.The guitars are extremely muddy, the lyrics are terrible, the drums sound like a kid beating on pots and pans, there's no solos, vocals are weak, the songs are about 1 minute of material stretched to 8 minutes.

Did Avril Lavigne ever play those \\"solos\\" that old Metallica played? No. So old Metallica therefore sucks. Limp Bizkit was the creator of thrahs metal, not old Metallica. THIS is thrash metal. Old Metallica is just a bunch of garbage for pozerz. The boys of Metallica finally decided to get a whole lot deeper and lose the wanabee goth lyrics, and wrote lyrics that even MTV (MTV is God) thought were amazing. Now, other thrash metal bands like Limp Bizkit and Mudvayne are supporting thier music.As for the album, it's great. I think my favorites are Some Kind of Monster and Invisible Kid are my favorites, as they all belt out incredible solos that prove that Jimi Hendrix and Erci Clapton sucked.

I tried to adjust the treble because the symbols sounded funny, and I never could get it to sound right. I wasn't my speakers. The music on this disk is probably a B-, but the sound makes it a D-.

There really is no need for two guitarists in this band any longer. Very few fills,no solos. Kirk is a great guitarist but with no way to express himself. Some of the songs are well written but sound empty except for that tin can banging constantly in the back ground. I can't even imagine what Cliff Burton (original bass player) would think. I know he wouldn't want any part of this. This album sounds as if it was totaly written by one person, probably James. Please Kirk go solo. Espress your talent. Maybe team up with Jason. You really need to go back to playing the guitar like you use to. Whats wrong? What would those who you were influenced by think of this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"About what I'd expected","review":"Metallica continue with their downward spiral on this release.

The snare is cranked up way to high. The guitar solos are virtually non-existant.I can't say much about Robert Trujillo on this recording as Bob Rock played the bass for the recording of the album. Get out while you can Rob!! You're to good for this band!!Production is terrible on this album with the music relegated to the background so that the shrieking of James can be heard and reviled by all.This is a putrid album and not worthy of the metallica moniker and certainly deserves no place in any Metalliheads collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a steaming pile of...","review":"I've been a fan of Metallica since before \\"Kill 'em All\\" - I went to high school with Brian Slagel, the founder of Metal Blade Records who first broke Metallica.

Given, it is heavy. And fast. And raw. But where are the insightful lyrics? The soaring melodies? The awesome guitar solos? They are, for the most part, missing.It is over for the Bay area thrashers.

Don't get me wrong, I am glad that Metallica is trying new things, but they do not interest my taste in music. One of the most disappointing aspects is from a lyrical standpoint. I dislike very much the repitition of the same lyrics, even when they are not the chorus. When the guitars are played fast, they are played well, but sound too low and distant. The double bass drums are the best part of this album. It is some of the fastest I have heard yet. The rest of the smaller drumset now is annoying. It sounds like Lars is hitting an empty barrel. If it had a different sound, it would be a whole lot better. This album could have been great if a couple of sounds had been altered and the lyrics were better. From now on, I am borrowing the new Metallica CD before I spend my money on one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"How could a once-great band like Metallica put out such a lackluster release? Here is why this is *NOT* worth your money:1. Guitars: As many have noted, there are NO leads or solos on this album. NONE. The riffs are identical to anything you would hear on the radio: downtuned and overly simplistic. This is certainly not the Metallica I know.2. Drums: What is Lars playing, a garbage can? I mean, seriously, these guys are multi-millionaires, can't they afford real drums?3. Production: My band's four track tapes sound better than this. I listen to black metal, and I still find this unbearable! It's not raw or powerful, it sounds like they took an old tape recorder and went to a garage to produce this.4. Lyrics: Why, God, why?5. Vocals: James has lost all aggression in his voice. He is past his prime.I could go on and on, but really, is there any need? PLEASE, there are so many other more worthy cd's you could buy.

Listen to metallica's early stuff like \\"Seek and Destroy\\" \\"creeping death\\" \\"for whom the bell tolls\\" etc. - you can't get these songs out of your head. Even the so-called \\"sellout\\" songs had a something that made them memorable and enjoyable to listen to. there is NOTHING on the new album with a \\"hook\\" that makes the songs memorable.

I suggest anything to this even yanni"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD for sale","review":"I do not like this album. The raw, garbage can sound of the snare drums dominates almost every song drowning out everything else. They went for a garage sound and it does not work. James off key growling into the mike also gets old. It's great they changed there style but I just can't get into this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Metallica!?","review":"I was excited about St. Anger until I actually heard it. What a joke. Metallica has sunk to a new low. If you thought Load and Reload were huge steps backwards from Justice, Puppets, and Lightning, just wait until you hear this [garbage]. The songs are pathetic and they don't even play any solos! There is not even one good song on the entire cd. Thanks a lot Metallica. Go back to fighting Napster. It would be less embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica rocks","review":"I am a big time Metallica fan, I love just about all their songs and I must say that this is a pretty new experience for me, don't get me wrong this album rocks from start to finish but it is just very different, although it is nice to see the boys going back to the old days with long and heavy songs. Lots of angry lyrics from James, Lars is pounding the drum like no tomorrow, Kirk is not very noticiable in this album but still good, and Rob is actually pretty good, if you like the 90s Metallica you may not find this interesting to you but if 80s Metallica is your flavor you will enjoy this, as for the hardcores like myself, just get it, is a Metallica album. the boys rocks on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard, Grinding, Heavy Metal - -Yes...Finally!!","review":"Finally something too hard to play on KPOP (or WPOP for you easterners). This album finds a way to creatively grind and knarl through 75 angry minutes. Nice to know Lars isn't just playing back-up once again. Other than the occassional overlay of voices, it seems like Metallica has gone back and made this album simple, clean, technically outstanding (which they've always been), and raw. Delightful and refreshing to see a band that has been so damn successful for so many years willing to kick half of their current fans out on their backside in exchange for pushing their own musical boundaries. One Bay Area local to the band--ROCK ON MOFOs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this.","review":"What the hell is this this isnt metallica any more. They dont even have the same guitar distortion or the same snare drum. I think this is crap this is the worst cd i ever bought. After this cd i think metallica ruined them self they should just give it up and pack their stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Stupid","review":"With this Metallica realease we find the band taking a step in a very awkward direction towards what sounds like new metal. Strangely the fast drumming Im used to from Lars is now messy and unrefined, Jaymz voice is dreadful and Kirk's solos are nonexistant. No one wants to hear me complain so I'll sum it up in one analogy. 2003 shows a regression from the 80s band, regardless the band will sell millions of copies. Meanwhile the new Anthrax shows just how great the band has become since the 80s, regardless the band will sell hundreds of copies. Somehow I missed the logic train."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast drums and lackluster vocals","review":"st. anger left much to be desired. lars is way to fast throughout the album (punk thrash) and james's vocals made no sense. if lars slowed down a bit ala 4/4 and james spent more than a day writing..... it could have...... this reaks of mid-life crises. and where was kurt?. overall a muddy mix. however, the downloads at metallicavault.com more than made up for the price i paid for this monstrosity of marketing. you missed guys"},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Awful","review":"Yeah, Lars can play blast-beats again! Neat! I hated Load and Reload, but at least they were good for what they were. This is among the worst metal albums I have ever heard! The production is terrible! The writing is terrible! JAMES DOES NOT HAVE THE VOICE FOR METAL ANYMORE!!! Can't you get it through your heads!? You all should have known that when you heard Mama Said! And the most obvious let down of this album - No guitar solos!? Why do you still have two guitar players? That's all Kirk was good for!I lost a small amount of respect for Metallica when Load was released (it was good; it was not Metallica); I lost a huge amount of respect for them when Lars decided he'd sue his own fans for downloading Metallica songs (I got news for ya, pal - they still do); and now all respect is gone. They are officially sell-outs. It pains me to say this, but - even the Deftones are better than Metallica.A few blast-beats and a big red fist- Gee, that's swell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Metallica Is No-Good","review":"One the positive side, there are some good guitar riffs here and there. On the negative, the drums are very thin and harsh, the vocals sound very strained, the guitars rarely leave the low frets, and there's not really a standout song on the entire album.With Load/Re-Load, we knew Metallica was experimenting with softer rock music. It wasn't nearly as heavy, but it was still essentially Metallica. Now Metallica seems to be chasing trends to the point of completely losing their identity. The tuned-down baritone guitars, endless riff-recycling, whiney lyrics, and no solos make for a very mundane listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Metallica?","review":"I used to love your music, now you come up with a CD that sounds like it was recorded in somebody's garage, album cover art that looks like classroom daydreaming cartoons drawn by a 12 year old, and just plain boring songs.

I'm gonna send you a get well card once you are over this sickness and start releasing metal albums again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this was a new band, I still wouldn't like it","review":"There's a lot I could say about this release, but I think I'll just keep it simple. The band should change their name; this is not Metallica. This is Metallica with an identity crisis.I don't expect nor do I want the band to revert to the Kill 'em All/Lightning/Puppets/Justice era material, but this new batch of songs is simply not acceptable. However, it does beat the hell out of Reload (but then again, what doesn't?). I find it hard to believe that I'm only the 4th individual to review this release, and that the other 3 reviews are all positive. Where are the other (MISSING)reviews? In any case, Metallica's latest failure is not worth the effort of putting into words how abysmal it is. If you have yet to give up on Metallica, now's the time to do so. They gave up on you long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The...","review":"ok. they WERE one of the best metal bands ever. They WERE once able to make great music. Then they just kinda..fell off.

Metallica is back and they mean business. Lars Ulrich has brought in the big guns with double bass in about every song, and you can literally hear Jaymz and Kirk pour their hearts out in their monster riffs that flys like fire through their finger tips. Oh and minus one bass player? Bob Rock stepped up and took care of the bass beautifully. This album shows Metallica going back to their roots, back to the \\"Kill em all\\" and \\"Justice\\" days when they were heavier than ever. You can't go wrong with the songs such as St. Anger, Frantic, and Invisible Kid. They are all SO AWESOME!!

There was no heart, passion, or meaning behind the lyrics but garbage put out on a record to make money. Sad but true I think it over for Metallica.

What St. Anger is I'll never know? But if this is the best that James, Kirk, and Lars have to dish out then they should just retire and go into hiding. I am so profoundly disappointed with this piece of [garbage] that it makes Load and Reload sound like true works of art, which were nothing more then total sell out efforts to turn a buck.

If you put a set of trashcans on a stage, tied a cat to a rope hanging from a ceiling fan set to high, you might come near the sounds emanating from this Bob Rock standard production.

Fame happened. Some of the riffs in this are real good but then..wham another riff that does not go well with the previous.

By the third time around, however, I was hooked. The first two tracks, Frantic and St. Anger reach out and smack you upside the head, and Dirty Windows is the best track on the album. This does not have the radio friendly tracks of the Black Album, it is more of a throwback to earlier albums, longer songs, and more complicated riffs. If you have been a long time Metallica fan, you will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dispicable compliation of [garbage]","review":"This is by far the worst album that has ever been produced. It is a shame that I can not give it less than one star. Garage bands display more musical prowess and better lyrics have appeared on Sesame Street. No guitar solos, as I am sure you know. Whiney, self-pittying lyrics like the rest of the garbage on the radio (\\"Invisible Kid\\" stands out here). You have been warned! Lars is currently disgruntled that our government uses Metallica's as well as other metal bands music to intimidate terrorists between interogations. Someone call the ACLU! It would be more humane to subject them to anthrax (not the band). It is a shame to say that Metallica is officially dead. I guess we'll have to look to the dim-witted likes of Staind and Godsmack as the new hard rock harbingers. This album, however, makes a terrific coffee coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah..borrrrrrring...soo borrrrrrring","review":"sorry, but this album is flat out boring. its just poorly put together and there's no cool seg-ways (a metallica trademark)...I've listened to them forever and cannot keep rockin with them..mainly because this album just doesn't..they use to define what was cool, now they're only trying to play what they think everyone thinks is cool..If you like repetitive heavy guitars riff backed by some really borrrring 2 beat drumming...go ahead...and the vocals? is james going thru puberty again? he sounds like the generic teenage kid from the simpons..past on this album..go get the new deftones..its good..much better.cya"},{"rating":"1","title":"No idea where they're going or what they want to do","review":"I've been a fan since the '80s, and this album is a ship without a sail. Hetfield and crew obviously have no idea what they want to be anymore- the heavy, pounding band of the '80s-early '90s or the band every high school cheerleader loved in the late '90s. The music says the former, the lyrics and overall attitude indicate the latter.This thing is heavy and angry, but it's that way just for the sake of being heavy and angry. This is nothing like what they've done before, and, although their last few albums made good coasters but not much more, that isn't necessarily a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Stuff","review":"This is a riff-heavy album that is a return to form for Metallica. The first 3 tracks are among the best on the album. Some knocks that keep me from giving it 5 stars: Lars sounds like he's beating on the side of a gutter. No guitar solos. Although there's about as much cool riffing here as on Master Of Puppets. A very solid album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!!!!","review":"When I say unbelievable, I mean it in a negative sense. I am absolutely shocked at just how bad this album is. This is truly the end of the very band that got me into Metal. I dealt with the changes on the last two albums, but this is far too much. This album screams of Nu-Metal and kills the integrity of the band. Track after track I hoped for something to stand out, it never happened. Kirk is non-existant on this album, the vocals suck, and the riffs are boring and repetitive. Lars is the only one who stepped it up on this album, flying on the double bass here and there. I give this album 0 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it ?

Well, Metallica has always been there as well but since the Black Album they haven't come out with anything above the average (or above the \\"real\\" Metallica average).St Anger was expected to be a great album for 2 reasons: the return to the old days (something Megadeth accomplished with The World Needs a Hero) and the input from a new member - the super Rob Trujillo (from the great ST and Infectuous Grooves). Well, Trujillo sounds awful and so does the album. No further comments. By the way, Mustaine made the right decision to \\"bury\\" Megadeth before its total decline... James and Lars should do the same..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! The Great Metallica has gone!","review":"Well I hear this cd and I get dissapointed, its not the metallica I like, no more One or Enter Sandman, no more sick Kirk solos, the drumming of Lars is not good as in old times, I recommend you to just download St Anger and Some Kind of Monster because they are the only 2 songs that are acceptable. Dont buy it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Ok so this isn't metallica best album but it is much better than load and reaload. I don't think people should bash on this album just beacause it isn't as good as ride the lightning or master of puppets, it is really hard to make something better those albums cause those albums were excellent.

In '84their music was the impetus for me to learn English. Try it with$t. Anger - Jamz, what's your mother tongue? I tend to make aparallel between Metallica and Exodus - both know that only deathdecides.

That's true.

I won't even go into the garbage can sounding snares or lack of solos.. What truly concerns me as longtime Metallica fan (since '88) is their departure from what made them great.. I accepted Load after a while, but St.Anger makes Load sound like Master of Puppets.. The lyrics are immature, the vocals are horrid (James is tryimg to sing?? why??), and just the lack of emotion.. I know we can't live in the past and this is the new Metallica and I have accepted that, but what I can't accept is corporate america and 15 year old fans praising this album when we all know Metallica is in the twilight of their career, and the desire they once had is dead and gone..

I would not even waste the time downloading the Mp3's. James must have really burnt his brains out from drinking. And Bob Rock on the bass Ha ha ha ha ha. James Hetfield should have never tried to sing. His old vocal style of harshness and not all drawn out was what made him sound good.

They completely changed their sound so that none of the songs sound anything like their old stuff. Their distortion sounds the same as slipknot or korn and the song st.anger sounds like a blatant rip off of linkin park. Gone are the guitar solos, singing and melody. Every song is played entirely by chords with repetitive punk drumming as james hetfield screams cheesy lyrics. Its sad to say, but this album is actually worse then re load(atleast reload had melody and guitar solos).Contray to the hype st anger sounds absolutely nothing like kill em all, its more like nu metal noise that all the high school kids will love.

What a disappointment. After such albums as Load and ReLoad, when I read that Metallica was returning to how their old sound was I was inspired to get this CD. Well it turns out they did get a new sound, and it is horrible. They are just another band now to catch on to the new metal trend.

I'm quite happy Jason finally got smart and got out of Metallica after getting abused for 14 years.I usually like to reserve extreme judgement for bands in Metallica's position who go out on a limb to try something different, but unfortunately I could find no redeeming value in this pile of trash whatsoever.

Never thought metallica would put out such a terrible release like st. anger as well as death mgnetic, was really excited when the band released death magnetic when i listened to it i was very dissapointed when i heard it, what another st. anger release. metallica was better known for their 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish they'd have allowed zero stars","review":"Can't resist. Actually I was thinking about this since I recently came across a \\"press review\\" of the album from before it came out. I had seen it before but of course put it out of mind. Just absurd to read it with years of hindsight to look at. The hype going into this one was so high: Best ever, return to roots, oh so heavy. Believe these one star reviews: this is pure crap. I read somewhere St. Anger was voted the worst metal album of all time. I can believe that if you compare what was promised to what was delivered. There's not one song on here worth repeating. Trust me, I try to every couple years and it's always the same: \\"Yep, still sucks.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Metallica CD ever.","review":"Let me get this straight: I loved all of Metallica's older CDs. I even loved Load and ReLoad a lot more than some of the 80's releases, but this CD is the worst I've ever heard from Metallica. It sounds like they're trying way too hard to impress some fanbase that is thirty to forty years old now. Either that or they're trying to grip onto the new generation with being incredibly angry. We must be angry because we made an album called St. Anger.You're trying way too hard, Metallica. Write music for yourselves, not for the fans. Please. It was better that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap...","review":"Please Metallica retire for gods sake...this album is an embarrasment...songs that drone on forever ...an occasional cool riff here and there...Can we finally say Lars is has got to be one of the worst drummers ever...to be honest I think he has gotten worse over the years...This band is just not that talented...James is an above average guitarist at best, Kirk is ok, and well Lars he just stinks...what made Metallica great back in the 80's is that they wrote cool songs. Well that isnt the case anymore. I think Jason Newsted was pretty smart now leaving Metallica. You know he has to be grinning after he heard St Anger. Go buy Killswitch engage, at the gates, Death, Decapitated, Opeth or just about any metal album out there other than St Anger. Or better yet get Megadeth's Rust in Piece, Countdown to Extinction or Youthanasia. These albums came out in the 90's and they are far superior to anything Metallica put out since the 90's (yes the Black album too)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The final nail in the coffin for Metallica","review":"St. Anger is easily the biggest disappointment of 2003. I laugh at the people who actually think this album is good, most of them are just in denial and can't deal with how bad it is. I know that Metallica tries to do their own thing and not care what anyone thinks of them. However, they should've cared what the fans thought and gave them what they wanted. Instead, they try to ressurrect their old sound in the wrong way and fail miserably. The production is awful, Lars sounds like he's clanging on metal. The vocals are done in one take, so Hetfield sounds like a sick crocodile. The worst transgression though, is that there are NO GUITAR SOLOS. Metallica just isn't Metallica without solos. Metallica had already started to die when they created Load. Now they are officialy dead and old news."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible trendy crap","review":"i've been a fan of metallica since mustaine was their guitarist. i've even put up with everything since justice. but this is just total dogsh@t! it is everything opposite what good metallica is. it is a pathetic attempt to cash in on the nu-metal trend. no solos?! hey let's be like korn! they sell a lot of albums! the only good thing about this band is that they have trujillo( suicidal represent!). but i'd even put on infectious grooves before i put on this piece of sh@t. maybe lars should have been in burton's place during that bus accident. at least metallica would still have some balls. now they're just myopic over-the-hill hacks whose self-image changes with whatever musical trend is popular. what's on the next album, metallica does the strokes? metallica vs. oakenfold? i have no respect for this band. metallica, YOU SUCK THE RAG!! did i mention that this album is dogsh@t?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be Metalgods","review":"Mettalica's first few albums gave birth to the heavy metal revolution.

They are the definition of a sellout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep on searching","review":"It's like their first song on the album says, \\"Keep on Searching,\\" because this is not MetallicA. They've tuned into Brittney Spears too much and wish to sound like her. I prefer to listen to another band that sounds like the old MetallicA, Grave Digger. They just had a new album released and it kicks St. Anger. Check it out if you love true MetallicA."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars for this waste of polycarbonate.","review":"If I could give this a \\"zero stars\\" rating I would. Metallica has put out an album that most garage bands would be ashamed of. The sound is absolute crap (is Lars playing a garbage can or a snare?), the lyrics are something a 5th grader could pen, and as for the \\"edgy, raw emotion\\" that many reviewers discuss, that's simply a euphemism for \\"didn't put any effort into the production or recording\\". James Hetfield has followed the pantheon of musicians who have dried out not just from alcohol, but creatively, after rehab. If you're thinking you're going to hear good music, skillful guitar work (not a single solo on this record) and insightful lyrics, then you will be sorely disappointed. I think they wanted to release an album that no one would WANT to download to get back at Napster fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"the great dissapointment","review":"what a let down, metallica's worst ever...EVER!1. poor, uncaring, unintelligent lyrics2.poor guitar3.no solos4.dull drums5.you don't have to be deaf not to hear the bass6.poorly written songs7.song sections don't connect wellmetallica have attempted to sell out, but are still no where as good as sell out bands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorded in their garage?","review":"First, I love Metalica.

After listening to St. Anger for the second time, i'm ready to officially make it a coaster for my beer. the whole album sounds like it was recorded in a tin garage. It sounds as if kirk and james lost the bass knob on their amps and replaced them with extra treble ones. the drums sound like lars was banging on some cheap pots from IKEA. I saw them live on the summer sanitarium tour and they did two songs off this album and they performed them better live, but i was still not won over. The speed of old metallica from kill em all through and justice for all is present in this album, but the driving songs that make you want to headbang just are not there. they are very choppy, thrown together songs and this album will go down as the godfather part 3 of the metallica era."},{"rating":"1","title":"St Arse","review":"Terrible. Vocals are the worst Metallica have ever done. There are 2 tracks that are just about passable ('Frantic' and 'Shoot Me Again'). They would have been ok if they'd been the worst songs on the album...but they're the best!!! 'St Anger' is pure crud. Every song starts the same. Some of the riffs are ok but they failed to marry any of the vocals and the guitar riffs. I'm seriously disapointed. Metallica are dead...give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, Inc.","review":"I've been listening to Metallica since the Puppets album came out in '86 and when the black album came out in '91 that was the last straw for me.

I came on here and listened to the samples and they sound like a bunch of 12 year olds in a garage band....sorry guys, it's time to turn those amps off."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cannot be real","review":"Imagine my dismay upon hearing for the first time this utter dross that is the new Metallica cd. I, like many am a long time fan, i hated Load when it appeared but after many spins it got to me eventually, as did Reload.This new garbage however will never cut it. Yes the drums suck and the guitars are awful and James never sounded this bad before, and no it is not a return to early roots, to say that is displaying total ignorance, this sounds like a bad cover band playing in a garage with a duff sound system.Early Metallica never sounded like that, to compare this thing to the cds that gave Bellz, Fade to Black, Seek, Horsemen and Creeping Death is nothing short of ridicolous.I only hope that this is a passing phase and the next cd shows the undoubted ability within the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Metallica of Yesteryear","review":"Metallica has just had a total miss with this one. The songs aren't structured like anything you can bang your head with, or sing along with. Lars has his snare drum tuned so loose that it will just aggravate you because you can hear it through the lyrics, and the lyrics don't make sense or tell a story like the old metallica stuff used to. St. Anger was the biggest disappointment I have had from a rock band in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are all right (the other reviewers, I mean)","review":"My First Metallica CD, agree with what they said, It SUCKS, The worst rock cd in my collection of 80 some odd. And the bonus DVD is really lame, I have yet to make it through 3 songs in a row withoutjust turning it off. It's that terrible. Why does the bass player look like a female gorilla? Kind of stomping around while he's playing. It is really scary that way.This is metal, that means that the few distinguishable lyrics should include some profanity or hateful phrases or something that kind of makes sense but \\"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle\\" just doesn't do much for me. \\"Some kind of monster\\" really doesn't help. Then there is the beat which is repetitive beyond belief. It's terrible. The Sickness (Disturbed) is far better and includes more imaginitive insturmental. Godsmack isn't even this repetitive and I like them. Boooooooooo"},{"rating":"1","title":"poopy cd that i will listen to cause im stupid LOL","review":"everything about this cd is crap, all the songs are crap, and it wont live up to the black album. so i think metallica should just call it quits before the die hard metallica fans loose interest in them. even though this cd is crap i listen to it cause i won it out of an arcade game LOL. so nothing wrong with a .50 cent cd that came out of an arcade game LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, simply awful","review":"I've been a Metallica fan since Ride the Lightning and the Monsters of Rock tour. That doesn't mean I'm living in the past, as I like a number of modern metal bands as well. But I've listened to this album several times and, well, it just plain sucks.It seems they wanted to re-invent themselves with a new, unique sound. The only problem is that unique doesn't always mean good, or in this case, even tolerable. Ignoring the monotonous empty oil can drums (which deserve a chapter of scorn all by themselves), after a few songs it simply becomes the kind of noise that makes you cringe, like the sound your brakes make when the pads are completely worn out.Maybe Newsted (and Burton before him) was more of an anchor for this band than anyone realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Metallica?!","review":"This was a really disappointing CD to listen to. In anticipation of this CD, I had been listening to their older stuff. Perhaps that's what did it for me. I honestly have no idea what Metallica was doing with this CD. No guitar solos? Bland lyrics? Horrible sound quality? Snare drums?! Metallica is trying to go for a hardcore rock thing, but instead they sound like a really bad garage rock band.All in all, St. Anger seems really predated for Metallica. For another rock band this CD would be mediocre at best, but this is Metallica we're talking about here. If you want Metallica, pass on this and get S&M; and their self-titled albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica - St Anger","review":"This album has it's moments but, overall it is not Metallicas best work. The lack of guitar solos from Kirk Hammet is disturbing to say the least. And the sound of the drums does not do Lars Urlrich's playing justice. Fans of Godsmack and Disturbed may enjoy this album but, The long time Metallica fans from the '80's will be un-impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Metallica release ever","review":"This is, without any doubt the worst CD that they have ever done. There is no meaning to it. James sounds terrible. Lars sounds like he is playing a tin can. There is no complexity, no solos, no point.

Iw as personally excited about the return of Metallica. But this CD was just a big letdown. They have a new bassist, and they are all older. It just doesnt seem the same. James hetfileds vocals just arent good anymore, and Lars is just repeatedly hitting the same drum, its kinda annoying. The only good song here is St.Anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how the mighty have fallen","review":"First off, I love Metallica. The true Metallica. I have every album on cd (yes, even the post Black album stuff)and have every album up to Justice on record. But this? WTF is this crap? I love metal, and hey, I'll admit it, even some nu-metal. But this? This isn't music. It sounds like a mix between my neighbors garage band (who actually play better) and a inpromptu Stomp session. You know, I started playing the drums after hearing Metallica for the first time. I used to dream of meeting these guys. Now, I can only hang my head and say goodbye. Metallica, the real Metallica, the guys that recorded Kill Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, ...And Justice for All, and yes even the Black album, have lost their way and become everything the fought aganst in the hayday of metal.

I'm soo sick and tired of all the people who give metallica soo much credit just because they use to be (but no longer are) great.

That is the nicest thing I can say about this album. The album is poorly produced by Bob (doesn't)Rock. It sounds like it was not edited and was spliced together in five minutes.Every song sounds pretty much the same, with lame lyrics that pale in comparison with the band's previous albums, most notably Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets. The worst offender is Shoot Me Again, in which lead singer James Hetfield repeatedly screams \\"Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet!\\" Intelligent.Lars Ulrich changed the sound of his drums, and it now sounds like he is banging on pots and pans. Kirk Hammett is non-existent on the album, as it lacks guitar solos on any of the 11 songs.To sum it up, St. Anger is a sorry album that feels rushed. It seems that Metallica is trying too hard to return to their early sound. They should accept their evolving sound and move on, because they failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"i agree with everyone else, this is the worst metallica cd","review":"I have tried to listen to this over and over again, I atleast tried to like it but I can't. I got a good deal ...dvd and st.anger t-shirt. Ok, the t-shirt was cool and worth [the money] but this cd is worthless. What the hell is Lars banging on, either he is banging on garbage cans or the worst drumset ever made. Hey BOB ROCK,YOU lost your producing abilities and keep working on that and stop playing the bass like you did on this cd,you [stink] and now you [stink] producing. Kirk and james did play some guitar well but that's all i can say. you must do this cd over again with a good set of drums from the BLACK ALBUM and some hard screaming from james's vox and get the new bass player to play bass from sucidal tend. not BOB ROCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disapointed","review":"The tin can snare drum is moderately annoying in some tracks and intensly annoying in others.

They've had a few member changes and well...they've gotten old. They're past the prime of their lives. I only listened to the single and it sounded like they cut back the guitar and let Lars have too much fun with the drums. Then there's that bit where it kinda' sounds like a bad attempt at rap. Can't explain that bit but you should know what I'm talking about.Metallica should have quit after Garage Ink.I think when 250-something people give it a 1 star (when over half of them would have given less if they could) should be a hint to GIVE IT UP."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Bad Abum By Metallca","review":"This is the only bad album of the Four Horsemen. I am a fan of all metallica albums from Kill'em All to Reload but this one is just like a bad joke. Before this album I used to think that whatever Metallica does would be good. This album caused me to leave Metallica fanclub. I really can't understand how such a good band can make such a bad album.

First of all, the production is terrible, but once one moves past that, there are a few compelling songs here and there. Unfortunately, the filler infesting this album is too abundant to warrant a purchase. Save your money and don't buy this subpar album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sad attempt at relevancy","review":"This is definitely NOT the return to their former glory. This is a desperate attempt to regain credibility and old fans that they had lost upon the release of \\"Load\\" (and became the band that they used to rail against). They sound like a formerly great metal band waaaay past its prime trying to sound like the current \\"Nu metal\\" bands. James voice no longer has the grunt it once had, in fact in spots it's downright embarrassing. Lars drums sound like metal chairs being banged. No solos (in all fairness, Kirk was pretty generic as far as metal guitar gods go). This album is yet another reminder of why the old fans abandoned them for bands (Pantera) that were playing the metal that these guys stopped and still won't. Unfortunately their days as a leading musical force are looong behind them... They should've packed it in when Cliff died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God We Still Have Megadeth!!!","review":"Hello fellow headbangers! I really believe Metallica made this CD to p*ss us people off. But I don't hate them for it, because up until 1990 they made the best thrash I've ever heard and will always remember them and cherish those CD's in my collection. But from that point on you gotta say at least Megadeth tries to stay to their roots and that's what makes them the Kings Of Thrash and I can only hope the Metallica boys will try to win it back before their too old to do it. Don't buy this, spend your $12 on \\"The System Has Failed\\", it did for Metallica. Bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I had heard from a lot of people that the album [was bad].

The only question I can fantom is what happened to Metallica? I over looked Load & Reload as mistakes or the band suffering a quarter life crisis. Then I wait with baited breath for the new album that was supposed to sound like the Justice era... gee how wrong was I, songs that overstay their welcome, hollow sounding, no solos, childish lyrics I can go on, fingers crossed Rick Ruben can help out but im not holding my breath!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Just adding a quick review to pull down the misleading three star rating.

Although lyrics like \\"you flush it out, you flush it out\\" and \\"tick-tick-tock\\" are the best Hetfield has written in his career they show that he is an amateur writer. Oh and the drum technician was sick the week when they recorded the drums so Lars had to set up the drums by himself. Btw Kirks guitar technician had the flu the day they were supposed to record Kirks solos so he could not tune Kirks guitar, and Kirk couldn't tune the guitar himself, so no solos on this one baby! as Jaymz would put it.

After all, its been almost six years since Metallica released a studio album. With that said, St. Anger is, in one word, HEAVY. James Hetfield's vocals approach those of olden days Metallica, except deeper, and heavier. The same with the guitars. The detuned riffing sounds postively Slayer-esque at some points, and evokes some of Metallica's earlier work. The only thing that keeps the album from five stars is the lack of shred master Hamett's mile a minute solos. With that said, if you were a little disappointed with Load and Re-load, give Saint Anger a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me cry :'(","review":"GOOD GOD...what happened???? The only good thing about it is that even though they sound too much like Nu Metal, they're still better than the other Metal Wannabees. The drums are weak and sound like Lars is banging on a garbage can, the guitars sound like you're listining to them through a drain pipe, and James sounds like he stubbed his toe when he's singing. I think when James was in Re-hab he forgot what Metal is soposed to sound like. I think that Metallica should come out with some sorta CD like a greatest hits one OR SOMETHING to make up for this and oh yea..MAKE IT GOOD! Although if you're still a Metallica fan...go ahead and buy it...it's good to listin to when you're pissed off, somehow the sound is like counting to ten and you're not that pissed anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must say, I am rather disappointed with this album. No solos, which is what (I believe) makes Metallica who they are, in part. Many of the songs like St anger and some kind of monster sound very mainstream, like they could be by another band like disturbed and it would not make a difference. Also, that new kind of snare drum with the ringing is a terrible addition. It gets annoying. The vocals on this album need work. Don't get me wrong, it is still an ok album, but I thought that after 5 years Metallica would come up with something much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't shine a turd","review":"After watching the members of Metallica whine their way through the self absorbed mess of \\"Some Kind of Monster\\", I went out and bought \\"St. Anger\\".

My advise to Metallica: quit whining, get rid of your therapist, get rid of Bob Rock, start drinking again and think about retiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"ST. POS","review":"yes that's right this is a POS, how can anyone compare this to their earlier works and say it is better?!?!? For those of you who think this is better than Metallica of 10yrs ago, you all must be fans of Korn, Limp Suck, etc etc...Lars couldn't play his way out of a paper bag (good drummers=Neil Pert/Mike Portnoy) we won't even consider James singing, if you can call a moose in rut singing.

This album was so uninspiring that basically it became a laughing stock in the metal community.

Even the song lyrics seem dumb and almost immature.

Saint Anger is the only Metallica album that I just can not get into. I like when bands change/experiment, but this album is uncomplicated and too stripped down. Frantic is a decent song. The other 10 trackshave potential, but lack the complexity and aggressiveness thatMetallica used to possess. I've listened to this CD 23 times, it doesn't do Metallica justice. Metallica should bow there heads in shame and call it an early retirement, or make something truely worthy of listening ears. No, I don't have a mullet, drive a Camaro, not stuck in the 1980's either.

Well, guess what? I've been a devout Metallica fan since 1986, when Master of Puppets was new... and I love St. Anger. If you can get over your stubborn little preconceptions and try being a little more open minded, maybe you'll appreciate it when a great band continues to be creative and experimental, instead of just stagnating and rehashing and rewriting their own material for 20 years. St. Anger is yet another new sound for Metallica, and it's a powerful one.

Being not a big fan of Load and Reload (but still there were some great songs on there too). Not to mention their covers album was great! Alright the riffs on St Anger are good(not enough variation), the Bass if only a little bit on there, what is there to be heard is good, but not enough (no wonder Jason left!)Go buy all their other albums and you can see what a great band has become and how they should finally call it a day. At least SLAYER never sold out - go buy Slayer's latest - \\"God Hates Us All\\" and you will find out how to keep the fans begging for more!Metallica you have become your own harvestor of sorrow - once again why have Kirk in your band if you have no solos!

Lars sounds like he's pounding on empty coffee cans. The drums have no depth. And all the people that say Robert T. sounds good should know that he didn't play bass on the cd.

Second, someone call Lars and have him check his drum kit, I think someone has replaced his snare with a trash can. As far as the bass goes it is weak, I guess that's what you get when a producer tries to fill in. I am sure Mr. Trujillo will add some bottom end to the songs live. If you must purchase this cd, get it while it's on sale. St. Anger sounds like all of the other generic \\"metal\\" out there. Now on to the things I like about the disc. The DVD is a nice touch, nice booklet, cool artwork by Pushead. In all, I can only hope this was released as a joke and the real disc will be out soon.

It seeps from every song on this disk. It permeates every word. You know what, this is a good thing. Metallica has finally been reborn into the juggernaut of pure metal mayhem that many of us fell in love with the first time we listened to Master of Puppets. Every cut on this sublime CD is a testament to the towering prowess of this band. Kirk Hammett has never been sharper, the crunchy riff heavy guitar work on St. Anger may be his best yet. James Hetfield has grown by leaps and bounds. His vocals are painful, expressive and emotive. Lars Ulrich...even though he is one of the most over-rated drummers in rock, gives his finest performance to date. The DVD included with this CD only makes the purchase more worthwhile, as it takes us inside the recording of the album. Highly recommended for fans of blistering rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want some furious Metal ? Don't call the \\"Saint\\" !!","review":"Dissapointing... where's Trujillo's killing bass ?

The sound on \\"St. Anger\\" isn't near as polished as previous efforts, as it falls into a nastier mix. From start to finish this is a pretty solid disc; just be sure to pop it in with an open mind if you don't want to be disappointed. Metallica have completely made sure that this was going to be an extremely heavy album; chugging riffs, double-bass driving, loud vocals, ALL of that is hear and presented well. The current single is the title track \\"St. Anger.\\" \\"Unnamed Feeling\\" will most probably be the next single; great song. Most fans will definitely enjoy this release.

The drumming is also very bad, it sounds like Lars Ulrich is banging on trash cans instead of a set of drums. Very, very bad. There are no guitar solos either, which is another vast disappointment.

They've lost the speed, they've lost the edge. Too much drums, average bassist, the death of the guitar solo, and the dry echo-less vocals contribute to making this forgettable.

Why?","review":"Having been a big Metallica fan for years, I was truely expecting that St. Anger would live up to all of its hype and be the true return-to-roots we've all dreamed of. Unfortuneatly, as with Load and Reload, Metallica has continued to experminent with their sounds and musical style. St. Anger is that experiment gone horribly wrong. The audio quality is terrible. Not even on par with an average video cassette, the CD is what I would call \\"Low-Fi\\". The singing style is more like that of Linkin Park and Korn. That's not a good thing. Gone are the \\"cool\\" solos from previous albums, as are any and all concepts of harmony. Probably the worst thing about the album is the sound of the drums. Lars sounds like he's banging on a trashcan lid. With all of the money he has, you would think he could have spent $[...] on a Remo dampener, or at least taped a sock to the drum head. Do yourselves a favor and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Metallica","review":"This album is not very good to say the least. There are no solos, Lars' drums sound more like tin garbage cans than anything else, and the songs generally have no substance.I think Metallica needs to go back to the old way of recording. Spend a full year in the studio working together on great material. With James having been in rehab and Jason having left the band recently, I can only assume they have been under serious pressure to release some sort of \\"album,\\" and I guess this is it.Despite all of this, I haven't lost all hope that Metallica will turn things around and somehow re-learn how to create an album of the caliber they used to, albums where EVERY SINGLE song was awesome. (i.e. pre-Load) Back in those days James and Lars WERE Metallica.Well, at least the album is heavy. Frantic is really about the only good song on the album, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a Doubt [garbage]","review":"I've always been a big Metallica fan since I was in junior high. I own several of their albums and have been very happy with them until I bought St. Anger. As a fan I feel terrible saying this, but the album is just [garbage]. You can play through the first couple of songs and think it will get better, but it doesn't. There is not a song on that CD that I can force myself to listen to. I highly suggest anyone considering buying this album to forget it. Stick with the old albums so you won't be disappointed in the band as a whole.

Maybe all the band members got sick during recording and the technies and roadies had to fulfill the deadline and pick up the instruments. Or even more absurd, the aliens came and abducted James,Lars, and Kirk, and had them replaced with something else. Maybe that'll explain why the songwriting, production is some of the worst I've ever heard. Now I know liking music is greatly subjective, but production level can be gauged. If Bob Rock produced this, I suggest him get a new line of work. I burst out laughing listening to the first track, Frantic. Wait, this is suppose to be a metal record, not Robin Williams telling jokes. Listen to James \\"sing\\" tick tock, tell me if it's not funny.I have followed Metallica in the early 80's to the Black Album. St. Anger-- I'm not sure if I'm suppose to cry or laugh.

They don't need to \\"grow\\" on anything. This album is a complete joke. My nine year old nephew may have even written a few of the songs. Metallica is down to selling junk music solely on their name.Save your money and donate it to a charity that would help the feeble minds of ANYONE who actually thinks this album is worth listening to.

You know, you can be Hard, Heavy AND Melodic. Everything sucks about this record. I was wondering if it's just me, so I asked friends about \\"st. anger\\" and they all agree with me. What happened Guys? The rating system forced me to give it one star, but I gave it 1 star too many.I guess even the Mighty MET is not bulletproof. Let's hope this is just an aberration (like 'Van Halen 3',another band that I once thought could no do wrong). Rock Music doesn't have many great Bands left. I hope this once great Icon can rebound..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap takes on a new name...","review":"I didn't want to believe it when I first listened to it but it was true. St. Anger is possibly one of the worst albums Metallica has ever made. And what's even more sad is how many more new fans they have because of this album and they love it. I give this two stars because although it was a horrible album, there maybe two good tracks; Frantic and The Unnamed Feeling. The rawness of the production was there, reminiscent of their earlier recordings like Kill 'Em All, but it can't compare to that album at all. The live DVD was a nice little feature that had all of the songs played live in Metallica's HQ, but it still doesn't save the crappiness of the songs. If you must buy the album, buy it used or steal it or download it to piss off Lars, it's not worth the full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell!","review":"Let me start off by saying that I love Metallica, always have, always will, but what the hell happened? I can't find a single thing about this album that doesn't make me cring in pain. The production is bad, and the drums sound like crap. I have a trash can in my kitchen that makes the same noise (...). Lars, what are you doing? I do Like the fact that we finally have some heaviness returning to good ol' Metallica, but I am very dissapointed.

The drums all but the snar were ok clang clang Hey Lars there's this little lever on the side of the snar drum flip it UP the next time.The music on the DVD was mixed better than the cd.

The remarkable thing is how both \\"old\\" (pre black album) and \\"new\\" metallica fans have almost universally panned this record. I've heard of \\"stripped-down production\\" but this record simply sounds amateurish. It really is a tragedy and here's to hoping that no more good bands succumb to this \\"dumbing down\\" trend and throw away all their growth and maturity and regress back to suckdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Effort from Metallica","review":"While the band promised a return to it's roots, this album is a poorly produced effort. On this record, Metallica sounds like a garage band, rather than a metal powerhouse. Where are the guitar solos? The lyrics to the songs are also weak. I'd have to give this a new name- St. Fair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit even to download from KazaA...","review":"What a pathetic effort from an experienced Heavy Metal band. All of the songs sound alike, terrible. The lyrics must have taken all of 3 minutes to come up with and the music itself is unharmonious and disorganized. If this was Metallica's first CD thier career would never have gotten of the ground. In fact this sounds like someone recorded this in a garage with cheap recording equipment. I have been a Metallica fan since \\"Kill em All\\" but to watch the downhill slide of a good band just makes me shake my head. I was hoping for something a lot better after a few years since the \\"Re-Load\\" CD which was bad enough. METALLICA, GIVE IT UP ALREADY, THE FANS DESERVE BETTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't buy it","review":"I got this album when it first came out, I remember when I first popped it in my CD player, I thought there was something wrong with it, but nope...what I was hearing was what they had made. After a few listens though it kinda grew on me, I'll admit its a great jam album. However it quickly became less and less appealing, to the point where I took it off my computer (I rip all my CDs) and buried the CD in a dark cavern under my bed. Quite frankly now I think this album sucks, its monotonous, repetetive, simple (drop tuned guitars?!?!?!?!?!), and poorly produced.I think I should target 2 groups of people. If you like pop/rock music like Linkin Park and whatnot, you might like this, I don't know what you crazy kids look for in music. If you're like me and like death/black metal and OLD metallica, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BUY THIS!!!! You'll end up breaking the disc in half and gourging out your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger is Pure Garbage And Should Be Disintegtrated","review":"Another Horrible CD from this greedy, self absorbed California Nu Metal Band. Oh yeah last century they were a Metal/Alternative Band. Now they are NuMetal. What's next ? I'm sure whatever crappy new trend comes around in the next five years will be imitaded and badly reproduced by this un original, go with the latest trend, bunch of has beens. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of these clowns acting like they really \\" care \\" about their fans. All they care about is $.

Just in case there's a slim chance I may like it someday.Whatever you do-BUY IT AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely dissappointed","review":"As an avid fan of Metallica, dating back to the early days before they had any videos, I can honestly say that this album is very poor. The lyrics are extremely trite and many of the rhymes are forced and just plain silly.The album is also very poorly produced, in some songs you can hear the vibration of the guitar/bass intro rattling the snare drum before Lars even begins playing. I guess they were going for a \\"raw\\" sound, but thats what live albums are for. This album is about as good as Kill em All, but without the well concieved lyrics and killer guitar solos. I was not a huge fan of any of the albums following the Black album, but this one is garbage. Definately check out a friends version they want their money back for before you buy this out of Metallicistic nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"Metallica is a ghost of it's former self.

The guys are old and balding now, way past their prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica needs to retire permanently!","review":"This is the worst album I've heard in the 21st century and I tried to avoid the junk at all costs. But it seems my Anti-CD-Spam failed with this. And it is definitely worst Metallica album ever - even Reload, compared to *this*, sounds so damn fresh and new.Someone in these reviews said something very true: Who are they to be \\"St. Anger\\" in their age, in their villas, pools? They can be sad (I bet they are) and pitiful (sure), like the most of the very rich crew, but certanly not angry. They are (re)loaded, they are part of this megalomanic and capitalistic society and all they want now is to make some easy money on the kids and teenagers (I only know 14-16 year olds that liked this) based on their old fame.They should permanently retire and leave their great <91' material alone!P.S.

The first time was the last time. The problem is IF one were to actually download, St. Anger \\"AIN'T WORTH THE TIME\\" to even do it for free. Besides, how many times do you have to hear the same lyrics over and over and over again? Yep, the band's therapy didn't work, and I'll bet Jason Newsted is laughing his --- off."},{"rating":"1","title":"what noise! not music, but uninspired empty noise!","review":"Don't buy this cd. Something is not right. This is not Metallica. Some of the same guys who were in Metallica are also in this band that just happens to go by the name of Metallica. The least these guys could do would be to get a new name for the band so as to quit soiling their legacy. Let's face it: Metallica died with Cliff Burton. Check out the first 4 albums and avoid this one like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just horrible","review":"Why did Metallica put out St. Anger? Its the worst album I've ever heard. Not only is the production cheap and garage-like, but the songs are repetitive and incoherent. They just repeat the same monotonous guitar parts over and over for like 10 minutes. Its like they go on and on and on and don't stop until they get tired. The songs have no sensible structure what so ever. And the lyrics are even more awful than the music. \\"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle\\"? That's the dumbest thing I\\"ve ever heard. I hate St. ANGer so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica didn't \\"sell out\\" until now","review":"I've always loved Metallica. In fact I was one of the few true fans who enjoyed and appreciated (at least most) of Load and ReLoad. Everyone talked about Metallica \\"selling out\\" for the last 3 albums. Wrong. They did what they wanted to do and nothing was forced, they remained true to themselves. For \\"St. Anger\\" every track feels forced and uninspired. James Hetfield's inspiration is all dried up. The band is done, the creativity is gone. The band put pressure on itself to release St. Anger and they've got nothing left. This album shouldn't bear the Metallica name."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Dissappointment","review":"Ok, Im not going to beat around the bush. I hate this album. There's not a song on it that I enjoy. I desperately tried to let this album to grow on me, but it just didn't happen. There are a lot of things that I don't like about this album, I really don't even know where to start. The drums are probably the worst aspect of \\"St. Anger\\" they just sound bad. The lyrics aren't much better. I could not in good conscience recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they release such a bad CD?","review":"When I first heard the single St. Anger I lost alot of respect for Metallica. I used to consider them artists, but now I know they a are content coping the same new metal garbage that is popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-around Solid Effort","review":"I'll keep this brief. The songs are very good. The drum sound isoriginal (albeit a little too prominent in the mix). It's good tosee Metallica back to playing aggressive music. However I was verydisappointed by the lack of guitar solos, as I've always been anadmirer of Kirk's lead work.I'd like to point out something and correct previous reviewers.While Robert Trujillo is, in my view, a great addition, he did notplay bass on the record. Bob Rock did."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Suck","review":"I am just asking people to stop buying this album. I have to put up with this poo every day. I would describe why it sucks, but I'm afraid of Metallica sueing me or making me apologize with some horrid lawsuit that costs so much money out of Lars's pocket that he has to sell another painting or move into a smaller mansion.BTW, Metallica no longer thanks you underground listeners that made them famous in the first place. You are all freeloaders and the RIIA is going to come and get you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANYONE HAVE ANY AIR FRESHENER?....THIS STINKS!","review":"I would say these guys fell from grace...more like a dive-bomb.

How does someone wake up one day and say to themselves \\"hey, it would be cool if I stole Oscar the Grouch's garbage can, took it to the studio, and banged on it for 75 minutes instead of using my regular drum kit. F'n Lars. Not one memorable riff, melody, lyric...nothing. Don't get me started on the absence of a guitar solo anywhere...this is supposed to be a METALLICA album, right?

Every single track is horrible. They all follow the same basic formula. First, the song opens with a monotonous guitar riff. Then James grunts into the microphone about his anger problems. After that, the band breaks into another monotonous guitar riff and repeats it over and over and over for several minutes. Then James starts grunting into the microphone about his anger problems. Then, the band breaks into the same monotonous guitar riff, repeating it for a few more minutes...which is followed by more angry grunting by James Hetfield. Its so formulaic and boring. All the songs just sound exactly the same and just wear my ears down. I haven't been this bored since watching \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" at the movie theatre ten years ago!

I got it on sale for 10 bucks at best buy and after listening to it I knew I'd been robbed. For Metallica, this is the musical equivalent of whatVan Halen gave us on Van Halen III. Something seems to happen when rock musicians go through rehab and therapy- there 'music' becomes steaming poop. I think it's great when anybody beats addiction and comes to terms with personal demons and all that, but a law needs to be passed that states no rock musician can be allowed to release an album for at least four years after their therapy and recovery 'stage' has happened. The bonus DVD isn't worth jack. It's just them playing these crappy songs in a small room straight through.St. Anger is sure to make you very Angry.

It only encouragesthe crapiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel betrayed...","review":"St. Anger. Ouch. This has got to be the singularly most disappointing CD I've ever listened to. The aggression of the guitars and bass are unchanged (props to the new bassist), and as good as ever. However, the drums are tweaked in such a way that the snare drum sounds more like a steel drum. Not good. And James Hetfield, my God, what the hell is wrong with him? It seems as if hetfield is trying to be an older fred durst. it sounds awful. The lyrics are so boringly repetitive and the overall sound so cacophonous, I thought for a moment that I was listening to some Kylie Minogue-Andrew WK collaboration.If you are a Metallica fan in any degree, I STRONGLY suggest you listen this CD before you buy it. I hated this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry about St. Anger","review":"Who is this band? And what have they done with Metallica. Holy cow! I've never been so disappointed in a new release. Especially on a heavy metal legend such as Metallica. This is not the Metallica I grew up with. Nor is it the Metallica of just a few years ago. I suppose all the critics will love it and hail it as Metallica experienting by branching out and broadening their musical horizons. Please! Give me a break!

Oh come on, ever since Metallica hired Bob rock to produce the Black Album, Metallica have went from bad to worse. St Anger is [a] discomfort to listen to. It's weak to add art work from Pushead on the album, it's the only connection to the old Matellica we all love and knew....

The metal gods have been replaced with some band playing way too simple riffs with lousy song structure and lyrics so bad they're low end of nu-metal whine.There is next to no soloing (which is like telling Da Vinci to paint a house) and little display of mastery of any instrument or singing. The only bright spot is some awesome drumming, which is still irritating becaue of a tinny snare drum.Yep, it's hard and rauchy, but it also shows a skill level no better than a garage band. Guitar lines are short, songs are redundant and uninpired.MetallicA always claims to do what they want, but to go from Master of Puppets, down to Reload and then to this?...you have to wonder what the hell they really want.If you liked the 'St. Anger' single, by all means, this album's for you.

We (and the band themselves) should accept the fact that Metallica are washed up.They sound like a broken down basement band devoid of creative fire and state of the art chops especially compared to new hungry outfits like Lamb of God for instance. That's not to say that a band of Metallica's stature should nessacarily be stacked up against other more recent bands who have youth and the benefit of building on the metal legacy Metallica themselves spearheaded but even on their own terms there is no excuse for putting out boring ill concieved and poorly executed material.

I have been a huge fan since I can remember. Metallica helped me through many hard times. In my opinion,\\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Ride the Lighting\\" and \\"Kill 'em All\\" are the best metal albums. \\"And Justice For All\\" was a masterpeice, and hey, \\"Black\\" brought metal to the masses. \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" were okay, but I thought it was just a phase.Now que to \\"St. Anger\\"...The music is annoying, so much that I could ony listen at 3 minute intervals. The vocals sounded like James had a throat cold but Bob Rock still made him sing...Just plain irritating. I could not find a decent song, although I really thought I could find one on this miserable disc.James, Lars, and Kirk should have followed Newsted and quit while they \\"were\\" still ahead.

I cannot believe I was so hyped up waiting for it to come out only to get this... Did they record this in a port a potty on the interstate? Evidently Lars took some time and went back to college and took Snare Drum 101 while James had some junior high schooler write his lyrics for him.

Seriously, these guys are out of touch with the fans or just don't care anymore. This is the biggest piece of self indulgent steaming pile they have released yet, and that's saying a lot considering Load and Reload stunk. James and Lars, please go buy the new Testament cd and have a listen. Yes, it is possible to have an updated sound while remaining true to your roots! Don't waste your time or money with this, or get your hopes up for the new release.

And to have it come by one of the hardest bands of the 80's is a testament to the times. Times have certainly changed, and not for the better.-Hetfield strains his voice to painful levels, and plays the axe like a retard having a seizure.-Ulrich's drums sound like garbage cans.-Hammet and the bass player (Ugly Ogre, I call him) just melt into the background.-No solos.-Nothing good.-The DVD only shows you them playing these songs, and isn't worth the plastic it's burned on.+The only good thing (and not worth $15) is the cover art by Pushead.Any hardcore Metallica fan will definitely want to pass on this one. Not since Justice have they released a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Album","review":"I bought this album as soon as it came out unfortunately. This is by far Metallica's worst album. The drumming is so bad I can't even make it through the first 2 songs on the CD. It sounds like lars was banging on garbage cans. Save your money at all costs and buy the first four Metallica albums. Its really sad that the band released this piece of crap. Metal by and large has been on a downward trend. Metallica may be the most famous metal band in the world. But seriously when was the last time they put out a decent album. Load was crap, reload had 1 good song at most. The Garage Inc Covers album was good. Everyone had such high hopes that this album would give metal bands in general a big boost and it didn't happen. The band will continue to be a force with its live shows but even the band will want to forget they made this worthless album.P.S.

Lars sounds even worse than he did in ..And justice for all, James sounds like he's clenching his teeth, and Kirk... wait a second, where'd Kirk go?

They hyped the return of the classic Metallica sound on the MTV \\"Icon\\" show and played a medley of their classics and promised new classics from the latest CD.

The lyrics are stupid, the drumming is bad, and there are no real good guitar solos. In addition, the band seems to be trying too hard. Nothing is natural and nothing flows here.

They have angered all off hell and soon all of its hatred with come to claim them. Lars snare has an infinite ping that would disturb a deaf man, the first time i heard this album it triggered multiple violent vomitting sessions. Where is General V and Eddie, they need to be summoned to deal with these humiliations. It's as if they defied all laws of music theory to please the public. The rythme makes absolutely no sense, the lyrics and music has less emotions than a souless corpse. Do they really think that this album was good? I am still in disbelief after watching it.

And then, I put it in the CD player and found that it sounded nothing like their older stuff.

It may be some sort of statement, yes, much like Damien Hirst's preserved animals. But you would not want a tank containing a preserved cow in your living room any more than you would want to listen to the hopeless album that is 'St.Anger' on a regular basis.It really is very challenging indeed to get through even one of these awful songs.

I grew up idolizing these guys. I think it's safe to say that they have let the music world down again by creating a new drink coaster for our collective coffee tables. This cd is terrible. The production is hideous. The drum sound is almost laughable. Lars is the worst drummer in rock/metal today. Metallica has lost every ounce of creativity that they once had by simply going through the motions. It seems as though they think that the general public is oblivious to the fact that they all sat around and came up with a perfect marketing and money making strategy which is to give us exactly what we want.

The sound is raw. It only serves the necessities of a band with serious internal problems. No wonder Jason Newsted left the band. A DVD has been included for the sole purpose of covering up the undisputed fact that this album is bad. S& M was amazing. The fans were expecting an album which could surpass the previous one.

And frankly, I'm a little insulted by their attempt to return to their heavier roots (with a little nu metal flavor added to guarantee radio airplay) after they've worked so hard at eliminating a large percentage of their true fans by releasing [garbage] like Load & Reload. Every 5 years since 1990 I give these guys a chance to redeem themselves. After hearing St. Anger, I realize that this once truely great band, who I've supported since 1983, is dead.

This is not a guitar album, like Metallica used to make. Instead, it's just annoying drumming, background guitar, and badly written vocals. There isn't any impressive guitar work at all on this, let alone the characteristic solo, and it seems as if James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett have just stopped trying.

I heard they were listening to a lot of Meshuggah so that's where their new sound comes from. Well, Meshuggah uses a mixing board. Go listen to \\"Gods of Rapture\\" and be amazed that they sounded like Metallica could have now. And they sounded like that 10 years ago. Basically, the songs on St. Anger aren't bad. If we were to hear them and someone told us that it was some new band, I think most people would like it better. But with Metallica, we all expect something more. And Justice for All, Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, these are all great! Those albums all sounded the same and yet they were completely different. Basically, I, like so many others. are disappointed. Come on Metallica, you are capable of so much more.

S.T. Anger was meant to be played loud on a stereo surround full blast to where it looses your hearing, It sounds better than on plain headphones. This CD has its moments of good heavy drumming like Frantic, St Anger, Invisible Kid, and Somekind of monster(inspired by the whole Napster deal!), My only complain which practicily what everyone else is writing. their lyric writing isn't that good in this cd as the black album ,but they do and all the songs need to be shortened because a lot of the songs are very repeditive. Personally, this is not their finest ,but if you are a metallica fan or you are wanting to get this for Frantic / St. Anger then it is well worth it.

But by Metallica standards this album is horrible. The band has lost there golden touch. The druming has an over-bearing feel and it seems to be mis-directed. The bass lines, are hard to make out. I don't however think that James Headfield's voice is still going fine, I saw them live in July and he sounded better than ever. I also can understand why there aren't any guitar solo's - because they want to be more current with the music today. While listening to this record you can tell that Metallica is trying to fit in with the new-style bands that don't usually do flashy guitar stuff.I think we all want our old Metallica back... this band needs to realize that they can't just stop and try to become more modern in there outlook they have to keep the formula that made them great... this album is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy [Crud]","review":"This is embarrassing.

This album has 1 good song, St. Anger, and 10 really lousy ones. With the MTV special, the video for St. Anger, and a couple radio plays, I thought I had to have this CD. Oops.I hate to admit it, but I started as a Metallica fan with \\"One\\", and gradually discovered their early stuff. This album does not work on many levels...several songs actually sound like Lars and James were playing two different songs at the same time. The lyrics are pretty bad too. It's hard to say, but perhaps they blew their entire creative genius on the Black album. I had to listen to it twice just to get the memory of St. Anger out of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen To this it Kicks!!","review":"There are two points of views.

This is metallica's best artistic music ever! when you watch the bonus dvd you feel it inside you. there music spans three generations and i hope that they will put music out for my grandkids!!they enjoy being with each other and rockin out. buy it listen to it with and open mind. metallica is the only band to reinventthemself's so well. you will not be disappointed trust me. they still KICK A!! EVERYDAY ST. ANGER RULES"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to their roots to please the fans?","review":"Metallica went back to their roots, the metal sound, for the fans, or so they say. If this album was for the fans, and to rediscover their roots, why did they do such a terrible job? It's simple... bands change. The reason why Metallica had such huge success in the 1990's was because they matured from a metal band to a metal/alternative band, which appealed to the masses. This album is a horrendous attempt at trying to piece together what once was. Hetfield can't scream like he used to (bascially sounds foolish), and his lyrics are ridiculously corny.Metallica should do us, and themselves a favor, and retire already if they're going to continue to disgrace themselves like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica's worst-ever album","review":"Many people trash the Black Album and Load, but they were both good albums. Load was perhaps a little self-indulgent, but it was still an excellent body of work. Reload, in my view, marked Metallica's first real decline. It was simply the Load offtakes and should never have seen the light of day.The new album, St Anger, is just pitiful. The songs are garbage, the production is garbage.Thank goodness we older metalheads have a new Iron Maiden album to listen to this year ... Dance of Death. Unlike St Anger, which is Metallica's worst-ever record, Maiden's new disc is their best ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The first time I listened to this, I was listening as a \\"they can do no wrong\\" fan. But after hearing my peers, coments, I listened as a music fan. And I saw many flaws in this.Okay, Robert Trujullo(or however his name is spelled) breaths new life into the band, but they are trying way to hard to recapture thier old sound. Sounds like MC Hammer trying to do gansta rap.I guess metallica lost all credibility after the whole napster scandle, but I really wanted to like this one. But these guys are way past thier prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Sound For Metallica!","review":"This is definitely a change from the Load/Reload days and absolutely unmatched to the early Metallica days. For those who are into the current alternative sound, you will be pleasantly surprised. If you are hoping to hear the Metallica sound that's so dearly loved (i.e. Creeping Death, One, Master of Puppets), then you will be utterly disappointed. I bet Kirk Hammett was playing in his sleep...where the heck are all those inexhaustible lead solos?? Lars' drums, especially the cymbals, sound mechanical. It's hard to believe that Bob Rock actually produced this CD.It's cool that a DVD of the rehearsals is included, but I really don't care to watch a rehearsal of songs that I don't care for. Too bad this technology wasn't around during 1984-1990. That would have totally rocked!!!I commend Metallica for trying something new, but as a long-time Metallica fan, I miss that \\"Metallica sound\\" that once was there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"First off, I would buy the next 10 Metallica albums regardless of how I feel about this one, but I am very dissapointed. It's almost as if they put too much into it. The lyrics are repetative to say the least. The guitar is great but without any stand-alone solo's and Lars is awesome on the drums. Even though idividually they all get A's, the end product is noise without direction. I have listened to the entire album at least ten times waiting for it to grab ahold of me, but none of the songs have. I am glad that I bought the album, but am desperately awaiting the next. Kudo's to the band for releasing the DVD, it makes the album a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of Metallica","review":"The highlight of this cd is the DVD included. I am a metallica fan, and have been waiting for another cd to come out. This is their worst effort in my opinion. The lyrics seem choppy and don't flow with the usual Metallica metal style. Some of Kirks guitar work is real heavy, and would be worth listening to without the lyrics. This cd could put Metallica down for the count, or perhaps it should put them down with this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened...?","review":"This album is both great and dissapointing at the same time.Classic Metallica song writing, with strong vocals and great lyrics. The album, however suffers from terrible, sub-standard production values. What happened???? After 4 or 5 tracks the snare drum becomes very annoying making the music difficult to listen to. This same team, Metallica and Bob Rock, have produced great albums and set the tone with the production values on the \\"Black\\" album and every Metallica recording since. This one sounds like a demo and not a polished Metallica recording.Sorry to say but the production is just not there and if that was thier intent, what a bad decision that was! Someone should have double check this recording before letting it go to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the solos?","review":"this cd is ok. st anger and invisible kid have some cool parts, but what i wanna know is, where did the solos go? they've got kirk hammet, and excellent soloist, and there is not one solo on the entire album. i am honestly disappointed. this version of metallica sounds nothing like the metallica of old, or even the stuff from load and reload, its like a totally new band, and thats not really a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant noise","review":"Ok, when I first heard Metallica (in 1985, on KNAC in L.A.) it was a life-altering experience. It was music that turned heads (ears?) It was ground-breaking, angry-yet-beautiful, well-crafted music that you could listen to over and over again - the definition of a true classic. St. Anger is not ground-breaking in any way whatsoever. It's a rehash of much of the same thing that's been done over the last 15 or 20 years, only not as good. I agree with the other reviewers about the lyrics not being up to par, and James' voice coming close to breaking at different points. And Lars' snare, that metallic ringing might have been a great effect for one song, but by the fourth or fifth one, it's annoying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be some sort of joke....right??","review":"I can't believe this...some jokesters have recorded a bunch of horrible \\"music\\" and put their phony CDs into packages that say \\"Metallica\\". God, I hope these people get sued and thrown in jail and are never heard from again. Hopefully everyone who bought this crap will get their money back...it is just awful. It sounds like it was recorded thirty years ago down in some kid's basement using a Mr. Microphone. What a bunch of losers! I can't wait until the new album comes out from the real Metallica, it should be great. They owe it to their fans after waiting so many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica Used to Rock, but Now...","review":"Sure, Metallica was a good band back in the late eighties and early nineties. But ever since their tiff with Napster and their propsed break up in 2000, the news that they would be coming back made me astonished. I was actually looking forward to \\"St. Anger,\\" which I heard was going to be a heavy, actually the heaviest, Metallica album ever. But Metallica's new album fails to deliver the good of the early nineties. Where's the melodic tranquility and furious guitar thrashing of \\"Enter Sandman?\\" Where's the vocal experience of \\"Turn the Page?\\" The title track happens to sound very unprofessional, making it seem as if they're trying to be hard and heavy. They're Metallica- They don't need to try! Maybe their next one will be better. For now, I'll just listen to \\"Metallica\\" until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"something something something is needed","review":"I'm a huge metallica fan and have six cd's which i all like except for this one. Don't waste your money on this cd although the free DVD is good, but the music is horrible. Lars Ulrich has the most annoying drums that ruin the music and you can't even hear Trujillo play his bass. Hetfeild's singing is the worst in his career. There are no solo's at all and they often repeat their lyrics especially in the St. Anger song where they repeat it two annoying times. This band needs help especially in the no solo part. Metallica has turned themselves into just a regular rock band, not the heaviest and one of the best rock bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I Didn't Buy This!","review":"I got this burnt and thought it was HORRIBLE...Still haven't changed my mind. I love 'Some Kind Of Monster' but the rest is HOPELESS. NO-ONE BUY THIS. I HATE METALLICA NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"What hapened to the great Metallica??? this cd is okay, but it's not the Metallica I know. I was shocked to see that there is absolutely NO SOLOS. Cmon! What is Lars drumming on? It sounds like trash cans, that sound can get really annoying fast.Some songs are good, but I know Ispeak for every other Metallica fan when I say their old stuff is ALOT BETTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"I like Metallica. Their albums over the years have demonstrated a great deal of versatility in what they do. They've pioneered new areas of metal, and produced some incredible tracks. With St. Anger, however, I'm having a hard time finding anything good. It sounds like they're trying something new, but they've gone way too far. The tracks are LONG and monotonous, and the songs don't have any real character. Another reviewer mentioned a lack of guitar solos - NONE - and I think that is one the biggest disappointments. And what is with the (snare drum??) that sounds like a cow bell? Bottom line: hold on to your money, or hope for a return of the Metallica we know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Poor Quality!","review":"This is by far Metallica's worst CD. The song quality dropped even from the less than interesting Re-Load CD. And who allowed such poor production value to even go out the door? I mean, was everyone asleep on this one? Your name can only get you so far and then you actually have to show some talent or your fans will not follow you anymore. Metallica can do much better than this especially after the long time between CD's. Metallica, you got nothing to worry about in regards to people downling your \\"music\\". It isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is NOT back!!","review":"Save your money people. Metallica's last great album was Black, and that it shall remain. Metallica sounds here , worse than they would in a garage, with no one listening. This album is all drums, no musical sound from Hetfield (Other than muttering), and no guitars!! It's just not the Metallica we (born in the 70s folk) are used to listening. I love the old Metallica, and I'm not willing to settle for less. So, if you feel the same way, buy the new Helloween album or listen to some of the new German heavy metal. They haven't lost their touch there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I am a die hard Metallica fan and I loved this album, I didn't have to have it grow on me like a few other people here. This band has recreated itself to the new age metal while adding in some old Metallica sound. James and Kurt has some killer guitar riffs, Roberto Trejillo is an awsome replacement on the Bass Guitar for the lost Jason, and Larz is just being Larz. The album has a different sound to it but what do you expect from a band that came large in the \\"Big Hair Band\\" era and still rocks todays teenager the same way it rocked me when I was 8 years old. This band has redfind itself in heavy metal like Madonna has in Pop. Metallica is forever the Kings of Metal and they put together one heck of an album and a pretty cool DVD. Awsome buy, go out and grab one and get ready to bang your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, Inc.","review":"What happened??? The sound quality is horrible. The lyrics could have been penned by any [angry], pre-teen (and that is an insult to the under 13 group). The only saving grace to this (heavily discounted) \\"effort\\" is the bonus DVD: Metallica is still something to witness in a live setting. This makes \\"And Justice for All\\" seem like Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" by comparison. Someone please tell James to get back on the Hooch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Bad!!","review":"This latest effort from one of metal's heavyweights sounds as if each member wrote and recorded their own material and then tried to figure out how best to patch it all together. If this band is \\"evolving\\", then they've evolved past my level of interest. Here's one long-time fan that is very, very disapointed. Save your money and if you absolutely need this CD to complete your collection or just to satisfy your curiosity, then go to any used CD shop. I unloaded my copy and only got a couple $$ because the shop already had lots of used copies in stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bold move from the baddest band around","review":"From a fan of Metallica's 'Kill em all' through 'black album' era, let me say that this album is horrible. The lack of guitar solos is disgusting, and the forced sounding lyrics backed by low tuned crappy guitar is even worse. However, one has to respect the bold move of putting out a something completely different than any of metallica's previous albums. By doing what they wanted to do and not catering to the expectations of everyone else, i have to give props to metallica, although I am hoping for something better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"by far Metallica's worst","review":"Nothing to say about Selloutica's latest album besides that everything about it is absolutely horrible. Do yourself a big favor and buy one of their great albums of the 80's like Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning. Even Load and Reload are much better than this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least I Bought It Used","review":"Yeah, this CD is crap. It's a good thing I stopped buying new 'tallica albums after Load."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sux balls","review":"this album is unbelievably crap, but what is worse is that this was the best of their newly recorded material! what this means is that they recorded songs (which they will probably release) which is worse that st anger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give It A Chance","review":"This cd isn't as bad as people say it is. It's actually a really great album if you listen to it and give it a chance. It has songs that express what the band experienced during the recording of St. Anger and some of the band's personal problems. The lyrics are great and the music is loud and agressive. The reason I didn't give this cd 5 stars is because there are no guitar solos and Lar's drums sound like pots and pans. Not only does St. Anger have a different sound than their past albums but it is also their first with new bassist Robert Trujillo. I'm really glad to own this piece of Metallica history and if you're thinking about purchasing St. Anger...DO IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful","review":"What happened to my Metallica? They should not have bothered with releasing this trash...seriously it's plain rubish. Long gone the days of Ride the Lightening, Master of Puppets and ... And Justie for All. I was so excited about this album but when I bought it, I just could not get passed the first song. It seems like they recorded this album in one session. What a disaster!Now I am wondering if the movie they released where they documented their \\"therapy\\" sessions and the process they went through recording this album was nothing but a sales pitch.A dieu Metallica"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is disgusting","review":"Really really bad. Kirk, James, and Lars are very talented and it shows in their first 5 albums, but this album shows none of that talent. All that you can hear during most songs are poor drumming and screaming. There are no solos or good rhythms and the bass is inaudible. If you are a Metallica fan and want an explanation of this album, see \\"Some Kind of Monster.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirdest sounding Metallica","review":"If Metallica continue to experiment with weird sounds they will end up in Marilyn Manson land.When I want to listen to industrial music then I find a good industrial cd.When I want to listen to rock music then I find a good rock cd.When I want to listen to metal music then I find a good metal cd.St Anger is none of the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a No Stars option?","review":"The drums in this are legendary because they are so bad.

It's fun !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The album that killed Metallica??","review":"I've listened to this album several times, and read the reviews. Some people are calling this album 'genius'. I can't believe they could listen to Master Of Puppets or Justice or even the Black album and still say that.1) This album has terrible production. My first thought was \\"why didn't they get the Master of Production, Bob Rock to produce, then I read the credits... he did produce it! I've heard local bands that have better sounding discs.2) The lyrics are terrible. \\"Invisible Kid\\" is a joke. Most of the lyrics sound like they were written in an hour.3) Kirk's talents are wasted on this album. Nary a solo to be found. I wouldn't blame him if he followed Jason Newkid and left.4) Lars, how could you and Bob be listening to the drum tracks and both nod your heads??? Awful.The complex harmonies, crafted lyrics, ball-busting drum sound, layered guitars, wailing solos, excellent production, all gone. Good-Bye Metallica, it's been fun..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Yet!!!!","review":"If you thought the RELOAD and LOAD albums were bad. Think again. This has to be the worst Metallica album I have ever heard. Not only does Kirk Hammet loose complexity in his riffs he also loose the high treble cutting edge guitar signature sound that he created. On top of that Lars Ulrich sounds like he is playing Bongo Drums. Can you say SELL OUT? Metallica is selling out to those other non solo performing bands to make the almighty dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metalliwho? MePlastica? Huh? Who are these people?","review":"Who are these people? No wonder Jason Newsted left. Did Garey Cherone join Metallica .. .. ..is this what sobriety does to muscians? I'm sorry, all I have is questions... . .this was my favorite band in the world. . .I had heard they were going back to Metal. . .this is not Metal.. this not even Nu Metal, this is what I left in the toilet and someone recorded it. Do these guys even know who they are anymore? For the first time ANYTHING by Megadeth is better than this album. Load and Reload had deepness - they still sounded like Metallica.. . .just a refined and polished Metallica. .. this... this.. St.Anger, is all my hopes and dreams for the \\"Masters of Metal\\" dashed against rocks. It's a disgrace to their name. It reaks ..it reaks so bad you can smell it.

Cliff Burton would roll over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Face it, They are Done","review":"I remember when I was about 10 and I heard Master of Puppets. That album was amazing. I fully converted from hip hop to metal. After this, I got into Maiden, Priest, Saxon and many many other great metal bands. After I heard Load, I knew Metallica was done. THis album just solidifies that. When Metallica was a good band, they used to actually call themselves \\"metal\\" and compare themselves to Maiden, Priest and Sabbath. Now they stay away from calling themselves metal and compare themselves to Audioslave and Red Hot Chili Peppers. If that isn't sell out, then I don't know what is. I know bands try to make their music more accessible to people (Priest did this with Turbo and Saxon did this with Denim and Leather), but this is just ridiculous. Don't get this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"This album was suposed to be the return of the old metallica. However, when I listen to the old songs such as \\"battery\\" or \\"master of puppets\\" I nearly blow my head trying to figure out what went wrong.. Not a single solo in the entire album! Kirk Hammit is the master of solo it's what made metallica METALLICA! This album came as a huge dissapointment. I could honestly care less what happens to it. I hope metallica writes a humble apology. It's awful! The songs droan on and on and hetfields voice is somewhat like a pre-pubecent boy. DO NOT even consider this album. It's nothing like the metallica you used to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album gave me a headache","review":"This a quick and to the point review there are 11 songs on the cd over 75 minutes of noise oh sorry I mean music.

So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Different Metallica","review":"I was extremely excited to purchase this new CD from Metallica. I've been a fan since 1985. I have seen them live about 6 or 7 times. This CD is nothing like any of the old ones. The lyrics seem very simple and detached from the music. The music is not at all representative of the talent of this band. It seems to be just a lot of noise. I had a very hard time finding one song that I could really tolerate. All of them seem too long and monotonous. All in all, I am disappointed with this latest effort. After so many years between recordings, I was expecting something more impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disapointment!","review":"Before this cd came out, I heard rumors that this was to be heavy and sound like old metallica.What a load of crap that was.This album just comes to show what Metallica has lowered themselves to:Sellouts who'll do anything to make a buck. I suggest if you want real Metallica, stick with Kill 'em all -metallica(black album) and stop there.Metallica is dead as far as I'm concerned and has lowered themselves to the likes of awful bands(not metal) like Limp Bizkit,Linkin Park,Staind,Godsmack,etc.This album is dreadful and should be avoided at all costs!If you want real metal of the present, check put System Has Failed by Megadeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive, Song-by-song Reveiw","review":"If anyone of you are thinking about buying this album maybe this review will help you out.1.

At least they don't have to worry too much about people illegally downloading it. It is NOT a return to their older sound - that is a big lie.

I have appreciated that each album had a different sound and feel--until St. Anger. If you like noisy, repetitive punk music, then you might like this conglomeration of chaotic, melody-free rantings.I liked the way the band was maturing. This release, however, seems poorly written and poorly performed. It sounds like the band went to James' basement, dusted off some old pawn shop gear, pressed record, jammed for a couple hours, and called it a day. I think more time was spent designing the CD/DVD jacket (I never did like Pushead's art).Do you remember the colossal let-down of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, getting that sinking feeling every time Jar Jar opened his mouth, ruining your Star Wars fanaticism? This album was much the same for my Metallica expectations.Watch eBay for my hardly-used copy of St. Anger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like the old Metallica could be back","review":"Very nice they have dumped the reloaded sound and went back to there earlier days(this isn't the radio friendly stuff they have been playing, there's alot of double bass and the guitars sound great they have a deep rich sound the shortest song is 5 min and some odd seconds up to the longest clocking in at over 8 minutes.

Anger rocks.

If not then, definately after the Load/Reload train wreck. After trying to force myself to make it through St. Anger, I finally gave up after only the 5th track. The high school garage band guitar riffs coupled with James' struggle within to find lyrics that weren't borderline kindergarten level were painful. Not to mention the quality of the recording. The snare kept ringing, the rhythm guitar nearly drowned out the vocals, and there were a couple of lead guitar lines (particularly in Some Kind of Monster) that made me wonder if Kirk Hammett was really still in the band? His name is under the credits, but does he play? Overall I would rate this effort from Metallica 0 stars, but the scale doesn't go that far down.

It has now been banished from my CD player forever, and I'm hoping I can trade it for some real music.I have all of Metallica's CDs and was even listening to \\"Kill 'em All\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" for a few weeks before this was released, just to get into the heavier side of the band again. I should have stayed there. If you really want to know for yourself, borrow this CD from someone first. You may be one of the minority of people who actually like it, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE . . . HORRIBLE . . . HORRIBLE!!!!!!!","review":"I can't say much that hasn't already been said. This album has no redeeming value. Terrible production, poorly written songs, and musicians that sound like they are trying too hard. Nothing came together. A complete disaster!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"failed attempt at a raw & hard sound","review":"Metallica attempts to return to their original raw and hard sound, but comes up short with St. Anger. As a fan, I've been trying really hard to like this album, to give it a chance, but unfortunately I don't think its going to happen. I've listened to it all the way through about a dozen times now and still can't find a song that I like. The drums sound so shallow, as if Lars used tin cans and recorded it in a bathroom. Every song literally sounds the same, there is none of the former lyrical and musical poetry and diversity. There is lots of anger, lots of yelling, lots of dull power chords and boring beats, and nothing that represents Metallica's true talent which I know they possess but apparently put aside for this one. Maybe it is the influence of the new bassist, I don't know, but they did something terribly wrong with this album. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented sound---a big step down for the band!","review":"After Load and Reload, with a follow up to the incredible mixture of sound in S&M, this band seems to be in an identity crisis. Lack of follow through in the songs, less melody and more of a \\"Static X\\" feeling throughout---gave me a disappointed feeling. I have been a fan of Metallica for a long time and this is the ONLY time I have ever walked away wanting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger","review":"I just bought the new Metallica album St. Anger (the first day it came out) and no offense to Metallica but this is not a good album at all. I am a true metallica fan to the bone but this is really not much of a cd. I have every album of theirs and this has to be the lowest on my list of cd's. All this album includes is just everybody pounding on the instruments at once. You can't tell much of a rhythum or depth to it. I am a guitar player myself and admit this is really a songwriting low for Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caca Metal at its finest!","review":"Poopy metal. I used to idolize these guys when Justice came out years ago. It feels like blasphemy knocking their work at all. But damn, I'm not feeling any of this underproduced garbage. The songs are long and heavy but they are repetitive riffs that really didn't impress me at all and the production is terrible. I have given this disc many times to grow on me but all to no avail. I gave up on them after the black album. Somebody told me this release was \\"heavier\\". I rolled the dice and lost. Download this bad boy. Its not worth a buy. RIP Metallica. I still have Justice,Puppets, Lightning and Kill to remember you with. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!","review":"Definitely an album Metallica would like to forget. The drums sounds like someone is slapping a biscuit tin and the singing is just terrible.

Having grown up with Metallica's music, it's a shame to see this kind of release (well, the past few releases have stunk). This is just NOT the Metallica that I have such fond memories of.It's sad that they have gone so far away from what made them good. I guess that's why we have our old CDs. We can go and listen to them while they were good and still enjoy them.Basically, if you're just getting into Metallica, start fom the beginning and experience the excellence they brought to the table for the industry and then weep with the rest of us at what they have become. Very sad, very sad indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This is not the worst album in the world. It's still extremely bad, though, and there's not a track I can enjoy except for maybe Frantic.

This album is horrible at best. If this is what sobriety brings, someone needs to go to the beer store and get the boys back \\"off\\" the wagon. What a let down and an overpriced piece of garbage. Now I know why Hetfield was crying in the movie, they let him hear this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality in Recording Arts","review":"One star because there is no half stars. One good tune on the whole damn cd (Some Kind of Monster) and it has a annoying loud hiss all the way through it. What is that dang hiss anyway? A Joke? They telling us something? The only good thing about the cd is that they went on a tour when released and I saw them because Godsmack was the opening act and were far superior in performance quality and smoked them in concert. This is what happens when a band becomes bigger than their fans....like Korn and The Limp ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will make you cry.","review":"I am disgusted with this album, the production of it is just TERRIBLE maybe James shouldn't have gone to rehab... his songs we're better when he was drunk frankly. On some of the songs (St Anger for one) James sounds more like a country singer! Where are the guitar solos? You can't be metal without the crazy guitar solos! The drums are just terrible, they are far too loud and they sound like Lars is playing a 50 dollar drum set.There is one slight part of this that isnt a total let down though. The song some kind of monster isn't really all that bad with some nice guitar riffs, but it is still too long and feels even longer without a guitar solo and vocals the whole way through.Metallica's first 5 albums are the only ones worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low","review":"this is just the absolute bottom.

The music style is so different, they focused on being heavy, when in the past it came naturally. Overall a huge dissapointment and delay to the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this album released?","review":"Well, its apparent that Metallica didn't really put must effort into this album. St. Anger is by far, the worst Metallica album ever. EVER. It is quite a shame too. Jason Newstead made the right choice leaving. Metallica threw away all their principles in music in an attempt to 're-invent' themselves, but instead, they've just re-invented what's the music scene has been doing for the past 4 or so years. nu-metal. Metallica should recall St. Anger, release an apology for this album, and then re-release an album of actual time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unnamed Feeling","review":"When you put this album on for the first time and you listen to the first track, \\"Frantic\\", you want to just bash your skull into the wall (but in a good way). By the time you reach oh say number four you are begining to wonder what happend to the boys.Whered Metallica go?There aren't (m)any catchy riffs, the vocals are mediocre (compared to other albums), and the drums are...usual, but I must say that the bass is incredible.After giving the album about 10 or 12 spins in the last two days I am begining to like it alot more, but it still lacks the power and crunch of previous albums such as \\"...And Justice For All\\".All together not that bad boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's Back","review":"This Album is great. It's not Metallica's best (which in my opinion are Justice and Master) but it still kicks ... The drumming is just awesome, James is singing his lungs out and the bass is ok (it's worth to remind that Rob Trujillo DID NOT record the bass on this album. Bob Rock did it). The Guitar are also very furious but the one thing that has left me down is the lack of solos... I think it would be really great if Kirk had put out some guitar solos, at lest on tracks like Frantic and St. Anger. Also, the lyrics are Metallica's finest. I think James has gone really deep on them, sometimes being very emocional and sometimes making links to the past (if you think about it, the lyrics of the song St. Anger are inspired by thos of DAmage Inc.). I intend to soon write down a song by song review of this album, but, by the moment all I can say is that this is a another must-have Metallica album's for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"It isn't old (pre-Black album) and it isn't new (Black album, Load, Reload, etc.) Metallica. This is 75 minutes of Lars incessantly smashing cymbals and James droning on in the same key. No memorable guitar riffs, no power chords, nothing that you'll be able to recall in a day. \\"St. Anger\\" lacks the energy and venom of Metallica's earlier days and the polish of their later work, and as a result will most likely be a severe disappointment for both new and old fans. But don't take my word for it: wait a couple of weeks...check out in-store samples...get your friends' opinions. Just do your wallet a favor and don't make this an impulse buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit the Lights...please","review":"I thought that there was no way Metallica could make a more contrived piece of trash,that they somehow thought that they could spoon-feed to the MTV sheep, than Load.I was wrong.I seriously doubt this will quench the thirst of what few remaining loyal fans they have from before the dark days (read: before they became addicted to money,overproduction, and apparantly Pro-Tools). I have James 'sweaty' Hetfield armband from a black album tour show I still save out of some sort of twisted sense of nostalgia, but I wouldn't even download this steaming tower of [garbage] for FREE off Napster. No wonder they are out to bring Justice for All to free music traders, they don't want anyone to sneak an ear piercing listen before they cough up thier [money]Its a sad, sad moment, but not one that any long time Metallica fiend is probably really surprized by. Oh well, Hit the Lights, this ones dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, Metallica is dead.","review":"I used to be a huge Metallica fan. I think it's important to mention that fact or readers will just think I don't like them when they read this.Metallica's latest CD sounds like a demo in every way. The production is horrible, the drums ring, the guitars sound muddy and the vocals are flat. The whole thing sounds like something you might hear on a local band's cheap demo tape.The songs themselves aren't much better. James apparently can't sing anymore, the fire is gone. The writing is a sad attempt at the speed shifts of the old days. It just doesn't work. I tried to learn to like it, I just can't. Anybody want a slightly used CD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know music","review":"To sum it all up, hard drums and guitars, but james sounds awful. His lyrics are stupid to the point where they are funny, and basically the best part of the cd is the first couple of seconds at the beginning of each song where there is no vocals. Worst cd they have put out by far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catering to their base","review":"Of course, Metallica in recent years has been very disappointing with their loyal fans. ... everything that has turned away their base of fans. I remember the good ole days when mettalica would sell 1,000,000 albums without putting out a video. Having 14 different kinds of Metallica shirts and having people ask me \\"Who is Metallica?\\" It was great! Then, they got greedy and they moved their sound to more acceptable means...So, this album is a big way of saying \\"Yes, we are still hard\\". \\"Yes, we still are angry\\" and \\"Yes, we are going to kick some ...\\" (for the censors on here). So, I stand up and applaud Metallica for turning away from the money machine and putting out a trully, magnificently hard album. Long live Metallica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"F@#$ This!!","review":"What has happened to this once great band! I guess the influence of the media, and what is popular at the time has turned these great musicians into sell out wannabe's. If your thinking of buying this album ....DON'T!!!

This album has staind the world of heavy metal forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS OBVIOUS WHO WROTE THE LYRICS FOR METALLICA EARLY ON!","review":"This album is the end of what was once a great Metal band. It is obvious that Dave Mustane wrote the early Lyrics to Metallica's songs. They havent been able to put together a descent CD since 1991. This is pure crap and it is embarrassing to the Metal Mania establishment to put out such crap. Metallica RIP 1981-1991. Thanks for those years, but there are much better bands around to listen to now. Hang it up and please don't put another album out like this. Let us remember there was once a Metallica!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO METALLICA???????????????????????????","review":"No Joke, this is one of the worst albums EVER!!!!!!!!!

I can see the disapointment in most fans. But those of you who say \\"SO WHAT\\" to no solos and production quality don't know [anything] about metal. Maybe this is all a prank from Lars to punish people for tapping into his profits from online downloads. No excuse for such a poor production, in a time of Cakewalk and Pro-tools anyone with half a brain could have gotten a decent mix. But again, they decided to go on tour with Stinkin Park and LAme Bizcut, two no-talent bands, instead of touring with another metal band. As for those trashing traditional metal, you all know in Europe and the rest of the world it is thriving, just here in the US with Record company owned radio stations do we only hear the [garbage] thats out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful...","review":"The last great CD Metallica put out was \\"...And Justice For All\\". It's been all down hill from there. Poor guitar work, terrible vocals, repetitive drum work. The prison video for \\"St. Anger\\" should have stayed locked up. I guess the director couldn't come up with anything more original for that lousy song. Save your cash for a CD that the band actually put some effort into making. This CD could use a 0 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beat nuts.","review":"In a word- uninspired. This album contains some of the worst songwriting I've heard in a long time from any metal band. There is no soul to any of the music, the drums are lame, the riffs are watered down, basically no soloing (so what exactly did Kirk Hammet even DO for this release?), and campy lyrics. Why was this album even produced? We all know Metallica doesn't need the money. My guess would be that this aging outfit still needs to feel the warmth of the spotlight.I can't blame Metallica for not being able to write good music anymore. For nearly 10 years they were hands-down the best metal band in the world, and produced 10-or-so albums that were golden, original, and genre-defining. No band can write cutting-edge material forever, and Metallica was doing it well for over 15 years.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. It's over, Metallica. And if you're a true metalhead, check out some of the newer bands (In Flames, Soilwork). Metal is not dead, just Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply ...","review":"Fans of Metallica, beware, St. Anger should have been called \\"St. ...\\".

If you want a smooth, silky, sweet sound i suggest you go and pick up any of todays pop artists - as i'm sure many of those reviewers dissing this album have done.Some are complaining about poor sound quality - take another listen to Kill 'em All. After more than one listen you'd appreciate the 'garage' effect Metallica were trying to achieve.Why should this album sound exactly like their '80s music? This album has a fresh, raw, harsh sound that all true hard rock / metal fans would appreciate.The DVD is a great addition too - its very rare to see an entire album being played live in a recording studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Metallica sold out....................

We've waited all this time for something new from Metallica and what we get sounds like any mediocre heavy metal band. We got this Cd the day it was available, listened to most of it but it got so frustrating, we only listened to a few seconds of the last few songs. We havn't even considered listening to it since (it's been about 3 or 4 weeks). We don't think we want to see them in concert anymore because they will probably do songs from this cd.

THE ONLY THING THAT THIS ALBUM HAD A PROBLEM WAS THE DRUMMING FROM LARS THAT HE CHANGED & REPLACE THEM WITH GARBAGE CANS. BUT HEY, THEY DIDN'T SOUND TOO BAD TO ME AT ALL. THIS IS A MIGHTY GOOD ALBUM HERE. ALTHOUGH, EVERYONE DID LOVE THE OLD STUFF BECAUSE OF MOSTLY JAMES FAST MOVING VOCALS BUT WE ALL HAVE TO MOVE ON SOMEDAY.

They've almost sound like modified drums in my opinion even though they're not.I like the old stuff too but along with the new stuff as well. If I need another Metallica album, it'll be this one right here. This album as far is the heaviest.

Ever since the release of the album GARAGE INC., Metallica has started a steep downhill slide. I purchased this album in hope that GARAGE INC was just a bad album for them, every band has to have a bad album somewhere. So I gave ST. ANGER a chance. A complete waste of money.

Why?","review":"Having been a big Metallica fan for years, I was truely expecting that St. Anger would live up to all of its hype and be the true return-to-roots we've all dreamed of. Unfortuneatly, as with Load and Reload, Metallica has continued to experminent with their sounds and musical style. St. Anger is that experiment gone horribly wrong. The audio quality is terrible. Not even on par with an average video cassette, the CD is what I would call \\"Low-Fi\\". The singing style is more like that of Linkin Park and Korn. That's not a good thing. Gone are the \\"cool\\" solos from previous albums, as are any and all concepts of harmony. Probably the worst thing about the album is the sound of the drums. Lars sounds like he's banging on a trashcan lid. With all of the money he has, you would think he could have spent ...[$5] on a Remo dampener, or at least taped a sock to the drum head. Do yourselves a favor and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"With this production..I'd be angry too...","review":"Well...don't get me wrong..Metallica had accomplished a lot in their careers. This album as a whole...STINKS. Some songs could be a lot better if the production wasn't so bad. The snare drum rings like a coffee can hit with a lead pipe..some songs where the drums and bass just play..the bass is barely a rumble...and when Lars and James come in..the whole mix drops out..very poorly produced by someone who is(was)well respected in the recording world..Bob Rock. Well..maybe they did go back to the Ride the Lightning days..with a bass guitar that is nonexistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no zero stars?","review":"If only they had just thrown in the towel when Cliff Burton passed away, the world wouldn't have to put up with this insipid tripe they call an album.

For anyone still interested in true old school metal check out the new Nevermore album ENEMIES OF REALITY instead.There you will find more metal,and music for that matter,than Metallica has in a decade.trust me,you'll be glad you did.By the way I gave this album 1 star because there wasn't a lower rating..Yes it's that bad.I'm glad I'm old enough to remember when Metallica didn't suck......"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DYNASTY TORN ASUNDER!!!","review":"Metallica, when i used to hear that word i thought of some great hard rockin' music that was some of the greatest in the world, now i think of a group of old men trying to make teenie-bopper music.

The songs sound like broken up audition tapes slapped together to make a record. As a Metallica fan i feel betrayed by Metallica, Jason where are you when we need you!?

To my shock and horror this was the worst album I have ever heard! It doesn't even sound like Metallica! What happened?

I tried to just take the album as something new... This is obiously a deliberate attempt at the nu-metal genre, and done very badly at that. The lyrics are lame, the riffs are simple and boring and the songs lack a cohisive flow. On top of all this the lead guitar that had given their songs melody and punch are now gone. The fact that these great musicians have degraded themselves to write songs like this is truly dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I think Metallica should kick it back to there roots...","review":"I have just listened to every track on the St. Anger album, and quite frankly, with the exception of The Unnamed Feeling which is mediocre at best.

If Cliff heard this album he would be spinning in his grave.Moving right along, I would much rather listen to Kill 'Em All while having a knife dug into my spleen then listen to the St. Anger album straight thru.

I guantee you theres bands wont sell out like metallica did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill 'Em All...the band I mean.","review":"This is by far the worst Metallica album to date. I thought Load and Reload were bad, then I got this and it makes those albums look good. :( I'm afraid its time for Metallica to retire. The \\"garage\\" sound this album has, added to the poor music and bad singing equal one of the worst metal/rock albums I've heard in quite a while...and I've heard a lot of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I'm all for bands trying something new, but this album kinda [stin]ks. I was ready for the old days of some [REALLY]ROCKIN METALLICA, and all got was this amateur MOTORHEAD sound. I guess not everybody can be OZZY, or AC/DC and keep making good songs their whole career. I think if METALLICA makes their next album like this one it could be the end of METALLICA. I hope not because I really need METALLICA back."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Annoyance","review":"I don't know what they are trying to do on this album. There is a great lack of direction for each song. One of THE biggest problems is Lars snare drum. Good God does it sound terrible. I think the album as a whole would be better if he got rid of the timbale drum. I mean overall his drumming is better than it has been in years. He finally sound like he is playing with some vehemence. Their guitars are tuned so low they sound like mud most of the time. Kirk does need some solos in there as long as he doesn't use his wah wah pedal 200% of the time like he has done on past albums.James needs to go back on the bottle and then only then will he get some good lyrics that don't repeat themselves over and over and over. There is no thought put into them.Well guys we will have to wait 5 MORE YEARS to wish for a better album to come out next. Until then I am going to listen to And Justice For All, their only album that gave them justice and their best album EVER!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Angerrrrrrrrrrr !!!!","review":"I cannot believe all of the negative reviews of this album. This is the first \\"true\\" Metallica album since \\"...And justice for All.\\" The Black album, Load, Reload, and S & M were Metallipop. When I first put this cd on I was geeked listening to the opening track but worried it would fall off from there. Thankfully, it did not. Thank you Metallica for putting out an album for your real fans. This is a raw, angry, and fast cd. Just like the Metallica of old used to put out. Those of you who do not like St. Anger go listen to Reload. In fact I'll send you my copy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica: Worst Album EVER","review":"As several other people have stated - the only reason I gave this album 1 star is because there was no \\"zero star\\" option. I have never been more disappointed in an album in my life as I am with this one. Metallica said that they were going back to their roots.....unfortunately they only did this 10 seconds at a time. The songs change pace and skip around so much that you can't keep up with them. James sounds like he is singing the whole album in his \\"Nothing Else Matters Voice\\" instead of his \\"Creeping Death\\" voice. If this is the kind of music that Metallica is going to produce I think they should just call it quits. I, for one, have retired as a Metallica fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for the new Maiden...","review":"Pomp and Circumstance - 10; Substance - ZERO!

Since they've already played the \\"Covers-album\\" and the \\"Group-and-orchestra\\" tricks, and the \\"Unplugged\\" is old news, Metallica should start putting \\"Best Of's\\" out... looks like their best is WAY behind them :(((("},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic Disappointment","review":"having been a metallica fan when Kill 'Em All had Am I Evil on it, i was sadly disappointed to hear the discord presented on this album. the artistry and tightness of sound on previous metallica efforts is sadly lacking here and as much as it pains me to say this, i don't like the much of music on this album.the lyrics are still powerful. the boys' writing is still intelligent...not as thought provoking as MoP or Creeping Death but still a thinking person's lyrics. it's the composition that leaves much to be desired.i'm going to be listening again to the album but the hook's not there. the fluidity of master musicians and the sheer brilliance of arrangement don't seem to be present on St. Anger. breaks my heart to say it...but it's not one of their best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Lars sponsored By Tupperware???","review":"OK, Being a long time fan of Metallica since Kill \`em All, I Grew up with them, I play all their songs on guitar, Ive Seen them in concert, Ive even broken down the songs in my head because of listening to them so much. I am one who expects change, NO band can sound the same forever, You have to change your style, its called progression! But what in the hell is this album? It sounds like Lars Ulrich uses drums that are sponsored by TupperWare! The ENTIRE album seems like they made it overnight....St. Anger is already played out on the radio, and i have to change it because its so annoying already, And trust me....Thats not good, For any band! Metallica, You [stink] now, its offical, its over. Go home to your families, and relax and retire. You shoulda left it alone after orchestating everything, But no..You tried pulling that last album out of your ..., and to be honest, I think thats actually where you got it from. Im now offically ashamed of you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Metallica. You say that name and what do you think of? You think of the insane Metallica that I used to know who played their hearts out. Where are the insanely good Kirk solos. A Metallica song without a solo is no song at all. Was that really James singing. Wow. It sounded like some punk band lead singer who cries like a baby. The only reason I was nice enough to give this c.d two stars is because the songs where heavy. That is one thing that stayed the same. Don't get me wrong. I am in love with the old Metallica. The awesome riffs, the great lyrics, insane solos. I love them. Even if they redid their old stuff it would have been better then this ... I think the Metallica bus has run out of gas. They should hang it up with the new stuff and bring back the past. My advice to you, buy the c.d if you like heavy stuff. If you love the old Metallica don't expect the same quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be duped again.","review":"First, I am a huge Metallica fan and anxiously awaited the release of St.Anger. Unfortunately, the album is pretty much worthless. Sure, they still have their chops, but there isn't a real song on the entire freaking album! It's all just a kind of endless, chaotic, rhythmic loop. No wonder people want free downloads. My suggestion is that for anyone interested in well-crafted metal, purchase Marilyn Manson's latest. Intense, passionate, worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grew tried of it quickly, songs too long...","review":"Ok when I first got it I liked it. I grew tired of it pretty quickly though. Metallica needs to do like KISS and have a farewell tour (or two) and quit making records, they have milked it long enough!the songs on this Album are WAY too long.Invisible Kid - 8.5 MinutesSome kind of Monster - 8.5 MinutesSt. Anger - 7.5 MinutesAll Within My Hands - Almost 9 D*mn Minutes"},{"rating":"1","title":"And, mind you, two stars is me being VERY generous.....","review":"I really think Metallica needs to stop making records. It's depressing. And even more depressing because I remember putting this album on (because a girl I was dating let me borrow it) at 3 in the morning while I was driving in my car and the first track was actually pretty good. I was....surprised. Wow. Might this album be good? The first two songs are pretty good! And even the third is kinda okay. And then it stopped. The rest of the songs are worse than Load and I didn't think that was possible. Metallica was amazing. They will go down in history as one of the most influential bands of the 80s and 90s. They can stop now. They don't need to make any more \\"records\\" so Lars can go buy another 5 million dollar painting. However the first 3 songs are pretty good so I'm giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???????????","review":"What Happened!!!!!!!!?????????Metallica has always been my favorite band. If they can't make a cd like their older stuff then just retire our atleast go on more tours. They have plenty of money.

LISTEN TO REAL CLASSIC METAL!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica to Rocktalllica","review":"This album is the biggest disapointment EVER. What happened? Did Metallica all the sudden start sucking? YES.In this album, James sounds like a country singer when he sings slow and the lyrics have the intellect of a toddler. When I first heard a song from this album, I thought that they were going back to their garage days. Man, was I WRONG. I made the mistake of buying this album. Please, don't make the same mistake that I did. Spend that money on a better album like \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" by Pantera. Usually, Metallica fans love Pantera."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgotten souls","review":"After the demize of heavy metal,1991. Metallica's last decade is a trend to desperatly to keep on the charts, (at any cost). Much like the band KISS of the 80's. They lost track of what they enjoyed muiscly, and dont realy injoy what there writing anymore. They love to play and tour just like the beach boys.Obvious: Money is the object hear. This album would have been a ledgend if they proclaimed they were on acid. But the truth prevails. We are lost and cant find our way. FALLOW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD!That is there best bets, sorry folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I wanted to give it awhile to settle in to see what my long term opinion would be, thus the wait on the review. I bought this thing the day it came out and was looking forward to a real rockin' album that was promised to be much better than the sub-par Load/Reload.The first time I listened to it I hated it. It's disjointed and might as well be jazz.Then I watched the DVD and took the music for what it's worth: a jam session in its rawest form. Just the guys having fun.Later and now, I hate it again. The drum reverb is impossible to get past, Kirk's solos are absent and Hetfield's singing is just awful. Sorry, guys.I'll probably never listen to it again. Probably watch the video, but just pretend it's a practice session I'm sitting in on and that James has a sore throat and Kirk has a broken arm and the acoustics are just bad that day for drums.Still waiting to see what Trujillo can do. Loved him in Suicidal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"I loved this album the first time I heard it. I don't get people who don't understand this album. Someone said in another review that the new bass player wasn't all that good. Sorry to inform you, but he didn't join the band until after the album was recorded, so please get your facts straight. I love this album from start to finish. Frantic is a great song. I listen to this from beginning to end constantly, three years after it came out. To all those smart Slayer fans, it is okay to change. You don't have to make the same album over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good record, but not the band at their best.","review":"I was looking forward to St. Anger for a really long time. I have to say it didn't meet my expectations all the way, but somewhat satisfied them. Songs like \\"Frantic\\", \\"St. Anger\\", \\"Some Kind of Monster\\", \\"Invisible Kid\\", \\"Shoot Me Again\\", and \\"Unnamed Feeling\\" are the best of the bunch in my opinion. But alot of the songs had parts to them that were quite necessary. For example, \\"Shoot me Again\\", after the chorus Hetfield keeps screaming \\"Shoot me Again, Shoot me again, c'mon, Shoot me again!\\". That part did not fit in the song whatsoever and it almost seemed like they added it to make the song heavier, other songs suffer the same fate as well. Overall though, St. Anger is a decent album, worth buying if you're a MetallicA fan or hard rock fan. It's definitely a lot better than the trash entitled \\"Re-Load\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica returns to their roots","review":"For the old school Metallica fans that thought Metallica sold out to mainstream audiences with the Black album, Load, and Re-Load, this album will probably be a welcome return to their original style. For fans such as myself who started listening to Metallica when they started singing instead of screaming, this album will be a big dissapointment. I looked foreward to it, but didn't have high hopes for it because of everything that has gone on in the Metallica camp since Re-Load was released. The single St. Anger is OK, but the rest of the album is best left to those who feel that louder is better. Personally, I am not one of those people. If Metallica is chosing to go back to their roots, then I thank them for the three great mid 90's albums and wish them well as I will not be buying any more of their material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a Metallica funeral!","review":"It is sad to say that I actually got my hopes up on this release. Review after review declared Metallica was back and with a hard album. Hard to listen to! This album is a virus that should be contained and not allowed to spread! Hetfield maybe sober, but knowing I spent $... on this album has made me hit the bottle! No solos, a tin can sounding drum kit and poor production have all come together to carve out Metallica's head stone. It's time for Lars to play the funeral drum as this once metal giant is finally slain and laid to rest. I'm glad Newsted was able to get off this sinking ship before drowning with the rest. And smart enough to not throw them a life preserver! Just like Jason did, it's time to let it go! Our Metallica is never coming back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This album has much more passion put into it than Load, Re-Load, and Garage Inc. COMBINED!! Frantic is a perfect album opener, you can't help bangin your head to it!! St. Anger is a great song, much better than the radio version, clocks in at seven and a half minutes. I'm not gonna sit here and ramble about each song, If you like any one of their albums, be sure to give this a chance... By the way, its their heaviest album to date.(They used 7-string guitars on most of the songs)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS METALLICA?","review":"James' lyrics [are not good], plain and simpleGuitar is alrightDrums are so/soThere is no song that grabs you, and keeps hold.

Freakin' idiots could have made any album they wanted.One song, Dirty Window, had potential, but the mix is awful and James' voice is weak now.

The worst part is the singing. What is James trying to do?!?! Only reason I bought this CD was because it was on sale and came with a DVD.

Jame's vocals sound like he's sitting on the crapper, and the background vocals are awful. And last but certainitely not least did Kirk Hammitt even play on this record?? Metallica should hang it up if this is all they have left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but interesting","review":"If you're looking for another Master of Puppets, this isn't it. A lot of old-school Metallica die-hards are going to hate it, because it sounds nothing like those albums. On the other hand, it doesn't sound like the post-Black album discs, either. It's very raw and agressive, and the production is much more WYSIWYG -- not a lot of reverb or effects on the vocals -- very upfront and in your face. No big guitar solos or harmonies, either. If you've seen or heard the first track, St. Anger, you have a good idea of what the album sounds like. But, kudos to Metallica for trying something a little different. If you're looking for an angrier Metallica, this may be your cup o' tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Kirk even still in this band","review":"This album is just terrible. Very repetitive.

Suffice to say that it's as metal, plain, and simple as always, with the notable exception of Bob Rock at the bass, which is of course a step down. My review is motivated by the truly appalling sound mix job in this CD. As I imported the CD into iTunes and started listening to it, I went \\"wow, this sounds really bad--I must have selected a high loss format,\\" or \\"perhaps the CD is 'copy protected'\\" (as some labels are so fond of doing in Europe). So I inserted and listened to the CD itself... and it was still just as bad. Sounds like a make-shift studio (paint can for snare drum and all). I bet I can do a better job using GarageBand on my $2,000 computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Metallica....","review":"I still call myself a Metallica fan, not a fairweather fan. I bought all their albums, didn't download them from napster. But, I have to say, this album flat out sucks. It makes Re-Load sound good, and that's saying something. When I first heard it, I hoped that stupid drum of Lars' that sounds like he's banging on a pot would only be for one song... nope. The whole album. They are so surrounded by money-hungry yes-men that just wanted them to get SOMETHING on the market so they can start raking in the cash. It makes me mad because I know they are still capable of so much better. It also makes me mad because their next album could be a spoken-word album titled \\"Political discussion with Lars, comic book discussion with Kirk, and a recorded drunken slurring from James\\" and I'm such a Metallica fan that I'd still go buy it. Hopefully Rick Rubin will help get them back on track. It's only been 16 years since their last good original studio album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Metallica Fans","review":"Ok we all know how bad this album is. But we might not have to listen to another bad album like this from Metallica. They're putting back the solos and the drums won't be sounding like trash cans anymore on their next album. Maybe Metallica is finally going back to their old metal roots. Oh God please let this be true. Now as far as this album goes yeah it's pretty bad. But everyone has already said everything that I might say about how horrible this album is. But I give them credit for two songs. The Unamed feeling and St. Anger are pretty heavy tracks. Probably the best and hardest songs off this album. In a way those songs kinda have some elements of their old stuff. I'm not saying those songs are like Master of Puppets or One but hey I like them.

This CD is the worst album in the world. If you want to buy this your money would be better spent on KIdsBop. Metallica wnet from one of the most creative bands to the worst band ever.CREED doesn't even write songs this bad. If you like guitar riffs that a 13yr old girl wrote you will love this album.

Look at trends in previous albums. Or preview it before you buy it. Some stores have this available. As far as this album goes. I don't have the album and I haven't even heard all the songs. I knew this album was going to suck, just by the results of load and on. When I saw the videos for st. anger and frantic, it was confermed. They suck. The first thing I noticed, is that the drums don't even sond like drums. More like bongos being hit with drum sticks. I never get tired of seeing rows of the new metallica cd in music stores, that no one is buying. Even when it's cheap or on sale. Everyone out there who things that metallica is going to come back, you go right ahead and think that. But, it's hopeless and you know it. Weither you admit it or not.

It is by far the worst piece Metallica has ever released. I mean, i thought Load and Reload was bad. This takes the cake. If James's voice doesn't give you a headache, then that damn echoing snare drum will! That is the most annoying thing I've ever heard! Just listen to the album and you'll know what I mean. Second of all, where did the thrashy rhythm and thundering solos go? They are nowhere to be found on St. Anger. Nothing even close to a solo. Third, The lyrics. Such classic Metallica songs as Disposable Heroes and Eye of the Beholder have had some truly deep, amazing lyrics. But now it is nothing but the mindless babble of every other band out today. I don't know what happened to Metallica, but hopefully they will learn from this mistake called St. Anger and go on to do some better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their best album in 10 years, but...","review":"...it still isn't very good. And the blame for this can be placed at the feet of one person: James Hetfield. As an example listen to the opening of the title track, St. Anger.

But just when you start to get into it, the tempo comes to a screeching halt, and James starts his \\"singing\\". Three problems:1) Singing rarely works in heavy metal2) He might be trying to sing, but that isn't what he's doing.3) The lyrics to this song, and all the others on the album, are absolutely horrible.I gave the album 2 stars because they tried to return to the sound that made them famous, but they just didn't try hard enough.Music - 4 starsSinging/lyrics - 0 starsOverall - 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"11 tracks of the same song. ride the lighting as a 10 this is a 1. monotone all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yor money, even at [item price]it's a waste","review":"I was looking forward to this album, as it was being hyped that they had gone back to thier roots.I think that they need to hire Dave Mustaine to co-write songs for them.

From the \\"Tick tick tick tock\\" of Frantic to the chorus of \\"Shoot me again I'm not dead yet\\", it is really hard to take the songs seriously.My other major gripe, would have to be the constant pounding of what sounds like a steel drum by Lars. You hear it in every song, and after a short time it becomes very annoying.If you want to hear Metallica in there prime, listen to Master and Ride The Lightening. Anyone looking for real metal from an old school band, stick with Slayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica: Worst Album Ever","review":"As someone else stated, I couldn't put zero so I give the album 1 star. I have never been more disappointed in an album in my entire life. Metallica claimed that they were returning to their roots....unfortunately they only did it for 10 seconds at a time. The songs change pace so much that you can't keep up with them. James sounds like he's singing in his \\"Nothing Else Matter's Voice\\" instead of his \\"Creeping Death\\" voice for the whole album. If this is the kind of work that Metallica is going to produce, then they should just call it quits. As a Metallica fan, I have retired."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOOoooohhhh YYYeeeaaahhhhh!!!","review":"I waited and waited and wiated for this album to come out and here it is. First thing I did on June 5th is buy this baby.When it comes to hardcore, industrial, speed metal this is the album to get. It has an amazing heavy sounds which will make any head bounce and feet tap. There is alot more background singing in this album than any other Metallica albums.The disapointing part of this album is for people like me who play guitar, especially the ones who are into playing Kirk Hammet leads, like the outro from \\"Fade to Black\\" or intro from \\"Sanitarium\\". This album hardly has any leads or solos!!!The few ones that are in anre really short and covered by heavy rythm and drums. Kirk doesnt to much in this album!So if you are into heavy metal this is for you. If you are looking for the old Metallica harmonies, melodies, solos and such...Then this album isnt for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Short, Metallica of Old is Back!!!!!!!","review":"I went to the record store today a little worried on how good this album was going to be, and I was right, it isn't Good at all: it is ...GREAT!!! it sounds like a garage album, and brings back the metallica of old. my favorite songs on it so far are \\"Frantic\\", \\"St. Anger\\",\\"Shoot Me Again\\" which is the best song in my mind, and \\"Sweet Amber\\". Great 75 minutes worth of a cd. and also, the dvd Looks awesome frome what i Have seen of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So So metallica cd","review":"If you are a Metallica fan then you will most likely be buying this cd just because you like the band. This cd is a lot different then a lot of there other cds. They sound a lot different. The words don't seem to go with the music they play. That is really the only complaint i have. Other then that it is a pretty well done cd and comes with a bonus dvd. This cd is definitly worth the money the dvd shows the recording of all 11 tracks of the cd. I don't think anyone will give this cd 5 out of 5 stars. This is not there best album but still good if you like metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh what a shame","review":"it pains me to write this being that metallica has been a long time influence and fav band, but this album is horrible. to wait 5yrs for something that sounds like a demo its sad. i understand their desire to expand and explore and i respect that but this music is not music...it sounds more like \\"trying\\". if they wanted to get back to their roots then it must have been some other bands roots because it sounds nothing like kill em all, or lightning. to top it off, my most fav guitarits of all time, kirk, did not do a single solo in the album and if he did i missed it which is probably worse. metallica is still musical idol and i continue to listen to their other stuff, but this is just not them and its sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves an Aluminum Taste in your Mouth","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this album only to be horrified at what I heard. This is the Worst Metallica album/cd to every be released. Put any other name to this group and they would be booed off stage. It's not like one bad song, every one of them have the same aluminum drums pelting your ears. If you like the sound of finger nails running down the chalkboard, you'll love this album. I cannot imagine any serious music lovers even thinking to listen to this twice, it's just too much torture. Listen to the track samples and you'll know just what we're talking about. I think Metallica spent way too much time worrying about file sharing than making music. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Awful","review":"I dont know who the critics are attemping to fool by calling this a good CD. Once again Metallica has proven that since the Black album exposed them to the favor of the mainstream media and the bandwagon fans that this band has obviously forgotten their hardcore roots. This album is horrible, it sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom to begin with. The drums sound like over-amped pots and pans that almost completely drown out the guitars and bass. Maybe Bob Rock should have concentrated on production instead of playing bass. The songs are uninspired and James is making an attempt to \\"sing\\" instead of using his raw vocal style like he used to. Hopefully the once mighty Metallica will find what it was that they lost, get their [heads] back, stop giving a damn what the critics and MTV think and get back to playing the kick [tail] Metallica music that they once did many years ago. Otherwise save your money instead of wasting it on this God awful piece..."},{"rating":"1","title":"saint who?","review":"SAW THE VID .LET\`S SEE\` WE\`LL PLAY IN A PRISON TO SHOW WERE BAD AND WE ROCK.SORRY EVERYONE .METALLICA DIED WITH CLIFF CASE CLOSED.

ANYWAYS YOUR ON AMAZON HAVE SOME PATIENCE .THERE\`S PLENTY OF GREAT BANDS HERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I can't understand this album. Metallica went from the best, with Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Justice...to this? They seemed to start losing it with Load and Reload, and even the Black Album, but I never anticipated this. There are no guitar solos, the vocals are terrible, the lyrics are stupid and redundant, and it sounds like Lars sold his drum kit and bought a couple trash cans to bang on.Don't waste your money on this. Buy Master of Puppets instead. Hell, don't even waste your time pirating this. Hopefully their next one will be better, but after the past decade and a half I don't expect much from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just listen to the clips","review":"I can honestly say that I HATE Metallica. The ex-fans seem to be right when they say they have sold out. I find it cute that they are trying so hard to return to their roots. I will say I like And Justice For All, Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, Black Album, and Garage Inc. Those are all the albums you need from this group. I guess that's why I like Slayer so much..they have been \\"Some kind of monster\\" for nearly 25 nonstop years while Metallica is looking more and more like a kittenbye bye Metalica, It's been fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest piece of trash ever","review":"I'm an old fan...haven't liked a thing since \\"...and Justice\\"... but this is the biggest piece of crap to ever be released. And in reality you gotta figure that this is nothing more than a jab back at those that download Metallica's music. They put nothing into this. No time, no thought, no emotion, nothing. And of course, the production is about as trashy as a 4-track tape recorder...so they put no money into it either. And so they put this piece of S**T out there and make a good load of millions off all the suckers that actually buy it. Good way to make up for the money they believe they're losing from file sharing. Don't buy this! Don't support these sell-outs. A few years from now you'll see Metallica trying to re-gain the suppport of all the old fans they turned their backs on.I buy music regularly. I downloaded this out of spite. I deleted it after downloading...not even worth it when it's free. nu-Metallica sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ST.Anger SUX","review":"worst Metallica ever.I am going to give it away if I can find someone to take it.Tried to give it to my brother,he said it sux also. I would have given it no stars if I could"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica Hates Their fans?","review":"OH MY GOD I FINNALY GET IT! St.Anger is a concept album! they wanted their fans to get as angry as they felt while recording it! it's ugly, poorly made, monotonous, annoying....enough to really piss most people off. see also \\"Megadeth - Risk\\" \\"Anthrax - Volume 8 The Threat Is Real\\". mountains of cess ridden hatred and filth be laid upon this waste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica sells out for nu metal","review":"Oh my god this album was such a sell out no wonder this album was mostly bashed by metallica fans. They completely betrayed their 80's sound and ended up to become nu metal while other 80's metal bands are evolving & created better sounds but metallica should be ashamed. This album will make a true metallica fan want to throw up. Thank god I didn't waste my money on this sell out album. If you want the best album from metallica buy master of puppets don't waste your money on this garbage. I give it 0 stars don't even deserve a 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madly in love with St. Anger","review":"Actually I've reviewed this CD awhile back, gave it four stars and stated I like 4 out of 11 songs. Well, I love all the songs now. Metallica rocks! For those of you who say the lyrics are horrible, spend a few minutes, if you haven't already, and read the lyric insert that comes with the package. Read all the writing on the side, top and bottom (in Jaymz' handwriting). HEART HEAVY!!! And for all of you old school Metallica fans stuck in the 80's--check out the latest show on ABC? called the Mullet Show--right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Metallica?","review":"Ok, I've thought long and hard on this one. After listening to this CD continuous times since it came out, I've come to the determination that Jason Newsted made the smartest move by leaving. What in the hell was Lars thinking when he decided that playing on a trash can gave a good sound? And how can you even give yourself credibility as a real band when you can only play 2 songs from your new album live? Aside from the fact that they actually are playing heavy riffs on this album again, this album bites the big one. \\"Invisible Kid\\" is an absolutely garbage song and I hope Metallica realizes that they need to refund everyone that bought this album. They need to stop reinventing their music and stick with what worked: \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"...And Justice for All\\". God help you if you think this album deserves more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashionably Terrible","review":"It seems Metallica is trying to set a new fashion in music. The no-fidelity sound. I've heard of lo-fi, like Cake and Meat Puppets, but Metallica just created no-fi. The recording is so blatantly terrible that I can't enjoy the music. It's a gimmick but one I hope does not set any kind of trend. I'm miserably disappointed with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This cd is missing something fundamental. I am not sure what it is, but it is not there.Could be the complete cliche lyrics. The lyrics do not make the music, but they can help. Total lack of any coherent chorus that you can either tap your feet to, or scream along with ... the pointless meandering of the songs are annoying.This band just seems to be looking for something, and not finding it.I wish I could like this cd... I was really anticipating something more than this, and it just didn't get it done. At all. There is not one song on this outing that is worth paying any attention to.complete airbag. St. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for the hype","review":"They released this album early, they might has well had waited until the release date or even later. What happened to Metallica? Where are the moving guitar riffs? What happened to the drum sound? Even more, James' singing...well, if you waste your money, you'll see. There are no more epic Metallica songs. Load was bad, Reload was worse and this has hit bottom. Gone are the days of Puppets, One and Sandman...They've faded to black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Suicide?

All I have is one question for Metallica...What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell were they thinking ???","review":"I love Metallica Old and New. What the hell were theythinking ??? This album is dark and fuzzy. So fuzzy thatthe music sounds like it's going in all different directions.And the drums...Lars has the best sounding kickers combinedwith the worst sounding snare...PING. The Lyrics are weak.James needs a beer. On a positive note you get a nice DVD withthe purchase. Buy it because it's Metallica, but don't expectto much you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the songs that really [are bad]...","review":"I agree with the people who think the production [is bad], but look at the White Stripes--I'm no fan, but they can get away with a goofy-sounding vocalist, a K-Mart drum set, and no bass because they write good music (just check out Audioslave's kick-...live version of \\"Seven Nation Army\\"). The real problem with St. Anger is that the songs [are bad]. The title track is probably the most awful song I've heard in a long time. I don't care if it's nu-metal or old school, just write good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally","review":"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I CAN SAY I WAS EXCITED TO PURCHASE A METALLICA ALBUM AND EVEN MORE NOW THAT I HAVE.

I've been with them since the beginning and it hurts to say just how terrible this cd is. The DVD is actually better due to the drums not sounding like plastic buckets. What happened Lars? STay away from the napster kids and practice again. You forgot everything that got you where you are. You need to listen to your own music.

Also included is a full-color booklet, with photos, liner notes and lyrics. This is a great package that is well worth the price, and is by-far there greatest effort as of late! My faviorates on here are: FRANTIC, ST. ANGER and PURIFY! If you lost faith in METALLICA, give this a listen, and your faith shall be back once again. METALLICA never dissapoints, they only get bigger and better than you! It's good to here a stripped down, pure, in-your-face, kick [...] metal album like this!

Sorry to see that Metallica have decided to go back 20 years and relive their early days again. This album is perfect if you're looking for nothing but headbanging metal action, so expect nothing more... no originality like that found on the previous album, or even on the S&M live set. This is raw, unabashed metal banging at its finest, but to me, that's not good enough from a band this talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diffrent, Unique, NOT A SELLOUT RECORD!!!!","review":"I Just want to make one thing clear, this is not one of their previous releases, it was not ment to be and thus don\`t compare it to previous releases! This album has a very raw metal sound, I love that. But the best thing is that this album is totally unique to what has ever been made. Not just the Riffing, but how it all was put together. It does grow on you and there will never be a St. Anger again. It may lack a bit of speed, a whole lot of solos and epics, but it is still metallica, a new metallica.The songs are not Radio-friendly, crowd pleasing(and so on).

It's like a poorly recorded jam session with words just thrown in to make it a non-instrumental album...St. Anger actually makes Load and Re-Load sound good!!!

I've liked almost all their stuff before this but this is insulting to Metallica fans. The guitars are stripped and boring, and some of the lyrics are just plain stupid.

I had visions in my head of a return to the \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" sound that defined Metallica as masters of speed metal. Instead, the result is an album that features absolutely horrible sound quality, vocals that don't even remotely sound angry and very poor lyrics such as \\"tick tick tick tick tock\\" and \\"St. Anger don't get no respect.\\" The drum riffs are lackluster beyond belief and the guitar leads are dissappinting. The effects on the rhythm guitars sound like second-hand fuzz-boxes with a short-circut and the overall production is horrid. Hetfield's vocals come off sounding like the wails of a pre-pubescent boy rather than the screams of an angry grown man and Lars seems to have forgotten what a heavy metal drummer sounds like. The only thing Metallica should be angry about is how dissappointing this grossly over-hyped album actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Metallica. What a waste...","review":"Guys:If you like Korn or System of a Down, go right ahead and buy this album... you'll love it.

This sounds nothing at all like them.James Hetfield was blessed with a great voice. Kirk Hammett was blessed enough to be one of the best metal guitarists alive. He's capable of playing complicated melodies and harmonies at lightning speeds. Lars Ulrich is... well, Lars.NONE of them use their talents for this piece of [garbage].

Hard core fans at the time didn't like the new direction the band was going in. That record may not have been as epic or as heavy as Master of Puppets, but was a damn good CD. The sound was unreal, but I regress. Fast-forward to 2004 the the release of St. Anger. Pure garbage. We knew the band was going down hill in the late 90's, but nobody thought they could go this low. What the hell is Lars playing on here? Rusty trash cans, his mothers pots and pans, what?This band did rule the hard rock world for about 3 or 4 years, but those days are long gone. If this was the record that Matallica put out in 1991 when the so called hard core fans were up in arms, this band would have been dead then and that would have been it.

Imagine 4000 reviews by hard-core Metallica fans who are dying to hear a Metallica album that they will love. But instead they get this piece of trash. Startlingly bad! This is probably an example of what happens when superstars are told over and over that everything they do is great; they actually start to believe it. Thank god they redeemed themselves with Death Magnetic.Funny - I went to the Metallica concert after they made St. Anger.

Not true anymore! Now they're just another screaming metal band! I guess it's not really that bad of an album, if you take off the Metallica label- it's just not the same Metallica sound i love! It sounds like they're just trying to keep up with the times or something... like they don't want the same sound as in their 80's albums.

The really great part of this is that you get a free DVD of the band playing the entire album in rehersal. The better part is the access code you get to download live tracks. The live stuff is great.

Then they made \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\", which have about 5 decent songs between the two albums. \\"Garage Inc.\\" was just sad. My biggest complaint about \\"St. Anger\\" is this: It's not BAD...It's just not GOOD. There are NO memorable Metallica songs...there isn't even a decent radio hit.

Hetfeild's vocals and lyrics are mainstream like Limp Biz and Lars' drums sound like trashcans.I am all for a band to evolve but keep something in the sound that ties the albums together.

However, if you are convinced that this music is worth buying, i will admit that \\"Saint Anger\\" and \\"Invisible Kid\\" have a bit more work put in to them than all the other cr@p.

Excuse me im going to leave now and listen to my Slayer albums, at least there still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a Joke","review":"The fact that this album has somehow received an average of 3 stars is unfathomable.I have tried to convince myself to like this CD, but it lacks verything that ever made Metallica what it was. This sounds like a bad Nirvana cover band with a drummer who thinks he's God, a lackluster session bassist, and a lead singer who's had one too many drinks. Oh, wait a second...The production is miserable, it sounds like it was recorded in my basement. James' voice has gone to crap, the music has lost its edge. Kirk seems to have had no input into this album, and Lars needs to turn back the clock, as well as turn down the volume on the drum mics.I'm normally forgiving as far as bands exploring new territory, especially one as close to my heart as Metallica, the band that turned me into a metalhead 15 years ago. But has far as this album, excuse the pun, Metallica is Unforgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think that.......","review":"Look people napster has been dead for over two years now. Its time to move on. Metallica was the only band with the balls to sue them over what they stole from so many bands.-Besides Metallica has kicked ass for over 20 years now and they really don't care what you think...Because your all to cheap to go out and actually buy the albums!-I like this album Some Kind Of Monster and Frantic are awsome songs. And ST. ANGER sounds even better live then on the album! You really need to hear it for your self!-I find it hard to lable a band Sellouts when they spent millions of there own money to make an independed documentary. An tour more than any other band that I have ever heard of.(my point: yes they do make a little on the side But most of there income they actually work for! and that rare today!)-So next time you fell like bashing a band for no good reason just remember that. And there are better ways to hold a grudge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have tried again and again to like this CD - But it stinks","review":"With better production this CD might be listenable. Some music parts are pretty good. Most of the lyrics are pitiful. The worst part of it all though is the sound. If I'm listening to a internet radio station at work and listening to bands like Slayer, At the Gates, etc.. I will just work away and enjoy. Then a St Anger song will come on and I have to stop working and shake my head for a few seconds. It just sounds so bad it's un real. Even old Minor Threat and Dead Kennedy's Cd's have better production than St Anger. This CD will have to be put to rest in my collection. It just isn't worth listening to that horrible sound to try and enjoy the songs. For any one interested in great metal pick up the Opeth DVD that was just released. It is incredible, and the songs sound ten times better live than they do on their CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by too much success?","review":"My favorite Metallica records are ...And Justice For All and Master of Puppets. Those are really enjoyable!BUT THIS?!! Knowing from experience that the best music is complex and usually takes a while to get into, I really gave this record time. Some of the songs have cool beginnings, but other than that it's just unlistenable. Painful and disjointed.If you want good metal try Symbolic, Sound of Perseverance, and Human by Death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"I would really like to be able to give this cd negative stars due it being such a horrible failure. I remember the first time st anger debuted on tv. This video was stupid and so was the song. Huge dissapointment. I dont understand their logic. Hey lets take a bunch of crappy riffs,and even crappier lyrics repeat each till the songs are at least 6 minutes long and call it an album. Songs that are over 7 minutes long usually have more than five parts. Every song on this album could have been done at roughly three minutes.Not to make them more radio friendly mind you but a tab less monotenous. This will be a huge album for people buy anything Metallica does blindly. Do yourself a favor get older metallica and pray that their next cd is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS STILL SUCKS !","review":"I wrote a review before saying that this st.anger album is the biggest pile of horse manuer ever. ANYBODY WHO GIVES THIS MORE THAN 1 STAR SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL. I don't even suggest buying or listening to metallicas' older albums or any album by them. This is coming from someone who used to love this band. Instead just let them fade away because they don't deserve your time or money. If you want some awesome heavy metal to listen to check out MANOWAR,BLACK SABBATH and IRON MAIDEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a quick update...","review":"This album has recently been certified TRIPLE BRONZE by the RIAA - Over 3 MILLION COPIES RETURNED!Once again, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the F@#k is going on here!!!!????","review":"Metallica used to mean something. They stood for METAL ATTITUDE. They burst on to the music scene in the early eighties with an \\"I don't give a s#$t\\" outlook on life. They changed the face of Rock music. I don't care what some diehard fans say, I think Metallica really has sold out (Hell, they started to sell out after Cliff died!). There's good forms of change and bad forms of change and Metallica is a perfect example of the latter. If you don't believe me, take a look at their contemporaries. Metallica, a band who opened up for Venom (BLACK F#@$&N METAL NEW YORK! Sorry, I just had to write that!) numerous times in 1982 (on the \\"Seven dates of Hell\\" tour) and 1983 now has the gaul to tour with bands like Linkin park and the Deftones. Hail Death, Opeth, Hypocrisy, Arch enemy, Children of Bodom, The forsaken, Meshuggah, Enslaved, Vomitory, Amon amarth, Bolt thrower, Kataklysm, Bathory and Shadows fall. To Hell with Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is Dead","review":"I cannot explain how horrible this CD is. From Lars playing drums on his trash cans to the terrible lyrics and repetative guitars this album is one of the worst of all time. It should be givin 0 stars there is nothing in this CD to be happy with. I hope Metallica comes out with another CD someday so that no one buys it and Metallica retires. Please do not waste 18 dollars on this CD like I did, the most use you can get from this CD is using it as a frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old guys can't Rock","review":"I really didn't buy this CD, I'm not making these guys any money. I just wanted to let you guys know that these guys are one of the reasons why Napster was shut down and started this whole RIAA bullsh*t. RIAA seem like they have good intentions with this lawsuit but if you dig deeper they are in it for the money also. They couldn't stand (especially Lars) losing money after they already made their millions. Sell outs to the fullest. Big label bands suck except for a few exceptions. Not only that I did hear their new CD suck to make this review official. So don't make them any more money and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"they tried but i dont think they suceeded","review":"This album isnt THAT bad, except for the repetitive songs. Ever song repeats itself way too much. The main drop of Metallica was Bob Rock, what an a**hole. He popularized them and his influence has made their music ability go completley downhill. He came aboard on the Black Album which was a good album, but ever one after that has gone downhill. This is a little better than RELoad but so f**king what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The music really is good...","review":"The music written for St. Anger is absolutely fine. The lyrics aren't supposed to be good. The singing isn't supposed to be perfect. The music is supposed to be fast and not very complicated. It is an angry album, and that's ok. Some of the songs on here are absolutely perfect......except the production just kills it all. The drums, man...the drums! Why the bad drum sound? What made them think that this sound would be ok? It is very unfortunate. Frantic, Sweet Amber, Purify, All Within My Hands...all of these would be great metal songs, but the drum sound completely ruins it. The DVD is much easier for me to listen to, because the drums there sound like they're supposed to.The lack of solos is a minor gripe I have. You can pinpoint in both Sweet Amber and Purify exactly where a guitar solo should be. But this pales in comparison to my complaint about the drumming. This could have been a 4-star album for me, but instead it gets a 2 for being very badly produced good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST SOULS","review":"I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM SEVERAL TIMES TO GET A FEEL FOR IT, BUT IT NEVER HAPPEN.

St.Anger, sucks. Flat out sucks. I am very disappointed in Metallica. I expected MUCH more. In this CD there is NO guitar solos. All the songs are the same, and the drumming sound is bad. Very. Very clingy sounding. Metallica is still the best \\"older\\" rock band out there. I highly recomend ANY other Metallica CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I really wanted to like this album. I've been a long time fan of Metallica and I have to say, this is the worst album I've heard in a long time. There's only two somewhat decent songs on it; St. Anger and Some Kind Of Monster and they're not even that great.I dont know why I dont like this album. I think it's because everything that I dont like in music has been lumped together in one big pile of garbage. This is coming from someone who liked when they experimented and came out with Load. I liked that one, but this one is horrible.Here's to the next album, I hope they dont make a \\"ReSt.Anger\\".Save your money and go buy Iced Earth or Anthrax's new albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"What type of Rock Band is greedy enough to sue its own fans?","review":"METALLICA the Band that once was. The once in your face and f off attitude is now gone replaced buy a bunch of corporate rock greedy ass kissing old men. The as the ultmate insult Metallica sues its fans for downloading and swaping their music. What a slap in the face to their all their fans. How greedy does a band have to be-i guess after the crap they have been putting out latley including this pathetic album sums it all up. And after what they did to their fans is simply UNFORGIVABLE. Do not waste your money time or energy to support this pathetic band instead let them just FADE to Black and put them where their music now deserves to be in the 99cent cut out bin. Metallica may your fans all desert you so that you all can go roast in hell---you bunch of sell outs!!!!! im glad that Cliff (god rest his soul) aint around to see what happened to his band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at All Costs","review":"Absolutely terrible. Avoid this pile of garbage at all costs, I have lost respect for Metallica due to it. How can a band go from writing songs like Master of Puppets and One to vomiting out the throwaway crap on this album? The world may never know. Instead of attempting to answer the question, save yourself the 15 dollars or so and don't buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did you expect?","review":"What did you expect from a band that did not yet have a real replacement bass player for Jason Newstead, had a full time psycho therapist in the studio with them, and experienced writing and recording delays by Hetfield's lengthy detox and subsequent touchy feely healing process? Of course it was gonna suck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica has completely lost their edge!----what a bunch of pathetic has beens!","review":"This is the lamest attempt at a comeback since Micheal Jackson's \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD in 2001! Every second of music on this cd is pathetic, there is not even ONE even remotely listenable song. The music is uninspired, boring, unoriginal, and uncreative. The band members have no interesting songwriting ideas, all they do is repeat a bunch of downtuned nu metal riffs over and over and over, and just stop whenever they get tired. James Hetfield's \\"tough guy\\" voice sounds forced. Those monotonous guitar riffs and \\"PING PING PING\\" drums combined with his growling about his anger problems are more irratating than Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" CD!Metallica, if this is the best you can do, its either time to retire or just play on the \\"oldies\\" circuit! You went 6 years between albums and THIS garbage is the best you can do? That's pathetic, and you guys are pathetic. What a bunch of pathetic has beens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this album","review":"Although I am more than a Metallica enthusiast I must say this album is odd and it sounds more like a really noisy teenagers wannabe metal band. Very poor drums (as discordant as they get), and a huge lack of guitar participation.Quite disappointing... Don't waste your money on this. Is the kind of album you keep skipping songs to try to find at least a good one and you will rapidly find yourself again in Track 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?????","review":"I find the title of this CD ironic. There is no anger in these songs. No pain. No edge. Metallica are now mega-rich rock STARS completely out of touch. The songs are crap, they aren't memorable, they don't rock. And the drums sound HORRIBLE. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????"},{"rating":"1","title":"They Were Once the Trendsetters, But Now They are Followers","review":"Once leaders and now followers. This album shows that the band knew that they had lost their way. But the sad part about it is that they couldn't find their way back. They sold their souls with the Black Album, and could never get them back. The music got worse and worse until they were unrecognizable as the titans of metal that they were in the mid 1980s. It really was painful and sad to listen to this. It sounds like they are deperately trying to appear heavy and hip, when all they really are is washed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one minor comment","review":"Why oh why couldn't they have turned up Lar's snare just a little louder in the mix? You know; so instead of sounding like a retard caning a welding tank it would sound like A-Rod going to town on a propane tank with an aluminum baseball bat.Yeah. That'd be great. I mean, if you're going to be ridiculous, why not go all the way, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont know what to think","review":"i dont know what to thinkfirst the album is so [bad]! the music there isnt so good , example is st anger ( song no.2) , they create a nu-metal kind, fast and without any soul.this is not metallica that i know.but from other way that kind remind me the old metallica.anyway , this cd is just for statistics that fans have for saying i have the new cd of metallica, like load and reload."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saint Anger is incredible","review":"I recently bought Saint-Anger and I have to say that I'm incredibly impressed with the quality of the album and the ferocity of the music.

And, guys, let Kirk rip a solo every now and then. Man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica lost their way","review":"Most people harp about what a load of crap Load and Reload are. Well, let me tell you that those may not be traditional Metallica albums in the sense that their old ones followed but at least they were well produced, had some grooves, variety, and just overall rocked in some parts. St. Anger somehow was supposed to go back the days of old. Well whatever happened I don't know. This album is a total mess in the production department. Lars sounds like he's just banging away on a tin can over and over again. I normally love his playing, but something went terribly wrong here. James vocals are all over the place. Kirk has no solos...not one!! Now this album is by far one of their heaviest but it lacks any memorable tracks, other than maybe Frantic, St. Anger and Some Kind of Monster. It just seems to be same song over and over again for almost 80 minutes and let me tell you that can get very tedious after awhile. FOR DIEHARD FANS ONLY that think Metallica can do no wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Balladra!!!! Blah blah blah","review":"The DEATH of this band goes back to a key player - BOB ROCK!!

On BlabberMouth.net I read that Lars thought people arent digging this because of how \\"raw and heavy\\" it is. This man has lost his mind, and all the band, because they have such high egos. They think they have a f*cking midas touch or something. Well, Lars sure doesn't because his \\"drumset\\" sounds like garbage cans. The singing is terrible, the riffs are terrible, the production is terrible, and to call this metal would be a crime. I mean, Overkill has been around for almost as long, and still thrash like in the 80s. Listen to Death's 'Human', now that's pure talent. This is just mtv trickery, dont fall for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on You","review":"Being a long-time fan of Metallica, we have all of their albums (CDS) but when I first heard this new album, I thought it SUCKED...but after you listen to it for a little bit, it will grow on you just like the other (Load & Reload) albums. The songs have potential. The bonus DVD rocks also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD but lacks original sound","review":"St. Anger is seen by many as a dissapointment before it even came out. I think it's great that they decided to try something new yet again and I think this time, unlike Load and Reload, they will be successful. However, the guitar solos we are all used to are practically gone and Metallica seems to be leaning more towards todays newer bands while still somehow having thier own original sound that can only be played by them. This CD is much better than I expected it to be after hearing all the bad comments about it but if you really like Metallica stick to thier old stuff (Kill Em' All through ...And Justice for All)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt to regain their heavy roots","review":"One thing I've always liked about Metallica is their way of using dynamics like no other metal band I've heard. It seems as if on this album their \\"blowing their load\\" too soon and leaving me for one, bored.When I heard that their next album would be heavier like classic Metallica I was excited and anticipated the release. They released the album early so I went and bought it and now I wish I would have sampled it first. There aren't any guitar solos just drop D struming that get's really boring after the first few tracks. Lars really should think of losing the bell sound his snare has because I don't know if it's just me but it get's a tad old quick.One thing that this album has that no other does is great packaging, artwork and a cool DVD with the exact same track listing being performed. I thought this was a great idea. But this dosn't save the lack of Metallica I've grown to love, excluding The Black album, Load and Reload."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to form for headbangers","review":"Just finished being pummelled by this relentless disc. If anyone thought Metallica had gone soft during their absence this disc is going to silence them. This is one of the hardest metal albums I have ever heard. You've heard the title track \\" St. Anger \\" which switches tempos at the drop of a beat. The chorus drives it home. But there are other gems to be found with \\" Frantic\\", \\" Some Kind of Monster \\" and \\" Shoot Me Again \\". This is what rock is suppose to be all about. Long live Metalica, long may they reign!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not load , reload (thank goodness)","review":"Huge metallica fan! huge dissapointment with load and reload. St. Anger is a breath of fresh air. I haven't heard them play this much riff in along time. No solos, strange but doesn't take away from anything. Every song over 5 mins!

I listened to the St Anger radio version, and I nearly died laughing. Then somebody told me it was St Anger, the latest Metallica single. My laughter nearly turned to tears. Metallica is officially punk rock now, a genre which I loathe more than country and rap put together. I was hoping they'd stick with their power metal trend they set with Reload (RELOAD WAS GOOD, SILENCE ALL YOU NAY-SAYERS!), but I guess that was too much to ask for. Sigh. But hey, spend money on it if you're into punk rock. You'll probably like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like a refund","review":"I had been an avid fan of Metallica for years from the powerful Ride the Lightning to the progressive Load/Reload albums. The Black Album was brilliant. Truly amazing CDs that I could listen to over and over again. Now comes St. Anger. I couldn't believe that this CD was actually released to the public. When I first bought the CD a few months ago, I was extremely disappointed and I thought perhaps I could learn to appreciate the CD a few months later. Few months had passed, ok, the first two songs were ok. However, the rest of the songs were just badly written, bad vocals, no solos, and annoying tinkering drums. Production sounded like it was recorded with a $50 boombox in a garage and then later converted digitally to CD.St. Anger is one of the worst CDs I've ever encountered. If I can find the contact information, I would not hesitate to complain and ask for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Metallica of old...","review":"Alas, Metallica has not returned to the trailblazing metal of their formative years. Instead they seem to be trying to sound like everybody else. The music is very similar to the radio- friendl, sugar-coated mainstream rock one hears on radio.

We are all covinced that this album is just a spoof that James and Lars are trying to pull off, Like Spinal Tap or something.. They most likley left Kirk out of the loop just to goof on him too. He would jump in front of a train if they told him to, so I'm sure he went along with it, no questions asked..

With a new Bass player, and somewhat a new sound/image, this CD makes the old metallica fans somewhat weary....almost like \\"what happened to metallica!?\\" but after the first few songs pass by, you will soon be reunited once again with the fast-paced and amazing muscal talent that metallica has brought us time and again. If your on the market for a new CD i strongly suggest the \\"Black Album\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\", but if your looking for another CD to add to your collection....you absolutely cant go wrong with ST.

I really, really liked S&M because it seemed like they were growing musically and weren't afraid to try unconventional approaches to their performances. I am very disappointed with St. Anger, mostly because I feel the group has taken a step or two backwards artistically. The music sounds, pardon the pun, angry and it's more like something a new garage band might write, not a creation of an experienced, vetran group like Metallica.

Metallica should go ahead and replace James, Lars,and maybe even Kirk if he's done with guitar solos. Throw someguys in with just a little bit of talent to replace them andwe'll a much better band than this. This whole album soundslike trash.In review, I would not get this cd if I were paid the [money] totake it. There are no redeeming qualities. It's not that theychanged, it's that they didn't even try.

I bought my first Metallica album in 1987, and from then on bought every item of Metallica I could find. I have been to numerous concerts, and love every bit of Metallica. Until this album came out.... I am so dissapointed in this album. You could play their very first album/tape, and it would sound better than St. Anger. The production quality sounds that of a cheap 4 track recorder. I cannot believe that Bob Rock would let Metallica move in this direction, when he made them so much stronger in the early 90's. I agree that the drums sound horrid, and the songs sound like amateurs throwing licks together in some random fashion. Believe me when I say, I am still a huge fan, and will continue to be at every Metallica concert that comes near me, however I am just dissapointed in their newest album, and hope they recover from their mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds","review":"Like it was recorded inside a bathroom while somebody was taking a crap.Plop Plop Fizz Fizz Oh What A Relief It Is. -I think that I now know why none of these songs were performed live.\\"Some Kind Of Monster\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess Newsted was very important to the band.","review":"I first saw metallica live at day on the green in 84?

I am here to make the truth painfully obvious they always sounded like this only you didn't realize it until now, so quit saying they're imitating Britney Spears and get better tastes in music so you can't be stereotyped.

It's hard to believe that Metallica would put out an album like this. I'm listening to it as I'm writing this review and it's probably the last time that I will. This album makes Load look like a masterpiece. I've been a big fan of Metallica since 1987, so I know what I'm talking about. Gone are the great days of Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, and Master Of Puppets. These guys are lost and have an identity crisis. I hope that they don't play many songs from this album when I see them this summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing...","review":"For as long as it's been since the last album, you would think this album would just blow you over. It doesn't even come close. I love Metallica, old and new, but this album is just a blistering mess. First of all, I think the hearing loss must be getting to the guys because this album is mixed horribly. The drums sound like Lars recorded them while playing in a tin can, and the guitars are so muddy and indistinct that you can discern what the hell is going on. The lyrics are horrendous, and all the songs are unbelievably repetetive. Yeah, they're all 10 minutes long, but after 3, you've heard everything, and it just repeats, and repeats, and repeats. I guess the truly die hard fans might love this new sound, but I couldn't be more disappointed. There are no epics, no great songs like Metallica of old, nor anything catchy or intricate like their newer stuff. This is just garbage....beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time or money","review":"Metallica hasn't released anything decent since \\"The Black Album\\" and this is no exception. The lyrics are mindless and the music sounds as if it was written by a teenage-garage band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal lives in St Anger","review":"If you thought that the 8th original studio album was going to be Metallica's last ditch effort to spring back into action, then you have no idea what is coming your way. St Anger is one big metal, hard hitting, lyrically intense cd. Its none of that fancy, a little too melodious ballad kind of ..., no its just pure, fast metal all the way. St Anger, by the name of the cd, is very angry and agressive. One can find themselves getting lost into such tracks as Invisible Kid, and My World rather easy. A few rather inventive songs which define the evolution of Metallica and utilize Ron Trujilo's radical bass playing are Frantic, Shoot Me Again and All Within My Hands. Metallica has done it, they have stayed true to their fans. I do have to critique them on one point though: there are virtually no good Kirk solos anywhere on the entire album. Maybe Kirk will jump into action next time. Until then, rock out and kick it to St Anger - one of Metallica's best yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetting your roots","review":"I can't even begin to explain my disappointment. Metallica is best known for their incredible solo's on every song. Yet this album has NOT ONE GUITAR SOLO. Each song follows the same formula: play the riff on bass for a few seconds, then play the same riff with guitar. And James' vocals are at their end. From the first song \\"Frantic\\" the man's running out of breath going \\"tic tic tiiic tiiic tiiiiiiic tock\\" Not worth the money. Heck, not even the download!!!!! You'd think after months of studio time, they'd make something good. But apparently not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica has gone down hill.","review":"I thought that Load and Reload was total crap; then I listened to this, and I found Metallica at a new low. The once greatest thrash metal band is about as bad as Dave Mustane's voice singing opera. This is a should not buy on any person's list who have loved Metallica before they played this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to do with Metal","review":"A friend of mine bought this worthless piece of garbage and let me borrow it so I could hear what all the fuss was about. I have never been more appalled in all my life. This thing is so awful it almost makes me want to vomit in horror. The songs are bland and thrown together. There are no solos whatsoever, and the songs seem to be long for no good reason at all. Nothing on this album really goes anywhere. I gave it more than one spin and it certainly did not grow on me in the least bit. In fact everytime it only got more and more difficult to listen to. The last time I actually cut it off in the middle and just put it back in the case. The next day I gave it back to my friend. For anyone who desires real Metal, get anything from Decapitated, Naglfar, Setherial, Opeth or Iced Earth. Anything by any of those bands will be much more satisfying than this \\"thing\\" that some misguided poeple think is \\"Metal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks is the word","review":"metallica has turned into a bunch of clowns, come on... they need to first of all take some music classes and lars needs to practice some basic druming techniques...I cant beleive that this is what metallica has come to, a complete sell out boy band, metal wannabe...Dont buy this album, and in case you see Lars in person, punch him in his ugly little face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Words","review":"Retire and fire Bob Rock.

Six years since their last studio album (1997's ReLoad). I don't even honestly know where to start? I've been a fan for 17+ years. I liked everything up until 1996's Load album. After hearing this though, it makes Load sound good. The songs on this album are not memorable, to say the least (The title track is the only song I halfway like). The production is awful. The drum tracks are horrible (Lars sounds like he's playing a trash can). I've heard better quality recordings from demo tapes. The songs are way too long, and very repetitive. The lyrics are silly and unimaginative. And, last but certainly not least, there are no guitar solos anywhere to be found. Truly unbelievable. I am still in shock.."},{"rating":"1","title":"no justice.","review":"the basic idea behind this album was good -- a raw, garage sounding record -- like they traveled back in time and were young, dirty potheads again. the only thing is that the songs aren't very good. i can't believe this is the same band that created the justice and masters albums. i think lars and the gang thought..

Pound Pound Pound Pound pound pound pound..is all I heard. The snare is monotonous and not entertaining at all and weak as hell. The music is zz-top-esque rock with rap rhymes. At this point my ears bleed with puss and I am searching through the music for the reason it exists and I am ready to take a bath now. Hetfields voice is absolutely atrocious.

The Black Album was a shock at first but about five songs off of the CD grew on me. Load was a total let down but two or three songs I finally found to be decent. Re Load left me with about one song I liked. Now St Anger has given me not a song I can listen to and enjoy. I still crank Ride the Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and Justice from time to time. Those CD's are truly great CD's. From beginning to end they are solid CD's. The latest four releases are full of filler songs. A catchy riff here and good chorus there but all in all the CD's are weak and unimpressive. I'm very let down by Metallica. They are just getting worse and worse. Each release since Justice for all... is progressivley boring and lame. Is the next CD going to sound like Blink 182 ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh...","review":"OK, first I want to knod to the fact that I am not a *fan* of Metallica per se. I like Master of Puppets, and almost everything from it to the black album, but i am yet to dig something they did after that. I am more casually into metallica and I don't have patience for this and their less impressive work. So in my opinion, a one star effort in production. They should have used this a preliminary demo, then stopped butchering songs together, and recorded an album with a snare that doesn't dominate the songs with its horrible wretching sound...gasp...ok I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger ?","review":"Everyone should just move on with there lives. This CD will be forgotten quicker than that guy who sang for Van Halen after Sammy Hagar. Whats his name ?

They either need to wake the hell up or stop making music. I thank God that I did not buy this album, but rather burned it. If I bought it, I would probably kill myself. Bottom-line..Metallica has gone from the very best metal band in history................to possibly the worst. This album proves that. They don't even have any guitar solos, yet they have one of the best guitar players in metal music. Metallica's done. Do yourself a favor and save your money when considering this album.

Anyways the albums lyrics rock, typical metallica greatness, the only set back is Kirk forgot one small thing on the album, a legendary guitar solo so cool it makes the hairs stick up on your neck! Solid 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting back to basics","review":"Unlike the previous critics, I think this CD rocks! If you are 13 - 18 yrs old and became a fan during the Load/Reload era you'll hate it. If you are a true metal head and yearn for the rough production of albums like Kill 'em All you'll love it. This album is coarsely produced, but it lends nicely to the heavyness of it, because it definitley is alot heavier. The newly invigorated metal/hardcore scene has definitely pulled metallica out of there shell.I think this should have been the next album released after the black album. Load and Reload are loads of sh*t and St.anger takes metallica back to it's basic metal roots. True metal heads will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disgrace!","review":"First off, I can't beleive how low Metallica has sunk to this level of tin-can bashing and vocals that sound like nothing else I've ever heard. They do not even sound like their older albums, with that power and grace and how we all have come to love that famous instrumental music. I would recommend Metallica's older albums, plus any of Linkin Park's cd's. At least they know what they were doing when they recorded their music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy, yet weak...","review":"I've listened to this CD a few times and I think I've summed up what the problems with it are. First, and foremost, Lars' snare drum HAS to go. The ringing coming off of this drum is distracting and turns Metallica's normally clean sound into a muddled mess. Second, the guitars seem to be a bit muted. This is a guitar-heavy band. The sound of distorted guitars should blow you away. Yet it doesn't. This is VERY obvious in the opening of the song St. Anger. What should be a smash to the face is merely a tickle. In short, good songs, badly mixed. Let's just hope this is Metallica's last time with Bob Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This album...It sounds like a bad demo. The guitars are buried in the mix and the drums are to loud. What makes it worse is Lars had the most awful snare drum sound I have ever heard. I can't believe this was even allowed to be released. The sad part is that the music is actually good but the rotten production ruined it for me. Don't waste you money. Don't buy this album. It is not worth it. Metallica are offically dead when it comes to music. The DVD is the best thing. It even sounds better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet.","review":"I have been a Metallica fan since first hearing the song \\"One\\". I am highly dissappointed in this effort.

Listen and decide for yourself, dont take my word for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant love","review":"I know Metallica lost their bass player, but I hadn't heard they lost their lead guitarist too!Just kidding there. St. Anger is stuck in my cd player and it may be a while before anything else gets played. Great riffs and the most straight forward lyrics Hetfield has ever wrote. Metallica has lost half of their fans with every release but make up for it by gaining millions of new fans. This cd should continue the trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Anger","review":"When I first bought St. Anger I didn't think that there was any way that it could be as good as their other albums, but I was wrong.

The first time that I lisened to it I thought it [was bad], but the more I lisen to it, the more I like it.Don't let the other reviews stop you from buying this album it's hard, it's intense, it's long, and it's worth buying if your a true Metallica fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"That annoying snare drum sound kills this album!!!!!","review":"I love Metalica.

I bought St. Anger and have tried to listen to it repatedly, It just doesn't work for me. I cringe everytime I i hear that god awful twing sound when Lars plays a snare beat. I think Lars is a great drummer but I can't take that sound. I wouldn't mind a guitar solo or two but that is not what kills this album. In anticipation of the flak from other reviewers, I am not stuck in the 80's I love allot of new bands and albums. I think Anthrax's new album maybe their best yet.

Yes, I too was excited when I heard this new album was going to be a return to the hard and brutal sound from Metallica of old. However, St. Anger is angry just for the sake of being angry. It is almost as if the boys of Metallica had to prove that they still are bad ... This album is basically eleven tracks that sound exactly the same. The intros are nearly identical for each song. Kirk's technical guitar playing is absent from the album. James' lyrics are mindless and horribly repetitive. Not to mention his vocals are absolutely terrible. In short, if this is the best album Metallica can release after a five year break then the appropriate question should be....Why even bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and worn out.","review":"St. Anger is monotonous and predictable. I was a huge Metallica fan, until Load came out. I bought Load and, like most Metallica fans, was disappointed. I listened to a few sample tracks of Reload and decided to not even buy it. So after the years of disappointment, I was glad to hear that Metallica was steering into a new and heavier direction. It's true, the bass lines and guitars are pretty heavy on this CD. But they are repetitive and unimpressive. Just because it is heavy doesn't mean it is good. But that's not the worst. The lyrics are outright bad, both in their content and delivery. I think Metallica is done. They need to fold up the tent and call it a career. And that doesn't mean they suck overall. The pre-Load stuff is still excellent and serves as a benchmark for the metal genre. But it appears that anything after the black album is just a misguided and futile attempt to regain their previous glory. Sorry to say it, but they are finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooo!","review":"i think all the good soundingness went away with newsted. it sounds like it was recorded in a garage. they need to hang it up. metallica's head is already big enough. still people will buy this [not so good] cd and llove it because it is metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"If This Dosnt Signal Coming of the Appocolypse, Nothing Will","review":"Thats right, this is the worst cd ever.

I bought this CD with great excitement and anticipation only to be let down by lame songs with no melody, no guitar solos, and James' stupid whining lyrics. I've even tried listening to the songs many, many times, thinking they'd grow on me. They did not. Frantic and St. Anger are decent, but the rest of the CD is horrible. I got so upset and irate that Metallica would produce something this [bad] that I almost threw it out my car window. Bottom line...this CD is like nothing Metallica has ever done -- it [is bad]. I'm a big fan and I'm so dissapointed it pisses me off...I can't beleive Metallica had the nerve to produce this CD.

NOT!. There's nothing left of the extraordinary group that was Metallica (until the Black Album). All the false pretenses and new \\"back to the roots\\" pose that Metallica is getting these days, is a sad view of a group of talented musicians that walked the wrong road since \\"Load\\", and to be real, this is worse. I don't know if it's rock bottom, but i guess it must look like it. Total loss of solo guitar work (is Kirk still on the band?), a rude apocalyptic sound ( not because it is aggresive, just the sound of a dying band), terrible lyrics, a ver big disappointment. To save: the vocals i think, James' roar has improved. A record for all those \\"fans\\" that joined the group after the black album. (how are we missing you, Cliff). Hope for a better future"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best, at all","review":"I was looking forward to St Anger since the hype was it was a return to their roots. I'm a big Hetfield fan but the vocals are weak and the lyrics aren't up to standard. Overall the songs lack depth. Is Kirk even playing on it???Lots of bass going on (which wouldn't be a bad thing if it was GOOD bass playing) and drums throughtout the cd but many of the songs sound repetitious with an end result more boring than anything that a fan would associate with Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is barely metallica","review":"While the drums are excellent, there is little else to like about this cd. Apparently the new metallica isn't big on guitar solos, as you won't find any here. By far the worst aspect of the cd is the vocals. The lyrics are laughable (Invisible kid falling through the grid? c'mon guys, what were you thinking?) and strangely enunciated by hetfield. The songs are also overlong and wandering, occasionally so rambling its hard to tell where one song begins and ends. I had originally heard the album was going to bring the guys back to the days of ride the lightning, and having only moderatly enjoyed the load/reload albums i was up for something old school. But this is not ride the lightning. It is loud, and definetly raw, but that is where its similarity with lightning ends. I can only hope that this poor excuse for metallica does not contiue on past this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"The first track started off well. It rocked hard and brought me the anticipation that Metallica had gone back to their roots. Then the vocals came in, which took away the excitement of the song.The majority of the songs start out amazingly aggressive and hard. They build you up and get you pumped, then all of a sudden the excitement drops to a cheesy vocal attempt by Hetfield. I think Hetfield was better off using drugs and alcohol. His performance and musical creativity was a lot better when he was wasted. The drums are amazing, and always have been with Lars behind the drums. The guitar riffs are decent, but are empty in places.I feel that I was cheated with the purchase of this album, and can now fully understand why people would want to download an album off of the internet before they invest their money in music that is not up to par. Very disappointing. Definitely a weak attempt as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"The album that should not be","review":"If you know this album exists chances are you already know how bad it is. Here's the cold hard truth, St. Anger has no high points whatsoever, Metallica has transformed themselves from Metal Masters into your annoying kid brother and his half-witt garage band. Words can't express the disappointment you are about to experience with this album but you really should hear it for yourself. Metallica owes me 75 minutes of my life, and Lars owes me eight bucks for a bottle of asprin. If you want to fill the void Metallica left in your life almost fifteen years ago, check out \\"IN FLAMES\\". Don't bother putting flowers on Metallica's grave, they don't deserve it. Sad but true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica Keeps Kickin A**","review":"This album is definently a new style for Metallica. Its a new hard core driving style. I love it. The cd has been in my cd player for weeks. The only words that can describe this album is kick A**! This album just rocks. Every Metallica fan should own this album. Metallica did just what you would expect, something you wouldnt expect. They completely changed their style. Its such an agressive and emotional type of music. Buy the album, and enjoy more of the great METALLICA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Anger: Metallica has done it again.........","review":"The boys from the Bay have done it again. With their new release St. Anger , Metallica has shown the world that they are still the kings of metal. After 20 plus years together and new bass player Robert Trujillo , they have put out one of their finest performances to date. St. Anger is a complete look at where the band has been and where they're headed. Metallica shows why maturing only makes you better. James Hetfield , having overcome his addiction to alcohol , has once again shown his greatness as a guitar player and front man. St. Anger is riddled with larger than life riffs and true Hetfield styled rhythms. The album contains one scorching number after another. An album that will certainly gain approval of lifelong Metallica fans and also one that will add to the always growing fan base. The album gets an A rating from me! A must have for any real collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an impressive comeback by the greatest metal band","review":"This album, for sure, is different than other 'tallica albums.

Some great, really heavy, melodic songs. This is definately an evolution from their other stuff, but still reminiscent of their signature style. Hetfield sometimes sings outside of his range, but I think this adds to the raw rage on the album. The DVD just adds to the value of the album. It is no frills, just straight footage of rehersals, but still cool to see and hear. You can hear the songs with the new bass player Robert Trujillo adding his touch on the DVD, because he did not play bass on the CD. I think he is a great addition to the band. I have been a Metallica fan since the mid 80's, and this album sounds great to me, so dont let any naysayers claiming to be \\"hardcore fans\\" tell you this isnt up to some unspecified standard, it sets the standard. My fav songs on this disc: Shoot me Again, Sweet Amber, Unnamed Feeling, Invisible Kid...to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen from grace...","review":"To anyone who considers themself a fan of Metallica's music (forget about all of their backstage drama), you are going to be SEVERELY disappointed by this new album. ... Contrary to many other reviews, THERE ARE NO GUITAR SOLOS on this album, mind you, this is a comment based solely on opinion, being that the [material] contained on this album hardly lives up to the abilities of Metallica. And what possessed them to eliminate the one \\"soft\\" song that more often than not proves to be the best demostration of both their musical and vocal skill? The tunes are all boring, repetitive, and there is an overpowering noise generated by the new bassist, who obviously is talented at playing, just doesn't quite belong in Metallica is all. His contribution really doesnt seem to fit in with the classic Metallica style. Jason, i hate you, but damn we need you back. Basically, the only way i'd recommend picking this one up is if you're a collector who owns every other Metallica cd. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL?","review":"WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING? Did the band listen to this before they put it out? The production is horrible and the drums sound like tin cans.\\"Frantic\\" & \\"Some Kind Of Monster\\" are worthy examples of what the mighty 'Tallica are capable of,and new Rager Robert Trujillo (formerly of Suicidal,Infectious Grooves&Ozzy)is hands down one the best bassists in metal today (and it shows on this disk).Question-where's Kirk on this disk?Kirk is one of the strong points of the band,and is sorely under used on this release.The disk is a sonic mess (just listen to the title track for proof),and the guys should have put a little more polish on these raw,unfocused tunes.Anybody looking for a much awaited return to the days of old will be sorely dissapointed.Buy the CD/DVD combo (if at all) for the DVD of the band doing rehearsal versions of the album - for completists only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I thought the CD was very repetitive. I'm a very very big Metallica fan and couldn't believe what I was hearing. It sounds as if they were going towards a harder heavier metal but just couldn't reach it. I'm lost for words. There's some interesting songs in here, but I love their old stuff and wish they'd go back to their roots. If you like Metallica go ahead and buy it. You may or may not like it. But I wasn't impressed. Next CD needs to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Bother","review":"With all the hype about this record's release I thought St. Anger would be a slam dunk. Well slam dunk it in the trash can. I'm one of the few that can appreciate Ride the Lightning AND Load/Reload. However, God Himself couldn't make me even tolerate this CD. Metallica can financially afford mistakes like this CD but it's too bad that they feel they need to play games with themselves and their audience. This record sounds like they intentionally wanted to irritate the listener. This Metallica fan is sadly disappointed. I'm sure you will be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh. My. Dear. Lord.","review":"This is, by a long country mile, the most appalling record I've ever had the misfortune to listen to. Twice, I might add. There are absolutely no redeeming features in this album, it really is that atrocious. The incessant banging on what sounds like trash can lids used as a substitute for real drumming, the horrendously poor production, the infantile lyrics, the total lack of melodies, the unimpressive vocals all combine to make this CD virtually unlistenable. Shocking, to say the very least. I'm not what you'd call a massive or even lifelong fan of Metallica but I was looking forward to this album. A tragic mistake on my part it seems.I regret that I ever spent a dime on this, because knowing what I know now about St. Anger, I wouldn't have touched it with a ten foot bargepole if someone had paid me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five years gone and this is the best they can do!","review":"This album is [garbage]. It has been compared to such classics as Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning. To say that is to trash those albums.

St Anger No Good.","review":"As someone who remembered when Kill em All was brand new, A long time Metallica fan who enjoyed this band since the early days, I have to say, what is the deal with St. Anger? No solos, really distored recordings. Some people will say that this is a new sound to Metallica and that is it great, I bet these are the same people who if Metallica recorded N'Sync songs they would say \\"wow the new sound is great\\".

Carless, just like this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened..........?","review":"Given that I have a max of 1000 words to write this review, I think that there is only one word to sum up the latest outing for a band I regarded as 'awesome' from the first moment I heard them. That word I can't really use here so I'm going to substitute it for the more watershed friendly 'pants' instead. They sound bad. I mean really bad. The start of nearly every song has Lars just crashing on the drums, the lyrics are dire and no real rhythm ever seems to emerge. Normally when I get a new CD, I play it almost to death. I switched this off after one session. I tried again later that day, I guess out of desperation to really want to enjoy it, but still the same opinion. I played it to my mate (long time Metallica fan) and he appreciated me playing it. Luckily for him he's saved a tenner. I couldn't even swap it in Woolworths. As for the DVD - great, we can now watch how badly they hash this album up as well.Even Load was better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extra star for the DVD","review":"First off, I hope other bands follow Metallica's lead and release a cool DVD with the CD for a regular price.My take on the disc:Good-The riffs, the energyBad-The drum sound (yuck!), where the hell is Kirk??, too bad Trujillo did not play bass on the CDOverall: 3 starsThe DVD is the entire album performed live. The drums are not as annoying but Trujillo is playing on it. I find the DVD more enjoyable musically than the CD. I don't even watch it, I just listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica or Not?","review":"Before I even continue, I think one thing should be cleared up first. Rob Trujillo did not play on this album. The majority of this recording was complete before he was officially made a member of the band. Bob Rock (record producer) did the bass for this album.Now....I'm a fan of the older material and I also play the older material so I can say that this album is far from being back to old school. Lars sounds horrible on the drums (maybe it was just the horrible production) and Kirk does not solo. This album sounds more like Linkin Park and Lim Biskit (bands I loathe) than Metallica.With that in mind, I'm glad I only borrowed the cd from a friend and didn't buy it myself. You want bands that stick to their metal roots and don't try to be something they're not, then I recommend the following:Iced EarthBlind GuardianHammerfallSymphony XDream TheaterIron Maiden"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What happend to my favorite aggresive speed metal band!?????

But that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica phones it in....the [horror!!!]","review":"I have been a Metallica fan for many, many years, and have stuck with the excellent changes in style that this wonderfully gifted group has produced over that span of time. This, however, is not a good album. Yes, its fast. Yes, its hard. It also sounds like many hard rock and metal bands from the eighties and nineties that are no longer with us. For a reason. They made crap rock that sounded as if one night in the studio drinking with your buddies is all it takes to hammer out an album. To those of you thinking of buying this album, save your money. Listen to some Ride the Lightning, Justice, Load, etc., and remember those wistful days when Metallica not only rocked, but made the kind of music that has kept them on top for 20 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is awful or /getting their just-desserts..","review":"It only seems fair that these mega-millionaire musicians get such bad reviews after they shut down Napster so us fans couldn't share their music. After this album I'll NEVER want to share a Metallica CD again. Time to retire boys. Take your millions and move to an island so those of us who enjoy good music don't have to deal with you anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven forbid a band do something different","review":"If metallica had produced something similar to ride the lightening or Black, people would be complaining that they hadn't done anything different. I am not a hardcore metallica fan, I would say I am a casual listener to all of their albums. St. Anger didn't appeal to me at first, but the more I listened to it, the more the raw sound appealled to me. I think the melodies, the riffs, and the entire album where a good change of pace and direction, and I look forward to their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the f**k?","review":"This, THIS is what we've waited for? Metallica are a disgrace. If they want to prove how METAL they are, I dare them to take Slayer on tour as an opening band with them. But they won't and you know why? Because the CRAP on this album doesn't measure up. Slayer and their fans will kick Metallica fans ASSES...especially if Slayer does all of Reign in Blood like they have been recently. All the Metallica fans who like this are wimps and I dare them to pick up any of Slayer's records...God Hates Us All is a mean evil record released on Sept 11...now THAT is an example of what metal should be. F**k Metallica...go back to your stupid group therapy...Metallica is DEAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MUSIC JUST GOT HORRID","review":"This doesn't even deserve one star, it makes me sick just to even look at it, no guitar solo's what so ever, just a bland album, there's not one good song on the whole album, back in 1990 i wouldn't had even thought about Metallica being so horrible, i don't think Metallica's even trying anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavier then the Loads","review":"I bought this when it came out and I just listened to it the other day.

Just don't.","review":"I've lived with this album since the day it came out, and have tried repeatedly over the years to like it. You know what? I shouldn't have to try this hard. This album blows. The drums sound like coffee cans. The band needs a bass player to anchor them, and they didn't have one. There isn't one good song on here. Not one. Now that Death Magnetic is out, we can put the nightmare of St. Anger behind us. Hopefully all of these songs will be dropped from the live set list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for comedic value! So bad its good.","review":"\\"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle!\\"\\"You flush it out you flush it out!\\"\\"Frantic tick tick tick tick tock!!!\\"What sense do those lyrics make? I wouldn't even consider them lyrics at all, its just James shouting a bunch of incoherent nonsense into the microphone. By the time this album is over, you'll be rolling on the floor in fits of laughter, laughing at the stupid, stupid lyrics. Just listen as James Hetfield screams \\"I'm already dead shoot me again!!!/I'm already dead shoot me again!!!/I'm already dead shoot me again!!!\\" His attempts to be angry sound forced. You'll laugh your @ss of at that pityfull display of fake anger.This album is hilariously bad, I reccomend it for comedic value. Hearing a 45 year old former alcoholic like James Hetfield screaming angrilly about his emotional issues is one of the most hilariously pathetic things you'll ever hear. Sure the music stinks. But it is still laugh out loud funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sellout? No....","review":"To me, Metallica really comes out strong with this album. All of the tracks have a nice flowing similarity throughout them, and they are taking things in a different approach then that of their other albums. I really do like this album, even if guitar solos are not included. It's still the bad-ass sound of Metallica blasting your ears off your head.But why am I not giving it 5 stars?Lars drumming sounds horrible.He should really go back to his original drumset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally, more \\"trash\\" music from metallica!!","review":"The sound is horrible, the voice of james is a torture, the guitar solos, where are they? (please, leave the lack of solos in the music to Korn). A waste of money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhg... What happened??!!","review":"Metallica is one of my favorite bands but this album is just terrible. The music doesn't take any risks and the lyrics seem like they were put in at the last minute because they are not very thoughtful and repetitive. There is so much for a band like this to say right now and instead they went the route of following most other the metal bands out today, which is down the crap hole. The riffs are unoriginal as well. I think its great if a band goes through changes but I really feel like this band is regressing. If people disagree, first go back and listen to the song Disposable Heroes, a phenomenal antiwar song that is valid today, or how about Master of Puppets, lyrically and musically both these songs are genious. There is no comparison between the old and new Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh.....My....Sweet....Jesus.....","review":"To say that this album is a disgrace is an understatement. This album is so bad it could very possibly be a sign of the apocolypse. These guys lost their way with The Black Album, but this....this is disgusting. Just....Don't buy it.

Bad drums, vocals, rythm, YUK!","review":"I've given this several listens to try to get into it, but I can't. I'm sorry to say, this is one of the worst albums I've listened to...and I have 100's. Lars drums are horrible...the tinny sound, the erratic tempo changes. James lyrics and voice are bad too. Where are the guitar solos? Why can't I hear the bass? Why isn't there ANY rythm or melody?Save your money people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is SO 1980's","review":"This album is horrible. It goes against everything Metallica stood for. Albums before Load were almost orchestrated and there was alot of thought behind how the beats and rythms came together. Even after the Black album there were some redeeming qualities, and the spirit of Metallica was still there. This is utter trash. My brother's garage band sounds better than this! And to the people who say that thrash Metal and old school metal is not for this day and age, go buy some In Flames or Shadows Fall. Try out Trivium. In fact, go to All these bands could whip current Metallica around the block in pure musical talent. In fact, go to www.nuclearblastusa.com and check out some more of the bands on that label. Most of them are not from the states, and that's a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bamboozled","review":"This is the last time I buy a CD without listening to it. Been a fan of Metallica's since And Justice For All. Loved all the early stuff and Black, liked Load, Reload, and even Garage. I hated St. Anger. Hated its psycho babble lyrics. Hated the drumming (I read some other review describing how Lars sounds like he is playing tin cans. He's exactly right. The drums he used have a really annoying tinny sound.)I just saw their Some Kind of Monster on VH1 last night, which chronicled the making of this album and prompted me to write this review. I have the CD another try, but it is truly unlistenable (is that a word?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horribly pathetic! 0 stars","review":"I have been a fan of Metallica since Justice. Their first 4 albums are good thrash metal...but after Cliff Burton died, Metallica died. They suck more than any band in the world now. They should have changed their name when they did that poor mainstream rock \\"Black album\\". This St Anger album is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. It's horrible. I can make farting sounds that are more musical than St Anger. Kirk can't play guitar anymore, he's a sissy. James might as well shoot himself, he doesn't have any talent as a singer(and he never did). Lars is a little whiny b*tch. I don't even play drums and I can play better than him. It sounds like he used trash cans as drums for St Anger. Totally a waste of time and money on this album. Do your self a favor and use your money to blow your nose instead of buying this album. And for my closing statement, METALLICA SUCKS!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Tapdancing Christ","review":"Have you ever wondered what a steming pile of crap sounds like, well this is it. This album is horrible, especially with the garbage can sounding drums, the lyrics stright from Hetfield's AA meetings, this shows how a good band was turned into the worst thing I've heard, this is the biggest disapointment of an album I have ever heard in my entire life, Nu Metal sounds better than this, I urge anybody, even the biggest Metallica fan to not even stare at this cd or the crappiness will make your head explode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica...Heavy and Frantic","review":"Ok, let me start by saying that this cd has gotten some bad reviews. I think that this cd should get alote more credit, this cd shows that Metallica can go back to the more heavier side. \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" are very good albums but are not as raw and hard as \\"St.Anger. Even though solos are not in any of the tracks dont let that foul you..this is NOT nu-metal, not even close. If you like raw, gritty sounding and heavy, you will love this album. Some of the best tracks on the cd are \\"Frantic\\" \\"St. Anger\\" \\"Dirty Window\\" and \\"All Within My Hands\\" dont let some of the things said about this album give you doubts. If you are a big fan of Metallica,like myself, or just discovering them get this cd along with Master of Puppets its freakin great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People change so do bands","review":"The funny thing is everyone expects Metallica to be like they were in the old days. Well guess what? They've changed which means the music changes. You can't judge a band or it's music without looking at what points the members are in their lives. In rock and roll years they're old men. They have kids now and James Hetfield just came out of rehab. You really expect to get another MOP or AJFA? Nope, never will. Get used to it. You ever stop to think that maybe they don't want to make another album like their old stuff? Maybe they want to do different things? Boo hoo if they didn't call you first and ask what kind of record they should make. This is a really metal good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ninth Circle of Hell","review":"There is no word in the English language that can describe how phenomenally terrible this album is...if Dante had written the Inferno in 2003, he would have made Judas, Brutus, and Cassius listen to this album for all of eternity at maximum volume. Supreme torture, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy the Rehab album","review":"Every time a leading member of a band goes into rehab and comes out and does an album, you know it is going to suck. That has to be the only logical explanation for this latest Metallica installment.I am not sure if they were trying to create a buzz or just try something new to be labeled innovative, but they only succeeded in alienating much of their existing fan base and knocking down their legnedary status amongst the HeadBanger greats.It reminds me of Michael Jordans Washington Wizards come back. Should not have happened.I think most would agree that Metallica has done nothing really meaningful in terms of new music since the Black Album.My advice to Metallica, drop Bob Rock, listen to the songs that made you great and go back into the studio and make an album for your fans. I have been a fan since 1984 and continue to be hopeful, but after St. Anger I have my doubts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album?","review":"This is a wonderful CD! The disk itself makes a great coaster for my beer and/or coffee! My dog loves to play catch with the bonus frisbee that Electra Records included for free (oh, wait...you mean that was the DVD?!?) AND...I fixed an uneven table leg with the CD case! Pretty useful item for under $20!!!But in all seriousness, if an unsigned band were to have written this material and submitted it to a label with hopes of getting signed, I'm pretty sure the A+R Dept. would've gotten a good laugh out of it... at best! It's really THAT bad. Metallica is dead....but that's O.K. If the members would simply realize that fact and pursue other areas of musical interest, we'd probably get some pretty good material. Hetfield always has been a great songwriter... and in the future, I think he'll surprise us again...although it probably won't be metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short comment","review":"I'm not going to reiterate the flaws of this album. I'm not a sadist. Hundreds of reviewers have already done that. What I am going to criticize is the inability of the mainstream media to tell the truth when it comes to a bad album like this. Amazon's review, while not glowing, certainly gives no indication of the horror awaiting anyone who listens to this album, and seems to regard St. Anger as a comeback album for Metallica. It's not. Even worse, other websites gave this album the very positive, detailed reviews that should be reserved for music with passion and depth (AllMusic even gave this album 3 1/2 stars!). This is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard, but mainstream outlets won't even acknowledge the overwhelming public opinion here. If you want real music with genuine heart and soul, stick to the underground of rock and metal. That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anguish!!!","review":"This album [is bad]!!! I made numerous attempts at letting it grow on me but to no avail. I can find very few, if any, redeeming qualities to this album. The songs are drawn out, incoherent, the vocals are terrible (what the hell is James doing towards the end of \\"Invisible Kid\\", somebody torturing a cat?), guitar solos are non existent and you can hardly make out what the bass is doing. Say nothing for the tin cans that Lars is banging on. Such a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELLOOOO people it's 2003!","review":"It seems that most of the people that have reviewed this CD are stuck in a time warp. WAKE UP - it is no longer the 80's people, it's 2003! These same people probably still wear acid washed jeans, old faded master of puppets t-shirts, and still drive 80s firebirds/camaros!! This is a band that has evolved, grown up, and moved on with the times. A good band can do that. Who wants to listen to the same old stuff day in and day out??? NOT ME! If that is you then don't waste your money - just stay home and listen to your old Master of Puppets record or tape for the millionth time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tic Tic Tic Tock, Time To Break Up","review":"This is exactly what I expected, Bought it on June 5th day before it came out. WOW! I would rather listen to pop-punk. Now i think thats pushing it but is along these lines. I own every single Metallica album. EVERY ONE. The greatness and the wesuckness I have it all. And this is the worst album of 2003 and 2004 and 2005. I am positive. It is sad that this is the same band that put out the Black Album. They just stopped trying. I still respect them though, Because of their accomplishments so many years ago. The best song is #2 which is kind of annoying because of the repetitiveness of it. This is not real metal . This is an album put out to continue the flow of money as their popularity increases in the mainstream. But to me if a band has a video played on MTV they are bound to suck within the next album. Sorry guys your time is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"MetalliCRAP","review":"This is the first Metallica album I'm ashamed to own. I hadn't heard St. Anger before I purchased it. I was at Sam Goody and saw that there was a new Metallica CD. I won't make that mistake again.I am a huge Metallica fan, but this album is not Metallica quality. St. Anger makes me think that Metallica has forgotten how to rock. ANY OTHER Metallica CD is a much better purchase than this.BE SURE you hear St. Anger before you buy it. I would highly recommend you pick up a different Metallica CD, such as Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning.Metallica is a great band, but St. Anger is a terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God, I payed for this?","review":"All right. St. Anger, the title track is okay during some of the parts, but it's NOT good enough to listen to all 7 1/2 minutes of it! There isn't a single song on here under 5 minutes long. For anyone else who wants to hear this album for Kirk Hammett's guitar skills, save your money. There isn't a single guitar solo to be found on this album. They said Metallica sold out to numetal on this album, and they're wrong: This album made me think numetal might not be so bad (It certainly has to be better than this piece of crap!)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Rock, what have you done to these guys?!!!","review":"I mean, other than making them rich, why are you helping to destroy them forever? Are you some kind of sorcerer, that hypnotized them to make such useless albums? I agree that St. Anger is not commercial at all. Why? It can not be commercial, because the album simply IS NOT AN ALBUM! Maybe to attend a limit date of release, they put together this terrible thing. Why would a producer lead a band (or accept their orders)to go into such a direction? Of course he will get his royalties no matter what crap the band releases (I hear it sold more than one million copies already worldwide. A honest producer, one in real friendship with the guys from a band, would never let them release such crap.Shame on you, Bob Rock. Shame on you, Kirk, for quiting soloing (not that your solos were ever even close to brilliance).

This from a person who listens to Arch Enemy everyday without fail. I don't mind James vocals, I don't mind that there are no guitar solos, I don't mind the song lengths, most of the time I quite enjoy heavy sludge from my speakers throbbing my entire house. I enjoy Shoot Me Again and Frantic, they would be up there with Metallica's best songs, IF the freaking drums didn't ruin it.

If anyone is found playing St. Anger, they should be prosecuted and put on trial. Listening to even one song from this load of crap is harassing. Dont get me wrong, Metallica is one of all time fave bands. I have listened to a lot of crazy, wierd crappy metal and this is one of them. At least they are true to what they believe. Metallica has no direction in this album. They just go off playing dissonant riffs over and over in every song. Its a shame I have enjoyed Britney Spears albums when compared to this one.Highlight: Gives you another reason to hate Lars Ulrich.ps: Lars, if you read this, no matter what you say about St.Anger...it still sucks. I'm madly in anger with you, James, Kirk and Bob Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"God why did I bother....","review":"I finally got Metallica's St. Anger... and I really *hoped* the reviews I read on Amazon and on the Usenet Newsgroups were just overly harsh...They weren't...I mean.. DANG this thing is a turd. The mix and sound are horrible.. The guitars clip constantly and the sound is so oversaturated that even if the material were *good* it would be unlistenable...Note to Lars and James: \\"KILL KILL KILL KILL\\" is NOT a lyric - you dopes!!On a scale of one to five stars I give it a big fat ZERO."},{"rating":"1","title":"heh holy crap","review":"I was never a huge metallica fan to start with.

They must be trying to suck, and the suceeded wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are their glorious days over ?","review":"I have been listening to these guys for all my adult life , I have all their albums , I respect them enough not to download it , I have listened to each song easily more than 1000 times , but Why should we fool ourselves, some people listen to it for 3 months to like it , Dude Don't make yourself to like something that is not good , ITS NOT GOOD STUFF . PERIOD !I still will buy their next album , but they are going down , It started with Black album and is getting worse , Well , nothing lasts for ever...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thing That Should Have Never Been","review":"I am very sad. Very very sad. At first, I thought Metallica was going to return to thier roots and rock harder than ever. Instead, they recorded an album that sounds worse than my 4-track cassette demos that were water damaged. WHAT GIVES?That drum sound is horrid. The snare rings hideously. I can appreciate the tuned down approach but give me a friggin break! Not one guitar solo, Jame's voice sounds so unenthuzed. It's no wonder Jason Newstead bailed from this unit of what was a once great band. I am afraid that they failed miserably in thier attempt to rediscover themselves. This must be the end of Metallic.....uh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst music commercially available","review":"I have been wanting to like Metallica again ever since Load came out. S&M started to bring me back, I thought it showed they hadn't lost their creativity and flair for dramatic, anthemic rock. St. Anger has dashed all hopes, however as it is the worst music ever made commercially available. Forget comparing \\"new Metallica\\" to \\"old Metallica\\" as many people did with Load and Reload. This album doesn't even stand up to anything available today. The lyrics have become even more meaningless, the songs seem randomly arranged and I don't know what Lars has been doing but he wasn't practicing as he has taken a marked turn for the worse (maybe too much litigating). The DVD may be the only thing making this album worth [the money]..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope they didn't do this album on purpose","review":"I think this CD sucked out loud. They didn't spend much time thinking about it because they had a dead line to meet. I think they may have done this album to promote there other albums (since they're other albums are 10x better than this one). Because this album got everyone talking about their old stuff. Either that or they sold out! Metallica's going to hell in a handbasket"},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Bollocks","review":"What happened?Has $ellouticA finally put an end to their miserable career? Has Lar$ decided to hit trashcans instead of an actualy drumkit? And Kirk... what a waste.I saw one little fanboy saying that this is a return to heavy metal.

You know Metallica has a version of this CD with 7 solos and they released this one instead of that one? Really..so since theres no solos, the guitar work is basically crap, the riffs sound all the same to me and are boring, and the drumming...wow. Not only is the drumming just..bad, but you can hear the drumming over everything else, and its very obnoxious actually. The lyrics just suck, and whether you know it, or if your retarded, they ARE sellouts. And im not even talking about the music. The whole shutting down Napster thing? Wow..I mean they cant be sellouts, can they? Are you stupid? Their whole image of being non-corporate just got flushed down the toilet with that. Anyways, this album sucks, as does everything after the black album, but this is the worst CD basically of all time. You know 81 people recommended Britney Spears instead of this? Wow..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Metallica","review":"This must be the worst album yet, with bad production, no solos, a very annoying snare drum, intentional signing out of tune, and of course no inspiration at all. I'm not against using Pro Tools, but not when you don't know how to use it and make the msuic sound choppy, and I don't mean Guitar chops, since none were to be found. It looks like Jason was smart quitting, since he won't have to deal with the backlash. It's basically the same rythem track repeated over and over. There trying to be Nu-Metal, but someone should tell them to get a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst CD Ever Made In The History Of Music","review":"Between them suing their own fans , Becoming MTV Puppets , Touring with the most recent \\"in\\" bands , Newsted quitting , Bob Rock playing bass on the new record , Getting a gorilla to replace Newsted , Hammett not playing leads , Lars playing on trash cans , James singing like a whining idiot , almost all of their fan base old and new bashing this record , every person I know hating them now , being made fun of on South Park , and them releasing a album that has zero production and zero talent, I think it's safe to say that Metallica are finished soon !

Congratulations boy's you are offically the most hated band in America !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica Has Failed.","review":"This album was the final nail in the coffen for the once mighty metal giants. Did Kirk Hammett even play on this record? Give me a break. If you too feel cheated out of you $15, go buy the new Megadeth cd \\"The System Has Failed\\". It will satisfy your metal hunger in a way Metallica chose not to. Dave Mustaine got the last laugh. Period"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Metallica??","review":"I don't know who this band was but it was not Metallica. The singing was terrible, I don't think Kirk was playing the guitar, and the songwriting was just plain horrible. If you like Metallica, from kill them all to the black album, you will hate this CD and want to throw it against the wall. If you liked Load and REload, you might rate it a 2. But album is terrible. There is not one good thing to say about it. It is a shame to think it took them this long to put out [material] like this. Megadeth has passed Metallica bye, by at least putting out albums that have some musical value. I don't know what Metallica was thinking when they heard this CD in the studio and deceided to release this. I would have rather them put out another box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar metallica","review":"I believe Bob Rock ruined Metallica (as well as the death of Cliff Burton). Sure they sound great(produced)but the creativity and attitude are gone, as seen in their latest release. Just because you play fast doesn't mean it's good.Horrible riffs that any other band in their right mind would have left in the jam session and out of the final album, is what comes to mind here. More muted riffs just to hear the great guitar sound but not enough melody to justify a song...and what's up with Lars' snare drum? My god it over powers everything! The echo of the rim shot in every song sounds more like he's playing a can. Never thought it would happen but it's time for Metallica to continue their fight with P2Ps like Napster, have more babies, and start drinking again James cause you guys got no more ideas and it shows. Even RE-LOAD had ONE good song...or was that LOAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the absolute worst album of the year","review":"No joke! The recording quality is disgusting, the songs are horrible, and the vocals are even worse. This is the only CD I have ever DESTROYED! I got it, and crushed it under my foot less then an hour later. I love Metallica, but spare yourself to money and purchase something... anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helen Keller would hate this album","review":"First let me start by saying that I'm a huge Metallica fan. I've got all their CDs as well as their DVDs. I like the pre-Black Album stuff as well as the Load & Reload CDs (which were poo-poo'd by many old/loyal fans.) However, this long awaited St. Anger CD is horrible. There's just no other way to put it. It sounds awful. Lars' drums sound like they were purchased at Wal-Mart. It sounds like they mic'd the drums with a $2 dollar microphone inside a tin can. The bass line plays the exact same notes as the guitar line in EVERY SONG. Plus, the lyrics are just silly. \\"My lifestyle determines my death style\\" ?? Come on guys.I give Bob Rock, the producer, a gigantic F minus and Metallica a D minus for this piece of junk.The funny thing is, they'll probably blame the low sales on Napster-like file sharing programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ..happened here?","review":"I wanted to like this record but I just can't. The production is horrible, the lyrics are all [bad] twelve stepper stuff and the arrangements while fast and complex feel forced together without any real cohesion.

This album is the biggest rubbish ever!First, there is no solo's and what happened to James Hetfeild his voice on Frantic's verse makes me laugh.St. Anger is a fair track but the rest of it is rubbish.The reason is because when metallica where making this they wernt getting along you will know what i mean when there movie Some Kind Of Monster comes out And just to make it better they give u a bonus DVD! Oh i am so excited! PLEASE PLEASE Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worthy of one star","review":"This CD is unlistenable. I bought this with a positive attitude, but once I heard the drums, I pretty much needed to get kleenex for my ears because they started to bleed. I mean...there's bad music, and there's music that is painful to listen to. This is the latter. People can say \\"well there are some cool parts\\" to this CD all they want, but when it's buried in 75 minutes of pure cacophony noise, I want no part in it.I can't believe producers can even give this CD a green light, much less the band. Everyone knows this CD is one of the worst listens ever made, but I just had to give my opinion too. Metallica used to be one of those bands that I would ALWAYS buy their new stuff, because I had so much faith in them...not anymore. I'm staying far far away from this and all other releases. In fact, their old stuff is so overplayed, I don't even listen to that anymore either. So Metallica is basically a has been."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Angry for spending money on this garbage!","review":"If it wasn't Metallica recording this, nobody would have bought it and it would have never been played.

Listen to St. Anger once and it'll change your mind pretty damn fast. The sound of the drums are so different now you couldn't even recognize if it was Lars playing or not. Stop feeding these greedy bastards your money, because this album isn't worth the sh*t off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"I burned the CD from a friend. I haven't listened to Metallica much of Metallica, just a couple of their old ones and the black album, so I didn't know what to expect from this CD. Geez it sounds horrible. It's probably the worst CD in my collection.That's all I can say about it, unfortunately; just \\"horrible.\\" IF you're new to Metallica try buying one of their \\"older\\" ones (i.e. the ones before the black album) instead of this one. Or heck, if you have an open mind the black album is terrific too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"METALLICA AT IT'S VERY BEST!!!\\"","review":"Yeah, it's a shame, isn't it? ANd by the way, St. ANger has to be one of the nerdiest CD titles in history-- \\"I am going to go pray to St. ANger now, cuz I'm REAAAAALY angry!\\" The anger seems feigned, but maybe Metallica is angry that it's music seems to fall short of what defines music. This stuff is worthy of someone who would pray to a St. Anger in hopes of writing a new CD. There is no St. ANger!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Metallica went down, they use to be so well back in the days. Why?1. They are known as one of the best metal bands.2. They made headbanging popular and a sport to many headbangers.3. They had well written lyrics, whenever you were mad you use to be able to blast Metallica and get rid of all the anger inside of us.4. Metallica was never on MTV back in the day. Now they just are and its not so well written.

I get the sense from the cover art and from the thrashey sound that this is an attempt to return to Metallica's roots. I don't think they succeeded, but it will be interesting to see where they take it.That said, buying this CD will give you access to about 18 128KBps MP3s from live shows over the years.

This incredible flaw, alone, killed half of the quality this album could have..."},{"rating":"2","title":"R U Angry?","review":"If you are you should love this album. You can feel the anger when you listen to it. I think that's what they intended. I love guitar solos and their old stuff as much as any devoted Metallica fan. However this album, after listening to it many times has really grown on me especially Invisable Kid, Sweet Amber and The Unnamed Feeling. It's remained in my car's cd player for over a month. If you wanna 'bang your head' this is the album to do it to. It rocks and rocks hard. I will admit however that none of my friends or relatives share my opinion. If I want my wife or friends to go away I just pop in St Anger. Obviously not everyone is going to like this type of hard rock. Due to the fact that I love guitar solos so much I withheld one star in my four star rating. Come on Metallica you fell just short of a perfect album. (Just my opinion :-) P.S. If you want awesome guitar solos buy Fate's Warning \\"No Exit\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a rest people!!","review":"I have 8 Metallica CD's and they have been my favorite band since the 3rd grade. I love their first 4 albums and I love their older sound instead of the newer and rather strange sound on Load and Re-Load, etc. Metallica wanted to release a new CD to take them off the Load/Re-Load path and to return to the old garage days like Kill 'EM All. Well, the results were bad, but so what? At least they gave a shot at trying to produce a CD like their old masterpieces. They haven't been producing the Master of Puppets quality metal since the 80's. You can't expect them to suddenly change back to the exact old sound they had with the release of one album. I am looking forward to their next CD because this one is like a warm up CD for them so they can perfect their sound and return to the days of Ride the Lightning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just do not like it","review":"Metallica can put out whatever music they want. They aren't our entertainers, they don't HAVE to provide us with more music, but they do. If they put it out, Metallica must feel good about it. In my own opinion, I do not like this CD. I am trying to be realistic instead of just coming out and saying \\"METALLICA SUCK BLAH BLAH BLAH\\"You probably want to stay away from this. I suggest anything by Puddle of Mudd, Deftones or Nirvana."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate drums!","review":"Whenever I hear the drums on this I bash my head into the wall until I lose consciousness! It's happened several times! gaaaah! I would come up with a hilarious pun of their name but I can't think of one! Metallica has been stinking ever since -INSERT ANY ALBUM- and I for one am fed up with it even though i'm one of their hardcore fans! Also: Where's Kirk? I looked and looked, but could not see him! He could be playing on this, but I've never heard any metal where two guitars play at the same time, so I wouldn't be able to tell! I was going to complain about the production but then it got better after I removed wax in my ears! Oh wait- I thought of one: more like metallicBUH! hee hee hee! So in conclusion, gaaaah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT??????","review":"Sorry guys,but this is no good.The crunch and grind has been stripped.Not metal.

Do not buy this unless you like listening to repetitive garbage that includes: James's worse vocals...ever, a drum kit that sounds like it was made from trash cans and lids, absolutely ZERO (0) guitar solos, mindblowingly lame and simple lyrics (thanks Lars), and songs that sound like the track is skipping, I mean that the riffs and lyrics repeat so much that it sounds as if the tracks are looped or skipping. So yeah, this is pretty bad by my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"2econd time around","review":"Forgive me people for writing (off) another review. I pre-ordered this cd from Amazon on May 14 in 2003 for my birthday. What made me purchase it was because one of the psycho reviewers who hears the music before we do, said that the cd has a hint and splash of Meshuggah. Boy, was I suckered! This is trash, like what Lars is making noise on. Phewy! Last piece of decent music was Master of Puppets (Rest in peace, Cliff-if he could, when hears what his former band is playing).

TRYING TOO HARD","review":"I'm sorry, but after hearing their single from this album, I must say Metallica is dead. Personally, I thought they were dead after the whole napster thing but once again, bad songwriting and horrible mixing puts this group at least six feet under. I understand the 'Evolve to Survive' theory but in my humble opinion, if you're gonna create a new sound, it should be better than the previous.

After listening to Metallica, my first experience being Master of Puppets, then Ride the Lightning, I got heavily into listening to them everyday, even going as far to playing their songs on guitar. To sum it up, Metallica was the soundtrack to my youth. WHAT HAPPENED? This is nowhere near their earlier work. Where's Kirk hammering out killer licks? Where's the brutal, poetic lyrics? There are none of that on this album. I kinda scoffed at Load and Reload, but after listening to this CD, those sound better. Metallica should really hang up their guitars and call it quits. Maybe go on tour with Engelbert Humperdink or Liza Minelli impersonators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbing ...!!","review":"...let me just say that I'd rather listen to a Faith Hill CD (at least hers have some solos and drum kit not purchased at Kmart and she's cute!).

It's ...like this that made me switch from the heavy metal to progressive metal (Dream Theater or Symphony X would never disappoint like this)...support them if you want to hear real & talented playing.Let me close by saying that I have purchased my LAST Metallica ever (even if an old one gets broken I will not put any more cash into what has become such a waste of a band)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst CD of the year.","review":"This CD is absolutely terrible. It is unlike anything Metallica has ever released. Back to their roots? Give me a break. Read the other reviews. It really does sound like Lars is pounding on buckets and garbage cans. James really does sound like a dying cat. The lyrics are stupid and repetitive. I still haven't figured out what Kirk was doing while they were recording. . . he sure wasn't playing any solos. In addition to all of this they intentionally reduced the quality of the recording. Even on a decent stereo it sounds like a mono recording played over AM radio.

It's a shame because after the Black Album each album afterwards has gotten progressively worse. This album is a new low.

Here is a small sample: FRANTIC, TICK, TICK,TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK TOCK.

It sickens me that some posers like him who think they are cool get St. Anger and then start walkin around sayin they are the biggest Metallica fans and stuff. Dont even try to pull that shiz-nit.

I'm a die-hard Metallica fan and have been since their early days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. They've definitely picked up the speed again which is a sign of their original roots and what made them one of the premier metal bands in the world. The music does take some getting used to, and it will surely grow on you as you listen. Don't expect old school Metallica, however the new sound is quite unique. More Hammett riffs and solos would have been nice as well as a few hooks here and there, but hey, this is Metallica and they can't be touched. Check out the included DVD. This was phenomenal to watch them record the entire album in the studio, in order of the songs on the CD. Great buy, but I just can't find it in me to give 5 stars.

From the obnoxious drum sound to the sloppy and grating guitar tone, this album is not worth the money or the time.

This is not a real Metallica album. It can't be, and I'm not overexaggerating here. I bet, what this recording is, is a bunch of pre-Kill 'Em All garage recordings that have been (for some reason) released on a new LP. This reminds me of a bunch of kids just messing around. The quality of the music, the effort, the talent? It's all very low and poor. The singles are good (they stand out at least), don't get me wrong. \\"St. Anger\\" the song and video are wicked, and so is \\"Frantic\\" and a couple other songs.... but the rest is very long, boring, talentless and just Not Metallica. The DVD is great, actually. But only because you can see that the band is having a good time, and they're very much in sync, and it's great to watch them jam. But um... nice try Metallica - please work harder next time around, alright? I know it's probably been a long 20 years but Come On!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst metallica album ever!","review":"this album is the worst.....sounds like lars is playing the bongos in the back ground in every song. If they go back to the old style like they did in this cd, where is kirks solo? what a blow to metallica with this cd, only song worth listening to is st.anger and the bongo sound in lars drums just drive you crazy though this entire cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why!?!?","review":"Ok, I would like to start out by saying that until the fifth of June I was an advocate of Metallica. St. Anger was not Metallica, and frankly made my respect for the band diminish greatly. I still have much respect for the band, but this album was wretched. If any of the band members read this I would like to say,\\"Everything from Black to Re-load was what made Metallica different from Megadeth and any other trash metal band. Please go back to the studio and redeem yourselves.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Awful...","review":"A better title for this album would be, \\"St. Awful,\\" or \\"St. Average\\" at best. Metallica attempts to sound like so many of the bands that they are currently on tour with and the ones that populate the airwaves right now. While it might be trendy to do this and sound more current, the album is just dreadful. It's eerily reminiscent of when the 80's Hair Bands attempted to sound like Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, you name it. If they stick with their roots, the fans will be happier in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"i dont know why, but it [is bad] the first listen. but it is great the second on.buy it, its more than worth it, i mean it comes with an 80 minute dvd.i only found 2 problems with this cd, one is there are no guitar solos, the other is the drums. not the drumming, the drum set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dosen't cut it","review":"You know, if I were to be your advisor, I would say delete that.

The most offensive and glarringly obvious defect is the HORRIBLE sounding drums!!! What were they thinking? That in and of itself makes the whole album sound the same and totally one dimensional. The production is also quite dry and the overall sound is quite sterile. I don't know if anyone knows this but lead guitarists are not extinct (indangered maybe) and with their tenure I think some solos would not drastically harm album sales. I tried to like it but it is one of the most grating annoying unlistenable albums I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars, actually","review":"Haha, it's very funny that the most recent 5 reviews of this album are all 1 star. They ain't lying folks!If you went to wal-mart and bought a drum kit and told your 6 year old son to play them, that's approximately what this album's beat sound like. This is just stupid songwriting. There is nothing creative in this at all, it's just stupid extremely down-tuned non melodically interesting riffs. The lyrics are some of the cheesiest and repetitive ever, and the there are not any guitar solos.You would swear that this album was done by some immature nu metal band, but no, this effort was by the same people who brought up Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning.Cliff is rolling over in his grave right now, someone tell these old has beens to stop before they hurt themselves.DO NOT under any circumstances by this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely large disappointment","review":"The snare sound that Lars uses, the lack of any really memorable riffs, the lack of flow to the songs, the \\"Now with more juvenile lyrics!\\" feature, and the random thrashing that just sounds like a pile of garbage basically make me not want to listen to St. Anger, ever. I own every previous Metallica CD and they're one of my favorite bands. I have honestly listened to the songs on this album over and over and they just never stop sounding like garbage. I don't recommend this album to anyone. Listening to this just makes me wish Metallica still took the amount of time to craft their songs that they did in their first four albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give this 0 stars?","review":"gimme a break... i love metallica to the death every one of their cd's even load and reload were better than most crap that comes out nowadays but st.anger is a joke..where did kirk's amazing solos go? james's brilliant voice? and the drums?

James' voice no more rings in your head,Kirk, he nearly don't play any solos in this album. There are some riffs that are not bad but the thing is that they are victims of this new generation metal and rock and this album [is bad]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the guitar solos???","review":"Horrible lyrics...No guitar solos???...Rapping? What happened to Metallica? I'm not expecting the old Metallica but at least they should write some decent music. The vocals sound terrible! And what the hell is Lars using as a snare? an empty can??

I duno but this just sucks, plain and simple. Metallica has lost every bit of integrity with this piece of trash. You've heard of thrash metal, but this is TRASH metal. I doubt anyone has actually listened to the entire cd all the way through, yes it's that bad believe me. They actually get worse with each cd they release, actually, the only good metallica cd is the black album. No sane person can enjoy this cd, it's that bad. Im glad I decided to download the songs first otherwise I might have actually purchased this tasteless cd. If it's nu-metal you want check out korn's self titled album it beats the hell outta this. Metallica, this cd is a joke it's almost like metallica is mocking their fans by subjecting them to this. This is an insult to their fans and to metallica's own name. This cd isn't metal, it isn't even anything, just crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENTER TRASHCAN","review":"Sharpen the edges of this disk as sharp as you can get it with out breaking the CD.

I agree with most points that MetallicA's previous albums before the days of Load and Re-Load are awesome pieces in music history. Something went wrong with St. Anger when they decided to go back to their roots. The only two songs worth mentioning in this album is FRANTIC and ST. ANGER. Myself (and various others) just couldnt stand listening to the other tracks. The clang-clang-clang drums thing really went on my last and only nerves. The clangs was cool in ST. ANGER but when they repeat the whole thing in the later songs, it just gets to much. The bonus DVD and the access to the Metallica Vault website didnt do much either.This CD is just for VERY addictive MetallicA fans (even they may find the album dissapointing). This is just below the average, something went terrible wrong..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word says it all...","review":"Horrible!Save your money..

Being musically talented, it sounds as though Metallica is trying to do something they cant quite get right..turn punk. This album is work that Metallica has to be proud of, but myself as a fan has heard better.

I guess we all saw it coming though, since every Metallica fan in the world went out and bought this CD right away, regardless of what it sounded like. This perfectly demonstrates how money hungry Metallica really is - they figure they're so rich and popular, that they could release possibly the worst album ever and it'll still sell millions and millions.... and it worked. I don't have anything else to add to this review that hasn't been said already in the previous 2,000 reviews, but lets just say that I agree with every single negative comment that has been said in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"st trash","review":"it sounds like in lars' kitchen !!!kirk is too handicapped to do a single f**king solo !!james is not an opera singerwho did the bass? wow only good thing (1 star)this sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"just wanna say this still sucks","review":"I wrote a review before saying how much this album reeks of horse manuer.ANYBODY WHO GIVES THIS PIECE OF JUNK ANYTHING MORE THAN 1 STAR SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL.I don't even suggest buying or listening to metallicas' older stuff,this is coming from someone who use to love this band.Instead check out some real heavy metal from MANOWAR,BLACK SABBATH,& IRON MAIDEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree!!","review":"I too am a Metallica fan since Master of Puppets...no album has touched me the same way since.....And I have to agree, this is the worst by far....okay okay so load and reload werent great....but they were both better than this..Even they had guitar solos!!!!!..remember the last few minutes of bleeding me???..One of the main reasons I liked Metallica in the first place!!!..think of the solos in orion....and it wasnt always the speed for me either....think Fade to Black or Leper Messiah....Those were great songs and they werent the fastest.....The chills I got (and still get) from \\"thing that should not be\\"....these are thing that made Metallica one of my favorite bands....I was driving home today and realized that I would rather listen to the white stripes cd than this!!!! at least there is real guitar presence on it, and its just one guy and a girl on drums....sheesh....just my rant...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I like Metalicca, everyone who doesn't like it seems to have some of thier life invested in the band, wierd but whatever works for you.I liked the songs, most were very repediative but that didn't bother me much. I liked the sound, I've always like the sound of metalicca and if you like there old stuff you'll most likely, like this CD. Most reviewers say the like to old but hate the new but it mostly sounds the same, so I can't see how they like one or the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason, Come Home!","review":"I really want to like this disc. I have listened to it 4 times. Something is missing. I am sure it is Jason. As noted on other reviews this disc seems disjointed and the drums sound awful. James sounds off too. I no longer want to see Metallica this summer if I have to sit through this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this album a major disappointment. The production quality is poor and I found the songs boring (who'd have thought?). I think this album is going to be retired to my CD rack never to return to my player. I've got plenty of older Metallica albums I'd rather listen to instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica's best album since Garage, Inc.","review":"A band that has completely lost compass (the profit remaining its only compass) puts out again an album that copies the current trend - and does it poorly. This should not be surprising from the guys who started as copies (of Diamond Head and Mercyful Fate). Unfortunately, today, as forty year olds, they are copying nu metal kids who can't play guitar. People keep arguing if \\"St. Anger\\" is really a return to \\"Kill em All\\" or not. Of course it is not. How can they return to \\"Kill em All\\" if the only gifted member they had in writing that album has been out of the band for 20 years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew drums could go out of tune?","review":"Who knew drums could go out of tune? I think that sums up the CD for me. The drums sound awful. Otherwise, the songs sound ok, the riffs are great, until the vocals start. The songs keep getting interupted by the drum's off-key \\"ting\\" and the inane lyrics. I mean come on, Hetfield, we're not expecting Shakespeare, but, \\"...\\" or, \\"I'm madly in anger with you...\\"?Bah."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 'Tallica boys dupe their fans yet again!!!","review":"I bought this album expecting a return to the metal that inspired me to pick up a guitar. I was looking foward to the beautifully crafted songs and musicianship combined with metal brutallity that made Ride and Master 2 of the 10 greatest albums of all time. OH YEAH, AND I WAS LOOKING FOWARD TO MAYBE A GUITAR SOLO HERE OR THERE.Metallicoin obviously spent the bare minimal money on production here. IT SOUNDS LIKE A DEMO. James' voice and Lars' snare obviously haven't gone through production. Kirk obviously didn't even show up. I could make this album in my basement.MAKING A SONG 8 MINUTES DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IF IT HAS NO SONG STRUCTURE. I DON'T CARE IF ST. ANGER ROUND YOUR NECK NEVER GETS RESPECT IF I HERE IT 8 MINUTES IN A ROW.And I repeat, there IS NOT ONE GUITAR SOLO ON THE ALBUM.In conclusion, DOWNLOAD this album just to prove to yourself that the boys aren't fighting fire with fire anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Metallica","review":"I never thought I would say this about a Metallica CD but this CD is terrible. I have no idea what they are trying to accomplish. Lars' drum kit sounds like he made it out of garbage cans and the bass and lead sound like their playing behind plexiglass. As far as the lyrics, James is just all over the place and he just doesn't seem to know when he wants to end the songs...every one of them is like this. There just is no continuity in any of the songs, they go from loud and hard to soft and mellow in a blink of an eye and then back again. I'm curious to see how they play live because without music in front of them to follow I don't know how they are going to be able to play a song all the way thru the way it is written. I never thought losing Jason would cause such disarray. Sorry Metallica. I haven't given up on you, just on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica disappoints yet again!","review":"I don't know about you, but this is a note to Lars. I know that you are the epitome of the resistance against the sharing of mp3s, but that very act saved me the money I would have spent on this piece of crap. I think everyone who gave this a true review agreed with me on the fact that James' voice sucks, the drums may be fast at times, but that [*] snare annoys the hell out of me. At least one guitar solo would have been nice. I could write better lyrics to match this music in my sleep. I'm very disappointed with Metallica and wish they could actually spend the time, energy, and money to created some real music, with some meaningful lyrics, and tight, professional production. This is a slap in the face to their fans, who have been with them for years, hoping and waiting for something decent to come out of the Metallica camp (since the Justice album). Don't waste your money, just download it, listen, and delete. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst metallica album ever","review":"wow if you're a metallica fan someone buy hetfield or whichever one of them drinks a bottle of JD and go back to make some older records. this makes reload and load look like masterpieces. those six people who recommended britney spears album before this have a point. rue the day metallica wants to become slipknot. i only have it 2 stars because it carries the metallica name."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD in a Time of Need","review":"Even though I've loved everything Metallica has done, this album is a major high point. Lars sounds incredible, I haven't heard such great drumming in a while. James sings, screams and makes this album that much better. Kirk has awsome guitar riffs in here (as always) although the one dissapointment on this cd is his lack of solos. I've always loved Kirks solos, but even though they are absent, the album still blew me away. It is much heavier than (re)load and it is more rythem based. Bob Rock does a pretty good job on the cd too. Robert Trujilio (the new basist) did not record on the cd, he is supposed to be awsome as well. My favorite tracks after the first few listens are definitly St. Anger, Frantic, and Dirty Window. There is not one throw away track though on this album, and it is definitly a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Metallica to retire.","review":"I would like to say that I used to be a huge Metallica fan. Kea, Rtl, MoP, AJfA were amazing albums. Even the black album had it's moments. I was hoping that this record would return the band to it former glory (for me anyway). I was wrong. The album sounds like a demo and the engineering is horrible. Also, I dont know what Lars was trying to do with his drumming. There is an effect on the snare drum that is not only annoying, but down right distracting. They lyrics and choruses are also sub par. However, the guitars on this album are great. Very kill em all , old school metal sounding. Buttom line is that it is time for Metallica to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is Metallica???","review":"I have been a fan of Metallica for about 15 years now. I have not been too excited about their last few projects (since the 'black' album) but have still purchased their cds. There have been enough good songs to make the purchases justifiable.St. Anger spits in the face of their fans. It sounds thrown together like some newbie garage band that hasn't learned how to record, mix, or sing. St. Anger is filled with sloppy production and thoughtless lyrics...Perhaps this is revenge for Napster, they have released an album that is not even worth downloading. TIME TO RETIRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate tiltes","review":"in the best 'Comic Book Guy' (Simpson's here) voice you can muster...'worst Metallica album ever.'they have had some decent albums in the past few years (well, not since the black album), but you still have to go back to '86 for anything worthy of the name. i have listened to this album 3 times and it gets worse every time i put the headphones on. the sound is great, as is normal with Bob, but there is really nothing else to say about this album that is positive. well, aside from the pushead art that is. if your roots of metallica are deep, then don't waste your money. sorry folks.peace,ts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely horrible, but not good by any standards","review":"OK, for those of you who always complain about Metallica selling out, chill out! I really don't care about them making music videos for MTV as long as the music is good. The only ok tracks, though, are Frantic, St. Anger, Some Kind of Monster, Dirty Windows, and Shoot Me Again.But still, if a good group sells out but still makes good music, cut them some slack. Making bad music and selling out aren't the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing...","review":"although some of the songs like Frantic and Invisible Kid were good, i was extremely disappointed with Metallica. This is definatly one if not THE WORST Metallica album. For new Metallica fans, I suggest their old albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're gone...","review":"Well,I must admit I don't buy a metallica album since \\"load\\" was out.The black album was not a bad one,yeah it was more commercial but it contained some good riffs and ideas.It's hard to believe this is the band that wrote Master of puppets.They have never been great musicians but they knew how to write a good song and they had great ideas.Now st.anger it's out...I was interested in this one because of the voices talking about a return to violent and agressive riffing.I've listened to it yesterday.(A friend of mine had the bad idea to get it...)I have no words to spend...The songs are awful and the production goes the same way.James sings in unbelievable way(in the negative sense)and there's a giant lack of ideas.8-9 minutes songs without sense..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica, ST. Anger","review":"Without a doubt, this cd makes a better frisbee, than a music cd!Extremely weak production, and ... poor songs.I have followed Metallica thru the years with a sort of expectant urgency that they may wear out their creativity, before I get too old to listen to them. They finally have. An overlong bunch of repetitive , poorly produced, and just plain lousy songs, have pushed me over the edge....!Released it early out of fear somebody may hear it, not pirate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good, but is it Metallica?","review":"I like this album a lot. Its hard and fast. Much crunchier than they have been before and the speed on some songs is similar to the old days. The songs are crafted to blow you away, unfortunatly James' vocals are too weak on most of the songs. It just doesn't fit. In some respects it is a cross between Pantera and Corrosion of Conformity and local Bronx metal bands such as Irate, musically. This is what makes this album! If you expect old Metallica well you should have realized after that horrible Reload album that they will never make that same kind of music again. So pretend its not Metallica and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"If you are a fan of Metallica as the blistering metal kings, this album is none of that. It seems like they tried to make it harder and faster than some of their latest garbage, but Hetfield's lyrics don't seem to match the music, there are no fingers bleeding guitar solos by Hammet, no neck snapping rhythm guitar as in their first four or even five albums. It is almost like they were all playing in seperate rooms and then mixed together. The drums sound cool at first, but even that gets boring. Although I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt as I really like Metallica, this album is a waste of money, even with a free dvd. Who wants to watch a free dvd of lame songs? It's almost like Metallica died after the sellout album and now their uninspired clones are making the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice try, horrible outcome","review":"I am a longtime fan, and respect that Metallica was trying to do: go for a raw, emotional, hard album that has a garage feel to it. But they made the mistake of recording this album in a fashion that makes it sound like they stuck one microphone in the middle of a room and just played. I think Bob Rock spent too much time playing bass on this album and too little paying attention to producing and watching out for the quality as he usually does. Eveyone I know has wished they had not bought this CD. I have tried to let it grow on me, but at the end of the day, there is not a song on there that really pulls me back in. too bad, I really was looking forward to this. They still were great in concert though."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Honest Review","review":"I have been a Metallica fan since their first album and I can honestly say this is the worst album they have ever released. A lot of Metallica fans are going to say this is brilliant but this is merely due to the fact that they can't accept Metallica bringing out such a poor quality recording. The drumming sounds like he is hitting a garbage can randomly. There is some catchy guitar riffs but not one solo. The lyrics are absolutely atrocious. There is no excuse for this uncomprehensible babbling. Overall I would not recommend this album for the above reasons. Buy any other Metallica album because everthing else has a high standard of music unlike St. Anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I just bought this album today being a big Metallica fan and I'm very disappointed. The upside about this album is they're trying to be much heavier and using alot of style instead of being complicated. But, everything else went to the toilet. The quality sounds like they hooked up a tape deck in the garage and just started jamming. All the music as a whole seems unequal and unbalanced. Also, James Hetfield lost his flare in lyric writing and just repeats himself like the Police used to. In my opinion, not even hard core Metallica fans would enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 6 years it still stinks.","review":"I borrowed this c.d. from a friend and went back and listened to it again after all these years. I tried to get into it and it still blows. If you think this is the best Metallica ever then good for you. I personally will stick to anything other than this pile of crap. And before you say that I'm one of those that wants the same c.d. every new release, that's bull. Load and Reload were different and I don't hate them. I'm all for change but this just sounds like Metallica trying to be another group. If they changed the weird drum sound and put in some guitar yes it would sound better. The vocals sound like James Hetfield but the music????? No way no how."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album of the Century....","review":"damn, id rather listen to lindsay lohan, ashlee simpson, or the new backstreet boys album than this crap. and thats saying alot, trust me. every single song on here is god awful. i wouldnt even wish this kind of music listeing on my worst enemy. everything about this album is poor. the production, mixing, instruments, vocals, etc. everything!! i cant even imagine how the metallica we all know and love who gave us the 1991 album with all their classics, enter sandman, master of puppets, nothing else matters, etc thought to put this out. how? how? . how did they go from that masterpiece to this trashpiece. this album will be remembered alright. it will be remembered as the biggest atrocity to the metal if not music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Metal CD.","review":"This review site has turned into a 'Metallica-Bashing' ground.

This isn't the mighty Metallica, is it? It was. Where were the velvet pants all \\"older\\" rock bands must start wearing?!? Where was the dopey power ballad? I must be honest, I was getting worried about the boys. I'm a huge Metallica fan and Load and Reload were very disappointing to say the least. This record however appears to be written by a band that isn't seeking the \\"casual\\" fan... you know that pencil-neck you work with. No, he's gonna hate this record!! Yes, I said record. If you don't call recordings records then you'll hate this album as well!! It's messy, it's dirty, it's chunky it's not perfect but mearly a step in the right direction for Metallica!!Not alot of \\"singles\\" on this album, it rather must be listen to from front to back; to really \\"get it\\"!!!

After all it is Metallica!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It NOW","review":"This new stuff I will agree is alittle \\"weird\\", but no group can be sucessful putting out the same stuff. The online music you can download from their web sight is worth the price alone, but also throw in new GOOD stuff (finally!!) and a bonus DVD for less than the average price of just a music CD alone is awesome.Plus, while you listen to this, you'll start having memories about people and places that Metallica had something to do with. Such as concerts or other times you have waited until mid night to grab the new copies. I have moved alot in my life so that was a nice added bonus that only these guys are able to do. BUY IT, for the price you can not get any better offer than this one!!! Oh ya, this is no LOAD or RELOAD, even though some of those songs were good. Just about as good as Master of Puppets, but better in some ways.

Was the recording tested anywhere outside the studio walls before final mix down?

The new sound coming out from Lar's \\"green monster\\" is terrible, and Jame's lyrics are inane. I couldn't perceive Hammet's overwhelming guitar solos, perhaps they are now gone after the waves he has been surfing, and you can really feel Jason Newstead's absence in the band.

Only God knows...Saint Anger sounds rather cool when it starts out, namely, the drums. But then it all falls apart, and quickly too...like as soon as Hetfield opens his mouth. I'd say for being as old as these men are, they sound as immature as ever.Metallica was never very lyrically creative; something was always missing. But Metallica was once filled with some pleasant sounding sound-like when I was 10 years old. Metallica should have officially died long ago without making a mockery of the band. Holden Caufield would despise the members' phony attempts to survive their images. Metallica no longer sounds nice nor angry (although they should be--with themselves), and they've never had much to say...

That said, the 8 minute long songs are not my thing at all with this band.The new CD seems to have taken the tempo and angst of the early work and combined it with the drawn out length of the more recent CDs, with the poor production quality of the \\"Garage days\\" EPs. Metallica always used to say how much Diamond Head and The Misfits influenced their sound - and here it sounds very much like \\"Earth A.D.\\" era Misfits, only with the songs being way too long. I don't hate this CD, but I can't stop thinking that it just sounds unfinished when I listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metalliview","review":"...I've only heardone song(St.Anger), but the song I heard was enough to make mewant to hurl. It sounds nothing like the Metallica I know. According to heresay, they were supposed to be getting back to their \\"roots\\" of old with this album. If anything, they've actually taken a step backwards instead of forward. I'd listen to Load or Reload anyday before I'd give this new \\"music\\" the time of day. The only reason I'll buy it is to see how the other songs sound(hopefully better that St. Anger). I guess the four horsemen have finally put their saddles up for good. Ah, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD idea alone merits 5 stars ....","review":"I don't much care for Metallica anymore. The band seems to produce similar stuff after awhile. But I'm writing this review to say that there does seem to be one band out there that get's it. Yes, Metallica have understood what makes those pesky downloaders by music. First make a good album. Second -- if the album IS or ISN'T good at least put a lot of extras on it. Things that aren't so easily downloaded and will offer the buyer something outside of the regular songs in case the music isn't up to par. Everyone wins out in such a case. Smart idea Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"O LORD","review":"This is so awesome. I would have to say that it is in my top 3 Metallica cds.

I'd just like to say there are about 3 good songs on the record. If the whole record was up to the standard of 'frantic' it would be a wicked album but since the rest of the songs are mediocre it isn't. I acknowledge 80s Metallica was ten times better than this but i think giving this album 1 star and calling it the worst album of all time is a bit exaggerated. And the production isn't bad, other people who listen to bands like Kyuss will agree with me on this, its just most of the songs don't have good riffs or lyrics basically, but its just mediocre, not \\"terrible.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is over (sigh)","review":"This album is really crap!!!

Kirk Hammet does not do ANY guitar solo's, James rhythm playing sounds like bad System Of A Down, and Lar's drums sound like a poor indie rock band recording.

For previous albums Metallica was criticized fro being too poppy so they went to the other extreme: just create a lot of fast noise... Sometimes it appears to not even have melody...

The only unique and cool thing is the DVD that has the FULL album played and filmed live which no band has ever done before to my knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is dead","review":"Upon listening to this cd, it is obvious that metallica has changed. This is by far their worst album, just about everything sucks. The drums sound horrible, the lyrics are annoying, and most of all where did the guitar solos go?!! I thougth that was what metallica was all about? Anyways if you really want to get back at metallica for releasing this garbage, go pick up megadeths new cd \\"the system has failed\\".

Jason was the energy that kept Metallica rocking, and even though they made some less than great albums while he was in the band they seemed to have more energy and raw power to them. When I finally bought the album I thought well I'll give it a shot and maybe all the reviews were right, but upon listening to this album I found that this was crap, not even good enough to be called bad Metallica. Do not buy this unless you want it for your collection, it sucks and sounds nothing like the Metallica we know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypothesis regarding Metallica's Disgrace","review":"For the record, I am not new to the \\"Metallica sold out\\" bandwagon. I didn't care much for the Black album or anything that followed it, and this piece of garbage is the culmination of Metallica's downward slide. What happened, you may be asking yourself? Metallica once had melody, rythym, lyrics, and production values higher than that of your average janitor's weekly paycheck.I think \\"Metallica\\" the creative force, not \\"Metallica\\" the band, left the recording studio a long time ago. Their names were Cliff Burton and Dave Mustaine. Think about it. Mustaine wrote/contributed to nearly all of \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and also wrote practically all of \\"Ride the Lightning\\". Cliff was a bass virtuoso and knew how to rock. Once their influences were purged through death and schizm, Metallica never recovered.Check out Megadeth's latest album, \\"The System Has Failed\\" for proof that Mustaine never lost the rockin' spirit.R.I.P.

I have been a fan of Metallica since Ride the Lightning and this is just not good. Problem #1: The production. The entire album sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. Metallica's signature sound (heavy guitars, driving bass and powerful drums) is gone. It has been replaced with this overpowered snare drum with all the song pretty much sounding the same. None of the songs are memorable, in fact, most of the CD sounds exactly the same. I've bought some great albums this year (Soilwork, Disturbed) and this just doesn't rank up there with them.

It sounds like someone recorded this cd with a cassette tape player from the back of an arena. It is as dull-sounding as you can get. It is empty! The drums sound like Lars is banging on 55 gallon drums. The vocals are absolutely terrible, and the guitar sounds like a garage band. I don't know what the boys were thinking when they made this cd, but they will soon find out that very few of their fans like this cd after the initial first week of sales is over. They shot themselves in the foot on this one. I wonder how long we will have to wait to get a \\"Real\\" Metallica cd. I do not recommend this cd to anyone except a die-hard Metallica fan who just wants their entire collection. If you buy this cd, I promise you will listen to it about two times, max.

No, Really!","review":"Well, they finally gave the fans they hate an album just for them. While I might agree that the album is quite heavy, it lacks the heavy, bassy, well-mixed \\"punch\\" of all of their earlier works. Even Justice is mixed better than this. When I heard the mix for the first time, I thought my speakers were blown. It's just entirely too muddy. Also, no Hammet solos, no epic feel. This is Bob Rock? I think the inflated egos of the band (ahem, Ulrich) knocked him out and attempted their own mix in his name. Either that or he hates them now and did this mix for revenge. I always buy CD's because mp3's sometimes lack the quality of sound. Maybe Metallica was going for a 64 mp3 sound just to kick their fans in the teeth. May their teeth be the nails in your coffins, fellas. And James, please, please no more rap-core.

I find that St. Anger mimics Metallica's first anthem albums, such as Kill Em All. While I found Metallica going back to their roots a refreshing change from Load and ReLoad, I believe that many people are trying to compare the CD and it's songs to the Black Album, which just cannot be done. Where the Black Album is very thought provoking and intense, St. Anger is mainly anthems and longer, more instrumental songs. I am not saying that it is better than the Black Album in any way, shape, or form, but that it is not of the same style of writing. The two cannot be compared. Overall, while not lyrically the quality of the Black Album, St. Anger includes very good instrumentalism in place and creates a well-crafted and classic Metallica feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice return to form","review":"Well, this seems to be a love it or hate it album for a lot of people. I for one think it is great. Not their best work, but still a 75 minute tour de force that never stops to take a break. If you thought the past few albums were a bit soft, this might be your album. Definitely a different sound for Metallica, but still a sort of throwback to their old sound. Lyrically it is a bit weak at times, but that almost goes with the rawness that they seemed to try and achieve here. No solos? That seems to be a gripe, but hey, I think they decided this was a team effort all the way and it turned out great. Besides a great, 75 minute CD, they throw in an awesome DVD with live rehearsal version of each song!

Let's all hope they will put alittle effort in the song writing and recording process for the next album (if they are still signed to a record label after this one...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a demo","review":"This album is pretty good for something recorded on 4 tracks in a basement. The actual studio release should be something to look forward to.St. Anger is a demo, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This is by FAR the worst Metallica record to date. They have gone downhill ever since the black album. I am sorry to say that I don't think I've heard a worse rock/metal album in quite some time. Too bad coming from one of the best metal bands of all time (in its hayday)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the guys need more money now!","review":"this album is weak .i mean the prodaction is well done it sounds good but the lyrics are boring like metalicas load.with so much good music in the world i would not bother !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Decent Metallica, Welcome Back Guys!!","review":"Being a metal head from the early early 80's, I have enjoyed the metal coming through the years. Metallica started off strong but slack alittle with load and reload but BOOM. St. Anger rifles through yet another strong and Angry sense of Old School Metallica that put these boys on the top of the game. Sometimes it takes an effort to regroup and these guys have done just that with St. Anger. Fierce drumming from Lars, and lighting fast licks from Kirk and the cut no non-sense hostility that James brings to the Mic, also don't forget securing Ozzy's best bassist and adding him to the war machine is what Metallica is about. St. Anger is proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks and bring back the magic that makes Metallica and Metal superhero."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album stinks!","review":"I have been a long time Metallica fan. I was really looking forward to this new album when I heard of it's release. However, this album is absolutley horrible. The songs are like 9 minutes long, and there is no hard rock to them at all. What is the deal with the title? The songs make no sense and are agony to listen to. I was overall very disappointed. There is not one good song on this album. My advice, listen to the old Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God.....","review":"This was horrible, this isn't music, this is just torturing Guitars and breaking drums... You hear the intro of a song and it repeads the whole song along with these disgusting 'Bamm-bamm-bamm' drums. Even the Voises are different! I doubt that this was ment seriously or just a test to find out what a producer can pull off.At least Bob Rock tried to rescue it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deleting the reviews won't save this junk!","review":"Can't believe Amazon deleted all bad reviews this album has got! It is a criminal. But tell you what - no matter what you do, it won't save this garbage of album! ZERO stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, complete crap","review":"Metallica sucks now. No one can deny that. It started going down hill after \\"The Black Album\\". I hpe this is their last atempt at music. Just fade into abscurity like a good old band please."},{"rating":"1","title":"I even stuck up for Load and Reload...but this?","review":"I stuck with Metallica even through the Load, Reload, and Garage Inc. years. When everyone else was dissing Metallica, I always stuck up for them. But with this release of St. Anger, I feel like I shouldn't stick up for them anymore. The album is just a dismal effort, and I even find myself bashing them now; a day I never thought would come. The song frantic is rather good, and St. Anger is alright, but the rest of the album....ugg. This CD now sits on my CD shelf and never comes off, collecting dust, while Metallica's first 5 albums are always off the shelf getting scratched from being listened to so much. Go buy Anthrax's new album We've Come for You All instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this CD zero stars...","review":"Metallica have hit an all time low with their 2003 album St. Anger. I would have rather them release another Load or Reload than this horrible album. They decided to try and get heavier again, but they seriously failed because they have no clue what heavy means anymore. I think their hearts may be in the right place, but their pathetic attempt to be the leaders of metal show that they aren't even a fraction of what they used to be. The songs are too long, too boring, and barely listenable. Hetfield's vocals are his worst yet, and Kirk doesn't do any solos. Good job guys, you have one of the best guitarists around and you don't even use him to your advantage.I seriously hope the band finally breaks up because I am sick and tired of hearing about them. Anybody who likes this album should get their hearing checked, because there are thousands of better albums out there you can be spending your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"they changed for the worse","review":"I thought the drums sounded really good. Odd sounding snare on some of the tracks..like he turned off the snares on the snare drum? They have jumped on the bandwagon with the low tuned guitars. It makes Hetfield's vocals sound different. How come no lead guitar? and no song with an acoustic intro building into a classic Metallica tune? they're trying to fit in with the current metal bands and in the process have abandoned what made them great! still worth having cuz it is Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't know you anymore.","review":"As a disclaimer I want to say that I love Metallica!!!I remember how excited I was when Master of Puppets was first released. I remember moshing it up at the Justice for All concert in Lakeland, Florida back in the late 80's. The Black album and Load CD's were different but they still rocked.But something has happened. Something has changed. I just don't know you anymore. For a younger generation that doesn't have a memory of the old school days this CD might sound okay. But to the ears that helped put you on the map, what can I say??? Please tell me you're joking. Yeah that's it, this is just a cruel, sadistic, twisted joke and the real CD is coming out next month. I know that you didn't make me wait half a decade for this skimmed milk.If for some reason this isn't a joke. Save you money and burn a copy from your misfortunate friends that did buy the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happend????","review":"After waiting forever for this cd, I can safely say that Metallica went the wrong way. But, if you like garage practice music, this cd is for you. If you what to hear hard core Metallica, don't bother with this one. What a heartbreaker!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Metallica- just like all the other nu-metal","review":"I anxiously awaited for this album, but must say I'm disappointed in the performance overall. Metallica started as a pioneer of heavy/thrash music, but this is lame. There is not ONE SINGLE LEAD GUITAR solo on the entire CD, all 75 minutes!!! The songs go on way too long and many could use some serious editing. They now sound as if they have just been listening to the new metal bands and trying to copy them, rather than write interesting unique songs like they used to, circa \\"Master of Puppets\\" or \\"And Justice for All.\\" Furthermore, the production is terrible in spots. Lars' drums sound tinny and the volume drops in many places. The recording sounds hissy. I'm sure the nu metal kids will love it, but it really is boring and has a \\"I've heard that riff a million times before\\" feeling throughout the CD. I'd have to hear their next CD first before buying anything else from the band again. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"No memorable riffs on this one, just a wall of mud where the guitars should be. Kirk apparently forgot to bring his guitar to the studio, whereas Lars has decided that pots and pans are the new wave in metal percussion. Hate to sound so harsh, it's just that we all know what greatness these guys are capable of, so that's what makes this effort so disappointing. Skip this attempt at nu-metal and hope for a better try next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Metallica ??","review":"This is perhaps the biggest letdown of the Summer. To begin, while Metallica may not be the most talented of the heavy metal bands, we have always relied on them for new and exciting mateerial, or at least material that has some form of substance and perhaps a little continuity. However, with this most recent attempt at music, all those who claimed the band \\"sold out\\" when Load was released must now reevaluate their position. If they sold out then, what have they done now?? Is there a step beyond selling out?? Shouldn't bands be required to change their name before such a complete departure from all things musical. That being said I'm sure they will sell an enourmous number of albums because unlike previous Metallica works this sounds exactly like everything else on the radio. Perhaps they should change their name to Puddle of Metalicpool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these impostors?","review":"Sounds more like Queens of the Stone Age than Metallica! What happened to Kirk's soaring, intricate melodies and the head banging thrash?!? Instead, we've got down tuned guitars and stoner rock song structures! There's not a single memorable song throughout this CD!Major letdown..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT with this Album/Metallica","review":"First, I like Metallica but Metallica's new Base Player must have the other 3 guys under a spell. It seems like each song in the album keys off of him. It's not as artistic as the past 2 Albums. When their are words to songs they don't have an impact like past Metallica Albums. Metallica needs to do some soul searching before they come out with another album like this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this surprise people?","review":"Metallica has not been the same since Master of Puppets. They sold out and there is no turning back. I stopped listening to them when I saw them on the Justice tour and they sounded terrible live. It seems things have only gotten worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Guitar?","review":"I am still trying to find any good giutar work on this album. It is realy hard to find. The drums, while they are fast and heavy, sound off aswell. Lars souonds like he has gon a little Latin for this one.I don't understand where this came from. Absolutely disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ...","review":"I used to be a Metallica fan from the days of old. This album is definately better than the last 3 [CDs] that they've put out. The problem is, it's almost like they're trying WAY too hard to get back the edge they've once had. Needless to say, I'm once again disappointed in them, especially after hearing word that they were returning to their \\"roots\\"... Not even..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anger Management","review":"Naw. I don't like it. The DVD was a neat idea, and I appreciate it... but the songs are horrid! GHASTLY! NO! I DIDN'T LIKE IT! I HATED IT! THE PRODUCTION WAS CHEAP! THE GUITARS ARE LACKLUSTER! THE VOCALS ARE LAUGHABLE! I DON'T LIKE THIS CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are no words to describe...","review":"How bad this album is, I mean. There is no way that anyone could like this trash. The folks who say they like it must be paid by the record company to do so. I mean, come on!!!! Listen to Puppets or Justice, then listen to this. Need I say more??? It seems that I must, because YOU IDIOTS ARE STILL BUYING THIS GARBAGE!!!!!! If you did buy it, throw it away. If you didn't buy it, congratulations. Now go buy something good, like a case of beer. (which James desperately needs)These guys are f*cking spent.F*ck 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Metallica Album Ever","review":"If it were not for the bonus DVD and cool packaging I would have thrown this piece of junk out of my window! Sloppy drums, weak vocals, poor production...and NO guitar solos? What the F*ck?! Are the guys brains that fried? Left me feeling used and cheated. Thanks Metallica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ARE THESE GUYS ON!","review":"If this is what James comes up with sober, i say we get the hell out of his life and let the man drink. Im sorry to anybody that purchases this album! I have LOVED Metallica ever since i heard the sound of james voice and kirks leads. When i put on my friends headphones to listen to the album, i was wondering, \\"what will they have come up with this time\\", and apparently, the answer is \\"nothing special\\". This album is so bad that i am now boycotting Metallica, with no exceptions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst albums of all time.","review":"I recently bought the latest \\"metallica\\" album and am extremely dosappointed. What really makes this bad is the fact that Bob Rock mixed the album which he played bass on, which just so happens to be louder than anything on the album. and then theres the total absence of Kirk Hammett and his amazing solos that make other guitarists weep trying to copy him. And Lets not even talk about James who if this is what he sounds like sober lets all encourage him to start drinking again. I had a hard time getting past track four but there are afew tracks that are ok like Shoot Me Again and, Sweet Amber. But they are even only ok songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD BUT TRUE","review":"Metallica is (was) my favorite band. What the hell happened on this album? I was expecting a return to the days of Kill Em' All and Ride the Lightning. They sound like all the nu metal bands with heavy drum and grinding guitar. They do not sound like Metallica. Unless they totally abandon this direction in music, Metallica is Dead. This album sucks!!! You have been warned.....maybe James needs to hit the bars again??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are u a real fan?","review":"ok, have to say this album really ..., just cant hear anymore of it, its a long anoying 75 min long song BUT if we are real fans of Metallica we have to support them on the bad and good days dont we?, this album was a complet mistake from the production to the release , but real fans will support Metallica always, cause on albums like : Master of puppets , Kill em all, Black album and Ride the lighting, they brought excelent music to us.Dont buy this album, buy the old ones. This really ... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello Kirk, are you there? New album title: Garbage, Inc.","review":"I was waiting 12 years to buy this album since the Black album, and I was was so sick to my stomach to hear this garbage!I heard Metallica was going to go back to its roots, but the guitars sound mushy, there's no structure to any song, the drums sound like Lars is hitting trash can lids, and the \\"singing\\" is just horrible! Hetfield sounds angry just to be angry. His lyrics are terrible. If that wasn't enough, I thought maybe I would get rewarded by some of Kirk's solos, but he is nowhere to be found! I didn't know that there were only three members in this band!I have never listened to such a boring and monotonous album. Sure, it sounds heavy at times, but it doesn't make it good metal- it's just noise!If you are an early Metallica fan, BEWARE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"back to the bones of Metallica\\" ...","review":"This album, above anything, lacks EVERYTHING that made metallica my favorite band. tha majority of the songs on this album have no dynamics, melody, rythm, or deep meaning, much unlike \\"Ride The Lightning\\", \\"master of puppets\\" or any other album the band has ever released. This is like no other Metallica album, in a bad way. they say the album is very angry but does that mean it has to be out of control? The song Sanitarium is angry, but it has dynamics, melody, and everything previously mentioned. \\"Creeping Death\\" is angry but it still kicks. I dont know what they were thinking when they put this thing together. I hope they dont stay like this forever. I would like to see them put out some music with depth again. Heck, even some of their songs with no words at all such as \\"Orion\\" and \\"Call of the Ktulu\\" have seemed more deep and meaningful than the empty feelin stuff on this album. I wanna hear something from \\"the heart\\"I wonder what Cliff would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger? Anger at paying $$..","review":"First off, Metallica is and has been my favorite band since my friend turned me on to them back in 1992. That said:If you like the sound of James and Lars playing on a 4-track in a garage with Lars playing the pots and pans, then this album is for you. Real Metallica fans will want to listen to Lighnting thru Justice. The songs on this CD are horrible. What made Metallica great were the lyrics and the awesome solos that Kirk would rip off in the middle of a song. Now they've dumbed it all down. The lyrics are of very poor quality. The guitar solo is non-existant on the album. This is the worst album they've ever done. For a 6 year wait from the last studio album (Reload) they've left me wanting. If you want to listen to Metallica, I recommend any of their other albums over this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metalicca have lost it.","review":"I guess whatever Metalicca releases nowadays the ardent fans will still buy it. But this album is really taking advantage of the fans money. The music just doesn't hit the right points, dreary repetitive and boring to listen to. The riffs are easy to play, the drums sound like they are a collection of empty plant pots and paint tins, the base is literally hidden in the back ground. St Anger is one of the worse Metalicca tracks I have heard and altogether this is the worse album they have ever released to date. I can only conclude that Metalicca have now run out of ideas and have well and truely lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the talent?","review":"I am a huge Metallica fan, I too have tried over and over again to listen to this c.d. hoping it would grow on me but it just isn't them. Where is Kirk's solo's? What happened to James voice? I thought this album was suppose to bring back the old Metallica, it just sounds like everything else on the radio now. It is sad to say the band has lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album sounds like System of a down.","review":"Well Metallica, Metallica, Metallica, You have lost your glory and you turn yourselves into a nu metal band (like limp business and other trash), no guitar solo, rapping (what the hell is that?), poor drumming (I Hate Lars), Cliff is probably rolling at his grave as we speakMetallica 1983-91 R.I.P."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Cliff Burton: My deepest sympathies","review":"This might be the most ... excuse for a music album in the history of the world. I never imagined an album this terrible would be released. In fact to use the word ALBUM implies several qualities that this garbage doesn't have: effort, thought, MUSIC comes to mind.Regardless of what kind of music you listen to, you would have to be ... to feel that this is anything more than human excrement captured on tape. (err...cd)There wasn't one ounce of thought put into this album before recording began. An incoherrent jam session was recorded, and then spliced together into random patterns. I ask you: HOW IS THAT SONG WRITING?Bob Rock has succeeded in making the greatest band in the world into a disgusting shell of its former self.\\"Master of Puppets\\" was Van Gogh.\\"And Justice for All\\" was Michael Angelo.\\"St. Anger\\" is bad finger painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"gratuitous gamut of garbage","review":"This is the most dissapointing album I have ever heard. No guitar solos, fatuitous lyrics, and endless repition of said insipid lyrics accompanied with harmonies so rudimentary it could just as well be a cage full of chimps with drums and guitars. I would not recommend purchasing this trash to individuals I loathe. Buy Megadeth's Rude Awakening instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big disaster reloaded","review":"I made sure I listened to it before I made a decision whether to buy it or not. I definitely didn't buy it. I can't support this, but I hope somebody digs this kind of stuff, because I hate to see what was once an incredibly strong heavy metal in my book fall to pieces. The songs seem poorly put together, James's voice sounds out of tune, and like he's trying to yell over the volume of the other instruments. The whole performance, or effort, feels forced, which could also be the reason why they sound like they are playing by themselves rather than together. Some interesting themes for their songs as usual, but alas, far from competently realized. I'm sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica has just forgotten how to play.","review":"It's the disappointment I expected it to be. The song St. Anger is very catchy and not overy brilliant. But it goes down hill from there, Purify and Shoot Me Again sound like they could have been good but fall just short, ruined by the lack of tallent Metallica may now have. I bought this album like the sheep the record company expect me to be, making the purchase based on the first 5 albums Metallica ever produced instead of the merit of this particular album. Load and Re-Load still had great songs on them despite being Metallica's weakest albums. St. Anger is the final nail in the coffin for Metallica as far as I'm concerned. The album sounds unoriginal and uninspired, only offering one song that I care to listen to and can hear on the radio or MTV perfectly fine without the purchase of this CD. A major dissapointment. Metallica may have completely forgotten how to tune and play their instruments. Just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Well, there isn't much more I can add to what has already been said. St. Anger sounds like it was recorded in a truck-stop restroom with a Fisher Price tape recorder. The songs are ridiculously repetitive and sound like they were written on the spot as they were being recorded, and James sounds like he's been eating razor blades and washing them down with battery acid. I'm not sure what happened here. It's like they didn't even try. Nothing new or even remotely creative here. Think System of a Down without the melodies. If this is the best album they can give us after 7 years, I hope they take 20 years to write their next one. Maybe when they're in their 60's (Geritollica?), they can give us one last decent record. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least it's metal...","review":"which is more than you could say for load(of crap)and re-load..james hetfield was going through a very hard time in his life,trying to kick a decades-long bout of alcoholism ,and suffering a nearly year-long nervous breakdown .as a result, his priority(understandably!!) was hardly making music and,boy,does it show... this album suuuccckkksss!! but,like i said, better than load and re-load..how sad is that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry I listened to the hype. I should have bought this earlier.","review":"I regret paying attention to all of the negative reviews when this album came out. I waited until late 2009 to buy it and I immediately got over the fact that this is not a traditional Metallica album. I enjoyed it for it's own merits. Hard, raw and angry. Just what I want when I listen to the harder end of my collection. I did not focus on the drums as much as some reviewers had, and based on the songs I did not miss the solos like I thought I would. Great stuff if you can allow your faves a chance to go in a different direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Lars stands out to me as being the worst part of this disc. Seems like his playing/tone/mix pulls everything else down. I don't know how the other guys could have wrote anything better to go along with the fact that the root (drums) of the music sucks to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is as expected","review":"as expected, metallica go into i guess what they claim is a studio took yet another dump and out came this garbage known as st.anger.i'm not suprised at all, come on \\"i'm really angry with you\\"? give me a break, a 10 year old could write better lyrics than that.but as expected somehow it'll sell millions. this album was said to have gone back to its roots.nothing whatsoever on this garbage. what happened to metallica? oh wait they don't even desevrve the name metallica anymore.until they release something good.which wiill never happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt at a comeback...","review":"Hey, we've all been waiting fot this, right? So we are all gonna go get it of course. Well for those of you who haven't yet, save your money. The first five songs are actually quite good, especially Invisble Kid.

Doesn't sound like anything they've done before.I'm sad to say that the best songs are mediocre at best (Purify & Frantic).Maybe Metallica is hoping for a new fan base on this one, because it ain't my Metallica. At least Load & Re-Load sorta sounded like Metallica.Jason Newsted is probably cracking open a beer and lightin' one up and laughing his [*] off being relieved with the knowledge that he made the right decision.Recommend not buying it. I'm gonna see what I can do about returning my copy, just too painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the old metallica?","review":"I didn't buy this one on the web. I bought it at the record store near my house. But anyways, I think that Metallica has drifted to far from the sound that so many people loved. This new album has a new sound similar to that of Finger Eleven or Slipknot. And to boot, all of us are familiar with a guitar solo in every song? Not the case on this one. Sorry boys, but this isn't the one we were ready for."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great...you can have mine if you want","review":"i am not impressed at all. If your looking for good metal don't buy this album look instead to Anthrax's \\"we've come for you all\\" The raw recording is really bad. the drums sound terrible throughout the whole album the vocals are just not up to the standard we are used to.The sound on the DVD [stinks] so you don't want to watch the whole thing...at least I didn't pay full price or I would be very angry.Seriously, I loved all the old metallica and I even liked Load and Re-load I could listen to them over and over again, but this CD sounds bad and its all the same.

This album is simply a disappointment.Don't get me wrong, I love everything Metallica did within their first four albums. There is literally not a song that I dislike on any of those albums. After that, however, good songs were few and far-between for poor Metallica. And this is the first album they have put out that simply does not have ONE good song.James does this stupid thing on Frantic where he goes, \\"Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock...\\" WOW, HOW METAL IS THAT....And poor Kirk Hammet is probably crying under his pillow every night remembering the good days of shredding on Kill 'em All and Master of Puppets, wondering why the hell he hasn't quit and gone back to Exodus.Sorry guys, this CD isn't even worth pirating."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL..FADE TO BLACK","review":"Okay I'll keep this short and sweet this CD is perhaps one of the worst I have ever bought. Now before you all start hitting the unhelpful button let me explain. I am not a rabid Metallica fan but I have followed and bought most things since album number one. I kinda gave up and dipped out around the \\"Load\\" era. With the reviews I have read suggesting that this one was not a critic's album I thought perhaps that means its good in a kind of anti-establishment way, the way they were in the beginning. Wrong ~! This thing lacks hooks, production, lyrics, infact it is downright annoying as it clanks and stumbles around like a slow dying dinosaur in a mud bath. Secondly time changes abound do not make your music cool or clever unless of course your creating moods or atmospherics like say the great Mercyful Fate.

Two hours ago. I was kind of nervous to listen to it because i didnt want to get disapointed. After listening to the single \\"St.Anger\\", it seamed to me that the Tallica-boys wasnt as hard and crushing as the previews of the album had told us. But trust me it is.....Its a really strange album..... but in a good meaning :). Not like anything they, or anyone else, have ever done before. Hard, and unpolished but still, I think, kinda melodic and absolutely \\"Metallica\\".

St. Anger shows that Metallica has totally lost their senses. They thought it'll be more fun to take out solos, to throw in repetitive riffs, simple drum beats, and some not-so-good also repetitive vocals. I really hope Metallica realizes what kind of album this is. Still I'm finding repeating in my head \\"Why the hell is the band name still \\"Metal\\"lica.\\" Sickness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Effort","review":"There is absolutely nothing good about this album. This is not a template of Ride The Lightning. St. Anger should not even be mentioned in the same sentence as Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets.Everything in this album sucks.

I'm an avid Metallica fan and have liked everything they've released...up until now.The production sounds like something recorded in a garage, and Lars sounds like he's beating on garbage cans and cardboard boxes. Guitars are muddy at best, and James' vocals are absolutely horrid in comparison with just about everything I've ever heard.This is definitely not up to Metallica. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY ST. ANGER....","review":"Sorry, ST ANGER...but after many many listens, i can say that you are BY FAR the less inspired album from METALLICA...it's not a horrible, terrible album where all the songs sucks...i like some moments on Dirty window and Frantic...but, really...all the songs sound the same...sounds like Lars was playing his drums on cans...and where is Kirk? There's no solos or guitars besides the constant repeatition of riffs...the lyrics are INCREDIBLY uninspired too, with James repeating the same verse many times...LOAD and RELOAD are WAY WAY better than you, ST ANGER...but don't worry...by now, METALLICA recorded LULU with LOU REED, and LULU is WAY WAY WAY worst than you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica is as Hard as Ever","review":"I am an ardent Metallica fan, and unlike so many fans that like either their old stuff (Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, etc.) or their new stuff (Load, Reload), I love /all/ their stuff. This album perfectly blends the anger and violence of their earlier music with the poetic lyrics of the Load/Reload era. I was thrilled when this album came out, and I think it is a /must/ for any true Metallica fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a Great Album - If you're a socially awkward weirdo from Oregon","review":"One of the Strongest Tallica releases ever. Don't be fooled. This is an awesome album.

St. Anger...hah. Someone likened to \\"justice\\". I totally agree, they both sound thin, uninspired and lame.You want some real rock, get the latest from Anthrax.

It seems the boys who gave us some of the greatest metal/rock albums of our time have tried a different approach and in my opinion have failed.There are no classic Hetfield melody lines - No ripping Hammet sols what so ever and Lars seems to be trying to prove something by double timimg his drumming on every track. (and his snare drum actually starts to hurt your ears after a while)I can't actually remember what each track goes like as they all sound so much alike. Each one is down tuned and they sound very mushy.The best tracks have been put out first. Tracks like Frantic and St Anger. These are not to bad and have pushed my rating to 2 stars but only just.I ordered this album af line and was so excited and could not wait that I went to a shop and bought another one. That one is going back.Hope you like it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this crap go buy Iron Maiden's Powerslave album instead","review":"I know i shouldnt be mentioning Iron Maiden here do to the fact that this album nor metallica has nothing to do with them but ive always knew that Maiden rapes the sh*** out of metallica and are the kings of metal and now I can say something that will prove it.

Metallica is absolutely not what they used to be. If you're looking for another Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightening in this cd case, dont even bother, you wont find it. Period. Not even a trace of it. First of all, the cover should set off warning lights (nuff said). Even before you pop it in, you should know to expect something terrible, because St. Anger got on friggin MTV!! If that's not enough, then what the hell are you doing listening to metal, go out and buy yourself some garth brooks or some crap. As for the rest of the album, cheesy lyrics, paling musicianship compared to past Metallica, and horrible song structure. STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could rate it NO stars . . .","review":"Let's be honest - this cd sucks. DON'T spend your hard earned money on this waste of time!!! If you really want to hear it - burn it off someone who still owns it. I lost the cd about a month ago and I was glad.It is actually funny - I saw Metallica in concert over the summer and they played two of the new songs. While playing them, people were booing them and throwing things at them. No one was happy until they played their old stuff. I think that about says it all . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"This album [is bad] no two ways about it. Check out the Metallica messageboard -- everyone there hates it too!! No solos, poor production, and the drums sound like Lars is banging on garbage cans. The songs are repetitive and too long. They should have quit after 3-4 minutes in most cases, but they kept going for 6-7. The album reeks of nu-metal. Just when they get a really cool riff going, they kill it off with a nu-metal chorus or some sappy slow lyrics. No wonder they pushed the pre-orders so much. There are so many more bad reviews of this album, even on Metallica's own boards! -- ...Note to Metallica -- get rid of Bob Rock, and fast!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"metallica is dead","review":"This album is very BAD!! Drums sound like a kiddie drum kit purchased at K-Mart. There are no memorable songs on this album, heck it even lacks guitar solos. Anyone looking for OLD style Metallica, And Justice For All and back should not waste their hard earned money on this piece of GARBAGE. Wake up Metallica and go back to the music you played with Cliff Burton, NOW that's what people expect!!! This album was not worth the six year wait, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT GUYS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is bad","review":"I love Metallica but this album [is bad]! This is the end of the downfall for Metallica. They have been getting bad for years now they just downright suck. It's time for them to retire and enjoy their money, because they can't write music anymore. If you like Metallica don't buy this album. A bunch of teenage boys in a garage could record a better sounding album then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW great new stuff from Metallica","review":"most people think that this cd is going to [the dogs] and it dosent in my opinion so what there are no solos i can get past that this is Metallica's best cd since And Justice For All the first song Frantic is very heavy and lars has some fast drumming through out the whole cd good bass from new commer to the band Rob and as always awsome gutiar from Kirk and James either way i dont think spending [money] on the greatest metal band ever is much even for people who think this album will [not be good]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Metallica","review":"This is heavy, Loud, and nasty and it kicks butt!...

I Love this cd and I highly recommend that you buy this one!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect the Metallica of 6 years ago!","review":"I've been a Metallica fan since the beginning. Since the whole Napster fiasco with Lars, I turned my back on them until St. Anger. I figured I'd give them another shot. Don't expect to hear the Metallica you're used to. Get ready for Lars playing with the snares off the snare drum. Don't expect too many ripping leads from Kirk and James doesn't have the same punch in his vocal delivery that he used to, although his power chords are well delivered. I gave St. Anger four stars for two reasons. One, I think Metallica reinvented themselves and have a whole new sound that's NOT wimpy. Two, When you buy the CD, you also get a DVD with footage of the band sans Jason, playing all of the songs on the CD in the rehersal studio. Now that's cool. In addition, you also get a code number to get into the Metallica music vault on the net. In conclusion, I would recommend this CD but just don't expect the changes we had when the CD Metallica came out Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited six years for THIS?","review":"This is a horrible CD. I have a huge Metallica collection and I love their stuff. I don't know what St. Anger is, but it sure doesn't sound like Metallica. Lars' snare sounds like a cat jumping on a garbage can, way too tinny. Where are the awesome guitar solos by Kirk? NO guitar solos! Not one. Let me get this straight, the boys mixed down Jason's bass riffs on \\"And Justice for All\\", but they let Bob Rock put stuff on tape? I read that they edited/mixed this with a computer. I made better tapes by sticking a microphone from an old Radio Shack tape player in front of my AM radio when I was a kid. If you like Metallica save your money. I bought it the day that it was released and listened to it in eager anticipation. I let it rest and tried again a week later in desperation. I haven't played it since. James needed a drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. A Great De-Stresser","review":"I had heard mixed things about this album since it came out. I'm not a die-hard Metallica fan, but I enjoy their stuff--especially Hammett's solo's and Hetfield's intros. When I first heard the album, I was confused. This wasn't the Metallica I was used to, and the album was devoid of solos. However, I kept listening found myself drawn to the style and the manner in which the album was made. The garage-band style gives them a raw, powerful, and somehow honest sound. The snare drum sounds like a low budget model from Sam Ash, but that's what I like about it. Again, it sounds honest and down-to-earth. The album is good for releasing anger, as this is some of the best aggro-metal I've heard in a long time. It lives up to its title. This is an album you'll either love or hate--there's no happy medium here. This is hardcore Metallica, and it's pretty awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLEW ME AWAY!!!!","review":"Wow! I've been a fan of Metallica since I heard and justice for all and I must say this album blew me away! Positively the best these guys have played in 15 years. The first 2 songs are incredible!

Lars is so scared that people will illegally download Metallica's music that they made the worst album in history so noone would want to. That's really a genious at work. How else is he going to buy mansions and Porsches if people don't pay for the album? Seriously though guys, just stop it. Stop making albums. You're just embarising yourselves at this point. Maybe you could work on a project for people who can appreciate your current work...like the deaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disappointment","review":"The best way I know how to describe this album is a Boeing 747 flying through a car wash. I have never been this disgusted/disappointed with any other album. Metallica would have been better off releasing an album filled with Village People covers. 4000 people have more than amply reviewed St. Anger, but I just wanted to let everyone know how bad I thought it sucked.

Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grim day for Metallica fans....","review":"The fact that over a 1000 people gave this sorry excuse for music is shocking to me.I guess they never really listened to this album nor seem \\"Some kind of Monster\\".

They SET OUT to make it sound like that, and I agree it wasn't a good idea. But it has serious potential and the next record is guaranteed to rule. As for St. Anger itself, if they shortened all the song, cut the horrible Shoot Me Again and Purify off, added solos, re-recorded it correctly (Lars' drums sounding like drums yaknow?) and rereleased it, it would be the next Master of Puppets. It could have been great but ended up just being good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of St. Anger","review":"I expected this album to be harder.

But now, when I finally had a change to listen the album, I can honestly say it's much better than I expected. It's different, but yet very complex, not boring as some people say. Very aggressive also, but still in a different way then the early albums. You have to consentrate on this, it's not an easy piece of music. Maybe bit too long, but still a very good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"Metallica??? This is and was probably the most anticipated Metallica album of all time, but that doesn't always mean that the album produced will be up to standards as we have seen with other artist. The fact is this new style of Metallica has no melody unlike the previous albums, no famous Hammett solos, and no ballads. Yes, the songs are pretty hard but yet there are still harder bands out there. It seems almost as if many of the songs were written spontaneously during soundchecks. The title track St.Anger is probably the best song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Rock Album EVER","review":"This album is horrible.

This blows, this blows, THIS BLOWS!!! Terrible album, terrible band, terrible everything. Ever since Metallica became more concerned with stopping Napster and making a few more dollars, their music has plunged to rock bottom. Actually, the last good album they made was the Black Album. So, it has now been a full 12 years since anything good has come from Metallica, and yet they are still around. It reminds me of Emmit Smith. He could have gone out on top of the world, but he changed teams, changed styles, and is now making an ass of himself and just making everyone around him cringe. Sounds kinda like Lars and the boys, huh? THIS ALBUM SUCKS, METALLICA HAS SUCKED FOR 12 YEARS, AND F*CK LARS FOR BOOTING ME OFF NAPSTER BACK IN 2000.

I have waited for 5 years for this album, I had hoped the Metallica would come back and claim the throne that is rightly thiers. I am not sure what happened in the studio, But if this is the best that Bob Rock has to offer then he needs to retire. The music does not speek for itself on this album as it has on past ones. There are no (Metallica) solos more like Limp Bizkit, I am not sure what to think of the drums, sounds like my 4 yr old banging on the pans in the kitchen. I love Metallica and have listened to the entire St Anger album over and over again in hopes that it would grow on me, saddley it hasent.

At the time, my friends who liked Metallica were disappointed but grew to like it. Now we have a paradigm shift with St. Anger. The songs are raw and less pollished with a production to match. I'm not sure why there dosen't seem to be any solos. After all, Peter Gabriel made an album without cymbals! One thing is sure, James and Lars make the kind of music that they want to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible!","review":"What a total disappointment.

Just listen to their old CD's and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"And still they keep on going -","review":"Metallica continue in their tradition.Starting from Load, onto Reload and Garage Inc. Metallica has become a band of mediocre pop-trash-rock-punk. Hearing the past three albums, and now the fourth in a row, one has to feel that Metallica has moer or less used up all their potential.I believe in Metallica, it is one of the better bands to come around in the past two decades, but they have got to get a hold of themselves before they burry themselves deep under all this trashy music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money","review":"I used to be a huge Metallica fan and really anticipated the release of St. Anger. After listening to this album, the only thing that even reminded me that I was listening to a Metallica album was James' vocals. The production is sub-standard as are the lyrics. Kirk doesn't even play on the album, as there aren't even the first lead break or solo on the album. There are a couple of songs with good riffs such as Invisible Kid and Sweet Amber, but overall, this album sounds really rushed and poorly executed. If this was coming from some untried punk metal band, I would rate it higher, but coming from Metallica, I believe in growth in a band as much as the next man, but this is a step back not a step forward, for they are capible of much better. I will say this, the songs sound better on the DVD than on the actual studio album. I actually enjoyed watching the performances live, but they still could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Metallica","review":"This album sounds just like Linkin Park and Limp Bizcuit.

If you like Load and Reload then this will be your cup of tea....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Work by Metallica","review":"I know there are many out there that hate this album, but this is more of an album that has you have to let grow on you. When I first heard this, I was very questionable about what kind of music they were writing. But after a few listens, I really got into the songs. \\"Purify\\" was not one of my favorites, but now I can't stop listening to it whenever I play the cd.

If you don't like this, get real, it is phenomenal and the best thing Metallica has recorded since 'Justice.' Even though I stand strongly behind 'Black Album,' 'Load' and 'Reload,' I am very glad Metallica has returned to their roots of loudness, speed and overall phenomenal songwriting.

Ahhh A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: I can recite this movie in my sleep, so listening the amazing Freddy's Back score or re-living the on-screen events of Debbie checks in/Time circles is always a pleasure.The Dream Child has some spooky gothic stuff, and for the life of me I can't recall much of Freddy's Dead music either...that must be a bad sign.All in all this thing is great.

I called customer service and after about an hour worth of useless trouble shooting, he told me I had the option to return the product since it comes with a 30- day money back gurnatee (THANK GOD). Microsoft A BILLION dollar company? pft. They can't even come out with a GPS and atlas/roadmap Software that actually works. I guess its back to good ole mapquest.com.

Specifically it does not always find its own best route between two locations. For example, I can ask it to route me from my house in the suburbs of Boston to a location in the White Mountains in Maine. It gives me a route with a drive time of 4 hours 2 minutes. I can then add a stop that is off the route, ask it to route again incorporating this stop, and now the total drive time is 3 hours and 30 minutes. Since this route is faster, the program should have found it in the first place. A half hour savings on a 4 hour trip is a big error.Further casting doubt on the routing is the fact that when I add the stop the suggested route changes downstream from a point that is common to both routes. There is no reason for that, either.This is a very serious flaw since it undermines confidence that any route is the right one. Conclusion: this program's routing algorithm is broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this trash","review":"I have been using Streets & Trips since 1999. If you can get your hands on one of the 2003 thru 2005 versions, there's NO reason to buy 2006. I use this software in my business to print maps when I want a paper backup to my Garmin gps unit software waypoints. I travel a lot around our state and can say that Microsoft has done absolutely NOTHING to improve the accuracy of the maps data. Major highway extensions and private roadways that were completed as long as 4 years ago, still do not show up in the \\"newer\\" versions. This is totally bogus and a waste of your money. I have decided not to buy another S&T version until 2008 at the least.

The author has spent 26 years writing a newspaper column on the subjects of money and investments. The author is not bashful with his opinions. The book describes the only strategy to use in buying securities, was the buy and hold strategy. Holding securities for 25 years. He does not believe in day trading, advising the reader against doing so. The book does not believe in fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or chart reading. It says you can not predict future prices and should not rely on historical prices as a guide. The book spends too many chapters describing stocks, mutual funds, bonds and how to find a broker. This did not leave much room to talk about Exchange Traded Funds. Which was the title of the book. Only one and half chapters were devoted to the subject. The book had potential, but it was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be \\"A Little about ETF's\\"","review":"This book is more about Archie Richards' personal investment philosophy than it is about ETF's. I'm not sure who his target audience is, but I can assure you if you want to learn about ETF's, you are going to be spending about 75% of your time reading about Archie's personal opinions about the investment world and what is wrong with it. The other 25% covers what ETF's are and how they work. It may be good info. if you want to be the Cliff Claven of ETF's at your friendly neighborhood bar. But if you want to learn how to use ETF's as a viable investment, you would be better off going to the websites of the sponsors for these funds and read their free information.

In the making of the movie, the director John Milius wanted to lean greatly on the score when creating the right athmosphere for the scenes and it is clear that his choise of composer was the only correct one.Listening to Conan's score is like listening to a great epic tale - no words ever required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conan Sound Track","review":"We rented this movie our son loved it, so I wanted to get him the sound track.

The most hit track on this CD in my opinion has to be the 1st one, otherwise known (translated) as Cruel Angel's Thesis. Now, this song isn't usually played at this long a time--it's an extended version and if you really must know, it's well worth the listening to.

Well, let me qualify that; if you like avant-garde music, there's a good chance this will appeal to you. It is easy to forget that 8,000lb pachyderms are making this music, even if they are performing more or less under the direction of a New York musician and academic."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong part, shipping to deliver and return 1/3 of total purchase price.","review":"This was not the part that was shown at the top of the page when I was shopping. The part by Jake's buying mistakes was less than half the Amazon part with no supplied picture. I was suspicious with such a price difference but didn't want to argue with a good deal. If they would have supplied a picture it would have been evident I was getting the wrong part. I think the pic. omission was no mistake. They took it back but by the time I paid to ship it back and they deducted their shipping charges, I have $27 invested in nothing. Boo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"This album is truly one of the best. I like Disc One more, because of songs like: Another Brick in the Wall (I,II,III) Mother, Good-Bye Blue Sky, Empty Spaces, Young Lust, Don't Leave Me Now. My favorite is \\"One of My Turns\\". Disc Two I like because of songs Like \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" Also, \\"the Trial\\" is a crazy song, and really freaks me out, but is truly amazing.I also own Dark Side of the Moon, and I enjoy it. Sometimes Im just not in the mood for Techno-ish Rock. This is when I listen to The Wall.If its your first time listening to it, be sure to listen to it from start to finsh in one sitting, with the lights out, and no other noise to distract you. Listen to every word, and don't skip tracks to recieve to effect of this great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ALBUM!!!!","review":"This album, unlike anyother, turned me into a Pink Floyd fan. At first, I had a sense that I wouldn't like this album, the reason I wanted it were the mere tracks of \\"Hey You,\\" and all the \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" songs. However, I found more great songs like \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Run Like Hell,\\" and \\"Young Lust!\\" There are very many other great songs, but these are my favorites. Get this album. Although I think it might be a TAD overrated, it is still a great album, and should please listeners of rock n' roll music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Pink Floyd album","review":"This album is the best Pink Floyd album I have, and i'm a pretty big fan. There are all kinds of hidden messages about war and life that Roger Waters put in. It is also just great music (Especialy the \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" songs) I would highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Pink Floyd rules!!!!!!!","review":"I like this Pink Floyd album the best because it it Roger Waters controlled. I like his style of writing better than when the rest of the members got into writing the music too. Roger Waters has got to the best lyricist ever! They got such meaning and feeling to them. They also make perfect sense. I like Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here too, but this one takes the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Remastered edition!","review":"The last Pink Floyd album with Roger Waters. A Sweet remastered edition that all Pink Floyd fans should have in their colection.

I puked at least twice!!!! Who do these people think they are! Taking a classic and making it sound like it should be treated like Rasputain. I will buy it and see if it can survive the tourture that I have in store...BETTER YET I'll get the f ***S who ruined it for the future children of Amireca!!!! BURN THE F***S BURN THEM TO HELL!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where to find more like the Wall","review":"The Wall is one of the greatest albums of all time, all the other reviews can demonstrate that. I just want to inform people looking for more amazing music similar to the Wall to check out a recent discovery I made.Modest Mouse- The Moon and AntarcticaIts a loose concept album with a vocalist that does everything, inventive guitar work, and just flat out great song writing. If you love the Wall, you will want to check this album out. I highly reccomend this even if you aren't an indie rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved It As A Kid - Realize it's Overrated As An Adult","review":"This was THE album to have when it first came out. Unfortunately as I listen to it now, I see how much filler is on it!! I never realized it before.Yes, you get a handful of absolute classic songs (\\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Hey You\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\"). But man, \\"Another Brick..(part 2) just sounds laughably dated now!!!!The rest...filler. Nice for nostalgic purposes, but don't believe the hype. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing","review":"This album to me is a summary of innocence lost on the way to arriving at your goal in life. It obviously was written with the events during the vietnam war era in mind. So that could explain a lot of the negativity in it. The music is okay. But personally, I can't find in the album where they talk about solutions to the chaos! It leaves me feeling kind of sad. Very lame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd The Wall - Beatles soundtrack printing error","review":"Greetings to everyone at Amazon.comI received the album Pink Floyd The Wall a while ago and listened to it immediately when I got it and saw a big error, that probably came from the cd printing company... there are 2 cds, the first one is good, nothing wrong with it exeptthe second one.. its a Beatles cd, like the Beatles movie soundtrack....so I figured it must have been a misprint of some sort and probably those 2 bands are with the same label so they mixed it up when printing. There must be many more of the same kind in wich you are selling and probably other customers had had the same experience as me, so maybe check that out!ps. I guess its to late to get a refund for that double disc and I respect that, its my fault, but check that out carefully.Cheers!Chad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound like a man going through a bit of a mid life crises","review":"The singer on this album sounds really quite upset about being a millionaire rock star with lots of fans. If he doesn't like it he should do it anymore rather than moaning on and on.I'm sure he's got enough to retire on anyway. Why doesn't he do what other middle age people do when their wife leaves them and go and buy a Harley and a leather jacket. Failing that watch reruns of Top Gear on Dave or better still read one of those Jeremy Clarkson books and wear Ralph Lauren socks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wall is the most degrading album I've ever heard","review":"I must admitt The Wall does have some(notice the word some) good songs such as Another Brick In The Wall parts 1-3 and Comfortably numb. But there are some very dark themes and racist themes such as in \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" & \\"In the Flesh!\\" which has anti-semetisim, and racist and other very derogatory remarks. This was mainly a Roger Waters album, it doesn't sound like Pink Floyd. I am a very big fan of the Floyd and I depise this album. If you want a good album go for either The Division Bell or Dark Side of the Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I received this CD as a gift and I like \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". The rest of this very long album is boring. You Pink Floyd fans are a special group. You don't know anything about music, but I guess everyone deserves their opinion. Let's see - there's one good song out of 26 on this album. Therefore, one star out of five seems generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many albums can be dedicated to Syd Barrett?","review":"Of all the grand doubleLP's by the great bands (like \\"The White Album,\\" \\"Electric Ladyland,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Physical Graffiti\\"), this is the most bombastic, boring and absurd. Roger Waters seems to have a Syd Barrett fixation. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" are either blatantly about Syd (\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\") or hint at the pressures of fame and the insanity that fell on Syd. So Waters does a whole double album around this topic, and other \\"deep\\" things that really just amount to music to go to sleep to. Skip this vastly overrated album and go instead to \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" for the real Pink Floyd--i.e. the Syd Barrett album (I don't have to recommend \\"Dark Side\\" because everybody has heard it 10,000 times), or go to Waters' Pink Floyd masterpiece \\"Wish You Were Here.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here for the audiophile.","review":"I bought it but what I really want is Floyd's catalog in the highest fidelity possible.

Sure it has some bad songs (Bring the Boys Back Home, The Trial) but it still deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost As Bad As the Movie","review":"1 great song (Comfortably Numb) and 1 okay song (Another brick in the Wall. I imagine the rest was written during a stay at an insane asylum. Too weird, too annoying. I've been told its great to listen to stoned, unfortunately i'd rather not have to have my senses impaired to enjoy music. You want great Pink Floyd, stick with Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Floyd album...?","review":"No one needs a review of this at this point in life but to me, this was always Floyd's best album. Everyone can argue darkside and wish or their earlier stuff and that's fine by me. I personally have always thought this is one of the top 10 albums ever. For me at least. I wish they'd release it in SACD or DVD-audio. I have about 4 versions of it, asian, remastered, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"We sometimes get lost in the wall.","review":"Coming from a life pink floyd fan, I can say that this is not the finest PF album. It is better that 95% of music out but compared to other PF albums it is ok. This album first off is almost Watters solo work. Exept for comfortably numb and run like hell that Dave Gilmore contributed on. Another brick in the wall part 2 is the most overplayed PF song and gives listiners the wrong perspective on PF. If you want the real PF look at Meddle, Darkside, Animals and Wish you were here and even alot of there really old stuff. The wall is great and has many strong moments but its not as good as you might think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped!","review":"Ok, the box and trinket contents are on par with the other Immersion sets, but we have all been shafted by this release. Yes, the CDs sound good (better than the original release), but for $120, we should have AT LEAST received hi-resolution Stereo 96KHz/24bit. Instead, we got 7 discs of the same old stuff....no offense to James Guthrie intended.I humbly request a complete revolt on this product until it comes with a DVD-A or Blu-Ray w/hi-rez audio. In the end, it's the SOUND I care about and not the silly box.Back it goes until a better sounding one is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Priced for what is actually there","review":"For what is in the box, it should have been about 50 bucks or so. There are NO surround sound mixes or any kind of upgraded audio, so I feel a bit cheated for the amount of money spent. The music that is included is good, but not worth the asking price. Skip it, buy the other Immersion sets instead which do have surround sound mixes, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for terrible sound remastering!","review":"No transparency at all,poor soundstage,big,big and terrible bass...what a disapointing. The old 1994 remastering is better! IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE STUDIO?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock Concept Album that works","review":"This is one of the few rock concept albums that truly works as a concept album. It tells a cohesive and intelligent story, which sets it above The Who's \\"Tommy\\", which has great music but a poor storyline (Who fans are screaming right now, but the false messiah story is old hat; and some of \\"Tommy\\" is a series of undeveloped characters showing up to abuse him then leave the story). And even though I am a huge Kinks fan and I like many of the Kinks' concept albums, not one tells a story as powerfully as \\"The Wall\\", which allows us to explore a rock star's psyche, from the child whose father dies in WWII, through marital problems and drug abuse, through madness (imagines himself as a Hitler-like dictator), until finally he tears down the Wall that he has mentally built between him and the rest of the world. For those who don't know, \\"The Wall\\" is a combined biography of Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, at different times the leaders of Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing much to it....but AWE","review":"People are obvioulsy entitled to judge...its on us to not get misleaded...n any review below 4 stars for this album will serve the same...misleading ppl from great music.Well i think ppl who own this know that this is one priceless n timesless album....listen to this and come to know what kind of things matter in this world.I know...ull come to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This is Pink Floyd at there best this album has surpassed perfection The Wall is truely the best ever and will remain a masterpiece forever. I would have to say this is required buy for anyone who is a music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!","review":"I was not much of a Pink Floyd until I listened to this record. A total work of art! The story is about a man who goes through so many problems in his life that messes him up little by little but slowly his mind starts to barricade his feelings and emotions within a wall that starts to drive the man insane. I would highly recomend this CD to others and also get it for your self. BUY IT!! Don't hesitate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wall: Immersion Box","review":"three boxes full of beauty that raise the sensitivity of a true fan to infinite levels, beautifully hypnotic and addictive music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The demo CD is something fantastic.","review":"The disk 1 and 2 do not require comment, as it topped the charts in the United States, France, Germany, Sweden and Australia when it was released. \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2\\" became a hit, selling over a million copies in a few weeks after launch, now the demo CD is without doubt a wonderful news and he was alone worth the expense to the album, it brings a side of \\"the Wall\\" I did not know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wall is genius","review":"Many people love THE WALL. And many people hate it. I fit into the former catagory. The only really lame cut is, \\"Don't Leave Me Now.\\" One reviewer said that \\"David Gilmour is the worst guitar player.\\" That point of view saddens me. No, he doesn't play at warp speed like some shredders I could mention, but the emotion of his playing is wonderful. As a guitar player myself, I know how easy it is to hide lack of emotion by playing FAST, but David doesn't succumb to that temptation (although he can play quite fast--check out some Floyd live bootlegs if you don't believe me). Anyway, a great album, great singing by Roger, great playing by David, and great all-around band performance. Oh yeah, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE STONED TO ENJOY THIS.Peace to all who read this, Nick Floyd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst remaster of The Wall","review":"This seems to be the worst master of the wall to my ears. The best you can trust is Japan 1st press 50DP and 40DP or even MFSL 24 karat gold cd. For those you did not know there're way better sound quality of the wall before they were remastered again and again in 1994, 1997 and 2011. Hunting down the old master while you still can."},{"rating":"2","title":"No! Don't sit on that....","review":"The case was cracked when I received it. However, what can I expect for something that I bought for half of what the stores charge for it? Loves me some Floyd, so I'm not complaining too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Albums EVER!","review":"If you are un-familiar with THE WALL, then come out from under your rock! ... and too all young ones who are force fed the music (punk metal Rap) they all hear today. Understand There are standards for music (or there were at least)Rock is dead as we know it today, so do yourself a favour and experience rock in its purist form. Experience THE WALL!Even tho my favorite Floyd songs are on other albums This is my all time favorite Floyd album, with Darkside a close second, followed by Animals and Wish you were here, Go check those out too"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for the old fans and new!","review":"I just got finished listening to the original Demos! Inrcrdible!All you floyd fans, this IS a must!!!!!I read about these demos in a book and always wanted to hear them.Here they are! They are worth the price of the Box set!I haven't even touched any of the othe material andhad to give a 5 star rating and review.I don;t want to ruin it for you guys, but lets say,some parts sound more \\"floydian\\" than The Wallwe have some to know and love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Pleased with Product!!","review":"I am very happy with the purchase I've made. the quality of the album was every bit of how the seller discribed. My husband was very pleased with it!! I will definitely purchase from them again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If you want to find out whats behind these cold eyes\\"","review":"The Wall is a masterpeice in many ways, In terms of Art and Creativity there is few \\"compilations\\" that come close. The Wall is story of madness and insanity brought on by old memories and Experiences, which in simple terms causes the character in \\"The Wall\\" to build a virtual wall between himself and the outside world. The story takes you in and out of the very depths of darkness with the combination of amazing guitar work and well done vocals. The problem with the Wall however is that to really get the enjoyment the album has to offer you must listen to it more as one big peice of music which can be annoying at times. The plot is also very hard to understand at first and It's not a bad idea to watch the movie as well as listen to the album to understand it, But even so it still has it's grand moments like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" \\"Mother\\" and \\"Hey You.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"[not] at best","review":"When I went to the store to purchase this CD, it was stocked with all the other Pink Floyd CDs. I was then under the impression that it was the original Pink Floyd. What I heard was a horrible tribute. All of the songs had been ruined. I dont know what \\"Out of Phase\\" was thinking, but I hope that they weren't trying to do the original album justice. To anyone that doesnt own it already: dont bother... Buy the original, you'll be alot happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I understand this is not Floyd which is what upsets me...","review":"Just listening to the demo clips online, I can only call this a \\"Techno Pop Floyd\\" cover. It's awful, and I only hope that someone listening to this isn't getting it as their first impression of Pink Floyd. That is my real concern with all the tributes and covers of truly great music. The newest generation only knows that Pink Floyd is a big name and might pick this up to get it at a lower price (as any Floyd fan can tell you the work is at a premium price still) and be jaded by the sounds coming from these tracks.Sorry can't stand behind this from any music aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Gift","review":"I got it for my boyfriend for the holidays. It came in a brand new package, sealed and all. He loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Floyd's greatest...","review":"The Wall has been described as one of the greatest albums of all time and a roadmap to suicide. These two facts hold true on Floyd's '79 effort; one of the darkest most influential albums ever. From the haunting vocals on Another Brick in the Wall all parts to the funky slide guitar on young lust (the album's only upbeat happy effort and it rocks!) to the rhythm guitar on Run Like Hell this album flat out rocks. Buy it if your new to Floyd and the whole depressing aspect doesnt bother you. If it does bother you and your new to Floyd pick up Dark Side of the Moon or Wish you were Here which are definently on par with the Wall.\\"...all in all your just another brick in the wall...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"still as relevant as it was","review":"i just bought the cd after getting tired of not be able to the record because i never fixed my record player and...wow!i went through the whole album in one sitting and although it got me severely depressed, it was so emotional that i just had to go through some of the songs again and again.it's all here: the battle of the individual against an oppressive society, the kid against all family baggage, drugs/law, good/evil...all of society's ills are battling away at pink's walls...there are still some things which i do not understand, but...and yes, i am a freak of house/dance music and this is still totally relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most depressing music I have ever heard","review":"I like Pink Floyd. I once owned several PF vinyl LPs, back in the day. But when I heard this slab of gloom I just could not handle it. This is the most dark and depressing music that PF have ever released, and this is from a band that made a career of darkness and depression. So you can imagine just how bad this is.Musically, it's brilliant, but the lyrics and theme drag it all down into an abyss. Then the band released the movie and added depressing images to the music. I actually sat through The Wall movie in a theater and I felt like committing suicide when I left.I hope Roger Waters sought professional help after recording this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"the wall was their second best album after the dark side of the moon and was so good that it sold over 22 million copies all over the world on the strengths of songs like comfortably numb,run like hell and another brick in the wall.a must buy for all rock fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Epic","review":"The biting sarcasm and streamlined music, the emotion poured into every line. It is exceptionally rare that I have ever heard something so effectively human in nature.

Most importantly it made me look at myself and change.I thank Roger for the ideas, and Gilmore for his contributions to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"We were actually compelled to watch this, whock horror, in my sixth form flim appreciation class - something held when it was too cold or wet to go outside and play sports. The start of the demise of Pink Floyd as Waters began to build his own wall, the last bricks of which were \\"The Final Cut\\" album which followed a couple of years later. A must have for all Floyd fans, but some will still prefer the pre Waters-self-pity era, me included."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't Floyd","review":"While the cd's have some good tracks on them, this remix of the wall seemed to loose the album.Any big time Pink Floyd fan will have a hard time listening to this album, as the vocals transmit an entrily different message then the original. The flow from track to track that you found on the original work was also lost.Those people who have only one or two Floyd cd's might be interested if you like remixed stuff.Whatever you do, don't buy this CD to add to your Floyd collection... it's not Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a cluster of disorganization!!!","review":"Amaxon does it again.

The comments are all the same for each product. So someone is complaining that the movie is not included with the Experience Version - well, it is not supposed to be. It is a two CD set. That is all. How confusing for someone who is looking for what they want. What is Amaxon doing or better yet, why are they doing it this way? There should be a different review for each bar coded version.

A long, long story of a boy named Pink who faces the death of his father, an overprotective mother, his wife leaving, and the pressures of stardom, and, due to all of this, he secludes himself from the world behind a wall. In the end, his punishment is to have this wall torn down. There is no hint as to what happens after the wall is torn down. While I admit, some of the songs seem dull, and they seem to drag on, the overall theme holds everything together. And songs like \\"In The Flesh\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"Hey You\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\", and many others are amazing. Overall, this is the ultimate story. Be sure to check out the movie too, it clears up some of the confusion you may have after listening to the album, as well as confuses you with some other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As I Thought....","review":"'The Wall 2000' is only a tribute album from the band 'Out Of Phase.' It Hardly Sounds Anything Like Pink Floyd. It's Like A Combination Of Techno Mixed With Rock. All Of The Songs Have A Techno-Funk Style To Them. A Few Of Songs Are Decent, But Most Of Them Are Too Much Like A Limp Bizkit/Korn-Type Of Style. I Would Not Really Recommed This Album To Any One Who Is Just A Basic Floyd Album Collecter. This One Is Mainly For EXTREMLY HARD-CORE Pink Floyd Finanics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip","review":"This album came out the year I was a senior in high school. I also wanted 'Another Brick' as the senior song, but it was turned down. Many years later, I still listen to this album.

Now, if only the liner notes and lyrics were more legible... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just love this CD.","review":"This may be better than Dark Side of the Moon. My original disappeared, guessing my college son might be the culprit? So I needed a replacement. Sometimes I prefer the entire CD to iTunes, or other, downloads.

I must have worn out my old CD cause I always had it on. Now comes the newly remastered edition and it sounds awesome. I'm not one to nit-pick about details, but it sounds great and you really get a feel of the sounds and all the little sound effects that Pink Floyd is good at. It sounds crisp and loud but you still hear every background sound and music too. As with the other remasters of their albums, this one is great, also one of my faves too. Certainly worth it, even for the price, and Amazon definitely has a great deal. If you love Pink Floyd, this is one of their best albums, songs like Another Brick in the Wall, Mother, Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell and Hey You are just great to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you don't like it then you don't GET it","review":"this IS genius because this is not just some album, some collection of songs, this album is Roger Waters' life.

For that reason I have chosen to give it 4 stars. The Wall is all about how Roger Waters complaning that he was now famous and he didn't want to be famous. There are good songs on this cd, Another Brick In The Wall, In the Flesh,Hey You. Disc 1 is the best disk. I would recomend Meddle, DSOTM, Wish You Were Here, and/or Piper At The Gates of Dawn. If you are a true fan like me though I would buy the wall for songs that I hadn't heard yet even though some are not worth listening to. The Wall is important because it is the last great Roger Waters CD.

This is mostly a work of Roger Waters, which I believe slightly taints the album.This is a very popular album and a good album for new Floyd fans, but after listening to this album, one should hear Floyd at their best in \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I have no idea of what led me to writing this review today","review":"\\"Does anybody here remember Vera lynn..and how that she said that we would meet again some sunny day (awful guitar squeak)\\"If you listened to this album, then you know why I like \\"Vera\\" so much.

This is not the band of old. It marked a change in FLoyd, one that they never would recover from. They totally blew the great idea of creating a rock opera with songs that are boring and annoying, like Run LIke Hell. Its really too bad that money was wasted on making a movie on this project. A movie should have been made about Peter Gabriel's masterpiece \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\"-a story with so many musical levels. It is the true quintessential \\"rock opera\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"When will fans get the COMPLETE Wall concert video?!","review":"It's well documented that Pink Floyd filmed a complete Wall concert. Why are we still waiting for this footage to be released? Is there any Floyd fan out there who would not pay good money for a full Wall concert video on BluRay? Nobody cares if the footage is dark and not up to today's video standards. It's Floyd history - man - and it's long overdue! Shame on the band and record company for \\"sometimes throwing us a bone\\" and only including a brief snippet of live concert footage in this Immersion set.

It's better than 95% of the stuff out there, whether compared to new rock or classic rock. But there is a lot of filler on the album that doesn't really have any purpose. My favorite song on the album is \\"Young Lust\\" because the vocals are incredible and the song rocks. And Gilmour's guitar solo at the end of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" must be one of the most under-rated guitar solos in the history of rock. But The Wall is not Floyd's best album. If you're looking for that, try Wish You Were Here or even Dark Side of the Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a marvellous album","review":"I think the great thing about this album is the way that the entire thing is really one work; although several of the songs are very good by themselves. the \\"plot\\" of the album is not particulary detailed, but I like that -- it gives you the freedom to make up the details on your own; and there is definitely a theme that runs altheway through it. There is also a variety in the type of songs; some are softer (comfortably numb) and some are harder (run like hell) and some are comic (the trial). I could listen to this probably a million times."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums available","review":"I have been a Wall fan almost my whole life. I grew up watching the movie. Now I finally own the CD. At first I made the mistake of purchasing the 'Out of Phase' ripoff version that is sold with the 'Pink Floyd' name on it. Beware of that version because it's not Floyd. Fortunately for me the CD store let me exchange for the real one and I am just loving it. Don't be set back by the high price tag. There's a reason an album that's been out for twenty years still sells for $35."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tale of Alienation","review":"I was sixteen years old and I bought The Wall on a Friday afternoon; got home from partying on Friday night and stuck this on my headphones, thinking I would listen to a little taste. An hour and a half later, I turned off the cassette player with my mind reeling. The Wall was one the first albums to really open my eyes to the role lyrics could play in great music. Seventeen years later, I still think the lyrics are some of the best rock has to offer - Comfortably Numb, Mother, Hey You, I could go on and on, but the point is, Roger Waters had a story to tell and he told it so well that hundreds of thousands of teenage boys have heard echoes of themselves in his words. I'm old enough now that bands like Pink Floyd have lost a little of their \\"mystique\\", but I'm not too old for great music, and on The Wall (and Dark Side of the Moon) the Floyd delivered big-time. If you don't own this - why not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother","review":"A suggestion: Seek out some new, untried sounds.

This is Pink Floyd's WORST album bay far. Nothing compared to Wish You Were Here, Meddle, or Dark Side. Now, it does have some good material(Happiest Days of Our Live/Another Brick Part II, In The Flesh, Is There Anybody Out There) and even a three really great songs(Comfortably Numb, Hey You, Mother) But this album is way too long. I can barely stay awake when I put it on. Roger Waters may actually do a good job of telling the story he sets out to tell. The problem is, by the end of this grueling over 100 minute recording, nobody cares. It is so hypocritical to hear millionaire rock stars singing about rebelling against education. This album is was way too ambitious and way too dull to be even listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like it!","review":"the songs are too simpel! we need better songs! it is good if you have radio and listen to 'we do'n need no education'. we have heard it several times! please STOP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I see Roger and David and.......","review":"......who knew \\"Romper Room\\" with a splash of petty anger could be so awful??? Pink Floyd's \\"Wall\\" album reminds us all why we're so glad the 20th century is over. Mundane and myopic testaments to boredom mix with crappy musicianship to produce this, the largest pile of art-rock crap ever produced.

I'd rather hear Henry Kissinger recite the periodic table of elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Worst","review":"\\"The Wall\\" is actually a pretty good song with its driving bass and distorted guitar.

I love that song. This CD is a disappointment. Even Comfortably Numb sounds better sung by David and his band then it did back in 1979.Save your money. This is just more of Roger Water's ranting and raving. He, for some reason, wanted to be a looney and that certainly comes across.I hope David and his present band make and album with old Pink Floyd favorites.

Where did all the excitement go? The creation and release of rythmic tension which had been rock's signature? Instead we find lyrics with a pretension to depth, and which are in fact staggeringly banal. We find music of leaden obviousness. The antidotes? Dylan, Neil Young, The Band, The Clash, The Sex Pistols. You know, music with a pulse, instead of musical necrophilia."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not the same","review":"I am not a music critic, but I do like Pink Floyd. I got this for my birthday and when I began I did not realize it was not PF. I am horrible at knowing music, but it didn't take me long at all to realize this was off. The sound is not as strong, the beats are different, and the voice is flatter. THEN I got to the 2nd disc. I was listening to my favorite song and it did not sound like it was supposed to at all. In fact it was quite a bad take. From that point on the songs were a little off key (to me at least) and nothing like the orginals. I agree with one of the previous reviews that there is not the same feeling as you get with Waters. Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Har Har Har","review":"The out of phase album clearly says T R I B U T E are you all stupid.

I would give it 4 stars,but this review is not about album content but the remastering of it. I had a cassette version and wanted to buy the remastered version from the year 2000. I received the CD that was remastered in 1994. I know there is a difference because when I set my car CD player dial at 11 o\\"clock I get the maximum sound but when it's not remastered I do not get sufficient sound at that level. I ask the question: Are there two different remastered copies (1994 & 2000) or is The Wall just a victim of bad remastering?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"The Wall by Pink Floyd is, in my opinion, one of best albums. To reinforce this, let me state that The Wall is the biggest selling double album of all time. I can't say it enough: This album is a must for people of all ages. It suits everybody. 'Comfortably Numb' and 'Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2' are arguably some of the best songs in rock history. The Wall keeps you hooked from start to finish. If you don't have it, get it. You will have no regrets for buying this great album. It leaves you comfortably numb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines concept Rock","review":"This CD truly tells a story--somtimes haunting, sometimes oppressive, but a real story!

But, odd as it may seem, this album is one that I heard after all of the others.Like the title of my review indicates, I hold that this album has only a few redeeming qualities. While songs such as \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\\" and \\"Hey You\\" would obviously be qualified as redeeming qualites, it possesses a few others. Mother and Comfortably Numb are both enjoyable songs, as well as the short Vera, which, I personally would prefer to be a little, if not alot, longer.I give it two stars because it is not anything like the musical genious portrayed in Dark Side of the Moon and a few of their other albums. I would not go as far as to reccommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE GREATEST COLLECTION OF MUSIC EVER!","review":"Starting out as a beginning Floyd enthusiast, I first purchased The Wall.

The only things that compare are The Who's Tommy and Jesus Christ Superstar. Waters' lyrics are amazing, gilmour's solos are phenomenal. Buy this album. I am 15 years old and I love it. I think this is probably one of the most underrated albums of its time. The songs are all so good that you can just sit there and listen to all of them without having to skip to your favorite tracks. I can't say that about many albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This album blew me away! The level of creativity and intent far exceeds about anything I've heard.

Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you've broken through The Wall, you can't come back...","review":"In one word: Engulfing In two words: The Wall Are these guys from another planet? Do they come from a world where people can actually write decent music? They must. In a way, this album paralells each and every one of our lives. It is about depression and repression, not being able to fight back. It is a story, in short, of a character named Pink Floyd, who is held back by a superficial boundary conjured up by society. He lives inside his own mind, but is still held captive by society. \\"The Wall\\" is everything. It has encompassed Pink's reality and forced him to near insanity. The themes that Waters displays are genius. But tastefully genius. He wrote powerful words and even more powerful songs. He wrote about the truthes in all of our lives, and for that, he should be hailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This is by far one of the BEST recordings of it's day.

Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Floyd's best, but still great.","review":"I don't think this is Floyd's best album, but it is rock solid. I've always prefered Meddle to this.

The album and then the film transformed our lives and we didn't even know it at the time. All we really knew is that it was very, very good and we knew then (even as teens) that it was a masterpiece. The last great collaboration by the four remaining members post-Barrett. The Wall wasn't meant to be radio-friendly, however, the decaying AOR stations made many of the individual songs radio-friendly by means of minimal editing. Anyone who knows this work can tell you that any one song taken from the album can stand alone but the original color is lost if not consumed as a whole with all the parts intact.No need to go on-and-on about this cornerstone of modern pop music, just give it a listen, judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a diehard Floyd fan....","review":"If you love Pink Floyd, then you must own this box set.

The first two discs are basically last years remasters, the next 2 are a re-release of the live \\"Is there anybody out there\\" from 2000, quality is more or less the same, slightly better. The 4th and 5th discs are great and DVD is ok. So essentially, only real floyd fans are going to buy this and they will already have discs 1-4, so they are paying big money for 2 cds and dvd basically.If you never had the Wall its probably reasonable value, still think its over priced"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterly Masterpiece","review":"\\"The Wall\\" is a towering Pink Floyd masterpiece from the brilliantly tormented mind of rock's literary genius, Roger Waters. David Gilmour takes somewhat of a supporting role here but he shines with his trademark vocals and unbeatable guitar. No one on earth plays like David Gilmour. Mason and Wright are further in the background but contribute their flavor as well.So much has been said already about \\"The Wall\\" that I won't take up the space to rehash the \\"plot\\". This amazing piece of composition is like an operatic, psychological rock journey through hope, despair, pain, alienation and once again a glimmer of hope. Although it is very personal it also becomes universal in its treatment of themes of the loss of childhood innocence, horrors of indoctrination into society, familial angst and the \\"numbing\\" of growing into adulthood and disillusionment. Everything about \\"The Wall\\" entitles it to be called a A Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"Pink Floyd is the most creative, inspirational and unique band ever created. No doubt. They are true talents with a constant desire to experiment and compose works of art that will last for at least decades into the future. Please, ignore all the kid's reviews and forgive them for their narrow-minded and immature opinions. Although this album is very different from other, earlier albums, I highly recommend it for it musical genious as well as the thought-provoking themes, and the visible effort that went into the album's creation. This is unlike the album's of today's music which are pointless, repetitive, and show that the artist or band put absolutely no thought into its creation, since music in the present is all about getting rich with the least effort possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best Floyd album","review":"All I can say is that this is, while not as good as DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, is still a very awesome album. I own this and all I can say is that every song here is amazing. Hell you should buy this just because 'Another Brick in the Wall, part 2' is on this, which is probably Pink Floyds most famous song. That loser Sunburnt Albino (aka Henry McPruter) will burn in hell for insulting Pink Floyd! Unless he's joking then he doesn't deserve to live, well maybe not that bad, but he is still a retard. Pink Floyd is the best band that uses a keyboard and thats still around.

THe line above refers to a line in a song from the album called \\"MOTHER\\", it's fantastic. While \\"The Wall\\" is not Pink Floyd's best album, it comes close. It features Parts 1, 2 and 3 of \\"Another brick in the Wall\\" which is the only way to fully appreciate this song. The radio edit version is good, but not as effective as the album version.Other standout tracks include:Comfortably Numb - This song sends shivers up my spine every single time I hear it. If you enjoyed \\"On the turning away\\" (from their Momentary Lapse of Reason album) you will love this, they have a similar feel to them.Run Like Hell - the introduction to this is simply brilliant.Released in 1979, it was ahead of its time then. Re-released in 1999 as a new digital remaster, it should have stated on the sticker \\"20 Year Anniversary\\" but got a \\"30 Year Anniversary\\" sticker by mistake. A small detail. The new digital remaster is worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST insul to Pink Floyd and their fans","review":"This is the worst piece of recorded music I have ever heard, not because it is bad in its own escence, it sucks because the vocal, solos, hooks, choruses, everything in it falls so short to what a Pink Floyd's The Wall 2000 Tribute should be, I have heard PF tributes in the past and I own and enjoy a couple of them.

Why!","review":"I'm not a really big fan of Pink Floyd. I just heard Roger Waters music and I liked it, and I knew he was in Pink Floyd before, so I bought this CD. It was not rock, it was techno music, I thought that that was the original Pink Floyd, but now I learned that it wasn't. I started to think diffrently at Pink Floyd music, but then I saw in some retail stores it had a 4 disc pack named \\"The Wall\\" and I started to think that this tribute was some remix, not the original Pink Floyd music.

No one is going to listen to these demos more than once. The other 2 Experience editions are worthwhile, but again, why not some live material on the earlier albums? Live material from some old tv specials could have been backed on More or Meddle - just as one example. I've been listening to Pink Floyd since the 1st album, which we had to buy as an Import when it first came out, so I'm an old-time fan. I'd give the Wall 5 stars in general but not this.

Maybe I'm missing something. How can I go against the grain like this when the songs ('Comfortably Numb,' 'Part 2') are undeniably staples of classic rock radio? At any rate, in the thick of it I'll stick to my convictions: I didn't like FORREST GUMP and I don't like Everclear and I don't like THE WALL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of All-Time","review":"This is the Best album I have ever heard.Every single song on this CD is Great. This CD is truly a classic if you dont own it you need to buy it right now. It consists of classic songs like \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". This is a must own album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best concept album in rock history","review":"Pink Floyd second best album (1. Dark side of the moon) the wall is musically, lirically AWESOME. For me this is by far the best concept album, some people say Sgt Pepper. What!! They are just couple of songs without coherence. Waters created an excellent concept with Great music with little help from Gilmour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustipated","review":"I havent bough this CD but... I think an attempt at creating a dance version of The Wall is a pretty cool idea in this day and age. But this is crap. Just listen to the sound files on this page, and if you havent heard the original Pink Floyd album, listen to the sound files for that and compare. No contest. Even if you somehow dont like the original The Wall, how can you like this?? So sterile and lifeless. Especially the vocals, its like a moron singing in his sleep, no really. Also, they could have at least made this album on a decent whatever the hell it is you use to make all these lame sounds called techno. But it sounds like a MIDI file, frighteningly so. The same goes for their horrible attempt at Dark Side of the Moon 2001. Hello, Out of Phase?? What are you doing? Talk about a bad career choice. You guys suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Remastering","review":"I purchased Dark Side and Wish You Were Here experience versions and The Wall(reg remastered version) I loved both Dark Side and Wish,but The Wall is not remastered at all!! I am not an audiofile by any stretch,but even I can tell how muffled the sound is on the entire recording.It reminds me of the recent Black Sabbath remasters,and the Sony Legacy remasters..neither of them are remastered at all,just re packaged...and thats what this is too,I am SO disappointed by this.I just dont know what else to say.Im tempted to find the last re-release of this cd and see if it sounds any better.,"},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience, that's for sure","review":"I picked this up at Best Buy when I was off to recycle a busted laptop, and stuck it in my car's stereo on the way back. Seeing as I wasn't going to be born for another six years when the album came out, this was the first time I was able to listen to it all the way through (I had previously heard Another Brick In The Wall (Part II) and Hey You), and it did not disappoint.Listening to it was an experience. The music was enjoyable, but it gave me the sensation of being slightly high and slightly ill. Always fun. Still, it was an extremely enjoyable album"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wall is one of the greatest albums of all time!","review":"For anyone who is a fan of a true musical \\"expierience\\"-Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is for you. Argueabley the greatest Floyd disc ever, this 2 CD rock epic takes you through the dark alley that is lead singer Roger Waters' mind. His life story is told so well through \\"Comfortabley Numb\\" and \\"Hey You\\"-this Disc is a MUST own for any true Floyd fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why it is one of Pink Floyd's best","review":"Fear, angst, alienation find a salve in Roger Waters' seminal work, The Wall. David Gilmour's vocals and guitar purify Waters' dark, bleak lyrical world, while Nick Mason's always-on percussion kick in the windows and smash in the doors of the oppressed and oppressors. Post-war disillusion and a domineering mother models Pink's childhood, and fosters isolation in subsequent intimate relationships. This is not background music but rather a soundtrack for those of us coming to terms with the post-industrial, post-patriarchal paradigm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Concept, Great Music, A Lot Of Songs, What Else Could You Ask For?","review":"The Wall has to be one of the best albums of all time. The concept is just completely genius and makes you think about what each song actually means. The music has a very sonic, spacey atmosphere and is a pleasure to listen to (especially David Gilmour's brilliant guitar work), and best of all it is filled with classic, timeless songs. Sure the introludes do get anoying, but because of the albums concept even they mean something in the story, best song is \\"Young Lust\\", great song for driving around in the city at night. I recommend this album to any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, it's the Wall. Enough already!","review":"Why are you reading this review? It's the Wall. Don't you own it already?

Not only the \\"The Dead Father\\" and \\"Roger against War\\", but also the circle of life with the ending of \\"Outside the Wall\\"(Is this where...) and the very begining of \\"In the Flesh?\\"(...get in?). It's not fear to comment the Wall without seeing the film or the show, then you'll understand. Another Brick is as a whole, great, and so is CN and Hey You. In closing: It's not the worst, and it's not the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"one of the best albums of all time right up there with the beatles white album, rolling stones let it bleed, and jimi hendrix electric ladyland."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Wall is not gonna be fall!","review":"Pink Floyd was a intresting band that played a very strange music! It's a some kind miracle that Pink Floyd came so popular and cult band. This double-disc album is their most ambitious protect! There are many classic songs that you can hear on the radio or disco for exemple Another Brick on the Wall part 2, which came one of the Floyd's music listeners favourites. My own favourite songs are dramatic Mother, brilliant The Thin Ice, aggressive Hey You and awesome Confortable Numb. There are too many ballads on the Wall and some weak lenks for exemple One of My Turns. All in all, This album is just another brick on the great music Wall, which stays there until the end of the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Floyd at its best","review":"This is by far Pink Floyd's best work. Beneath the melodic songs lies a common theme of torment, anguish, and despair, as well as a chronology of a rock star's struggles with fame and its pitfalls. This CD is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most extream range of mood pieces of music.","review":"The Wall has some of the best instramentally skilled work Pink Floyd has ever recorded and the prodiction and recording /mixing quality is fantasic.

Loved \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", loved \\"Wish You Were Here\\". Then comes The Wall, with \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\".\\"We don't need no education...\\" When I first heard that, those many years ago, I was completely enraged. Perhaps the Floyds were protesting the system in place at the time, but I survived it with my faculties intact and then and now enraged at the general level of ignorance in American society. Without education, we'd still be living at the cultural level of gorillas and chimpanzees.Somewhere in the boxes unpacked since several moves ago are those original 33rpm LP records of \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" ,and the cassette tapes I copied from them .

Overproduced, pretentious, and depressing Roger Waters' arrogance permeates throughout the work.This 2-CD set could easily have been condensed into one CD. It has exactly four good songs: \\"Another Brick In The Wall Part I\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Young Lust\\", and \\"Run\\".There are far better Pink Floyd CDs than \\"The Wall\\" including \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Meddle\\", \\"Pink Floyd\\", and \\"Echoes, Best of Pink Floyd\\".If you want excessive, pretentious CDs that are well done, buy something like Queen's \\"A Night At the Opera\\", Yes' \\"Close To the Edge\\", Emerson Lake and Palmer's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\", or Rick Wakeman's \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth\\". If you want two CDs of Roger Waters whining, then \\"The Wall\\" is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold Up","review":"None of Pink Floyd's albums really justify the hype, and this one is no exception. Individually, the song \\"The Wall\\" is appealing, but there isn't much else that really creates a desire to play this repeatedly. That said, it's definitely better than the tremendously overhyped Dark Side of the Moon, but still doesn't stand up to the achievements of the better artists of that era. If you are looking to build your collection, better to go for the Rolling Stones, Led Zep or Fleetwood Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like 3 Good Songs, The Rest Is horrible filler","review":"I can't believe I wasted my money on this awful album...

I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan but this album doesn't rate as a great album, let alone a great Floyd album. I can't think of a Pink Floyd album much worse than this. Nothing really than Roger Waters wailing and whining about stupid B.S. The lyrics are very uninspiring. While there are a couple of songs on here worth listening to there just is not enough to warrant listening to this entire album. Don't let someone fool you into thinking this album is anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Water's not Floyd","review":"I think this albam is possibly Floyds worst most Roger's ego conceited albam. There are only 2 good songs on this albam with David Gilmore on them. I think that this albam isn't even a great Floyd record, but if your a Floyd fan you have to get it just because of on my favorite songs Confortably Numb, but I think this isn't a Floyd record I say it A Roger Water's Solo record and should be marketed as such..Pink Floyd has way better music then anything on the albam. If you want to get a better Floyd albam by Piper at the Gate Dawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont understand why any Pink Floyd fan could like The Wall","review":"The Wall is absolutly the worst Pink Floyd album ever made. I love Pink Floyd and their music but when I bought The Wall is was deeply disappointed because the Wall doesn't sound like any of the good Pink Floyd albums such as Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, Wish You were Here, ect. Pink FLoyd didn't use very much musical talent in this Cd and the lyrics are disappointing (the mention of a wall is endless and boring). This doesn't sound anything like the Pink FLoyd in the sixties and sevendies, they sound like a stupid eighties band that has no musical talent. \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"In the Flesh\\", are just some of the songs that sound horrible and rushed. If you want to buy a good Floyd Cd check out anything but the Wall and you will be happy you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Great album, even with all of the self-indulgent lyrics.

Brilliant. But as far as the remastering goes, they still haven't got it right. In a time when music can be remastered to where it sounds like the band is playing live in your living room, not everyone incorporates this available technology in the remastering process. The Beatles remasters are stunning. Depeche Mode remasters on DVD are perhaps the best of all remastering projects I've ever heard, The Cure did a fine job, U2 eh okay could've been better... and Pink Floyd - eh could've been better, and The Wall stands out as most disappointing. \\"In The Flesh?\\" should kick off like it's going to tear down your living room walls by its sheer intensity. Instead, it sounds slightly better than the mid-1990's remaster. Skip this if you already own it. It's not worth re-buying just for an ever so slightly better sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pink Floyd!","review":"Unlike my husband I am not a major Floyd fan, but at the same time I do enjoy it. This CD was not what I had expected at all. I have to agree with \\"A music fan from Texas\\". If you are a major fan you will find this CD disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This is a very different version of \\"The Wall,\\" just as Roger Waters' 1990 concert in Berlin was a new take on the all time greatest rock recording. It makes sense to me that an artist or group would redo an entire epic in this way. Any good piano player learns Beethoven and Bach, just as all good jazz musicians do new versions of classics.Out of Phase is a band that I have never heard of, but I feel that they have done justice to \\"The Wall.\\"My main complaint with this album is that is lacks the personal feeling that Roger Waters injected into the work. When he speaks of 'daddy,' it really is his daddy that he is singing about. That is lost in this remake.I personally don't like \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\\" without the boy's chior singing the second verse, but that is forgivable.A solid collection that should be looked at by any serious Pink Floyd/Roger Waters fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd The Wall 2000","review":"This is was not at all what I expected.

This is a must have, period. As with most Pink Floyd recordings, important to listen to this from start to finish. See the movie release, also. Worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"For all you Syd loving, Waters hating retro closed minded people, you are ignorant. Pink Floyd made their best music with Waters at the helm, not Syd. (yes I have listened to Piper, blah blah). The Wall, like many others have said is a concept album. Don't expect to pick this up and have a radio single for every track. Even though there are a few (Comfortably Numb, Hey You, Another Brick in the Wall Pt2) It is best listened to straight through as you probably already know. Anyone who appreciates music should have this in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"I love this album, it is one of the three Pink Floyd vinyls I purchased.

The 5.1 versions sounded great and truly provided an immersion experience. When The Wall arrived I was disappointed to see no 5.1 or quad recordings, so I returned The Wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"The Wall is undoubtedly a masterpiece. The sheer musical quality of this album is amazing, and after you listen to this album it will definitely change your life. The lyrics are alternately brash and painful; the music is sometimes haunting and sometimes takes on a more clearly defined pop music edge. The album contains several songs which have become anthems of the past three decades, including Another Brick In The Wall, Hey You and Comfortably Numb. The album also stands out for the sheer variety of sound effects used in its making, including planes, a school choir, televisions, films, synthesised effects and accompaniments to songs. The work was probably Pink Floyd's last truly great work before Roger Waters left. This album is definitely worth having, and will become a staple of your music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic - But where are the missing tracks?","review":"That monumental concept album \\"The Wall\\" is a classic is pretty well known by now. The problem with this release is that it is missing two songs. When the original vinyl LP came out there were two songs (\\"What Shall We Do Now\\" and \\"The Last Few Bricks\\") that they had two cut because there wasn't enough recording space on that old medium. However, with CDs there is no such space restriction. So how come the songs aren't here? The live version (\\"Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live\\") includes the two missing songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE!","review":"My brother JOHN and I got this album for Christmas back in1979 and I remember thinking at the time what a great album itwas!

Never before on any PINK FLOYD album had thesound effects and dialogue been so successfully mixed in withthe music. And there are so many great songs here! This albumhas it's share of hard rockers, like IN THE FLESH(my favoritesong here), YOUNG LUST, RUN LIKE HELL and also has some lovelymelodic softer numbers, like COMFORTABLY NUMB, MOTHER, HEY YOUand practically all of side three! The string arrangements area nice touch, the lyrics are brilliant, the singing is verystrong, this album has it all. At the time, this album was veryunique; there's never been a concept album like it!

It sounds just like some stereotypical dance music, like the singer was totally ignorant of the song's meanings. And I bet you, this is why so many people hate this album.So, if you're okay with the idea of turning a masterpiece into a bunch of simple run-of-the-mill electronica, then you might consider checking this one out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"more ambitious than dark side, not as perfect, but still great","review":"the best rock opera ever (yes, better than Tommy), this complex tale weaves elements of syd barrett's life with elements from Roger Waters' past (plus of course imagination).

There are many great songs on this album, but the are quite a few that aren't so great also. Also this album doesn't have as great of a flow as Dark Side of the Moon. For new fans I'd recommend the more accesible Dark Side of the Moon first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen the better it tastes","review":"When I first bought The Wall and listened to the first few songs, I was wondering what the big deal was. However, the more I listened to songs like Comfortably Numb,Young Lust, Nobody Home, and Run Like Hell, The more I liked it. I didn't really get into some of Roger Waters' songs(Comfortably Numb was a revamp of a David Gilmour song which they then colaborated on, and Young Lust and Run Like Hell were written by Gilmour, don't let the sleeve fool you), But I think that a lot of people have and will love his work( I love what he did on Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here). David Gilmour's guitar solo on Comfortably Numb is possibly his best ever, definately his most dramatic, and his work on other songs that I mentioned is great too. So basically I didn't go for the story, but it is still one of my three favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is one of the best pieces of music I own by anyone. It is the complete story of the life of one man, how he builds up a wall around him to keep out reality, and how he eventually realises how evil he has become and tears the whole thing down. Deep and moving, I listen to it locked in my room with the lights off and no distrctions from the music. I definatly recommend this CD. It does have one flaw though. It could have been just one CD instead of two. But a great album none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album is absolutely incredible. Listening to it is like taking a strange journey through another world. The songs all fit together to tell a story. If you think Dark Side of the Moon is weird, you've gotta hear this one. It has even weirder sound effects and audio clips, and the songs are more wicked. One of the songs, \\"In the Flesh\\", may be offensive to some people, but hey, don't take it personally. I recommend Pink Floyd to just about anybody, especially The Wall. They're one of the great bands of our time. Also, if by some incredible circumstance the only version of \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" you've heard is Class of '99, then you really need to check this one out. It's about a thousand times better. One more thing. I haven't seen the movie, but I'm going to check it out, so I recommend doing the same. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religious experience","review":"I'm not claiming this is Floyd's best album, but when it first came out, I kicked back, put on the earphones, and was absolutely stunned by Water's lyrics and Gilmore's \\"crying\\" guitar.

It was a good experience to go on-line while doing other things and in a couple of days get music for my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Foxx Has Done it Again","review":"For everyone who slept on Jamie's singing before, this one is for you, for all the rest who knew of his talent, we aren't surprised. He said he made the CD for the ladies, but my boyfriend jams it more than I do. Highly recommended. Make sure you get the copy with the dvd extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Is Break'n it off on this one","review":"The Cd is laid back, a few of the cuts for the laid back slow motion evening; chill'n about to knock the boots type songs. Warm Bed, Three letter word are sure to get the panties off. Now the Song with Mary J, Love Changes. Man that is a hook! Whew, Off key, missed notes, so with that, that removes a star. Other than that, the CD is off the da chain."},{"rating":"1","title":"ms. Libra","review":"Jamie Foxx needs to stick to acting because he is a far better actor than singer. i was very disappointed in his latest try at making another cd. give it up Jamie, and stick to being funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice.....but","review":"Jamie has a great voice no doubting that, but when it comes down to putting a track together its not even close to be good. I thought the title track \\"Unpredictable\\" was decent so I purchased the album thinking Kanye would help a brother out and put some slammin beats together for him (being they've worked on 2 great hits already). But I came up extremely disappointed, the title track is probably the best song on the album, which is not saying much. Not a total loss though, I also purchased Mary J Blige's \\"Unbreakable\\" album and it is off the hook!! Get that album instead and you won't regret it, its one of those albums that you play the whole way through without skipping any songs, don't you love that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cash In","review":"This cd is pure dreck and it's just another example of the \\"flavor of the month\\" actor/wanna be singer trying to cash in on his current notoriety. Geared toward the ghetto illiterates with the dirty raps,language and moronic lyrics. Just goes to show what passes for entertainment these days. I wish all these half wits that are praising this piece of crap would learn how to spell first. You have no business posting a review on here. Go back to school or stay in the projects! No stars for the cd at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Jamie I was hoping for","review":"Jamie Foxx has one of the smoothest voices out there. I've always thought that. I was also hoping that he would put out another album. But now that he has it out, I regret making that statement. This album is not good at all. There are maybe one or two nice songs on the album but otherwise, it's not something that I would add to my collection. I'm glad my sister bought this album and not me. It's all for her. She seems to enjoy it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted talent","review":"Hey Jamie! I hope this is one review that you take to heart. I was excited about you singing again. I believe you have a beautiful voice. I was hoping you would have come with some music that would change the music industry not just fit in. I call this wasted talent because you are so gifted but you are using your gifts to futher promote music that does not add to the betterment of people. There are more things in life than money, power, and sex.Disappointed fan! Cole"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"...disappointing...\\"","review":"A marvellous actor; an incredible voice - but why is it that his album is one of the most unoriginal and dull experiences that so many of us are fed up of hearing? \\"Unpredictable\\" is a disappointing album that will probably be a success amongst those faint-hearted fans of the cheesy, cliché love-songs that have come to make me feel nauseous. All I can say is, Jamie, I know you can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this CD. I truly thought Jamie Foxx had musical talent, but this is pure GARBAGE. The lyrics are very tacky. Too bad, because I was very excited to buy the CD and now, I can't wait to trade it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent the wrong CD and they did not yet reply to email","review":"I have asked the vendor about exchanging to no avail. They sent the right CD jacket but the contents was two blank CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, Great actor, but Mediocre CD","review":"This CD has about 4 really good songs on it, but I wish I had just gone on iTunes and bought those 4 songs individually because I spent $19 on an overall MEDIOCRE CD. If you're like me, and you want almost the whole CD to be great, don't buy this! I'm a big fan of Jamie Foxx, and I still really enjoy him in many ways, but GREAT music is GREAT music. And this is just MEDIOCRE music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be something else to sing about!!!","review":"I've liked Jamie Foxx ever since I saw him as Wanda on In Living Color and on his show when he would sing sometime, I just couldn't wait from him to make an album so that I could hear him sing all the time. Now that he has it's really disappointing!! I've only listened to it three times hoping that I could find a couple of songs I could like but nothing. I still like Jamie Foxx but if he makes another album like this, I think he should just stick to what he does best... ACTING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"My daughter won this CD from a local hip-hop station. After seeing Jamie Foxx in \\"Ray,\\" and reading articles about his musical education and upbringing, I thought it would be okay for her have his CD. When we picked it up, I was surprised to find that Jamie Foxx, a parent himself, would release an album that requires a parental advisory warning. If it hadn't been free, I wouldn't have allowed her to have it, and have since confiscated it because of the sexual content. I am disappointed in Jamie Foxx. I expected better from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute GARBAGE!!!","review":"If I could give this CD \\"0\\" stars I would have. 1-star is way too much. When I saw that Jamie Foxx had a new CD out I was shocked because I hadn't heard any promotions of it. After wasting my money on this CD, I can see why. I must admit that Jamie, due to the Oscar winning, is become overexposed and without question OVERRATED. This CD is horrible. Now I am a very liberal person but this CD goes too far. I agree with an early reviewer who said that it sounds as if it only took Jamie 5 minutes to write the lyrics. I think Jamie has started to believe the hype about himself. I have 3 words for you---SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Jamie, all I can say is you need to come back down to earth my brother. You are out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like it took 15 minutes to write these tracks","review":"It always amazes me how anyone can be drawn to tracks that clearly sound like there was hardly any thought in the arrangements. Ya'll have to check out Jamiroquai and his new album dynamite. Now here's an example of music that first off was an asswoop to create/arrange/write. You'll be blown away. Its classified as acid Jazz, and it is definitely the top 5 albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Foxx is the man!!!","review":"Unpredictable the album is the stuff for 2006. This album is very predictable in the fact that he talks about sex throughout. But the songs are catchy and they stay in your mind forever. \\"Unpredictable\\" is the bomb on the radio and in the club and last weekend at the club they were playing \\"Extravaganza\\" and the club was dancing to his music. This cd is playing all the time in my car. This is a great listen and Jamie got the singing chops to sing these songs. Go out and buy this one you won't be dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictable....Love It!","review":"When I first listened to the CD, I wasn't feeling it and I wasn't expecting sex to be mentioned in 13 of the 15 songs...LOL...but then I listened the CD again while traveling during the holidays and fell in love with it. I've always thought Jamie had a great singing voice and it's good to see him doing well in this area as well as his acting. This is definitely his season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to any R&B collection","review":"When I got this for Christmas I played it instantly and I was satisified. After a lot of hype due to his performances in A+ movies such as \\"Ray Charles\\" & \\"Collateral\\" I would honestly have a hard time deciding if he is better at movies or music. His voice is a lot better than some other male R&B stars in music right now. Some highlights on the CD are \\"Can I Take U Home,\\" \\"Extravaganza\\" f/ Kanye West, \\"Heaven\\" and most importantly \\"Wish U Were Here\\" which is a tribute to his grandmother. His voice really sticks out on all these songs. I wish this CD the best of success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrically challenged","review":"Even after just reading the title to the songs, I didn't think there was going to be anything \\"Unpredictable\\" about this album. I listened to it and confirmed that this album is a total waste of resources and energy. I'm so surprised that it has 4 out of 5 stars here on Amazon. There is one subject that this album is about. It seems like when he wrote the lyrics he had to be thinking \\"they'll love it because I'm Jamie Foxx\\". Maybe he got his ghetto teenage cousin to write these lyrics because they are hideous. I can't blame the man for milking the cow while he's hot though, but I'm truly disappointed (but not too surprised because his first album wasn't that great either) that he couldn't put out a decent product. I'm all for supporting black, but we should expect quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jamie Foxx - Unpredictable","review":"HATED IT!!! I should have read reviews first. Not at all what I expected. He has a wonderful voice but it was NOT showcased at all. Lyrics are VERY explicit! I could never listen with my young kids in the house...but the CD will not be around here long enough for anyone to hear. I don't care that he thinks about sex every minute or how much he drank or where he ended up! What a voice!!! too bad he wasted it on crappy lyrics. Maybe he should stick to acting. Reminds me of the trainwreck Madonna made with her sex book several years back! Who cares how much sex Foxx is having give me some good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Closely","review":"I hate clean cd's. I haven't figured out what's clean yet. I'm guessing Game's rap, I think I can live with that. I was worried because I knew the whole thing was about sex. No wonder I found it used, some other sucker probably opened before they figured out it was a clean cd. They need to put all those in one section. But anyway, it's good riding music on the way to his or her house. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"...mature rhythm and blues","review":"This is an excellent album with some cuts that seduce you. A couple of the dance tracks are questionable but they might grow on me in time. Overall no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I usually read a bit about a CD before I buy it but in this case I just went out and bought the CD before reading reviews. I think Jamie Foxx is an incredibly talented man on many levels. I know he has an extensive musical background so I thought I was safe spending my money on his CD. What a dissappointment the CD turned out to be and a waste of money. He can sing and play but beyond that the CD falls short. Lyrically the songs never rise above the \\"damn woman, I know what you want and I'm the only one who can give it to you like you want\\" vein. With the wealth of talent that appears on the CD you would expect some originality and inovation....it's just not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what it do","review":"Okay so if you'll read my reviews then you'll know that I'm really feeling Jamie Foxx as of late and yes, I've seriously been singing his praises. UNPREDICTABLE was heavily sought out in the streets of Chicago; want to know how I know? I was all over the place looking to purchase it.Jamie Foxx is stepping up his game! No longer just a comedian with the ability to make you laugh, or an actor who can open your eyes, but he's proven that he has the ability to sing. I don't mean that mess where it's a ton of voice over work either, Jamie is a gifted artist who makes listening to his CD a pleasure.Unpredictable is actually one of those CD's that you can play when you need to mellow out while riding through the busy streets and not lose your cool. Because ya'll know I suffer from road rage, right?I LOVE each song, the beats, the collaborations and it's good to hear quality music coming back to R&B;."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Talented","review":"Make no mistake...this is for real. For those who slept on his 1995 debut \\"Peep This\\", you need to look no further than this album for proof that Eric Bishop, as funny as he is, from Terrell, TX is no joke! His debut on J Records is a fantastic effort that brings back the mid 90's sexed-up R&B feel first brought to the forefront by groups such as Jodeci, R.Kelly & Public Announcement and Silk...Jamie is in full control and displays all his swagger and a great voice throughout the album. He is also backed by very dope, sexy production that he floats effortlessly over. Vocal production and songwriting is above average as well (Tank, Mike City, etc). If you're looking for a dope album to throw on, bump front to back, ride to or grind to with your significant other...I suggest you cop \\"Unpredictable\\" immediately!!! VERY DOPE ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"triple threat","review":"Jamie knocked it out the box! again, another case of a cd that didnt get enough airplay but word of mouth paid off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Jaime Foxx is a great actor and also a great artist.

Unfortunately, he doesn't have his own sound or definitive style. At times it seems as if someone else is singing. As I listened, I also wondered who the audience might be for this album with the extremes of sincere ballads which seemed in sharp contrast to raunchy, blatantly sexual lyrics.The only songs I listen to on the CD are:1. Unpredictable5. Can I Take U Home13. U Still Got It (love Common)14. Heaven15. Wish U Were HereBy the way, he and Mary J. Blige destroyed Love Changes. When is somebody going to take away Mary J. Blige's microphone? The chick cannot sing.I found Jamie Foxx more sexy before he made the CD. Now I am just TURNED OFF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down.","review":"I was really looking forward to hearing this album... and when I bought it and put in it my car to listen on the drive home, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Every song is strangely and immaturely sexual... and his talent is taken over with sexual innuedo and pathetic stereotypical subject matter, lyrics, beats etc...DO NOT waste your money on this one.His talent is wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanna Be Impressed!!!","review":"Just bought the CD and was not really moved by what I heard ....UNTIL I got to \\"Wish You Were Here\\". That song says everthing about what you can feel about a loved one that is no longer here on earth. Otherwise, the CD (and his recent TV Special for that matter) is extremely 'average' to me.I know he is a talented actor and he has recorded in the past (with Gladys Knight) but based on the track mentioned above and \\"Three Letter Word\\", I am not happy with this project. There is way too much cussin' (yes, I said CUSSIN') (lol) and sexual messages here for me. I will probably give it away!!Maybe next time :("},{"rating":"2","title":"JAMIE FOXX has ARRIVED!!!!","review":"I'm in love! Jamie Foxx has out done himself this time. Sensual is the best description. Fresh is the next best. It feels so good to purchase an album where all of the songs are pleasing to the ears.

You won't be disappoint it is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It !!","review":"Yep, I ran out and got it the first day !! Was expecting Jamie to \\"tickle the ivories\\" a little more, but this is just a re-hashing of every hip-hop artist's works from the past 5 or so years.

This is something I never heard before, there tracks in here that can be played in parties and summertime dawg. The most hot songs in here is \\"With You\\", \\"Extravaganza\\", \\"Heaven\\", \\"DJ Play A Love Song\\" and \\"Three Letter Word\\". This album is definitely a grammy award you know what I'm sayin'. Cop this album right now. I ain't playin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is PREDICTABLE!","review":"It is a typical no-talent, hip-hop, sampled cd that has become common today. I love Jamie Foxx, and was really believing that he would put out a fabulous album; but someone in his entourage should tell him that his fan-base is much larger than the groupies that he takes home with him every night. This entire album is an \\"ode to a one night stand\\" and partying in the VIP. With a voice like his and the musical training he has, I was expecting ballads and songs to make my imagination run wild. Instead I received his diary of meeting women on the dance floor to take to the Embassey, and his description of taking them to the VIP to perform acts on him to \\"get that money.\\" The album is full of machine beats...what happened to the piano Jamie?! Its a great album for the young club hoppers; but for the mature audience....GIVE ME A BREAK! I thought Jamie was much bigger than that. He may as well be a rapper, because he definately isn't using his talent on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!!!","review":"THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE ON PERMANENT ROTATION IN MY CAR, HOUSE, WORK, ETC. YOU GET THE PICTURE. I guess the people who are surprised or act like they just found out Jamie Foxx could sing haven't been fans for very long. He's always sang in his comedy acts and on his show. Wonderful voice, wonderful actor! ENOUGH SAID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Foxx is 4 real!","review":"I purchased this CD on its release date. I was very happy with the album. Jamie Foxx spent time with the lyric's and beats and you would know as you listen to it. I believe it's one of the greatest album's I've purchased this year.

Jamie's slow grooves are very sexy and the up-tempo songs are bouncin'!!! I really like this CD because it's dedicated to the ladies and it's not too racy and it's not too lame, it's just right. Songs like Heaven and Wish U Were Here are very therapeutic and they're very beautiful songs.

Of course I like the title track and \\"Can I Take You Home,\\" but \\"Storm\\" and \\"Love Changes\\" are my favorites. My girlfriends and I agree that this cd could get one in trouble ... if you know what I mean! :-) This cd is GREAT to listen to on continous play during your house party, card party, stepping lessons, cleaning day, etc. I don't know what all the hatin' is about -- It's da bomb to me!

With the exception of \\"Heaven\\" and \\"VIP\\" this sounds just like every other R&B song out there. Like R&B itself these days, Foxx's CD is very predictable. Obviosusly, Foxx is smart enough to realize that he has to market his CD towards women, so most of the songs are something that women would probably get into. Although, they have to be somewhat turned off by his \\"player\\" style. Foxx does sound good as a singer, but his song choices fail him in the end. As I said \\"Heaven\\" and \\"VIP\\" are the only songs worth listening to on here. As the other songs are dull and very predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Foxx","review":"Do some of you people actually think you're going to get noticed by magazines or newspapers for writing long reviews on each song and what you think of it?

Go buy this album you will love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Foxx truely is \\"Unpredictable\\"","review":"What can I say, Jamie is and always will be talented. I never have let the fact that Jamie, being a great actor/comedian forshadow that he can sing. A lot of people don't take his music seriously because he's an actor and/or comedian....Nah, that sounds more like an excuse to me.Anyhow, \\"Unpredictable\\" is a very ballad heavy album, and that's not a bad thing either. This album has a lot of great songs. Unpredictable is definatly a must buy album!My favorite tracks in order:Track 10: VIP 10/10 Great beat, great lyrics/vocals...I just love songs with violins in them.Track 7: Extravaganza 9/10 Catchy song, great lyrics/vocals with a nice rap peice by Mr. West!Track 1: Unpredictable 9/10 Great first single. Love this song and Ludacriss rap verse adds.Track 2: Warm Bed 9/10 Another great song, nice dance feel to it. Party jam.Track 11: Do What It Do 9/10 Great slow jam, love this beat. great vibe and lyrics to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Song: Love Changes","review":"I can not speak for the entire album, the first and only song I heard on this was Love Changes Featuring Mary J and it was completely terrible and I totally love Mary J but she sounded like she had been drinking a lot or something and Jamie I mean really he should stick with acting! Their voices didn't even mesh together, they sounded like kackling chickens, she's doing one thing and he's doing another. I don't think I even want to hear any thing else on this album.

The whole album is like a throwback to early 90's R&B. SO much of the material is silly sex songs leaving the listener hungry for more depth and substance in the music.

I need substance and this CD doesn't have that...."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRY & TRY AGAIN","review":"Let's be real, this CD has maybe three or four nice cuts, and that's it. Most of the songs are relating to sex. (directly). From the interviews that Jamie has done since the album'a release, he spoke of going back to the old school in his music. Well, I think that he missed the train. It's a smoother way to accomplish this feat. Jeffery Osborne, Pebo Bryson, Will Downing, Luther Vandross, Carl Anderson, and even Chico Debarge from the younger generation all have a way of captivating women without being direct, and just having every well known producer on your album dosen't spell success. Has any of Tank's album's ever gone Platinum? It's a good starting point to improve, and I give him an A for effort, but please be more diversified in the next one, and please see a vocal coach to improve your range, and stop singing from your throat and nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Foxx will you marry me?","review":"Jamie Foxx is a triple threat, he is funny (Booty Call, The Jamie Foxx Show), he is one of the best actors of our time (Ray, need I say more?), and the man can sing... but more importantly put together a CD that's actually good!Jamie Foxx is one of the most talented men out in the world today.

His first cd was way better than this and he wasnt even really known then. There was too much hype about this CD and it wasn't lived up to when you listen to it. Maybe he should've gotten better producers to help him because this isn't cutting it. The songs are very poorly written and he isn't showing his true talent. I say him on the Ellen Degenress show and he told her that bascially he rushed this cd because everyone was pressing him since he did Kanye West \\"Golddigger\\" and this was a perfect time for him to get his music off the ground. I love Jamie Foxx as a actor, he is wonderful, but as a singer he just didn't do it for me on \\"Unpredictable\\". Like me alot of people went out and copped it because last year was his year and he had alot of success with \\"Ray\\" and \\"Golddigger\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible dvd!","review":"the global warning dvd was very boring. they even left out some of the matches that actually happenened at the event itself.plus all of the wrestlers performeed horribly.i thought this would be good but it was really bad.overall do nat buy on dvd or vhs the global warning 2002!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic sci-fi","review":"Okay, so the stories weren't really great, and the acting is bad sometimes, but if you remember watching this TV show in early 1970, like I do, it is worth it to see it again! I had these recorded on audio tape (no videos back then). And it was quite nostalgic to hear them again. I've really enjoyed watching them and remembering being 12-13 years old right after American astronauts Armstrong and Alden had walked on the moon. A much simpler time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Album, but hardly suited for 2001 A Space Oddesey.","review":"Alex North had good ideas with this music and i'm glad Varese Sarabande released it to the public instead of locking it away somewhere. But listening to this soundtrack, I found it hardly suitable for the movie 2001. Kubrick was right to use classical music because it fit the film better. If you're a soundtrack collector like me, add this one to your collection, it's worth it. If you're not, you won't like this CD.One more thing, Track 12 on this CD was used in \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\" or at least it sounded like it. Just thought that was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible score?","review":"I can't believe people prefer this score to the classical score in the film! The Alex North score is unoriginal and just like every other film music of the time. This score doesn't do the visuals justice and it would dramatically date the film. If they would have kept this in the film it would have been just lke all those cheesy sci-fi films that were made before 2001. In terms of the score itself it's not the worst score I've heard but it just doesn't accomplish what Kubrick had in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"my base pan was leaking a bit....so i was told i needed this part. the part i got was blue, but who cares...worked great...no more leaky base pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite from my teen years","review":"I lived in Germany in my teens and this was a top group.

There is nothing from this cd I will add or take away. Wonderful production and wonderful singing. Singing under the anointing doesn't take all the rifts and runs. This cd will put alot of cds to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such Anointing and Power","review":"Karen is back stronger than ever. The songs on here really ministers to your soul. The song writting of Israel Houghton is what Karen needs. Maybe he should stop writing music for himself and for other artist because him singing his songs is not really a good idea. The worship medley on here is just full of so much power, you have no choice but to stop whatever you are doing and start worshiping him. Now Karen is good but there are some songs she should have invited her sisters back on. Hallelujah was good but that is Dorinda's singnature song. Lets leave that one to her. You brought the sunshine was good but when you are use to hearing Twinkie do certain things on that song, then that is what you want to hear. This is a big improvement from the last one and you will not be disappointed purchasing this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CD.","review":"I really like Karen Clark Sheard and this album was really nice but is does not compare to The Heavens Are Telling.....but this album was nice and it has a few good songs.

Every song on this CD is fantastically soul-stirring and as a cadet at USMA I find myself listening to it every single night during study hour. I recommend it for EVERYONE. Although she doesn't have a song to include ALL of the Clark Sisters, she's got some really nice songs from the past to include: \\"Hallelujah,\\" \\"It's Not Over,\\" etc. So in sum, don't think twice about purchasing it; be it new or used, BUY IT!C.M.Clark"},{"rating":"2","title":"I never know what to expect","review":"Karen is back again showing some versatility on this album, produced and arranged mostly by Israel Houghton. Just when you think you've heard it all, Karen brings a fresh, new feel to her music. This is a solid CD from start to finish. In normal fashion Karen really works the praise songs and anoints us with the worship songs. \\"Favor\\" will have you in tears, waving your hands in the air or both and \\"Hallelujah\\" will have you doing your best church dance. The other tracks in between are good as well. Karen has proven that she can work with various writers, arrangers and producers (Missy Elliot, Donald Lawrence, J. Moss, etc). In my opinion, there is an undeniable artistic chemistry with Donald Lawrence. Their collaborations are always memorable. That's about the only thing missing from this album. Go out and get this one you guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Lady Clark-Sheard is on fiyah!","review":"Karen,the BEST sanga, not the mention the MOST POPULAR & BEST SELLING member of the Clark Sisters is back AGAIN with avengance. I cannot stress how good this cd is, I really cannot. Karen has never came out with anything less than stellar anyway, so I wasn't surprised when Karen came out with another smash! Pleeeeaaaaaase don't compare her to TWINKIE, DORINDA, OR JACKY.....there's no point, she is on a DIFFERENT level! No wonder why mega-stars like MARIAH CAREY, ARETHA FRANKLIN, BEYONCE, FAITH EVANS, MISSY ELLIOTT, MARY J. BLIGE, YOLANDA ADAMS, JAMIE FOXX, JILL SCOTT, MONICA ETC. have all sang Karen's praises. Be on the lookout for the new duet between Mariah & Karen plus one with Aretha Franklin for her next gospel album....then another one with Vanessa Bell Armstrong. Karen is doing it big for 2006, so Godly proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I felt like Karen recorded this album to fulfill her committments with her label.

The main song I really like is He Never Will. That song really makes me feel happy, I get happy when I listen to that song. I am a great fan of the Clark Sisters. I am a gospel recording artist myself, but I haven't came out yet. But God has told me that I was going to be out there! Then I am hoping to sing with them on my CD when the Lord brings me out. So look for me, My name is Marie Bell Nero. Look for me I will be out soon! God Bless You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An annointed family","review":"I just love all of the musical blessings of the Clark Moss Family. They are truly annointed musically to spread the Gospel through song. I love Karen Clark-Sheard for her willingness to truly allow the annointing to stay within her music. I love the song that her son produced the last song on the CD. WOW the gifts that God has bestowed on this family will continue forever. Also PJAM and Israel produced the other tracks, I really enjoy the new style of many of the songs on this CD. I really would like to see JMoss and Karen complete a Duet together, their riffs are similar. I LOVE Gospel and I love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful At Every Turn...","review":"Having been a silents fan for years, but just now discovering the real gems, through more wide releases of VHS and DVD, I have to say that my first viewing of a silent Lubitsch film was a true delight. Having seen Valentino in at least five films, and Novarro in two (this and Ben Hur), I would say it's unfair to compare the two at all; both exceed in subtly different ways.I was delighted by this movie, both in the dramatic skills of Novarro and Shearer, who complement each other's gaity and seriousness, and Lubitsch's (well, his Cameraman's) movement of the camera was a shock to me, as I hadn't seen such sophisticated camerawork in such earlier films (as I say, I am still green!); a subtle pan-in to a face, leading to a nice suspense of what is to happen next. The story does not disappoint either, it leaves one interested from the first frame to the last. A true delight, meant for repeated viewing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Cinema","review":"This movie excels on all fronts. The actors are perfect, Novarro is at his most 'ravishing' as he was known in the 20's. Shearer is just beginning to show her star quality that will allow her to dominate the screen at MGM for the next 20 years. Lubitsch makes cinema magic here. There are several scenes that will make you hold your breath, the arrival of the young prince (as boy), the scenes of Novarro coming out of his 'Royal' cocoon as a student, only to be forced back into it as circumstances dictate. This movie was shown at the Royal Albert Hall in London last year with live orchestra (the same orchestration that's on this video) as part of Novarro's centenary celebration (1899-1999). This is a movie that will capture your imagination and though it might be corny to say, your heart too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic, but good.","review":"OK, so here's the deal: I'm using this book to lead a small-group bible study for an hour a week. I wanted more info so that I could provide some insight into the thornier issues that Revelation as a book raises. I think the best thing so far about the book is that Wright focuses not on divining who might be the Antichrist or what world event symbol X refers to, but rather focuses on how we should live in the here and now in light of what is to come. I think this focus has prevented us from going astray into the dead-ends that many end up in.Wright tells anecdotes and also provides essential cultural background without which we would have no entry point into what the author of Revelation might be trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh revelation on Revelation","review":"I like fresh insight into scripture and N. T. Wright brings insight. Insight that rings true and is useful for advancing disciplship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a well reasoned interpretation and commentary on a difficult book. Wright's ability to bring together multiple sources to clarify what might best be described as confusing and obscure is a rare gift not always found in theologians. Must reading for those who struggle with Revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revelation to all","review":"For any one who has ever tried to make sense out of this last book of the Bible, N.T. Wright's exposition is the final word. As usual he makes each New Testament book understandable and highly readable with examples from everyday life and application of each section to the life of the Christian. Whether this completes your series of New Testament for Everyone or is the first one you have read, you will be blessed and challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"I thought this book sound so very interesting, being a major foodie. NOT. This book was more of a travel guide. She was supposed to go to cafeterias across the country so I thought she would discuss the food. NOT. She spent more time on facts about the school, the town, the state and the student who invited her. She seldom mentioned what she ate at each school and/or what she thought of it.She also told way too many stupid silly jokes at the expense of her own cooking. Ok, a few would have been OK..but she had way too many and most were LAME.I dont know who authorized this book to even be published. The title of the book seriously misrepresents what the book is about. I am pissed to have wasted money and money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kylie Is Better Than This DVD","review":"Coming near the end of a two year whirlwind of recording and touring, it is no surprise Kylie does not have much energy left.

Kylie has energy in Sydney.Kylie is a world class performer and singer. This DVD is OK, but does not show her at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"A great cd. I'm not all that knowledgable when it comes to dance music but I really enjoyed this album. I find this french duo to be very refreshing. I absolutely love track number 8 The Party featuring Uffie. It's a really upbeat song that makes me want to sing and dance without restraint. The opening track is also worth mentioning. It really helps set the mood for the rest of the cd. It's full of music that makes you want to party and have fun. I recommend it to anyone who loves fun music as well as anyone who just wants to party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you D.A.N.C.E?","review":"I'd heard this album around Christmas time last year, and was really impressed with what I heard so I bought it. \\"D.A.N.C.E\\" and \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" are probably the catchiest songs off here. I highly recommend this also to fellow Daft Punk fans. Not as clean sounding but definitely worth a liste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"This album is very good with that French electro sound. If you like Daft Punk and parties, you might like this album. The opening notes say it all.Great (not just good) tracks:PhantomGenesisDVNOStressOne Minute to MidnightThe rest of the tracks are all good, except 'The Party'. This track (featuring Uffie) is terrible because she has no talent and basically sing-talks over a quiet Justice track.

This isn't techno and it's certainly not rock or punk. It's noise, alright? It's Chemical Brothers if the Chemical Brothers had no rhythm... or an insanely short attention span. When I listen to Techno or Dance music, I need some kind of element to tie it all together... to facilitate the musical journey, if you will... a beat. Justice keeps throwing in different shrill sounds and... Hell, they make Ministry and the whole Industrial movement sound almost classical. Sorry guys, but I don't get it. Justice sounds to me like bad noise. The only decent track there contains a sample from an Italian dance song.J'suis desole les mecs, but when you compare Justice to others often lumped into contemporary \\"French sound\\": Air, Daft Punk, Kid Loco, and many others... these guys leave lots to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album","review":"One of my all time favourites.I listen to it every now and then, and it is always a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"cross vinyl","review":"being that this was shipped overseas, it didnt take long at all. i actually got it quicker than i thought. packaging was perfect - was worth the wait"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Gets Old Fast","review":"This music has been done better by other people.

During his first visit with his attorey, it appears that Jon actually manages to kill the attorney. He's got to have a new lawyer and no one wants to take the case.Amanda's father talks her into taking a dangerous and challenging case in order to get back on track. She suddenly finds herself believing the story of an unlikely client and looking into a conspiracy that dates back twenty years. She is nearly killed once a gain, but does solve the case. Hopefully she will come back again better ready to tackle a tough case without her personal hangups. It was not the best of Margolin, but still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good read!","review":"The plot is just too convoluted to be appreciated. There are too many characters, many of who don't really add much to the story. So many of the people we meet are involved in the conspiracy at the heart of the book, that one wonders who is left who is honest and can be trusted. Some of the people, mainly the accused murderer and his moll, are shady, disreputable figures, and to make them the protagonists of the story doesn't ring true.Not a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Margolin does it again","review":"Margolin does it again.

I wasn't, he was the author of many books I had loved. So, I figured he was having an off book. However, this book confirms it for me, he does not write anywhere near with the depth of character and plot that he used to. This book is fair, but not good. Amanda Jaffe lacks any reality and it seems that Margolin, like several other authors, is just trying to hook onto a series character to sell books. This character holds no spark or interest. I actually did not even finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon verified purchase: I bought the book through Amazon from BookRUS","review":"I recently bought a book through Amazon from BookRUS.I wrote a review that I want to retract.I spoke with the seller, and she gave me a good excuse why the bookwas not shipped on time.

Of the newly recorded material, \\"It's Electric\\" and \\"Astronomy\\" are terrific, but the Mercyful Fate is incredible and needs to be heard to be believed. However, \\"Turn the Page\\" and \\"Loverman\\" are unlistenable. This rest is okay, but not that exciting.Highlights of the second disc (older material) include \\"The Small Hours\\" by Holocaust and \\"Blitzkrieg\\" by Blitzkrieg. Suprisingly, the Motorhead covers are uninspired and terribly inferior to the Motorhead originals. Still, there's some good stuff here. Overall, this is well worth picking up, but don't expect to like every song. There are some real clunkers on this album, which is disappointing when you think of some of the great songs in metal history that were neglected in favor of some more mainstream offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album, 3.5 stars for disk 1, 5+stars for disk two","review":"Short summary of disk one, take out \\"turn the page\\" and Tuesday's Gone, and I love the whole thing. Sabra Cadabra with a slab of the awesome \\"A National Acrobat\\" by Sabbath is absolutely brilliant. One of the best covers. Mercyful Fate is great, and the Discharge covers are especially good. Disk two is perfection! I have most of the songs by the original artists, and Metallica does them all better than the original (except maybe Motorhead, but Lemmy is irreplaceable). I've been a fan since I heard Ride the Lightning on the radio back in '84 or '85. Maybe they have sold out or whatever, but they are still Metallica and still doing what they want. That's what they've always been about. But I still miss the intricately beautiful compositions like on Puppets and Justice. We all know they can be better than Load and Reload."},{"rating":"2","title":"A taste of the old and a taste of the new","review":"Garage Inc. is a godsend. I must say that the new recordings are good but I STILL believe that the second disc truly rocks.

Either way this has something for the vintage fan and the new fan. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difference You Can Here","review":"For those who claim that Metallica has not sold out, simply remove Disc 1 of Garage Inc. from your cd players and insert Disc 2. Covering songs by similar bands on both, a certain ferocity is lost between the two discs. Yes I prefer the second disc. The Small Hours, The Wait, Blitzkrieg, Am I Evil?, and Helpless all represent beautiful genuine thrash innovation. Plus Metallica nails them. The punkier crazy songs were cool as well, So What, Last Caress/Green Hell, Crash Course in Brain Surgery. I enjoyed all but the last few songs of disc 2. Disc 1 is not terrible, but it could have been better. Highlights include Whiskey in the Jar, Tuesday's Gone, It's Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Mercyful Fate, and the incredible Turn the Page. Fans of Metallica and fans of the original will like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Influencial Musicians","review":"When i first heard the album I was blown away by the cover Turn The Page.

Load, Reload, and now Garage Inc. is NOT music. I do not know what has happened to this once GREAT group, but something has gone sour. Anyone who has the audacity to absolutely ruin one of the Misfits great songs (Die Die My Darling) has got some nerve. To me, metallica is not even a decent band anymore. They have lost all creativity and uniqueness in their struggle to be an \\"in\\" band. The ONLY decent thing about this set is that it includes digitally remastered songs from \\"Garage Days\\" which was some of their finer work. In my opinion, if you must buy it, throw away the first cd, and add the second one to your Metallica collection.

In addition, they removed Am I Evil and Blitzkreig from Kill Em All, for what reason I don't know, and slapped them on here. Do you smell something fishy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOLD OUT","review":"I have nothing against a band sold out. They need to survive, they have bills to pay, nobody has nothing to do with it. If you don't like it, just don't buy nor hear it. But what makes me sad is to know that this band used to be authentic, strong. Now they release this garbage. Half of it is great: it's the CD containing the old covers. The other half contains the new covers, and it makes clear what path they are travelling now... The path of lack of inspiration. The covers are so heartless, so uneven, it's a shame to the band. Goodby, Metallica, farewell. Keep on in your great fight against MP3 to get more money ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimmer of hope...","review":"This was released in the middle of the Load-ReLoad period, and it proved to me that Metallica can still be great if they want to. It may be all covers, but it still rocks. At least they are still capable of remembering what \\"heavy metal\\" is, and where they came from. Of course, they followed this up with S&M which pretty much sucked (except \\"Puppets\\" sounds really good on that album) then St. Anger, which was the bottom. If Rick Rubin can re-awaken the metal monster in the band, then we may be in for more original music like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARAGE INC. -- EXPLICIT MONEY","review":"What a clever idea !!!!

The new covers are so gisgusting and uninspired... sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one of a kind cd is great","review":"I think this cd is great and i would reccomend this cd to anyone that likes metal and is a good metallica fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've heard most of these songs","review":"This has got to be a must have. MOst of these songs at least those on disk 2 are rare b -sides that are really difficult to find. They Rock, Green Hell, Am I evil!, BREADFAN (Metallica's best cover) Stone Cold Crazy (original by Queen) The prince all songs I'v been searching for for years I got about half of them! GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Inc.","review":"This album should have stayed in the Garage, buried forever under a pile of old clothes to never see the light. I traded this album in at a local record store for something else after one spin. I liked tracks #4 and 9 on Disc 1, and track # 10 on Disc 2. I just didn't care much for this two-disc set and I wouldn't recommend it to any music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE AIN'T ENOUGH STARS BELOW 1 CAUSE THIS IS SAD!!!","review":"Quite possibly this the worst album Metallica have done since And justice for all... Metallica were finished with ever since Cliff Burton died (he must be spinning in his grave). Take my advice don't bother with this sad excuse for an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? Why","review":"Ok so now Metallica decides Hey lets ripe off some more people because we can't do our own stuff without it sucking! You do know that Dave from Megadeth wrote all of there good songs. Without Dave around they sucked!!!!! I have sat down and tryed to rock out with this one because one of friends had it and I would just like to for the most part this thing sucks!!!! The Misfit's song they did was the worst cover ever!!!!! Hell COF does a way better cover of a Misfit song. If your looking for some band like to make money off of other peoples work then get any of there cd's. Now if your looking for some real metal then go get everything from Slayer, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu, and even COF because these bands are way better then anything they have ever put out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you make a clean version of Metallica?","review":"What is a clean version of Metallica? How in the heck can you make a clean version of Metallica? To make a clean version of any \\"explicit\\" band defeats the whole purpose of listening to that band in the first place. It makes no sense! The original version of any song is always better than any remake, at least in my opinion, and therefor the clean version of Garage Inc. is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their music range is complete.","review":"Mostly cover albums by metal bands are usually garbage, or for something for the hardcore fan. This is for anyone. I was suprised to see covers of Nick Cave, Bob Seger, Blue Oyster Cult, and Thin Lizzy. Way back in the 1980's it was metal, and that's it. Now, we have everything from blues to fusion to country. Rock on Metallica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY? OH WHY??","review":"why do we, the old metallica fans, have to be insulted with this fake music?? what happened to metallica i sang with a loud and clear voice with another 50,000 people \\"DIE DIE DIE\\"... what happened to the lyrics which had meaning? don't buy it so you won't have to be so dissapointed. as i am now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recollection of songs written a long time ago.","review":"The first disc isn't the best, but it has some great re-writes. The second disc I think is the best.

It's just too bad that Metallica's best album in years is entirely made up of covers. But my, what covers they are! Whisky in the Jar, Mercyful Fate medley, Astronomy, Die, Die my Darling...the album never lets up except for the WAY TO LONG Tuesday's Gone. Hopefully this will shove Metallica back to their old roots for their next studio album. Until then, we have this to tide us over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage Inc......Metallica's New Mature Metal","review":"The new Metallica double album, Garage Inc. is an awesome addition to anyone's Metallica collection. James and Lars have kids now and they can't play thrash metal forever. I think they're new maturer metal has a cool sound to it. And for the die hard metal heads, like me, there's the old covers like, Blitzkrieg, Bredfan, Am I Evil?, and infamous Last Caress/Green Hell. What are you waiting for, go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harkens back to the old days","review":"This new Metallica is a welcome relief for the older fans (Justice and beforehand) who are sick of the wussy metal they've been shovelling at us recently. One mysterious omission (contrary to the Amazon.com review that states that every cover over the past 16 years is included) is Crash Course in Brain Surgery (originally recorded by Budgie in 1974)which appeared on the $5.98 EP - Garage Days Revisited. It provided such a great lead-in to the Misfits medley of Last Caress/Green Hell. Anyone know why it was left out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for true tallica fans","review":"Metallica has done us all a favor by putting all of its B sides on one disk these songs are classics going back to the Cliff Burton days even. Disk one is I feel like a bonus I would ha ve liked to have seen some older Sabbath, but that merciful fate track rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second cd on this is INCREDIBLE.","review":"I'm a very big fan of their old stuff, and really don't like most of the new stuff (load, reload). the first cd isn't that good, but if you are into their old, true metal, the second disc is a must have. blitzkrieg, last/carress, and breadfan are truly awesome. on the first disc, there is one good song which is Die Die my Darling. buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is the best","review":"they did a great job on all the songs that they redid from past song writers like seager and the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm lost for words","review":"I have been listening to Metallica since Ride the ligthning. I loved, and still do, the \\"old\\" and fast Metallica, but I also loved, but not quite as much, the newer material, from the black album to Reload. But Garage INC. really blew me away, it's amazing, they give these old cover songs such an personal touch that I'm lost for words, just listen to \\"Whiskey in the jar\\", Thin Lizzy made a great version of it, but Metallicas.....phew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica is still the best after all these years!","review":"This 2-CD release is amazing and has great songs like: Whiskey in the Jar, Turn the Page, Last Caress/Green Hell, So What, and more. The guitar playing on this album is great just like it is on all the Metallica albums. I would really like to hear Metallica play a full version of the Misfits song, \\"Last Caress\\". That would be awesome. This album is really wicked and is worth your hard earned money. Metallica still knows how to rock. ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How many ways can you say CRAP!","review":"Metallica has really lost it for good. Both discs are terrible. If possible, I would give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"Wow. Thanks Metallica for putting out a double disc of music that you had already released with the addition of some cover songs. Bands that put out albums of other people's music may as well write \\"we are no longer able to put out good material of our own so here's some stuff you've already heard by bands that are better than us\\" in the liner notes. This just goes to show that the $ hungry Metallica machine is devoid of all creativity and will put out ANYTHING for their blind sheep fans to waste their money on. I'd like to take this CD and cram it down Ulrich's throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"they butcherd one of my favorite songs","review":"They tore die die my darling apart its so horrible no misfits fan would ever think it did danzig doyle or any of the orginal misfits justice Glenn Danzig Himself at one of his last concerts in 2005 even said that they butchered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks to this band........","review":"No more free music anywhere....... No napster.....No nothin...Music companies are now watching for sharing....uploading and downloading at the same time!!!!!!

Unfortunately, the album confirms my worst fears that came about from the last album: that Metallica will one day be playing Skynard covers!!!For God's sakes, Metallica, please go back to the raw pioneering sound of Master of Puppets! People respect you guys as an influence;not because of who you were influenced by! Nevertheless, it's great to hear you guys in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific album","review":"This is without a doubt the best release of 1998. Finally, all the fans who were too young to be a fan when Metallica first released their 2 Garage Days E.P.s can have a second crack at hearing the music that inspired the band, done Metallica-style, with the re-release of the Garage Days E.P.s. Personally, I've heard many of the original versions, and I think Metallica added new flavor to the original versions by the original bands, and many times, exceed the original. The new covers are great too. Overall, I love almost every track and can't stop listening to this album. It is probably the most diverse album out of Metallica's 8, especially since it is all covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rocks!!!!!!!!","review":"Iam 14 years old and I love metallica this I have two of their cds Reload and Garage inc.I think that Garage inc is a lot better then reloa the first disc is a little bit soft but the second disc is exsplosive with songs like so what,breadfan and stone cold crasy to name a few I would higly recomend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"It's actually a pretty good album. I really like how it sounds. What I REALLY miss is the two feet of Lars playing around with double bass in fills and grooves like he used to do years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"For all of you who love metallica you have to get this CD. Its like Justice for all and reload mixed together something for everyone. Songs such as \\"free speach\\" and \\"die die my darling\\" want to make us bang our heads, songs such as \\"Turn the Page\\" make us think, for those of you who can, and songs like \\"so what make us laugh. So for anyone who listens to me and takes my advice, make sure you get this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must-have for Metallica fans","review":"Garage, Inc. is an interesting and diverse compilation of Metallica's covers. Sure to please any Metallica fan, it seems to cross the years in the range of styles they use, from hard-and-heavy monsters such as \\"So What\\" to the rustic, haunting melodies of \\"Turn the Page\\". Though probably too esoteric for the casual listener, any true Metallica fan will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent 2-cd package","review":"It is one of the best cd's that i have heard in the last few years I can not take it out of my cd player, they have really outdone themselves with this cd package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stomping tracks, new and old.","review":"I wasn't sure about this, a possible rehash of the Garage Days et al. But wow! The first CD blew my mind...to find The Metallicats love the same music I always have like BOC, Diamond Head, Budgie and Motorhead! I was so pleased with this when I listened to it, it was worth every penny. Never having bought the Garage Days sets, the tracks were pretty new to me and sounded clear and crisp on the CD. All in all an interesting insight in to Tallica's muse, their inspiration. Nice to hear what people listen to when they're not playing their own stuff. Great album, all fans will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what Metal-stars do when they are on there last leg!","review":"Metallica has a lot of talent and has produced some very good albums in there career, but this is ridiculous. Metallica is all washed up in there new album, and there last three for that matter. I wouldn't recomend buying this CD unless you want to hear some mediocre covers of some even more mediocre songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica shows true colors. They are sellouts.","review":"Years ago this band used to play decent music. Now all Metallica is about is the almighty dollar. The butchering of Bob Segers' Turn the Page is sheer and utterly disgusting. Should anyone ever cover Satisfaction? No! These clowns known as Metallica have given Heavy Music a slap in the face. I don't know what I just said they aren't heavy any more than The Dave Matthews Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"b sides and rarities","review":"This a worth while addition to the Metallica releases. 3 lp's, and a nice variety of songs. Every Metallica fan should own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the old covers.","review":"Has all of the old covers from Diamo.d Head and others. It also has some good new.covers like Motorhead's Overlikk."},{"rating":"2","title":"great covers album by the masters","review":"Metallica's Load and Reload were not very good compared to old Metallica sounds but although some of the covers here were recorded during that era, i love it. There are a lot of heavy punk and metal covers on this album that Metallica literally make it sounds like it was originally by them an they wrote the song! they practially own the songs here! and metallica cover things cannot be completed without covers of diamond head and misfits and motorhead as well. i like disc 2 the best because it's from the 80s metallica mostly and early 90s which was the metallica that i loved more than the new \\"polished\\" metallica without hair and extremeness in their concerts. but garage inc is still worthy of fitting into your heavy metal collection and metallica cd collecion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise, 4 1/2 stars","review":"I bought this about 5 years ago and still have it. Great compilation of all the covers Metallica did on their biggest influences. On disc 1 you got the newest covers by metallica (1998, 11 new covers). Disc 2 is all the older covers recorded from 1984-1995(16 covers).favorite tracks include:Disc 1: Free Speech For The Dumb, Its Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Die Die My Darling, Mercyful Fate, Astronomy, Whiskey In The Jar, and The More I See.Disc 2: EverythingIf youre a fan of Metallica you need to go buy this now, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST COVER ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD","review":"Garage Inc. is the best cover album ever without a doubt. It is also a lot harder than Load or Re Load. So you should like it if you liked Metallica's older stuff. It is a very long double cd. The only song I really do not like is So What becuse of all of the swaring and the bad lyrics. Other than that it is excellent. The cover choices are great. I liked the first disc better than the second because it seemed clearer, like they put more time into it than the second disc. I loved almost every song on this album, it is great. The best couple of songs on the first disc are Whisky in The Jar, and Die Die My Darling. On the second Am I evil?, and Stone Cold Crazy. a must buy for any fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD-Set for everyone who loves metallica!","review":"I love metallica since 1993, have all the albums. This 2 CD-Pack is great. I love the first CD more then the second, though. Mr. Loverman gives you shivers down the spine. Turn the page and tuesdays gone, wonderful songs. Its just good old metallica. Load was an unsusal sound, then ReLoad already better defined style, which i like. Anyway, they shouldnt make the same music, they did in the eighties, because the world goes on and so do we. There is renewal. Thanx to the metallicats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless in every style","review":"Pretty good record best than load an reaload it has everything death metal,thras metal,punk and even melodic ! I personally like it a lot ! most of the best song are from disc 2 thoug disc 1 also is pretty good also"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?","review":"\\"Garage Inc.\\" was the only good album put out by Metallica in the 90's. Nothing wrong with hearing Metallica crank out some of their own favorite songs. Not an album for casual Metallica listeners, but a fun one to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is great....Garage inc. is'nt.","review":"Metallica is one of the greatest hardcore rock bands of all time. Almost every one of their CD's has been magnificent, but i'm dissapointed in Garage inc. I mean I want to hear Metallica for IT'S orignality, not Bob Segar's! No disrespect Metallica or any Metallica fans, but I don't like Garage inc. at all. I'm looking forward to their next project so I can rebound from their most recent dissapointment.LONG LIVE METALLICA!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica is BACK!!","review":"For those of you that have been a bit dubious of Metallicas new work, fear not, this album is for you.The price is neglible when you consider that the covers of Blitzkrieg, Am I Evil, and many other \\"lost\\" songs is on it.If any of the rest of the covers are as good as the Seger one, it is a must have for any TRUE fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS C-D!!!","review":"I'M SO GLAD METALLICA HAS RE-RELEASED GARAGE DAYS! IT IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ALBUMS. THE NEW STUFF IS GREAT TOO, ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T GET INTO \\"LOVEMAN\\" AT ALL. \\"TURN THE PAGE\\" IS AWESOME CUZ IVE ALWAYS LOVED THAT SONG. STILL IN ALL ITS GREAT TO HAVE METALLICA BACK THE WAY I REMEMBER THEM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY GOOD","review":"First off, this is NOT a box set, it is a 2CD set. If your a hardcore METALLICA fan from the old days, you will like this. It gives you the chance to pick up the music that was originally found on GARAGE DAYS and GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. As well as the songs \\"Am I Evil?\\" and \\"Blitzkreig\\" that were only available on a limited print of KILL 'EM ALL. Also you can finally get \\"Breadfan\\" another cool and popular cover. The first CD hascover songs that were recorded this year. Some have the old METALLICA sound, which is great, but most of them sound like the new garbage they've been doing. It's the second CD that gives this CD set a four star rating. It's the classic, the great, and the awesome old METALLICA style. I recommend this CD set to all METALLICA fans especially the old hardcore ones who have given up on the new crap. It gives you one last good METALLICA CD of the once great metal band."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome cd","review":"this is a great cd but i recamend for all u hard heavy metal heads do not listin 2 tuesdays gone its like a country song its so bad some people may say this cd sucks but its way better than st.anger but if u like that kind of metallica type then dont read this"},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE","review":"This is an album filled with one of the most influetnial metal bands ever playing their influences. Even thuogh so what is somewhat of a \\"nasty\\" song there are tons of awsome songs. They cover every one from Sabbath, the Blue Oyster Cult to Motorhead. I though the album is a must buy for metal heads. I being a musician and all find all of these covers excellent. Some i think are better than the orignals. So i say BUY THIS"},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon guys, give 'em a break!","review":"I am about the biggest Metallica fan there is. And basically, I have liked every album that those fellers have ever released, this one included. Most of the songs on the 1st CD are just amazing, the way they interpret the original music and get their interpretations into a form that we all have a chance to enjoy. I would like to see some other band try it! The 2nd CD is stuff that is almost essential listening for all the die hard metalli- freaks like myself. Besides, haven't we all worn out our copies of the \\"5.98 EP\\"? That's what CD #2 is, except with about 3 times the material! And to all of you guys that have turned your backs, why don't you try eating the same exact food for several years. If you pick something good, you may be able to keep it up for awhile, but sooner or later, you just have to do something different. So get out of the 80's and try giving the new stuff a chance!And remember, \\"TIME MARCHES ON!!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks! Something for every Metallica fan","review":"The second CD will please Metallica fans of the \\"Old School\\". If you believe a band should find a sound that works, fine tune it, perfect it, and play it better than anyone else, these covers rock!! Songs such as \\"So What\\" and \\"Last Caress\\" prove that when it comes to fast, raw, hardcore metal noone can play it better than Metallica. For those who believe a band can evolve over the years and find a sound that is just as hard and heavy but sounds nothing like what they've done before, the first CD is for you. With covers ranging from Bob Seger to Black Sabbath, Metallica proves they can \\"Metallicize\\" any song and make it cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's hope this is the end of the stadium rock Metallica.","review":"Hopefully Metallica will open up there eyes and see how pathetic they have become in the last five years, and get back to there roots.

Bob Rock eat your heart out."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally they got back to the good stuff","review":"i'm a diehard METALLICA fan and i think finally they've come back from the RELOAD crap and started recording some real good music. Way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look up the Originals","review":"this is a great set from Metallica, their best in years. That is mainly because they didn't write any of the songs. These songs are what Metallica are about, rough, raw sounds that have great energy. However, fans would be smart to look up the original artists to hear the songs as they were meant to be played. This is especially true for the Motorhead, Diamond Head, and Budgie tunes. Check em out, you may be surprised"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much money can some white guys make?","review":"Sellouts.

Too much money in being pansies.OUT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Metallica?..... I think not!","review":"One star because that is the lowest rating I can give! This CD wouldn't be so bad if it was left in the original format as Garage Days Revisited. Instead Metallica insists on placing substandard new songs on a perfectly good CD, adding the B-sides from all the CD-Singles (which the true fans already have). If you HAVE to have this disk, keep in mind that only one or two songs on the first disk are worthwhile, and the only real reason for the disk set to exist is for the first 4 songs on disk 2.

But, with the release of Garage Inc, it seems to me that Metallica is selling out. There was no need to release a 2CD set of covers and B-sides that they had done over the past few years!! I bet your guts that they are minting money from this album. I mean, it's not even their own songs! They're covers dammit, and they're making money. I mean doing covers for practise sessions and maybe during live concerts in OK, but, releasing a separate album full of covers it kinda bad. People say that Metallica sold out when they released \\"The black album\\", that's not true. They sold out when Garage Inc was released. It's sad but true!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Screw 'em, there are other bands that deserve my attention","review":"Whoever found this album burried in the garage should have kept it there. This album is so horrid. metallica has lost all their dignity and gone so far into the mainstream it's pathetic. I just say just let 'em go, there is no room in my world for such filth. The only highlight is the Garage Days Re-Revisted because I've been looking for this on CD for sometime now. I'll stick with other bands such as Overkill, Slayer, and Pantera. These bands care about their old fans. They could care less about how many albums they could sell. Oh yeah, and what's with this clean version? Is that an indicator that they really have sold out or what? I mean come on, that is so awful. DIE, DIE, DIE metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pathetic attempt","review":"After listening to DIE DIE MY DARLING for a couple of times, I made up my mind that this album is another pathetic attempt to make some more money.

They have tried every type of experimentation with rock music,and succeeded,though some albums were of better content than others. Garage Inc., in my opinion, is a look at the real heavy,hardcore Metallica breaking through yet once again. It is a good cd, but I think the Black album and ....And Justice For All will forever remain true to Metallica. I know they have progressed in their careers and have chosen to change their music.No matter if they do or don't go back heavy I give them credit for still being able to kick ass.

KICKS A55, Next to Reload And The Black Album I think Garage inc. is one of Metallica's best. Through out The CD a listener can find something he/she likes. For people who like the new Metallica disc 1 will be most appealing with covers of many of their favorite bands, (in their new voice). For those who like The old stuff. listen to disc 2 for GREAT Re recordings of their songs form the good old garage days.

I'm one of the \\"band-wagon\\" Metallica fans, whatever, it's not my fault I was 6 when they started so I had to start somewhere! anyway I'm rambling. Disk 1 was great, Astronomy has to be one of my favorite songs. Whiskey in the Jar also stands out, as well as Die, Die my Darling. Turn the Page has been played so much as to make me sick but that's what they made the skip button for!

However, I already had all the songs on disc 2 so disc 2 is pointless. Disc one is a complete joke. Metallica is trying to go back to their metal roots, but it is not working. The fluffy pop band that they are today is still brightly showing. The only decent cover is the mercyful fate mnedley the rest of disc one is pure crap. Most of the original songs are great, but metallica makes them bad. I wish this album was mever made. Metallica, as you once knew them is no more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Inc.","review":"Just another \\"We want more money, so we will put out another trash album.\\" Its funny how Metallica just seems to be brain washing kids into thinking that they are the heaviest band out there. Its sad. This album is a waste of time. I think they would have known that after Load and Reload, they would have gotten heavier, but they waste more time doing covers of some GOOD bands (Misfits and Black Sabbath).

I had every track on disk 2 the week that metallica released them on singles and compilations. That is the way it should be now. Uncut.

For the new fan disc 2 will be a good addition to your collection. Disc 1 shows their versatility as they cover everything from southern rock to classic metal. By the way it is pronounced \\"Garage Incorporated,\\" as in \\"Damage, Inc.\\" not \\"Garage Ink!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for what it is","review":"This pretty much a cd filled with covers. Some work better than others but mostly there are no real duds here, except for the completely out of place 'So What'. This song is so far over the top that it stops being interesting almost immediately. When I go on rants against hip hop music it's usually because I consider it so much more offensive than what groups like Metallica usually put out. So for them to record a song like 'So What' is a big let down.Ok, enough of that rant. The rest of the cd - like I said earlier - is pretty good. It just isn't essential. What you get here is a feel for music that influenced the band. 'Turn the Page' is a stand out that should not work but ends up being a near masterpiece. Another tune I like a lot is 'Astronomy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD Metallicats! Do it again!","review":"Metallica are the masters of taking a good tune and making it better. There is a tune for everyone on this CD. The covers of Diamond Head, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Mercyful Fate, are superb in every way.My personal favorites are IT'S ELECTRIC, SABBRA CADABRA, ASTRONOMY, KILLING TIME, HELPLESS.

This album is so horrid. Metallica has lost all their dignity and gone so far into the mainstream it's pathetic. I just say just let 'em go, there is no room in my world for such filth. The only highlight is the Garage Days Re-Revisted because I've been looking for this on CD for sometime now. I'll stick with other bands such as Overkill, Slayer, and Pantera. These bands care about their old fans. They could care less about how many albums they could sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica were did the \\"Metal\\" go?","review":"I am a big Metallica fan or at least a fan of the old Metalica.

If you want a good cover album by a good band try Megadeth's Hidden Treasures. If you like mainstream pop sounding metal, I suggest you go to the Bon Jovi section here (after all, Metallica is heading in that direction.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"Side 2 of the Second record in this 3 LP album doesn't play right. James Hetfield sounds like one of the Chipmunks and the band plays so fast it sounds like they're on Speed. There must have been a mistake at the factory because I had Amazon replace this album for me and the 2nd copy did the exact same thing as the first one! So, I asked for a refund. That was a very sad moment for me. I really wanted to hear Metallica's tribute to Mercyful Fate on Vynil...If you really want Garage Inc. on vynil, wait until Metallica re-issues it sometime in the near future. They're doing that with all their albums in celebration of Kill'em All's 25th anniversary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not original Metallica, but it still rocks!!","review":"First and foremost, this is not Metallica's latest original album. It is a double cd of covers of songs they love. Some of the stuff are new recordings(disc 1), and some of it are covers they did between 1987 and now(disc 2). Alot of the stuff is from 60's English Punk rock bands, but it sounds great being played by Metallica. If you're a real Metallica fan you should get Garage Inc. If you're a musician, like myself, you should get Garage Inc. to hear the music that influenced one of the most influencial bands of the last couple of decades. Bottom line is this: even though this isn't original Metallica, it still is fast and hard. There are plenty of songs to headbang to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best offering since 'Justice'","review":"Ok, I can come to grips with the fact that the Hard Fast and Heavy days of Metallica are probably gone, but one thing they will always do good is taking other people's music and making it sound great. For the longest time, I thought songs like Breadfan and The Prince were Metallica songs. Even the Queen standard, Stone Cold Crazy, feels like it should have been written by Metallica. Well, they've done it again. For anyone who is a Metallica fan, the double CD is a must have. The 1st CD shows their true diversity and the 2nd CD shows their history, not to mention some really meaty Metal tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One end of the Metallica spectrum to the other.

I truly believe that Metallica has outdone themselves this time. The covers are a big hit for me because they are so touching. I really enjoyed listening to \\"Tuesday's gone\\" and \\"Turn the page.\\" They are covers that one would think Metallica could not possibly be covering...but they did. They did a wonderful job with this album. For those of you out there who says their new stuff sucks. I just dont think so. They are a maturing band that will continue to rock the world with their music. The first cd is awesome and so is the second. I would recommend all to purchase this album, not on behalf of amazon but for the fact that you would enjoy the album. Thank you Metallica for releasing this album...made my year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover CD","review":"I thought that Metallica sold out when they released \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\"... then I heard this CD, and it rocks.

METALLICA FOREVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I give it 0 stars?","review":"OK, last time my review wasn't posted - understandable, these people are trying to SELL these CDs. They can: if you're a sworn Metallica fan, go ahead and buy it. But if you're a heavy metal fan - I'll say only one thing: skip ALL of Metallica after \\"Black\\", and SPECIALY this album. Making 2 CDs of covers was a bad joke, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hey look, we can play other people's songs\\"","review":"A double CD composed entirely of a collection of, for the most part, poorly done covers. Is this what we expect from Metallica, a band that is supposed to have great songwriting ability of their own? Not at all. Two of the covers (\\"Turn The Page\\" and \\"Loverman\\") are very good, but the others either just weren't meant for Metallica (such as the Skynyrd cover) or shouldn't have even been attempted. Now, I personally don't like covers; I'd rather hear a band release only its own work, because originality is most of the reason to like a band. I guess if you like covers, you'll like this one, but if you've been disappointed with the recent Metallica downfall (I'd say that it was after Load that they started going down, because I actually do have somewhat of a liking for Load), don't expect a relief from the plague in Garage, Inc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica is dead","review":"I bought the old Garage Days EP back in the day before 'Justice'. Like all Metallica fans back then I loved it. If you must have those songs on CD then get it they're all here along with the singles we all remember such as 'Blitzkrieg' and 'Breadfan', and the rocking 'Am I Evil'. For those songs, if you must must rebuy them on CD, then by all means go ahead.The rest of the 'new stuff' blows chunks. Bob Segar should personally execute the members of this band for their awful version of 'Turn the Page'. It was Spinal Tap meets The Banana Splits. Also the remade Motorhead songs made me want to vomit. If Metallica can't rock anymore, then they shouldn't try to cover the loudest band of all time. All Lars and the gang can do these days is make themselves look more and more pathetic with each passing day.RIP CLIFF - Not everyone's forgotten the REAL Metallica"},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUT","review":"The new covers are utterly horrible, denied of any credibility or passion, James' vocals are all the same growling.

When I first bought this album I knew it was all covers. Well in short I bought this, and I found about 7 songs that I liked on it. Usually on Metallica's CD's I like all of them, and I never I mean NEVER get tired of hearing them. After about a month I couldn't stand to hear them any longer. This CD isn't that muscially good.

From the desire of one man to join the RAF to the point of actual combat, the books describes how quickly a pilot could become an ace or be doomed because of one signle mistake. The author also added a lots of details on how the RAF was opperating. Considering that the author ended up as an Ace with 8 confirmed kills, the fact that he was the only Icelandic pilot in the RAF makes the book only more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger is junk","review":"This is a decent drill, but the charger is junk.

It was the first Pavement product I ever bought (i only bought it cause it was cheap and I heard good stuff about the band) I listened to it non-stop for several days before realizing that it is one of the best cd's I owned. Slowly Typed is a faster version of Type Slowly (from Brighten the Corners). It is much better than it's slower counter-part, mostly because the verses are a little longer, and SM's vocals are amazing. It rocks. Cherry Area is a song that at first sounded like a throw-away b-side, but once it sinks in its greatness becomes apparent. Wanna Mess You Around is a fast, short, punky song, which is great. Finally, No Tan Lines has the best guitar solo in the world (well, not really, but it's awesome) and is really one of Pavement's best songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and enlightening","review":"This book really helps to put in perspective what matters in life.

This is not a vegetarian cookbook or a vegetarian cookbook with an addition of a sea life (non-vegetarian) section. The supposedly vegetarian recipes contain oyster sauce, so everything that contains this item is omnivorous, along with the sea life recipes. While these items are easily overcame by the experienced vegan cook by using vegan sauces and such, it is quite annoying that an author of a book doesn't know the definition of one of the words in the title. Also, a beginner cook or someone who doesn't have extra time in the kitchen will not want to make the effort of fixing these recipes to actually be vegetarian.This is my preliminary review only, but since any recipe I make will be modified to be really vegetarian, I don't know that I can provide any further review of this cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful dvd","review":"i highly recommend this dvd, its very educational, with great details, it make me even more so to be very proud this be a black beautiful woman, we weren't suppose to last this long, but with many graces to god though the blood of jesus christ, we are here, and god though the sweet blood of jesus christ he still, not done with us yet, god bless some white who sacifice their lives for us..it would have been wonderful if black history would been taught more in this country or any where else, but though the blood of our savoir, our story is still being taught about these maginificent people....my people....thank you amazon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important history which everyone should know.","review":"I'm not black, but nevertheless, I would like to see this story which is about a shameful part of American history, about human beings, people who suffered gross mistreatment at the hands of white people,and who had the courage to risk their lives in their race to freedom.

I have not seen or ordered this DVD, much as I'd like to, because it offers no sub-titles, which I need in order to get every word of the dialogue.DVD producers should wake up and smell the coffee!

It is funny, fast-paced, and intelligent (surprisingly well juxtaposed to the silly plot). However, the cast on this CD dissappointed me. Harry Witherspoon's accent is, to say the least, embarassing. (To say the most: nails-on-chalkboard-annoying). The Uncle is annoying as well, but at least it fits the character. Rita and her brother slightly less so, but still have their moments of going totally off-pitch. The soloist in Speaking French is quite good, but the person least affected by a bad accent/pitch is Miss Glick. If you like the show still by the recording, but if you don't know it don't get the wrong impression from this recording: the show can sound much better. And try Ragtime! Another great Flaherty/Ahrens collaboration."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR","review":"Crude and cheap disc with bad piano accompaniment audio reveals Charlie Chaplin to be, surprisingly, not the physical comic genius I expected to see, but a hammy 'look-at-me!\\" comediene whose subtle facial expressions seems to set him apart from the wide, bold gestures of the other players. Aside from falling down, which happens a lot, there isn't really a single stunt in the eight one-reelers from 1914 shown here, and a whole lot of time where no action occurs at all. Fatty Arbuckle, whose career was ruined by a notorious sex scandal, is showcased in \\"The Knockout\\" and fares much better as a graceful. physical comediene with an inviting, commanding presense. This collection is shoddy as a product, at least one film's subtitles are in French, the piano accompaniment seems not in accordance with the film's pace, and the screen's borders omit characters that are obviously supposed to be seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpectedly small but beautiful","review":"I was also surprised at how tiny the cross is.

It makes a huge difference to the speed of ripping seams. Owing to the frequency with which I need to rip out stitches (!), I don't use the vinyl sleeve. The seam ripper just sits next to my sewing machine on a shelf. Those sewers who think the cover shouldn't have been vinyl could simply make a new one from heavy fabric. That would take all of 10 seconds.The handle is actually quite sturdy, more so than I thought from the picture. Despite one reviewer who said it broke right away, I think if you're using the ripper correctly (inserting the point under the stitch and forward to cut it), there should be no problem. It takes no force at all and cuts beautifully. I love the item and intend to order again so that I have more than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little product","review":"Added this to my order on a whim because I was sick of using my embroidery scissors that need to be sharpened for tasks like seam ripping and trimming thread.

If you are an art student, the nudity probably won't offend you, but if you don't like nudity, don't watch, because there is plenty of it in this dvd, male & female.

I love how some conveniently mention that the composer holds a professional degree--it's irrevelant. If electronica-style music is what you like, you may enjoy this. I didn't like Way Out Here, but I'm used to listening to creative music. A primary criteria in my evaluation of music is whether I want to listen again, not some flaky intellectual notion of merit. The world offers a lot of quality music--even currently--for those that seek it out. Regardless, a group, band, or musical style generating millions in record sales from mediocre or bad albums is not dehumanizing to anyone. Besides, you shouldn't use this crummy CD as an example of good music. Unless your 22-years-old or younger, I hope your not commenting on popular-music styles anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is 1 too many","review":"You would think this CD has artistic credibility beyond popular pop music based on most of these reviews. Don't be fooled by all the lofty praise, which should be reserved for music of greater merit. This is not the work of an innovative composer or musician. New and interesting harmonies will not be found here. Some reviews state this CD stands out from ordinary pop music or appeals to a more educated listener. I don't.

Since none of the classes covered ALL of the Canterbury Tales, I was able to use Ms. Rossignol's summaries to find out what I was missing in the tales we didn't read.

Primarily, I picked it up because it was on the Ark 21 Records label, who has consistently put out really interesting hip hop releases, that are at least what I'd consider meat and potatoes, fundamental hip hop, with a little more towards the experimental side every once in a while. This album was super disappointing. It's so cliche and unoriginal, so different from what this record company is used to. If you're expecting something up to the normal Ark 21 standards, don't purchase this album. Even for the gangster style it barely pulls off, the rhymes are average, less than intimidating or entertaining, and the beats are too old school with that synthesizer cheese.

I've never read a book by this author, but something told me to take a chance on it. Thank heavens I did. Sleeping Beauty is so engrossing from cover to cover that I could not put it down. Margolin artfully crafts his characters and verbally stuns your senses with horrific crimes. It had many twists and turns that were not expected. I found it to be a very absorbing, page turner that's very hard to put down once you start it. This book will assault you from start to finish. I found Margolin's writing to be fascinating with each chapter leaving me wanting more. I will now read all of his earlier books and add him to my list of favorite mystery authors. A must read for fans and newcomers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of plot twists keep the reader paying attention","review":"Margolin's 'Sleeping Beauty' is a twisting, complicated story that kept me turning pages.There's a particulary gruesome crime followed by more murder and attacks that keep young Ashley Spencer on her toes and running for her life. With at least 4 suspects to choose from the reader is drawn along to the satisfying conclusion.This is not Margolin's best work, but it's very good nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money !!","review":"Terrible writing. Flat characters . Boring plot. Like reading a high schoolers' attempt at a novel. Couldn't finish it. Life is too precious and there are too many good books out there waiting for me to read them !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Beauty","review":"Miles Van Meter is an author who writes a book, sleeping beauty, about the murders that happened a few years back. The book goes through the book tour of sleeping beauty and flashes back to when the murders and trials were actually taking place. It all starts when Ashley Spencer, a student, comes home from a soccer game and later on that night someone breaks into her house and murders her father and best friend. The book, that Miles wrote, describes the many traumatizing experiences that Ashley goes through after the murders; from going to a new school, having many life threating experiences, and tracking down the murder of her parents. Sleeping Beauty was sometimes slow but I would definately recommend to continue on with it because there is an unexpected twist that you will never see coming. There are also many ties that make you not want to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex thriller","review":"SLEEPING BEAUTY is s story that spans six years. It opens with Miles Van Meter promoting his true-crime book that recounts his twin sister's attack by a serial killer that left her in coma, and of the home invasion in which teenager, Ashley Spencer's father was killed. The story moves seamlessly between present day and past events throughout the book in one of the most complex plots I have read in awhile. The plot offers many twists and keeps up a fast pace. It is a suspenseful book and hard to put down. If you are a hardcore mystery reader then it was not really that hard to figure out where Margolin was going with the story. I figured out who the culprit was within the first quarter of the book, but still enjoyed following the different paths that Margolin was leading the readers. The crimes themselves are pretty graphic so beware if you are faint-of-heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Suspense","review":"This wasn't the best I've read from Mr Margolin, but it was entertaining nonetheless. The ending was well written, though not surprising for me. I'd pretty much figured out who the killer was before the reveal, including the twist. That being said, I'm really looking forward to what comes next from Mr Margolin."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting read! Keeps you guessing until the very end.","review":"Sleeping beauty may be the best mystery I have read yet this year. It is a truly twisted tale that will have you wanting to stay up all night to read.I felt the book was well written, gaving just enough clues to not spoil the ending too early or leave you wondering how did the crimes get solved. This is my first book by this author, and I am hooked, I will read some of his earlier works. Sleeping Beauty was impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"My hats off to Mr. Margolin","review":"Mr. Margolin, you haven't disappointed me yet with your books...I have always enjoyed Mr. Margolin's novels, and Sleeping Beauty is no exception... I won't write down what the story is all about, i think most people who've reviewed it, kinda have that kind of postings, but i tell you all, do not miss this one! I always look forward to his new novel and I hope there's one soon... it's a worth a wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I have to echo the previous comments regarding the wooden dialogue and two dimensional characters. This book had such a good premise, but Mr. Margolin hasn't taken much effort to flesh out his characters. They are typical \\"stock\\" mystery type characters: the gutsy survivor/heroine who falls in love with her tender young savior. The sassy, nurturing and buxom black female district attorney. The sinister and wily bad guys. And some of the legal details within the story are not plausible. I just wish the writer had put more effort into developing characters, it's tiring reading about such stereotypical people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum!!","review":"I've read several good books by Phillip Margolin and either I've grown away from his style, or this book is really boring!

There was a new twist waiting around every chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really....","review":"I know that this is a story, and with that comes some parts where you need to allow your brain to let go of certain things that you know as reality. This book became almost monotonous to read...This was my first read from this author - and will certainly be my last. The plot was as if a ten year old wrote it, and the characters were all horrible! I did not enjoy this read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Beauty","review":"Margolin is a long time favorite writer of mine, however, in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" with its never ending cast of characters, and convoluted plot, I feel I could crawl into bed with the sleeping beauty and join her in her comotose condition and not miss anything. My brain can only take so much and in this rendition Philip has burned me out.We have the rape of Tanya, the murder of Terri, the murders of Ashley's police guardians, and then, finally when Casey Van Meter emerges from here coma the killer makes an attempt on her life. He is finally caught, convicted and sentenced to death...hooray!! Wow, in retrospect I wonder if it would have ended better if Casey had joined all the murder victims.E.J.

The writing did seem adolescent and didn't have solid findings as it went on . There were too many discrepancis and so it seemed, not logical research had been used.I am an avid reader and I am firm on not going to the back of the book nor do I stop it the middle, because the book, well,... sucks. This was the second book that I had to cheat on, due to it's unrealistic and very predictable plot. It was the first book by P.M. that I have read, I am a bit disappointed. Would I rate this higher the 1, I don't think so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not literature","review":"While the plot intrigued me somewhat (enough to finish it), I couldn't stop screaming at the pages about how far-fetched it was. The author didn't seem to have his own voice, making a stereotype out of every character, whether it was a jolly black female, goodie two shoes attorney, innocent maiden or an ice-queen mother. I am reluctant to believe that this writer had written better books before, if he did, he must have had a really bad writer's block to plagiarize someone else's work this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Couldn't give it 0 stars or would have. Disappointing read from beginning. Writing style was elementary, characters were two dimensional, dialog was stilted and unnatural. Figured out real murderer early on. Forced myself to read the whole book because I had paid for it. Test of endurance. Major blooper on page 313 (hardback version) - even editors and proofers had quit reading by then. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"i really thought this was a great book . i have read the other reviews and agree with some things said , so i will not repeat it. but i did not think that it made the book any less interesting . i did kind of have a feeling about how the book would end , but i wasnt sure . i finished it in about three days so it did keep me involved in the mystery . i will read more from this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I made my mother in law cry---priceless","review":"My mother in law has been looking for a cinderella watch for about 5 years (before I met her) and my goal was to get her one.

Not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-Opening Story","review":"This book was very heartwarming. It's about a Mexican immigrant family that crossed the border illegally. This book shows how immigrants at that time must have felt and lived. In this story the little kids miss many days, even months to help make a living. This family, like other immigrants, picked cotton, strawberries, and other things for money. The story shows how the family moves around and how their private lives and school life have a different story than us. They show a well first person story and has a strong perspective view point. I liked this book and this is probably good for ages from 11-16, or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 book series","review":"We read the 3-book series as a family. Great insight into the immigrant life. All 3 books are fast easy reads and great topics for discussion aroung the dinner table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greta's review","review":"This book is sad but at the same time interesting. I think it should be rated four stars. The Circuit doesn't have a happy ending. A summary of this book is, a boy named Panchito and his family sneak illegally over the border from Mexico to America when he is about six years old. The book ends when he is around fourteen years old. Panchito for parts of the year and goes to school in other parts. He and his family have to move a lot. Torito, Panchito's little brother gets very sick and may not live. They are very are very poor and have to work very hard for money. Panchito has a big family, he has a mom, dad, and seven sisters and brothers. Overall I don't really like how this book skips his ages like 7-12 or 6-8. Also, there was lots of words in Spanish I couldn't understand. This book would probably be good for ages 10-15. I learned that you should be thankful for what you have and there are people who are more poor than you and who can barely afford anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're Looking For NO Action...","review":"It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on.This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boaring Book Alive.","review":"The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Eye-Opener","review":"I bought The Circuit because I am working with the children of Mexican migrant families this summer. As I read, I imagined the kids in my class experiencing the difficulties described by Jimenez, especially the poor living conditions. Yet the stories are not written as complaints. The hopeful spirit of the struggling family members really comes through, and moved me to tears more than once. Reading The Circuit has helped me to better understand and appreciate my young migrant friends. I'm passing my copy around so that my friends and family can see why I care about those kids so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quayle & Mansfield","review":"An early vehicle for Jayne Mansfield in an entirely different role for her: a major thief.

The screw head was larger than the opening so it was stuck in there. I would add a picture if it allowed me to in this review. I'm returning the item as defective. Maybe not all of these are manufactured like this and this one escaped quality control.

It was easy-- took maybe 20 minutes from start to finish, and most of that time was spent struggling with my old flapper chain (which has nothing to do with this product). It's attractive and seems solidly-built. I'm very happy with this purchase.It took a couple of tries to get the chain set just right for a successful flush, but that's got to be true of every flush lever. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"The mechanism that pulls up the stopper in the tank doesn't have enough range to open the flap completely without holding the handle down. IE - The handle moves only slightly when you push down on it.I tried working with it for over an hour, but the design was too limited to replace my original equipment. Had to return it. I found another brand (fluidmaster 686) that worked for me. The handle was plastic with a metal lever, and it worked - had the range to actually lift the flapper off the drain and flush completely without holding down the handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolls Royce of the Toilet Tank Lever","review":"These toilet tank levers are the best engineered and produced product I've ever seen! I've tried other manufacturers levers and they are cheap, cheap, cheap. The Danco 89448A's are made from quality materials and function beautifully. The lever handle and shaft that goes through the tank hole are highly crafted out of heavy brass and chromed to perfection. The entire mechanism moves smoothly and solidly. It was easy to install, and the directions were easy to follow. I highly recommend these Danco toilet levers. They are worth the cost! If you are looking for a toilet tank lever to replace the old one on your toilet look no further, these are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laborious, at best","review":"A tiring read with content nuggets few and far between, this book is tough to get through. Endless dialogue between the players in yet another ineffective novel format, you'll be skipping pages looking for ideas you can actually put to use. With excellent books already on the market covering the concept of ACCOUNTABILITY this book by Lebow/Spitzer is superfluous. I recommend John G. Miller's writings: \\"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question\\" and his first book \\"Personal Accountability.\\" These are content rich, loaded with terrific stories, and practical. Plus, having just seen Miller keynote a meeting for us, he truly understands personal accountabilty and its application at work and at home. Excellent speaker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Home Run\\"","review":"Randy Spitzer and Rob Lebow hit a \\"home run\\" as far as my clients are concerned in their new book, \\"Accountability\\".There are so many great illustrations throughout the book to guide you. It's clear today that the way to true success for organizations is to implement freedom and responsibility without control if you truly want to win in the market, community, company and with your customers.The only reason anyone would not see the purity of the ideas and strong possibilities for helping your culture pay is because they are struggling to give up control. It's been a mantra of business for generations - this kind of thinking is destructive.So freedom and responsibility without control is the future and the future is now.

Also, the radio is only splash proof and can only withstand a small amount of steam. Because of this I didn't feel comfortable hanging it directly under the shower head by the rope, so I used the suction cups and placed it at the far end of the shower. But, I was constantly afraid that the suction cups would fail and the radio would fall. I used it exactly TWICE (total time was about 30 minutes) when the volume (on/off) button broke.

The only problem I've had with it is that the suction cups holding it to the wall of the shower don't fit into a keyhole slot, but rather they just push into the back of the radio at the top. This allowed it to be knocked off of the suction cups when it was bumped in the shower, landing on my foot, and clattering noisily to the floor.

In this CD, the listener is treated to a wonderful mix of genre music from Science Fiction and Horror films. Orchestra conductor Dick James makes the most out of instrument placement, musical arrangement and stereo separation.If there is a downside, it can only be the absence of a theremin in \\"This Island Earth\\" and \\"It Came From Outer Space.\\" Jacob opts for a jazz organ as an adequate substitute.The only other problem is the occasional squeaky chair noises the musicians make.

The first time we got through 2 episodes and just couldn't take it anymore. After several months and reading the rave reviews, we tried again. We got through 4 shows this time. We found the daughter is by far the most interesting character. The mother has some merits. The rest is simply bad acting and bad writing. For example in the 4th or 5th episode the bad guy comes into the room blazing. Our fine detective is on the phone to her office. What do you hear in the background as the heros are ducking and diving...\\"call 911.\\"We gave up after the lame poker sub-plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EMPRESSED","review":"I'm not wild about the series.

Nathan Fillion Rocks!!","review":"I have been a fan of Nathan Fillion since Two Guys and a Girl and I must say, this is one of his best roles! The dynamic between Castle, his mother and his daughter...just fantastic. Love the banter between Castle and Beckett! The other detectives and the Coroner are perfect too. Really, all great characters, great writing, WAY funny, Bravo!! I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for some humor and suspense all rolled into one. If you are a Fillion fan, you will not be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Castle!","review":"Castle is the funniest show around, which is interesting because it's also a crime drama. It's also the best show depicting a quirky but loving family. Most shows about which you could make that last comment are cast with some very strange actors all doing their own schtick, but this show is well-integrated: a truly stellar ensemble cast. Admittedly, I'd be happy listening to Nathan Fillion read the phone book, but he doesn't hog the jokes. His reactions to the other characters, which are often hilarious, feel real; he's not scene stealing, he's enhancing. Love this show! I wish there had been more bloopers, but overall the disk set of the first season is well produced with nice packaging and it arrived from Amazon in good shape. Small plug for Amazon shipping department: I've never received anything damaged from them, a fact that sends me back to Amazon all other things being equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle","review":"I releally like this show just don't ruin it with a lot of bedroom stuff.

Not my my usual, but it's so quirky and the characters are both well written and perfectly portrayed by the perfectly selected cast (eg, the relationship between Castle and his mother and daughter is so real you could believe the actors were truly related)Even if the actual crime side of things is a little cheesy at times (I'm used to watching far more intense styles so find these a might predictable), the charcaters are so great and the humour is just right that you can't help but enjoy it (and watch it over).

It's oh, so much fun to watch. And re-watch. And that says a lot right there, that you can re-watch it and still love it. Why? The chemistry all throughout the cast is great. But the interplay between Castle and Beckett is inspired. Only a little less so is the relationship between Castle and his daughter Alexis (try NOT loving Molly Quinn -- you can't do it!). Another big point in it's favor is that it's clear they are trying to make it fun. There are no obvious \\"Emmy grabs\\" with deep and dark, gritty stories. Just an entertaining hour of TV. Start with a twisted murder scene, throw in some twists and plenty of banter, and sit back and smile.Time to pick up another season......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, Funny, & Engaging","review":"The show always surprises me. It's full of humor, drama, and I'm always left wanting more. Not your cookie cutter police/crime drama. Stories are ever changing & I never feel like I've seen it before or even anything similar.

One of my favorite shows now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to a new show","review":"This is a 10 episode season that started as a midseason replacement. It is an excellent start to what I hope will be a looong running show. It reminds me of a combination of some of my other favorites: Monk, Numbers, and House, which all (oddly enough) happen to be one word titles. For those of you who don't know, it's about a writer (Castle) who is tired of writing Dereck Stone novels. He's rich and flamboyant, which works well with Dectective Kate Beckett whom he meets when a murderer is copy-catting how people are murdered in his books. He assists in finding the murderer, but realizes that he has found his inspiration for his new hero, Nikki Heat (taken from Beckett). He pulls some strings and gets to work side by side with Beckett on murder cases, using his vast knowledge of murder mysteries to help solve ongoing investigations. It's a wonderful cast on an even better show. Want more proof? Check it out on Monday night, 9pm (central standard time) on ABC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Love this show! Chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is fantastic, and I love their witty banter. The mysteries are always entertaining and intruiging, if not always 100% accurate, and the scenes with Castle and his family are awesome. Molly Quinn and Susan Sullivan are fantastic. The cast is great, the writing is great. All around fun, entertaining show. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love \\"Castle\\"","review":"I love this show. I love the banter, I love the characters, and I even love the plots. This one is must-see TV for me, and I think I've already watched and re-watched the eps on DVR so often I can recite bits of dialogue from memory.Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic are fantastic together. Lots of chemistry between them. And I wish I had a daughter like Alexis. Susan Sullivan is always wonderful.In addition, they get New York RIGHT. So few shows do, like CSI:NY having a cabbie offer a woman a cigarette when New Yorkers know that it's been illegal to smoke in a cab for at least twenty years.

A lot of history books fall down because they have very poor presentation. I am interested in art as well and I found the illustration really helpful. Another thing I liked about the book is that one author is a priest and the other a layman, a Protestant. Yet the two really gel well together. I have a new respect for the variety of Christianity and the influence it had on our culture and civilisation. Just to think, without the popes, America would not be geographically the way it is today.I wish there were more in the book. Hopefully the paperback will have more. One last thing. This book is in no way designed or written to convert anybody. It is a scholarly, yet popular presentation of the largest religion in the world.Full marks and a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and underdeveloped","review":"The story is very slow and the interactions between the characters were very forced.

The fact that it was written 40 years ago itself makes the book and Ms. Zinkin's understanding more hallowed. Being an Indian, who is arguably well-informed, I found this book very resourceful and, more importantly, disinterested.Open your doors to the real India with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book!","review":"These are great stories, I felt that I was right there as I read them. I liked the fact that while sex and drugs were represented, most of the artist's tales were about the really bizarre things that happen when musicians are on the road and when people are involved in the music business. Marley Brant makes the book even better by narrating and explaining the circumstances that surround these experiences, and frequently gives her own hilarious perspective on the story. There is more to Rock and Roll than what happens on the stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"First of all, I have a brief entry in the book. That aside, I am not bias. I read this book when I got it and I have to tell you, it's alot of fun. The stories are great, from the everyday fan to the singers and musicians themselves.

Its a compilation of true stories about the opulence and decadence of the rock & roll industry of the 70's & 80's, as told by the rock stars who lived it. Very cool. It puts you in the middle of the party or on that tour bus and you practically remember being there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book teaches true Zen practice, beyond mere philosophy","review":"I have read this book and recomended it over and again. What makes it special is that the practice for Zen living is emphasized beyond the mere philosophy of Zen. This is important because, as often misunderstood, Zen is not philosophy but practice- a way of life. The author has the understanding that true knowledge is only gained through practice and experience. He does not deny the years of disciplined sitting and diligence necessary to master oneself. There is no easy way, but the techniques given are sound and true and will facilitate your journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of it's Kind","review":"I've read a few books on Zen meditation, and this is definitely the best one out there. It's truly the only book on the subject you need. This book teaches the basics of zazen meditation in an easy to read fashion. You'll find the meditation technique taught in this book to be extremely calming and serene.Even if you're not looking for a book on meditation, this book gives some excellent commentary and history on Buddhism and the Buddha. The book also has great drawings showing the different meditation postures and how they can be adjusted. Most of all, this book offers a wonderful learning experience to those that are new to Zen meditation or for the experienced pro. There's something in here for everybody. It's a wonderful read and I often felt a sense of peace just in flipping through the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"i really liked this book... well ballanced between elemets. liked the inclusion of a glossary as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish that this had touched me more","review":"The first of Kapleau's books i read was 'Awakening to Zen', which i found touched me a lot more than this book, and i was a little disapointed with this read, as i had hoped for a lot from it. That said, this is still an excellent reference for those interested in Zen, with the discussion of koans especially good. I found that some of the talk about makkyo (sp?) and certain schools of zen a bit exclusive of other areas of zen, but we have to remember that this is written from Kapleau's experience and perspective, and take it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only if you are a Zen/Zazen follower","review":"There are many paths to enlightenment, and this may be one for some... but not for everybody. Zazen is a highly codified form of meditation. It feels like a rigourous martial training, reminiscent of karate or kendo. Except that you are aiming for spirituality. This is a double-edged sword. For those who have doubts... the book will provide an interesting cultural read, but there are many paths, even among Buddhist followers.Pros: self contained meditation manual, complete with personal lectures from Japanese masters, struggles of other followers and pictures of seating positions. A welcome contribution to the literature.Con: zazen only, at times critical of other Buddhist paths. Ignores the fact that the journey to spirituality is ultimately personal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"Wouldn't charge several of my electronic devices.

I acknowledge that I have only tried to charge two cell phones, one via the USB port and the other through the built-in adapter. However, neither one charged to any noticeable degree. While Indiana winters do not supply a surplus of sunshine, I attached the charger to a south-exposed window with suction cups and failed to get results on nearly 100% sunny days. In fact, once the phone ran out of juice on me and in every case the battery indicator stayed the same or dropped. Of course, the phone was on and thus using some battery charge, but to only maintain the charge, at best, is unacceptable. I have a coil/shake flashlight and a crank flashlight, so I desire to utilize renewable energy, but it has to work and I can't recommend the product when it can't charge a cell phone with its relatively low consumption/demand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - sturdy, lightweight, reliable","review":"I used this on a backpacking trip in the Rocky Mountains. It performed very well. The BattJack (AA/AAA) charger is really handy and works well too. One item of note is to make sure you try charging using 6V first as this mode works best for most devices. Also, be careful of the polarity on the adapters. Read the instructions BEFORE using the unit. The only things I might recommend to Brunton is to add a cover for the side connector panel to help keep dirt and moisture out when using outdoors and to include a couple other adapters because most of my electronics DO NOT use the 3.5mm or 5.5 mm adapters that come with the unit. I understand from another review that you can purchase more adapters at Radio Shack, but have not confirmed this as yet.

As far as I'm concerned, their tech support is non-existent.I returned mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but...","review":"I, like many others had a hard time figuring out how to get this thing to work. It has one major design flaw. When it is not in DIRECT sunlight, the battery charger indicator lights will show that the batteries are fully charged. For a long time I thought that it wasn't working.It needs full on, undiffused sunlight or it just won't work. When you find a patch of sunlight it works great. Due to this I would recommend keeping a good supply of charged batteries on hand if on a long trip out in the field in case of extended times of cloudiness.For the money it works well, just make sure you keep it in DIRECT sunlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor results and no response from tech support","review":"I am very disappointed in the Brunton Solarport 4.4.

Instead, it simply does what most musicals do, only very badly. They have compiled a cast of people who cannot really sing (well, maybe some of the poor vocalizing is intentional) to sing clunky, grating, and unfunny songs to the accompaniment of an orchestra of maybe four or five people, while wearing ugly costumes and bad makeup.

This is an excellent book for the burgeoning Blake scholar. In fact, I used this book to make a photocopy of plate 10 from America a Prophecy for the tatoo I had carved on my right arm.

It was easy to install both software and hardware. This is my third Visioneer sheetfed scanner in 6 years. I have found them to be useful and reliable, but, as others will tell you, tech. support is weak. My advice is to try it and, if it works from the get-go, you will probably have a good experience. If you have problems with the installation, you may be better off sending it back and buying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Once the manufacturer of the BEST sheetfed scanners on the market, Visioneer has turned ugly. Whatever vision they may have had is now myopic and fading fast.Why, you ask? Products marketed as XP-compatible aren't; they dump their products into the 'unsupported legacy' bin faster than any company I've ever seen; drivers require several patches and confusing trial-and-error workarounds; tech support staff are rude, untrained and unhelpful. Can 'new economy' companies really survive on a culture of indifference and limp technical savvy? We'll see, because that's the consistent denominator in Visioneer's offering.Check customer reviews and the (significant amounts of) outrage-infused newsgroup postings on the company before you even THINK about buying from them. Good luck, and don't say you haven't been warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Installation & Use Problems","review":"I installed the software for this product and it seemed to work fine for about 6 months.

I'm selling my XP 100 and reinstalling my strobe NT. The plus is that paperport software is excellent for going paperless, and the XP 100 is lighter and smaller than previous. Good for carrying with your notebook for faxing. If you don't have a notebook do yourself a favor and buy a Strobe NT. It works fine with win XP once the updated drivers are loaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality, worse than older versions","review":"I have been using Visioneer strobe scanners for nearly 10 years. This is one of their worst models ever. Problems include:(1) The paper wiggles around during scanning (causing warped images).(2) The entry slot is narrower than the previous model (XP 200).(3) The \\"guide\\" adjuster is difficult to align to the paper width (previous versions were automatic).(4) The driver fails intermittantly on Windows XP.(5) The single-side scanning is upside down (you can't see the paper as it is scanning, unlike previous versions).I highly recommend avoiding this product and instead buying a used XP 200 somewhere.The Visioneer design team is clearly ignoring the feedback of their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage","review":"This is my second Visioneer scanner in three months.

Yes, I must be a glutton for punishment.Same deal. Installed, worked fine. I must print, sign and scan docs twice a week. First time I tried to use it on the road, it was totally dead. Got a nice tech guy at a college where my kids are training to help, he got it working once. Next time I booted, dead again.I will never, never buy Visioneer again.

What a lousy company to do business with. Unlike most companies that provide computer related equipment, you can't download the software from their website. You have to have them send you the disk and, as mentioned above, they charge you for it.

I used visioneer's troubleshooting site to \\"quick\\" unistall and reinstall the software and scanner driver after having to manually edit my registry and use some special uninstall software they published and after three attempts I continued to get black page scans. I have attempted the installation on three different computers. The first one resulted in these black pages, the second resulted in fatal installation (never worked), and the third computer--a brand new Dell resulted in the scanner functioning ONE TIME.

Unfortunately, Visioneer would not upgrade the software to support it on Windows 2000 and XP operating systems. My last (and I really mean the last) Visioneer procuct was the Strobe Pro, which worked for a time on my Windows 2000 machine, but eventually stopped when operating system upgrades were installed. Product support is nearly nonexistent. Moreover, the Strobe scanners are not TWAIN compliant, so if it doesn't work with the supplied software, it won't work with anything. If you're lucky, the XP 100 will work for you, at least for a while. But if it doesn't and you need support, you'll find you're out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I have had a succession of Visioneer scanners, and each one has been more of a struggle than anything else. My XP 100 worked OK at first, but if I didn't use it for a while, it would lose its USB connection. Reinstalling everything seemed to be the only way to fix it. Then after 13 months (the warranty is one year), it lost its connection and won't work no matter what I tried. Tech support confirmed that it was dead but after the warranty expires Visioneer won't fix it. You have to trade it in for 25% off another scanner.

Moreover, the emotional intensity of the relationship -- rather, the NON-relationship between the author and her stalker is as gripping as the lack of trust and emotional betrayal by her husband is off-putting.

However, it does contain many of the same dark themes of human nature as you find in \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and others. Some will appreciate the work for those intricate themes, the historical portrayal of London, and the critique of anarchism--I ended up enjoying the novel as a classical spy thriller. It is a short and easy read, although I found it a little slow prior to the big event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue and violence","review":"An excellent story. On the surface it is about intrigue, terrorism, espionage, and violence.

I think the strength in this book is not really in the actual machinations of the anarchists, or their pathetic struggle to find strength in their own obvious weakness(this is often too hateful on Conrad's part for my taste--he clearly loathes them), but in Winnie's story, subdued by most of the events of the novel, and her mostly ignored \\"Maternal Passion\\" as Conrad puts it. This is the novel's heart, and the rest of the characters make up a sad, self-important circus around what is essentially her modern feminist heroism."},{"rating":"1","title":"While Acclaimed by Many . . .","review":"While acclaimed by many, The Secret Agent does not seem to me to be Conrad at his best.

Clearly, the character has been franchised - this isn't by the original author, Don Freeman, and in this one Corduroy is a stand-alone character rather than a toy bear living with his friend Lisa.That said, I really like this as an introduction to Halloween for little ones, and as a fun story to read. It's not great literature, but it covers the Halloween basics - jack-o-lanterns, dressing up, trick-or-treating, etc. - in a gentle, non-scary way, and it has a nice little story about friendship: Corduroy gives his costume to a friend whose costume breaks, because \\"friends are more important than costumes.\\"If you're looking for a great book, look elsewhere: if you want a nice Halloween story your toddler will enjoy, this is it - and the price is right, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun to read","review":"My son likes this book fine but I don't enjoy reading it very much.

He then ties it in with relevant Scripture passages. It's a very engaging read, and you won't be disappointed with it.The big lesson I got from it is that loving God is not just something that we say with our lips. But it's something that we demonstrate with what we do with our time and with our lives. I was especially touched by the story of the woman who shows her love for God by donating her lunch hour every day to leading a prayer and Bible study time at a nearby prison. She has six kids at home.

I don't understand movies like this. You have incredible star power yet no signicant plot or conflict.The obvious premise is that Meg Ryan leads a hectic life trying to care for her dad and keep her sisters informed all the while hating her sisters for not caring enough and feeling sorry for herself.After about 20 minutes of Meg Ryan going nuts on the phone trying to talk to people, I wanted a line to form like it did in the movie \\"Airplane!\\" where people slap her around a little and tell her to get a hold of herself.I guess the big conflict is will the two sisters of Meg care enough to come and see their father and will Meg ever calm down. I guess they do at the end but you will never care enough for the characters to care about the movie.

Meg Ryan spends most of the time screaming into the cell phone while Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow yell back at her. It might have a plot but it got lost in all the screaming. Even the slapstick-comedy food-fight stunk.When I left the movie I wanted to go to the mall and smack every person I saw with a cell phone.

Her estranged mother couldn't care less and her two self absorbed sisters aren't much help.My Opinion: This is a stinker of a movie. It is misconceived right from the start. Is it a comedy or is it a drama? It's not very funny, and there is nothing redeeming to the drama. There is nothing in this movie to justify watching it through to the end. They could have done a lot with the three sisters but it wasn't about three sisters. It was about the middle daughter and her alcoholic father. This just isn't entertainment. It would be more accurate if we called it something different like \\"punishment for traffic offenders\\".DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic with a deleted scene and a gag reel that is better than the movie.What You Should Do: Steer clear.

From a strong stable of actors to a top notch crew with regard to writing and production. The casting director was the lone assasin when they decide to plop Lisa Kudrow in the midst of actual actors. Kudrow's performance was so bad that she ends up on the editing room floor for major segments of the film, but sadly, not often enough. I believe the film's writers may have even snuck a cryptic apology to the audience when in one scene they actually have Kudrow's character complain, \\"Nobody takes me seriously as an actress!\\"This film certainly could have soared higher without the Phoebe Buffet stinking the place up. Kudrow may be passable on \\"Friends\\", but certainly cannot perform with any more depth than we've already seen on sitcom TV.

Fortunately, I was on an airplane and couldn't sleep but once I started to hope that the plane would get into difficulty rather than have to sit through this tripe, I knew it was a poor film. Meg Ryan is especially pathetic. She will not stop answering her cell phone and I just wanted to rip it from her hands and bash her on the head with it. How could 3 somewhat talented actresses get tied up with this garbage? There is a lame plot, the full mellow-dramatic try-to-make-you-cry but you can only laugh theme, and horrible sight gags. Why does Meg Ryan keep falling over things every time she answers the phone? It is really too bad for Walter Matthau that this film was his swan song.

It was such a depressing film; there wasn't anything even faintly amusing about the lives of these characters, and Meg Ryan made me SO nervous with her over-the-top interpretation of hyper. She never stopped talking! And then, all those incessant phone conversations quickly became incredibly irritating. In my opinion, it was a total dud.

Starring Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow, and Diane Keaton who also directs this film, is the story of three sisters who are very different from each other but unite and ultimately let go of some old age resentment through their father's illness. Ryan owns this film, she carries every scene and I think her dramatic side as an actress never gets the credit she fully deserves.

These 2 books couldn't be further apart as far as ease of getting the information out is concerned but if you persevere it WILL pay off.

Shane's most consistent work since The Pogues' 'If I Should Fall from Grace with God', he mixes Irish folk with a country twang and washes of slide guitar, rock'n'roll and dub reggae. If not a concept album, this seems to progress in theme, from the brashness and bravado towards the start with 'Paddy Rolling Stone', 'Rock'n'Roll Paddy' and 'Back in the County Hell', through more sensitive numbers like 'Lonesome Highway' and 'Mother Mo Chroi' to a kind of wistful nihilism towards the end with 'St. John of Gods' and its world-weary refrain of \\"F yez all, f yez all\\". The lyrics are by turns cynical, caustic, gentle and funny (the reggae pastiche 'B & I Ferry' praises \\"Mighty, mighty Jar\\"), and a flavour of the hazy world of MacGowan is conveyed.

These well done songs in every way for young children are little treasures that every child should have because they are so valuable, entertaining, fun, and educational. Bobby Susser knows his stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errr...who are you and what have you done to Eric Clapton?","review":"Eric Clapton is my favorite musician. Period. So needless to say I always look forward to a new EC album. It seems, however, that after winning a million Grammys for Unplugged, Eric has forgotten how to rock. Don't get me wrong, I love some of Eric's acoustic work. Unfortunately this album sounds like something an artist puts out when they are contractually obligated to put out so many albums, and the record company is pestering you for something...and you just want to get them off of your back. Hopefully the recent reunion with Cream will inspire EC to return Back Home...to rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"will the REAL Clapton please stand up","review":"What is goin' on here? Thank God, I did not buy this pitiful attempt of music. My poor friend did buy it and asked me to listen, I told him it might serve better as a coaster for his beer glass so his wife doesn't get upset for leaving rings on the furniture. What is Clapton doing? I believe in the past ten yrs he has been steeped in banality, but this offering is horrific. Please listen to The Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton for a true understanding of this man's brilliance. Layla for some of his best songwriting and vocal phrasings. I never thought I could ever think this,let alone express it, but Mr. Clapton PLEASE put away your guitar until you once again discover inspiration, you are embarrassing yourself and tarnishing your legacy. It breaks my heart to make these comments, but at least my friend's wife will be happy. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too laid back, too commercial","review":"Lets face it you purchase a Clapton CD to hear him rip away with some blues, but alas on this CD he tries to do much and that leads him astray from his roots. The result is a big dissappointment. I would much rather have had a CD come out of the Crossroads Guitar Festival (DVD) then this and I am really looking forward to the Cream reunion CD that is scheduled to come out next month. Skip this CD and buy just the good songs on iTunes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant pop...but not rock.","review":"I'm glad EC is happy.But sometimes tragedy, youth and passion is able to make music alive and meaningful with feelings.Now he's playing the home scene at 60 years old.This is pleasant pop...but not rock.Maybe at 60 I'll crave easy listening too.Its a nice package with a 5.1 DVD version in a dual disc with a normal CD mix.At the moment on Amazon there are158 used copies available ...some under $3.So what does that tell you?For that price its OK but don't expect the usual Guitar licks or pyrotechnics."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an odd album for an EC recording.","review":"While listening to this CD it becomes obvious that Mr Clapton is in a much happier place these days, and I'm honestly happy about that. Though that can influence some guys to write great music it seems to not be the case with this one, at this point in time.I bought this without hearing it first, a major no-no of mine for obvious reasons, and once again I have been taught why that's never a good idea.If you've enjoyed bluesy, guitar heavy tunes of Eric's in the past, you won't find even one of them here. The guitar work is mixed in there somewhere but only rarely does it stand out.In my humble opinion, with the exception of the first song, the entire thing, well... stinks. I wish him the best with it though. Maybe it'll strike a chord with somebody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"A few decent tracks such as George Harrison's \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\", however for the most part EC sings to sub standard R&B ballads, which may work for some, but not for slowhand. In addition, the first track slowly ends with a baby crying. Back Home is a long way from 461 Ocean Blvd. Eric you can do better than this!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This breaks my heart......","review":"It breaks my heart to say this, because Eric Clapton is, in my opinion, the greatest living guitarist.........but........I didn't really like Back Home. There, I said it. A Clapton comeback would be great, and the album has a few promising guitar solos, but Eric just sounds so BORED throughout the whole thing. Sure, the opening track is fresh and cool, One Track Mind has a nice solo ( for about 3 seconds), and the reggae-tinged Revolution borders on mildly interesting, but still, Clapton is out of place on an album I was so looking forward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite frankly, this is horrible!","review":"What is the joke? How are coffee and Eric Clpaton alike? They both suck without cream. Well, I don't go that far. Eric has made some really great albums, primarily/exclusively in the 1970s, but still. This album is such watered down claptrap that it is impossible to listen to without getting ill, primarily because the man behind this music is so talented and capable of so much more. Does Clapton have a really great solo album left in him? I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful, grocery store tunes","review":"The lyrics might as well of come from a pleasant housewife shortly after digesting a particularly interesting issue of People magazine. This album is squarely for people who enjoy pasteurized reggae, Pat Boone soul and musak blues. The production is glossy, unbearably plastic impersonations of lively musicianship.In short, the album has no soul. This music is best enjoyed while chatting with your elderly aunts and uncles over crackers and cheap, imitation cheese.Avoid at all costs and enjoy your shopping experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced","review":"For about the first time, I've found Amazon out-priced. This CD is available at Best Buy for $13.99.I do almost all my shopping here, but from now on I'll be more careful with comparison shopping before placing an order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album-Great High Resolution Audio","review":"3 stars for the album and 4 1/2 for the DVD side high resolution audio. Not one of Eric's best efforts, but a very comforting album mostly dedicated to the songwriters he admires most over the years and to his family. If you're a Clapton fan (and have learned not to expect too much), you'll enjoy it. I bought the DualDisc version and am very impressed with the audio quality on the DVD side which for once is in real DVD-Audio (both 2 channel & 5.1 surround) using 24 bit sampled at 48khz. This is so welcome since most DVD sides on DualDiscs only provide Dolby Digital sound which is way too compressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Evolution","review":"Clapton has evolved and is writing good songs that reflect maturity both musically and personally. I have seen Clapton live and it is this newer material in which he shines and plays the most passionately.This album is mostly soul/blues songs mixed with a few acoustic numbers.All are well written and Clapton's guitar comes through distinctly and soulfully.The best songs with classic Clapton guitar solos are One DAy and Run Home to Me.For me I like to hear lyrically soulful songs reflecting something real like longing and family and then have Clapton apply his guitar expertise bringing these songs to an emotional head.For those longing for the old Clapton--it was and is great material--but the man has evolved--"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone listen to Eric Clapton for easy listening?","review":"With Back Home, Eric Clapton has released an easy listening album. The question is, why would anyone listen to Eric Clapton for sappy pop music? His talent is his guitar, not his voice - if I wanted pop, I would listen to Paul McCartney. Eric's voice is okay, but not great, and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here, it doesn't compare to his better CDs in any way.I know that Clapton has nothing against pop. He's played with every one of the Beatles at concerts, and is featured on George Harrison's solo albums with George and Ringo. However, he can't sing a pop song like George can, and on this CD he doesn't play the guitar as well as George and Eric did on their classic collaborations like While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Badge.I hope his next studio CD is a Cream re-union album like the recent Cream re-union concert. Perhaps going back to playing the guitar while Jack Bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the big picture","review":"Having read the reviews, I have to say that I am disapponted in how much the reviewers are ripping Eric Clapton. If they are true fans, then they ought to realize that Clapton is probably the only artist not content to stay within one genre of music. He can move easily in and out of reggae, blues, R&B, and others. I think this album is a very strong album. It has some great tunes like \\"One Day\\", \\"Love Dont Love Nobody\\", and \\"Heaven\\". On \\"Revolution\\", Calpton has been able to duplicate Bob Marley and the Wailers (not an easy thing to do). So, when you listen to the album, please keep in mind that Clapton wants to show how happy he is in his life and that he is not content to be a one trick pony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and flat","review":"Clapton's inspiration has been replaced by some new boring forgettable elevator songs.I'm sorry to say that REPTILE was a very good \\"soft\\" album for me ...

Hope the set of his 2006 tour won't be only based on this album... :(Maybe, this time, you should try a \\"CREAM reissue\\" show on DVD ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"While being a perfectly decent workmanlike little collection of songs, some even written by himself, there is absolutely nothing special about this disc, nothing to recommend it...He is, for quite obvious reasons, a guitar icon, so you always have to tune in, just in case...but this, I'm afraid, is not going to be the one to break the somnambulistic spell cast by so many of his recent efforts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, bother!","review":"Has the man who blistered our ears with Mayall and Cream (both the original and the recent reunion shows), who stood toe-to-toe with Duane, who shared the spotlight with the lesser-known-but-perhaps-more-talented Albert Lee and with various authentic bluesmen, and who is capable of so much more than just mailing in stuff like this listless set of elevator music fallen under the spell of a mind controlling cult (has he been seen with Tom Cruise?), surrounded himself with too many \\"yes\\" men and women, or simply gone over to the bland side, a fate worse than the dark side and a place where rock and blues have been eviscerated by a music industry that shares more than it might imagine with factory farming where animals live short miserable lives cannibalizing the otherwise unusable scraps of their predecessors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"God\\" is Dead","review":"If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you. If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it. I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this. Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them. I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the EC?","review":"I'm a clapton fan because of his blues/rock background. The songs on this albums aren't even good pop songs. I was totally disappointed when I listened to this album because I listened to it objectively. If you didn't know it was Clapton, this CD would not get any 5 star reviews. The EC fan club might enjoy it, but don't buy this album thinking it'll be anything you'd want to listen to more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Robert Johnson to this?","review":"I really hate to give this record only one star. Like one reviewer just said, eric was coming off the cream reunion and a really good Robert Johnson record and tour, and maybe we were expecting a corner turn in his somewhat laid back studio attempts over the last few years (reptile, pilgrim). This record makes those seem energetic. Lets face it. Eric is a great talent, but people should know where their strenghts lie. Songwriting was never a real strong suit for him. We all know that his strenght lies in his guitar and in his love for the blues. None of these are present on this disc. His tales of domesticity in these tunes are almost downright depressing. I know that people are ''so tired '' when they have kids. Every parent knows already. What we need is to be uplifted. And this record falls way short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Clapton Disc !!","review":"Eric Clapton is a true ARTIST. Singer, Songwriter, and above all: Guitar Player. Art is in the eye, or, in this case - ear - of the beholder. I wouldn't want my Clapton music to be the same thing over and over,.... that's what ACDC, U2 and Rap Music is for.This Artist is worth EVERY BIT of the hype and myth that's ever been told,.... and this cd is as good as he's ever been.Don't listen to the whiners,..... get this cd and ENJOY something different and GOOD !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diet Pop Corn.","review":"Diet pop corn is the best way to describe this CD. It has nothing sweet sounding, is made from hot air and is corny. It's almost like Clapton is the Saturday morning cartoon version of himself. I understand the song subjects are important to him, but it's tiresome and boring and is not worthy of such a legend. The first song on the disc (So Tired) pretty much sums up the rest of the CD. Either he's tired or just damn lazy. If this were a James Taylor album I would say it's pretty good. But as an Eric Clapton album it blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Piece of Junk Released this year","review":"OK first of all, I am a HUGE clapton fan. I have most of the records, seen him a ton of times and was excited when this CD came in the mail. After listening half way thru I was very upset. The music is GARBAGE. I mean how can you go from the Cream Reunion and Sessions for Robert J to this Smooth Jazz pile of rubble. Not even guest shots from Winwood and Robert Randolph can help this thing out. Clapton scatting isn't my idea of a good idea.I will say \\"Revolution\\" is a great song, if the whole record had more of that vibe it would have been a good addition. In my opinion this is worse than Pligrim.Thanks to simon climie for screwing up clapton's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"clapton's back","review":"Some people have a problem with Eric Clapton's solo career because he has a habit of releasing lots of uninteresting laid back music. Back Home has a really good song called \\"Revolution\\" that's groovy and influenced by reggae. It's worth owning for this song alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Average","review":"Eric Clapton is a Great Guitar Player,but He has been making the same Album over&over&over again.vocally I ain't never really felt Him too much.the songwriting is aight.the Arrangements&overall Musicianship here is real Polished,but is lacking any feeling on a whole.Eric Clapton found a niche a while back&stayed with it&it has worked for him.but it just makes for another run of the mill Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear oh dear!","review":"Schlock, pure schlock. Eric Clapton needs a rabbit out the hat for the next one or he risks being remembered for tripe like this. It's right up there with Reptile and Pilgrim. If he wants to be dumb and happy, great! He deserves to be happy. He should do it in retirement. He's just way too good to be remembered for such mediocre material."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Tired","review":"That about sums up this album. He should have hung it up with Pilgrim, the last album that made him sound even remotely relevant. He's already had like 2 \\"final\\" tours, and keeps putting out embarrasing albums that make him sound like a fool and tarnish what little legacy he has left. I'm not sure what he's trying to hold on to but he doesnt do it with this album. Happy or not, it stinks and should never have been released. No one who is not a baby-boomer or under the age of 75 will buy this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Crap. Without inspiration and repeats themes and musical patterns built by the record industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gives me a headache!","review":"If you wanted something like \\"Unplugged\\", for goodness sake don't buy this album. It's just not wonderful. I think that I will give it away - if I can find anyone who wants it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop or blues?","review":"While I would be willing to listen to Clapton play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in the blues mode, I find this album is a little more pop than blues or rock. I prefer the straight out old fashioned blues guitar from Clapton,but this is definitely an enjoyable CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"elevator music","review":"Hey! Everyone even Eric is allowed to make a buck. After listening to this disc that's the conclusion I came to. I can only speak for myself but I don't listen to Eric to hear him sing I listen to hear him play his guitar. The guitar playing is almost non-existent. The mix on the vocals and other instruments drowns him out when he does play. The songs are OK but none of them really stand out. If I could return this disc I would. I know I won't be listening to it. I was glad when I heard Eric was doing something new and not just another pale imitation ofRobert Johnson but this has no bite. I just can't believe that when they listened to this prior to releasing it they thought it was good. I guess I'll just have to listen to the beano album"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats the point","review":"before this album came out eric said he wanted to make a rock pop album. i thought he might have done something along the lines of his first solo album from 1970 that was one of his finest. this one is a pointless stinker, no inventive guitar playing or memorable songs. two stars because he is clapton but no more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a continuation of his music today","review":"I'll sum all these \\"Back Home\\" supporters and ney sayers....IF you liked Reptile then you'll like this. I put them in my cd player and play them one after another like a two cd album and it works!! I like them both. Not five stars because a lot of his acoustic and electric guitar work gets drowned out by background singers and production. If you don't have a good stereo system...most people do these days, you'll miss the suttle strings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar","review":"Why bother to record stuff he most certainly makes up as he goes along, jamming? Where are the songs? And if you dont have any songs why the super laid back delivery?This record makes me want to go to sleeeeeeep. Last album, \\"mr Johnson..\\" was all that this album is not. This is not back home. That was the last album. The new one is back in reverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"As a lifelong Eric Clapton fan I'm dissappointed in thie effort or should I say lack of effort.

Eric follow your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIce overall Album","review":"After buying \\"Back Home\\" I was somewhat dissapointed after a first listen. I loved Clapton's Me and Mr. Johnson stuff and I'm the first one to jump on his Derek and the Dominoes, Cream and blues stuff. This CD does not represent that side of him.HOWEVER, after a second listen through I realized that there is much to love here if you are a soft rock Clapton fan. This CD is very eclectic, jumping from reggae and soft rock to R&B; and blues. Many sweet sounding songs that work well together on the album. Definately worth a listen. And I think ill like it even better a third time through :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Different, But it's Not Bad.","review":"Eric Clapton's new CD. For about A month that's all I thought about. And when I first heard the song \\"Revolution\\", I knew this CD wasn't gonna be like his early stuff. It would appear as if the rock out, guitar soloing days are over. But that's ok with me...In his interviews, he talks about how he's really happy right now with his life. Any fan of his would know that that's all that matters. He's playing how he feels. And it makes me wonder why all these people are complaining about it being to pop and stuff. He's writing about he feels. If u just really don't like this album, maybe you should think... are you really an Eric Clapton fan?Now with all of this that I have to say... why only give it 4 stars? Because, I don't think it's his best.... But it's up there. There are many enjoyable songs on here. At as much blues as some of his other latest CD's.. but again.. I sure don't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the critics, this is great music!","review":"This is the master at work. Great songwirting, great music and superb performance.

Not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the usual ec","review":"this is not the usual ec album. its all pop music except for one track. there are no good guitar solos.

It's nice that life has improved for Eric, he's had very rough times in the past so he deserves it, and he obviously loves his children but great music usually comes from hungry, tormented artists. The giveaways: string arrangements, the kiss of death for any hope of edginess in rock, jazz, or blues. Despite the all-star line-up of great musicians, including Robert Randolph, John Mayer, and the late great Billy Preston, this album is about as interesting as an egg salad sandwich."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"When I was introduced to Clapton through From the Cradle, my jaw dropped! That was the kind of blues that my soul melted under.Unfortunately \\"Back Home\\" is not even 1% of what From the Cradle was.

While he deserves domestic happiness, the album harkens back to his worst commercial instincts. Sounding very much like the MOR sounds of his worst efforts like August and Pilgrim. The album has a professional and over-produced sound that is perfectly made for Adult Contemporary radio. The one highlight is The thoughtful and loving cover of Mr. Clapton's good friend George Harrison's \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\". It is an obscure album track from 1979's George Harrison album and Mr. Clapton puts his heart into and it is a touching tribute to Mr. Harrison. Too bad the rest of the album lacks this loving touch and feels like a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A very poppy CD with the girl singers back unfortunately.Sounds more like his early 80s stuff which I found back then to be his worst stuff.I guess Eric can't please everyone but this CD is a real downer.Very little guitar solo's however Erics voice is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back home, now stay home!","review":"Sure, the musicianship is solid, as is the studio production but it's dreadfully missing good guitar work, creative energy, memorable tunes and innovation that once marked this wonderful musician.I came away feeling really cheated, Eric sounds tired and uninspired.It seems the only band left from that \\"by gone era\\" that is still making \\"vital\\" rock music is Deep Purple, just check out their new album Rapture of the Deep. It's rock music with something to say, lyrically and musically. Simply brilliant! The release of Back Home is confirmation that Eric Clapton of today is no longer a artistically viable artist. But, it's not the final nail in the Clapton coffin, just a novelty, crawling at a turtle's pace.With two of my favorite artists moving in polar opposite directions, I'd just as soon watch Clapton retire and Deep Purple continue to unfold.Eric Clapton/Back Home: 1 1/2 starsDeep Purple/Rapture of the Deep: 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"Very disappointed in this effort by Clapton.

In short, this album is one of Clapton's worst ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK... a little bit of a let-down...","review":"I'll be brief and blunt. The new EC disc is slick, clean and rather pedestrian. I have been a loyal follower and fan of EC since first hearing Cream on L.A.'s first free-form FM radio station in the mid-late 60s. I believe he has always been, and is now, a stellar artist. So, it's not without some perspective that I opine on this recent effort. The references to family are great in a scrapbook or photo album. On a record album? I think no. After realizing that what I heard in one of the cuts was a baby crying back in the mix, I really had a hard time going through the remaining material. It's a little too sappy. It's wonderful he is happy and I suppose for some (many?) it's pleasing to hear that happiness echoed in his music. I'll lay out on this one and hope the next time he gets a bit grittier. (No, I don't believe his material has to be dark or that he has to maintain the \\"tormented artist\\" persona but this is a bit too far up on the happy-meter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"That's what I feel after listening to this album... blah.I tried very hard to find this record's groove, but easy listening music is not my thing. EC the guitar God is most certainly alseep if not totally dead. The few times I heard his Stratocaster come alive, the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference.The music itself is lackluster and uninspiring. There are no stand-out tracks, and every song sounds like it could have been written by any amateur songwriter. With such a great backing band and top-notch guests, this record should have caught fire and burned strong. The only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production.To me it looks like EC has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing.Very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton Back Home","review":"This is good stuff.

With the outstanding recent Robert johnson sessions I was expecting something exciting ... but this isn't exciting or, for the most part even interesting. It's okay, but not good. If you are a Clapton fan, you MAY enjoy it ... or at least a couple of the tracks. All in all, it is a bit of a dissappointment. Too Michael Boltonish (a little sappy) .... Your mom would probably think this was a pretty good record. I look forward to the next Clapton release."},{"rating":"1","title":"EC needs to get rid of SC","review":"I agree with the guy who said this Simon Climie messes up everything. Just listen to Pilgram. It's not very good. As soon as I saw his name I thought \\"another\\" album ruined. Every once in a while Clapton turns out a good album, From the Cradle, Journeyman, Money and Cigerettes etc. The day he decided the guitar wouldn't be the main focus,,,things went south. He is still a good blues guitarist but if you want to hear great songs, great singing and super guitar riffs and solos, pick up Jimmy Thackery's, Sinner Street, Drive to Survive or Healin Ground. This guy is in Stevie Ray Vaughn's league. The old Clapton (Dominoes,Cream,Mayall) will always be one of my favorites but I just don't want to hear sappy crappy bull and boring guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"If, like me, you found Mr. Clapton sublime and in the pocket with \\"Unplugged,\\" \\"Me and Mr. Johnson,\\" and \\"Riding With The King\\" (his duet with BB), be careful before you purchase this album.This is an imitative pastiche of recently fashionable pop cliches - 20 years ago for some, and 10 years ago for others. Aside from a couple of nifty flourishes, nothing distinguishes this album. It sounds like Clapton doing Kareoke. He even cops a Lionel Ritchie/Soul Chick groove on one song; it's horrible, even though his pipes are up to the required high notes. So, you might want to sit this one out. He'll be back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder why.....","review":"Tell me: why do teeny-boppers buy CDs like this and then post 5 or 4-star reviews by the dozen and say nothing more than \\"so-and-so is cute\\" or \\"they're good dancers\\" and then not actually take a look into the music itself? If I were you, I'd buy a CD only if I have tried it out first and then liked it. And then I'd have to make as good use of it as possible. That's something I myself have to take note of in the future. So, don't just buy a CD by the BSB, 'N Sync, et al because they're cute or anything like that, buy it only if you find the songs interesting. It just goes to show, after all, that this genre judges only by looks and not talent.

The book has alot of Pascal and pseudo Pascal stuff in it. If you need a headache, this is the book for you. To give Sethi a little credit though, some of the book is written okay, but this is not nearly enough to conteract all the other problems.

Since he does not give any explanation on how those snippets relates to what he is talking about, it just becomes even harder to understand.

It covers not only the ideas involved with writing programs in these languages, but also deals with some aspects of implementing compilers (attribute grammars and typing) and interpreters. At the end of the book, the chapter on lambda calculus prepares the reader for advanced material on type checking.The one aspect of the book that doesn't stand the test of time is the material on concurrent programming, which uses Ada. These days, it would probably be better to cover concurrent programming using Java or C++ with OpenMP or Threaded Building Blocks instead.

This book read correctly can change many peoples lives. Brilliant story about people searching for the meaning of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Original for its Time","review":"Considering that this book was first published in 1959, its amazingly original. Many of the themes and techniques Vonnegut pioneered here have been copied by other authors. For example, I read (and enjoyed) \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" a few year ago. However, I now realize that much of \\"Hitchhikers Guide\\" is a blatent knock off of \\"Sirens\\". My only criticism is that its really drags in places (like Unk's time on Mars). Despite this, its satire is inspired and the story is incredibly complex, yet coherent. So many of the small details turn out to be important. That Vonnegut did this without benefit of a word processor makes him all the more a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously - like other Vonnegut works I've read, and I'm no authority, the sci-fi serves as more of a plot device to drive home his humorously ironic yet wonderfully insightful social commentary. I've found this book the most meaningful of his I've read so far, about something we've all wondered from time to time: what is our purpose and where do we fit in to the universe?

Every chapter and every character is loaded down with the handicaps of futility and absurdity. It seems like the writer was attempting a total escape from rationality.

Perhaps it was theater of the absurd, perhaps verbal LSD.Earthlings, kidnapped from earth, are robotonized on Mars in order to invade earth in a futile suicide mission to unite all earthlings in a grand new selfless religion.

This is crucial. Vonnegut often uses fantastical devices in his work to relate his view of human existence to the reader. There is, however, no concern for elaborating on the workings of these devices, or even making them plausible. Vonnegut cares only for what those devices represent. This novel is, primarily, a rather despairing satirical analysis of the human condition on a cosmic scale.Read it to the end. I can't stress this enough: I disliked what I read until the end, because I was reading it in the wrong spirit. When I got to the end, however, I began re-reading sections and actually enjoyed it quite a bit. So read it to the end, and read it in the right spirit.The book is remarkably well-written, has a deceptively clever plot, and has rather deep characterization. All this in a relatively short book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An understated classic","review":"This is gem from Vonnegut's early career, before he'd crafted his clever style of bantering with the reader to an art form. The storytelling is still very deep, entertaining and poignant, the story itself is a masterpiece. This ranks easily among my favorite books of all time.It's a little more sci-fi, but I think it only uses that approach as a vehicle with which to convey its much deeper sentiments. To sum it up, it's basically about someone who sets up an insanely complicated chain of events in order to accomplish something very simple, yet very vital. The reader then comes to find out that the person's plan was part of the plan of another party, a far more elaborate plan to accomplish something even more simple.The story is very clever, and emotionally bittersweet. It is grossly understated among other Vonnegut books, I think it was by far his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vonnegut Prototype","review":"This was Kurt's first novel, and it's clear that it influenced practically everything he wrote subsequently. This has pretty much the entire Vonnegut bag of tricks: crazy characters, absurd situations, wild speculation, clever metaphors, and his intriguing style that holds the reader's interest through it all. This is a novel that you can finish and thoroughly enjoy in a single weekend. But don't misunderstand; this is superficially a simple science fiction story, but the layer directly underneath the surface is more of a lucid insight on the human condition. I particularly enjoyed the Chuch of God the Utterly Indifferent."},{"rating":"1","title":"was expecting so much more","review":"Stilted and difficult to begin.

The story is a kind of written cartoon that I don't know how to consider. All is too simple, too black and white, too unbelievable... All protagonists are freaks. Paradoxically, the most human person may be the Tralfamadorian machine. So what can be made out of all those words? A fable, a satire, an allegory, or even a parable? All of these, none of those? I can only say the message KV intended to convey didn't touch me. Books by KV make me think of abstract works of art that many people enjoy contemplating.

Dick like myself will no doubt enjoy this book, the writing style and theme are very similar.But if you expect to discover the meaning of life and answer some big questions about the universe...prepare to be disappointed. It does none of that unless of course you've never once thought about God, the afterlife and the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not representative of Vonnegut's work, but still worth it.","review":"Though I am a fan of Vonnegut, it is still rather obvious that Sirens of Titan is one of his first novels. It is much more science-fiction based than most (all seem to have some science-fiction element, but are not completely relying on the genre), and doesn't possess the usual flippant Vonnegut attitude- this book seems more serious, more dark without giving itself entirely to dark humor.This is certainly not to say that it isn't a great read. Like all Vonnegut books, the characters, if not entirely likeable, are quirky and completely unique, interacting in envirnments that only Vonnegut could envision- The Rumfoord's neglected estate on Earth, Mars, inside the crystal caves of Mercury, and Saturn's moon, Titan. All in all, this is a great read, for Vonnegut fans and newbies to Vonnegut alike- but it should be remembered that this is certainly not as representative of all his work as is the masterpieces Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Brilliance","review":"An avid Vonnegut reader, this novel is my favourite. The characters, full of personality and quirky behaviour, demand attention, and well deservingly, succeed. In following Malachi on his \\"spiritual\\" journey through space and time, one can not help but fall prey to the brilliance of Vonnegut's narration. A classic novel, comprised of pure wit and social critique, this is a definite read for anyone, espcially those who adhere to a cynical view of life, the universe, and everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"He does it again","review":"Another solid addition to Vonnegut's body of work. The story keeps you guessing, the satire is thick, and the humor is DARK. Vonnegut leaves nothing sacred.

This is an amazing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex yet simple","review":"Were dinosaurs on this planet only for the purpose of providing modern-day man with a fuel source? The Sirens of Titan is a wild ride through the imagination of Kurt Vonnegut. The protagonist, an ordinary man cum messiah, takes himself and a constantly metamorphasizing cast of characters through amazing adventures, on many planets... for one simple purpose. It is the purpose of these travels that leave the reader pondering his/her role in the future of the universe. As always, this Vonnegut creation was impossible to put down. Entertaining and thought provoking, yet borderline absurd, I would recommend it to any reader enjoying satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Sirens' Challenges Your Faith","review":"Be prepared for a rocket ride - not just through the overrated regions of space/time, but through the very fabric of the human condition in its need to believe in something \\"bigger\\" than itself asserting influence over the universe. 'Sirens' provides compelling, if somewhat comical, doubts strong enough to rattle the most stalwart of faiths. An incredible ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated joy!","review":"Vonneguts 'The Sirens of Titan' is an underrated masterpiece in his extensive catalog of material. More frolicking than his later works, this book takes the reader across the solar system in a delightful foray into parody and satire. Unlike his sometimes obvious - dare I say heavyhanded - novels that came later, Sirens remains fairly subtle and always witty throughout.A *MUST READ* for Vonnegut fans, or just casual readers looking for something to dig their teeth into. Certainly one of Vonneguts three best."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Spaceship","review":"This is a very entertaining and humorous sci-fi story. Vonnegut was superb at telling a tale. He writes some of the weirdest stuff you'll ever read. I think these people who don't like Vonnegut were probably not ready. You have to prepare yourself mentally for Vonnegut. I think a 6 pack will help too. For example, I found a tipping point when he described Earth as God's space ship. Never mind it keeps going in a giant circle. If it went straight, we'd have a whole other set of problems. We are all riding God's space ship. This is typical Vonnegut-ism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"This is a classic book and has many of the themes Vonnegut uses in later works.

And who among us may say that this time warp and military industrial complex has not occurred in our lifetimes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah","review":"I got most of the way through this book by promising myself that just around the corner will be something interesting that doesn't annoy me. Eventually the fear of more disappointment trumped the anticipation of discovering the point of this book and I was forced to abandon my beleaguered effort.

DuPont's role is certainly worth lauding, but not in the embarrassingly fawning, reverential way this book is written. Even his daughter presents a more realistic portrait of the man, his garden, and his collecting obsessions in her own recent book.He was such a shy and inarticulate man, that the quotes throughout the book are almost embarrassing. He sounds like Chauncy Gardner in \\"Being There.\\" The author and her Winterthur sponsors would have served their subject better had they not expressed their admiration in such florid, effusive prose.

Then the radio link between the rain sensor and the display failed and will not reset using the user manual procedure. After all this trouble I have come to the conclusion that I'm glad I purchased from a Local Retailer (Wally World) as it is going back.

La Crosse sent me instructions for \\"rebooting.\\" but nothing worked. I called La Crosse again, but this time talked to a less sympathetic person, who classified the failure of my unit as \\"abuse\\" and was therefore not covered under warranty. So be aware that the receiver is not very durable (our cordless phones hit the floor all the time and keep working), and that the company is not very interested in keeping satisfied customers.

With the French and Spanish versions included in the same little booklet, it is very difficult to read and, at the same time, make adjustments to the unit.

I enjoyed the disc, and it was intended to leave you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"B5 short stories","review":"More, more, more. The more B5 the better.Just be aware, these are NOT full blown episodes or movies. These are short stories, single plotline tales on a smaller scale. They have subjects that are pure Straczynsky - moral dilemmas that should provoke thought and discussion, without the distraction of the shadow war.Think of seeing a video of just Garibaldi trying to get his package from the post office, or Ivanova meeting with her \\"Uncle\\" and reconciling with her father's death as stand alone short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad.","review":"OMG, I can't believe how horrible the 2 stories are on this dvd. Two short, very boring episodes consisting of 2 to 3 actors basically chatting with each other. No real drama, no suspense... nothing interesting at all. The two shows on this dvd don't even have the \\"feel\\" of B5. When I got to the end of the second part I couldn't believe that that was it.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Tales","review":"I am a HUGE B5 fan from the start and think that B5 was probably the best show ever written, but the Lost Tales should be renamed as the Last Tales as they were awful. I expect so much more from JMS and was highly disappointed. I bought the DVD and wish I had rented it instead. These short stories show that JMS must be getting too old and slowing down and not as good as he once was. If this is the kind of stories he is going to release in the future, I hope he does no more of them because I'd hate B5 to end on a bad note."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lost tales weren't lost, they were forgotten!","review":"The lost tales weren't lost, they were forgotten! I admired the Babylon 5 series because of the realistic entertaining plots about sociological issues among different species in space. This movie was realistic with the understanding that real day to day life can be anti-climatic and tedious. The stories have little plot, and have nothing to do with each other. The only thing that kept me watching was hope. I hoped there would be some dense plot(s) that would develop and make me want to care. Plot or purpose wasn't the only thing this movie lacked, it also needed more people. There were only 4 or 5 main characters throughout the entire movie.The best part was the ship battles special effects, and an appearance by a former Stargate regular. My opinion is you will thank yourself for borrowing the movie not buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommendation","review":"Babylon 5 was an excellent series and we were looking forward to The Lost Tales even though the majority of cast members weren't involved. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed with this DVD. Actors did a good job, but after watching, felt like this was just something thrown together to put the Babylon 5 name on it and sell a few movies. Let's hope for a full-fledged Babylon 5 reunion film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"A very good set of stories. The CGI effects are MUCH crisper. Though both tales are short I think they are worthy additions to the Babylon 5 saga.The tributes to Andreas Katsulas (G'kar) and Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin) were subtly worked into the fabric and touching.The stories are driven, not by the CGI or the sets but by thoughtful writing. I gladly recommend them to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5 lives","review":"These two additional episodes take a brief look at life on B5 some 10 years after Sheridan left the station. The episodes appear unrelated at first but the end ties things up nicely.I rate this as a 4 and not a 5 because the overall production values are lacking. With only one major star and one minor star from the original series I felt something was missing. The reason I didn't give it only 3 stars is the behind the scenes and making-of material are excellent and, for those of us not paying close attention to Hollywood news, there is a new meaning for the phrase \\"Beyond the rim.\\"All B5 fans should pick this up but don't expect the same overall quality season 5 left us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, a disappointment","review":"I love everything Babylon 5.I have all the DVDs and i tell people howgreat a series B5 was, especially seasons 3 and 4.I saw this latest 2 story, made for video release the last week of July.The 1st story was....well boring and short. There was a slight tie in tothe second story which was better and more like the old series, but italso was short and i was left wondering where is the rest of this story?It could have been the beginning of a pretty good episode.This morning i watched the 1st episode of B5 the fifth season and itwas twice as good as \\"The Lost Tales\\"If you have seen that episode before, you know what to expect.Of course I'll buy the next video when it comes out.Heres hoping fora better effort then.By the way a friend bought Lost Tales off the shelf at full price, atleast I paid 10 bucks less by buying here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good continuation of B5","review":"Excellent story and solid acting make this LOST TALES disc a lot of fun. I am hoping it does well enough to make more in this series because the B5 universe is deep and expansive. The special FX in this release are the best B5 effects you will ever see.The increased FX budget coupled with tech advancements make the station look better than it ever had.I recommend it wholeheartedly for B5 fans.

I am sorry folks, but this did not measure up to the show I enjoyed 10 years ago. I miss the stations full of people and aliens, the zocalo, busy corridors on the station, and the moldy & sleezy down below. An original episode of B5 would have several different characters and plots going on at the same time. There was not enough going on in the background that painted the tapestry of the old B5. The B5 station didn't even have the same feel to it.As far as extras go, the memorial was the best part of the dvd.The sock puppets was really stupid and should have been left out. If it was a joke from the conventions, it just doesn't translate onto the dvd. And we are tired of JMS's arrogant attitude.I understand it may have been written for the fans in mind, but I think the fans deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another \\"wish I could give 3.5 stars\\" review","review":"It's Babylon 5, without a doubt. The episodes were a bit quiet and much more philosophical than I was expecting -- and the use of green screen shows quite a bit in some places. On the other hand, the actual special effects are much better than anything in the show's past.The DVD has two related, but separate stories -- more or less like episodes of the series. Was it good? Good enough (and much better than \\"Legend of the Rangers\\" or \\"The River of Souls\\".) I hope they make more.For anyone griping about the price, do you or do you not want more Babylon 5? You're essentially funding the show (no network to interfere!) by buying the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5 Revisited","review":"This selection is really for Babylon 5 afficianados - It should not be thought of as a \\"real\\" offering to this fabulous series.

I wasnt' really impressed with the story line. The special effects were great. But you could tell that the actors were all filmed on a soundstage. That part was a little disappointing. I would like to see more of the DVD releases, just pep up the storylines a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon 5: Left Behind","review":"The two stories on this DVD were obviously produced inexpensively and bear little resemblance to the TV show. As a fan of Babylon 5 I feel cheated.The first story takes Babylon 5's religious undertone and rams it in your face. It's more silly than entertaining or enlightning.The second story is a little better, but would be more suited as a sub-plot in a regular episode than a stand-alone story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done science fiction","review":"This release is one of the better Babylon films, it embodies much to think about, as well as great acting, and a provocative plot, with enough memorabilia to satiate the taste of Babylon 5 fans, as well as new viewers.

In the past the Babylon 5 series and movies have been outstanding in story line, visuals, and acting.Disappointment and confusion. Those are words that come to mind after watching this DVD and this has been the same for other B5 fans I know.I understand that the production budgets are tight and as a result the visuals are a let down. All I can say is that every B5 fan should purchase a copy so that the revenue can go into future B5 projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories, but alittle low budget","review":"Typical B5 storyline from JMS. One of my problems is that I don't know where the stories line up with cannon. Also, it the production didn't have the same feeling as a normal B5 movie/show b/c (at least in my opinion) there were that many extras to give it that classic B5 feel of vibrance and hustle-and-bustle. Overall, both stories were interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Don't buy! This DVD appears to have been assembled from episodes that were not good enough for SCIFI channel reruns (yes,that BAD). The plot lines are terrible. Additionally, the same episodes can be downloaded for free from various movie websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"$1.99 at iTunes, sure... $16 bucks, no way...","review":"CGI = good, but limited.Actors = OK to good, some were a bit stiff, but none were painful.Storyline = weak at best, and the 1st part was totally outside the B5 'universe'I agree with the lead review, this really boils down to a (not very good) single episode. After watching, I kept going through the DVD thinking there had to be more to it than that. From what I'd heard, I was envisioning something more along the lines of Sin City, with several 'episodes' linked together with a common narrative. I liked B5 from the first episode, but this DVD feels like a blatant rip-off of that audience. It just isn't worth the money, and buying it will only encourage more of the same. If they do more episodes (especially if they are halfway decent), and release them all as a DVD, maybe that will be worth watching (and buying)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst PoS I have ever bought......","review":"Save your money!!!!

The effects are great, unfortunetly that's all that is great. The story line and acting are less than that of the original series and seem to be two parts of two different, two part episodes. The sets are very minimal with barely a peek back into the big baby. The second part with Sheridan has a little flair but the budget shows when they don't even suit up for the starfury trip, a cheap way out of making the costumes. With all the dialog trying to be cerebral, there is a real lack of action. Strike that, No Action. Galen is the only character who's acting is up to par and I wish that there was more featuring him. The price is pretty high, I imagine that it will drop after the \\"suckers\\" have bought their copies, look for it in the bargin bin in a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Low Budget","review":"First of all let me say I am a BIG FAN of Babylon-5. I own the entire Babylon-5 series collection and the special feature movies. \\"NONE\\" were ever made as low budget as Lost Tales. The 2007 episode of Babylon-5: The Lost Tales, has a 15 minute story line stretched into 60 minutes using very few props - and I do mean very few. And for the most part... there's only three actors - 5-total.But... in the special features section on the DVD there's a memorial/tribute for two of the original main actors who have past away, G'Kar in 2006, and Dr. Stevens in 2004. That feature is worth buying the DVD for.Thomas"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen a bit of it","review":"At the New York Comic Con in February, JMS showed a couple of versions of the opening sequence. Once was with completed CGI but no music. Once was with music but incomplete CGI. It wouldn't be right to give a detailed description but I can tell you that the CGI is excellent and that the opening sequence is wonderful, pure Babylon 5 and even manages to give a 'nod' to Andreas Katsulas. The music is also great.To correct a previous review, the disk does only have two stories - one on B5 and the other on the Presidential starship.

Religious beliefs are a personal thing and should be kept out of movies unless it's a movie targeted at a specific audience that was made aware of it when buying it.The second episode was average and seemed low budget.Quality of the picture is better than the original series, but still a bit disappointing.I loved the original B5 series but this DVD is disappointing and a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disappointment","review":"Babylon 5, probably the best sci-fi vehicle ever made for television, bears little or no resemblance to this pointless sampler. These two short films will leave you wondering when the real Babylon 5 episodes will begin, and when will these terrible trailers be over? Oh, they're not trailers, this is the actual content. Well, maybe I can re-gift it to someone I don't like. The two pointless, irrelevant stories here will leave you wishing for more made-for-TV post-series movies instead of this. The only reason I can conceive of for having made it in the first place is BRUCE AND TRACY NEED MONEY.If you really appreciated the original series, it's engaging and bold plots, it's excellent characters and acting, the way it beautifully reflected contemporary issues, and just astoundingly good story telling, this DVD will leave you in tears of remorse.

And what is the deal with the rotating camera shots and shots of people's stomachs and knees? This story has no action, using perhaps the dullest characters in the show (apologies to Scoggins, she could probably do better if she was given better dialogue and plot). This is just a continuation of the decline of Season 5, although I thought it couldn't get any worse.Is this really the first of 6 DVD movies? Well, you lost me already, JMS.

Of course, along this line, it would have been awesome of JMS had included more than just two \\"lost tales\\" on this DVD.

It takes place during Cmdr Lochley's post on B5. There are some references to the late actors who played G'kar and Dr. Franklin. The video is pretty much two short stories. One that focuses around Lochley and the other around Sheridan. Although I was satisfied with the production of the two pieces (the B5 station looked incredible with the current CGI) it did keep me wishing for more of the cast members to show up.For me the part that made the disc worthwhile was the obituary videos for Richard Biggs (Dr. Stephen Franklin) and Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar).

I won out using the argument that we just need to get the pain over with so the DVD can be shelved...forever.We are now rewatching the series for the upteenth time in an attempt to purify our memories of B5.

This makes Legend of the Rangers look like a classic Bogart flick. The story was poorly written and had nothing to do with expanding on the storyline of the series. It had nothing to do with anything B5. Its only purpose is the stealing of money from unsuspecting fans wanting a plot, some relevance, and maybe a little action.

No Delenn, no Kosh, no G'Kar, no Garibaldi, no Londo, no Vir -- this is a serious handicap to the small, personal stories that the Lost Tales purport to be. Why? Personal interaction is intrinsic to the lifes of Lochley and Sheridan.

I also was surprised to see such a religion based story for the first episode. I thought that was both inappropriate and a bad story that went nowhere. The second episode with Sheridan showed some potential, but also went nowhere in the end. I would sum up this DVD as an hour of nothing!

While I wouldn't rate these two tales as bombshells (come on, it's going to be damned hard to beat \\"No SUrrender, No Retreat\\"!), they are fairly good for half-hour stories (would have preferred a full 43-minute episode, but...we takes what we can get).

Mystery lovers can only hope that it won't be the last.Scudder might be showing his age (he's now 62!) and slowing down just a little, but his mind and his instincts are as sharp as they've ever been. He needs all of his experience and resources, too, in order to solve a brutal crime that everyone else, including the police, is satisfied to forget.Many authors would be showing their boredom and fatigue with a character after twenty-five years, but such is definitely not the case with Lawrence Block and Matthew Scudder. The series is as fresh, exciting and brilliant as it ever was. Block truly is the master of the detective novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Scudder in Quite Awhile","review":"Most longtime fans of the Matt Scudder series should be pleased with \\"Hope to Die\\". The writing is stronger than the more recent Scudder novels, which seemed like hastily constructed assembly line jobs to fulfill a contract. The writing is not as good as the early Scudder novels, but this is a satisfying read, nonetheless. Stylistically, it had a few too many asides and tangents, although some of these help in introducing characters or bringing us up-to-date on them. The ending is a bit of a let down and a bit formulatic (I won't spoil it further), but I don't read these books for plot, as much as for the characters. Scudder's kids get established as adults with problems of their own & I'm guessing we'll be seeing them again in the future, which is all for the good.Now, if only he'd do a new Bernie \\"Burglar\\" Rhodenberr--just leave out the guy who reminds of Inspector Lugar from the old Barney Miller tv series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed Mess","review":"This is an unbelievably bad Lawrence Block novel. I suspect he may have owed his publisher a book after signing a big book deal. Or maybe he wanted to try to write something commercial. But this one is a big dud.It's not that his writing is bad. He's still very good with dialogue and style. However, the plot is horrible. His serial killer characterization is cliched, distasteful, and not believable.Block makes a mistake by alternating the first person narrative of Matt Schudder with the serial killer. It just doesn't work.I've read a lot of Lawrence Block novels, and this is one of the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far better than the 1965 version","review":"The original Cinderella with Julie Andrews is the only way to go. Full of catchy tunes and typical Rogers and Hamerstein music, any fan of musicals should own this CD. The 1957 version is by far the better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Perfection!","review":"This is the best of all three versions of the Rodgers and Hammerstien Cinderella. That includes the 1965 and 1997 remakes. The orchestrations are great, and the singing is wonderful. If you saw the 1997 version air on the Wonderful World of Disney and liked it, wait 'till you here this grand and catchy memorable recording. It was in my head for months! Just check out the 'Overture' excerpt above. You'll see what I mean with 'catchy'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I didnt know HE could sing\\".","review":"For years it was virtually impossible to buy either this version or the 1965 version of Cinderella. I now own both of them on CD. I have always thought that it was too bad that there is no full length version of the original available, and was very happy when the CD came out. Julie Andews is,of course brilliant,and the idea of casting Edie Adams as much younger fairy Godmother a stroke of genius. The real suprise here is JonCypher as the Prince. I had forgotten how good a voice he had until an episode of Major Dad when he sang \\"The Impossible Dream\\". (He played Dr Carrasco on B'way). Its fun to compare the two productions. I wouldn't presume to say that one is better than the other. I really enjoyed being able to have the original"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Andrews and Broadway wonderful","review":"This is a classic musical that I grew up listening to in my Mother's kitchen. I love the music and Julie Andrews is an angel at her best. It isn't Hollywood or Disney - fied, just good Broadway musical. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend who liked the book. I did not care for it at all. Yes, it is about a woman and her mid-life adventures. I found the sequence of events to be very unrealistic and downright corny. If you want a cutesy-tootsy rosy story, read this book. If you want some brain stimulation, steer clear. Also...typos are littered throughout the book. Very, very poor editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very funny","review":"This book has a simple concept - it's just the comics version of the \\"old movie with new dialog\\" game made famous by Woody Allen inWhat's Up, Tiger Lily?. It works brilliantly, thanks to observant and ruthlessly logical execution by Jeanne Martinet. This is one of the very few humor books that I have enjoyed reading numerous times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for pre-teens","review":"Wonderfully inspirational for all readers but a must for pre-teens. Anne Faigen recreates nineteenth-century rural Massachusetts with historically accurate detail while drawing the reader in with issues resonant and ultimately relevant to today. Readers will find themselves rethinking their own attitudes and values toward autonomy, self-development, gender and the environment while empathizing with the lively character of Rachel Louisa Curtis. The fact that we are introduced (or reintroduced) to the writing of Henry David Thoreau and Margaret Fuller is the other truely rewarding payoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistic Journey","review":"The Way of the Gun Riders is an artistic masterpiece. From an artist's perspective, the stick figure drawings are beautifully rendered as to capture the mood and energy of the art of calling shotgun. Also, I was lucky enough to attend the authors' book signing and am happy to say Stefan and Tim did not let down the crowd. This accompanying film which debuted at the signing was stunning. They have amazing gifts and I hope they continue to share them with their eager public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author enjoys own book.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I will never know what made me stop and watch but once I started watching, I was glued to the set. The way the story was told was done really, really well. Like a collage of noir and a tabloid - the noir is the music and the interspersing of the interviews and cuts of the headlines back in the day. The tabloid aspect is this is real but you can't believe this is real. Not being from NY, this was all new to me. I think I could study on this film and come away with a new thought on the human condition every time I watched it. I was so caught off guard by so much of the events that I found it gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Love movie online","review":"Firstly, this was not a purchase. I just rented it online.

Don't plan on reading any more. This one is about a teenage prostitute who is missing. Her very rich Grandfather hires Barrone to find her. She comes up dead, then the Grandfather hires Barrone to find her killers. There just never was any story, except the making of porn movies. There was no depth of character study. Not enough detail on things that were going on. I really enjoyed the Eagles Series and the EARLY Mountain Man books. I quit reading them because each book had several pages of flashbacks to previous books. Now I will quit reading the Code Series. Appears to me Johnston is after quanity and not quality. I know it will make not difference to him if I read another one or not but it give me some satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Considering how stupid some of their plans are....","review":"The members of the Code Name Team seem to be as lucky as they are foolish.

It was filmed on Crete, too, adding authenticity to an already great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Movie - But don't read the book first","review":"I read the book \\"The Moon Spinners\\" by Mary Stewart when Iwas younger and loved it, so I was more than pleasantly surprised when I found that a movie version of the story had been made. The movie is cute, but if you have read Mary Stewart's book, you will be disappointed in this \\"Disney-fied\\" version. A number of key elements of the story that make it good are changed for the movie and events that do not take place in the book at all are added in for no apparent reason. It's a cute movie, and I like Haley Mills, but it's not \\"The Moon Spinners\\".

Last year, they released three excellent, high quality DVD sets of The Swiss Family Robinson, Pollyanna and The Parent Trap. I can understand not producing two disks each time - there is only so much extraneous material available, but this new DVD is inexcusable. It looks like it's been recorded straight off a video tape - the quality is appalling; indeed, I have an old video that is superior in quality. And not to issue the film in it's original screen format (or both!) is just insulting. After all, one of the main attributes of DVD is that it can reproduce film quality for the TV screen, and it seems very silly of Disney not to take advantage of that. It seems to be impossible to contact Disney to express my disappointment, and if I could get a refund I would....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm TOTALLY confused!","review":"Once again, Disney misses the mark with an inferior DVD release. Why do we crave seeing our favorite stars on DVD? Picture clarity, extra features, restored prints, optional commentary... none of which are evident on this poor release of a wonderful Hayley Mills film. Disney's inexplicable inconsistency becomes evident when poor efforts such as this one are compared to stellar, awe-inspired efforts such as \\"The Parent Trap\\" and \\"Pollyanna\\", multi-disk sets released with quality and features on par with Criterion Collection releases. I give up on buying Disney. Next time, I'm going to rent the DVD first. Why waste money on new Disney DVD's that are inferior in quality to the VHS versions I already have! Hey Disney, wake up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, not again!","review":"For the life of me, I'll never understand Disney. Buying DVD's from them is worse than gambling. One time I get a beautiful widescreen version of \\"Pollyanna\\", \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\", and \\"The Parent Trap\\" and the next time I get this piece of garbage with a disgusting transfer in the hated full screen format. This is not the first time I've been fooled by Disney, but rest assured it will be the last. I should have known better after being burned in the past when I ordered \\"Castaway Cowboy\\" and \\"Blackbeard's Ghost\\". Both of those two also came dressed like this version of Moon-Spinners.

I could recall all the fun I had seeing this film for the first time as a pre-teen. I think we are all too hung up on technology and rather than focus on the inadequacies why not look at the fun we can once again have watching the incredible Hayley Mills!

To be honest, I fast forwarded it after the first couple minutes. Hayley's character was getting nauseous from smelling fish on a bus, and I was also feeling the same way. I'm pretty sure I missed nothing of importance. I saw some running around by various people, some nice rocky shoreline shot in obvious \\"day for night\\" technique, some closeups of various characters, some rather oddball outfits, and an escape from a windmill - not necessarily in that order.I've read elsewhere that there was a jewel robery and a murder.

It has been grouped with juvenile Nancy Drew type mysteries and not given a proper wide screen DVD release, but rather issued in a kiddie style cheap reissue. Amazon's HD Instant Video is a good transfer (not true wide screen) but panned and scanned for optimum viewing on modern 16 x 9 televisions. It has not been restored but appears as it did on movie screens in 1964, much better than the VHS master used on the DVD. This is well worth the HD rental price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family movie","review":"I've loved Hayley Mills for years and I've enjoyed introducing her to my kids.

The cast of 5 singers (3 women, 2 men) generally sings engagingly and well, although the baritone has a tendency to flat on a few of the slower numbers. A Grand Night for Singing is a charming show that puts the music in a completely new setting. Includes a drop-dead arrangement that puts \\"Many a New Day\\" (Oklahoma) and \\"Gonna Wash That Man\\" (South Pacific) together in a jazzy woman's trio of playful men-bashing. Other highlights include \\"Love, Look Away,\\" \\"Kansas City,\\" \\"Honey Bun\\" and \\"Some Enchanted Evening.\\" A very enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we get a decent Fiesta Book?!","review":"I don't care what Martha Stewart says.

So we are giving up on this set. I was going to give it a 4 star rating because it seemed so very nice and also easy to put together, but after having to ship it back twice, this only gets one star.

Also one of the chairs had a small crack but not worth returning it for. Other than that I only take one start because it is a beautiful and fancy table set.

My husband had to drill holes in the table and chairs in order for the screws to fit. Assembled, the table is lovely and my daughter loves it. For the price it was worth the extra effort. I would suggest trying to soap the screws and if they don't fit for you, you can carefully drill in the designated holes to assist with assembly. Just don't drill too far because then the screws won't be useful. We still ended up having to replace two screws that were stripped due to our extra effort of trying to screw them in before we drilled holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke rather quickly","review":"This table lasted maybe two years.

Of the total of four chairs, three were fine. The forth had a factory misassembly. The parts could not be assembled as delivered. I had to remove the under-the-seat brace, drill new holes and reattach the under-seat brace to get the leg assembly to fit the chair properly and to properly align the predrilled screw holes in the leg assembly. The table assembled OK, but the top had a split in it. I had to repair the split, sand and refinish the table top prior to giving to my grandson. This table/chair combo is of very poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"I got this table and chairs for my 3 year old grandson.

However, I regret buying it because it is not well made at all. When putting the table together, some of the Philip screws heads were stripped and I had to hammer screw bits into the heads in order to get enough contact to finish the job. The chairs were less troublesome, however, the back slats were loose in place because they were a couple of millimeters too short. Both the table and chairs wobble as well. My advise is to look for another set without any negative comments, regardless of the star rating.Regards,Ian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"Do not buy this product. I assembled the chairs first, and they were fine. The table is impossible. The screws are too tight and do not go all the way in. My husband and I made an effort to follow their instructions and tighten the screws with a Phillips scredriver after putting liquid soap on the screws, etc. but to no avail. We gave up thinking we will try later. But as we straightened out the wobbly table, we saw a deep crack (either already there or created due to our efforts to screw in the legs) that started from the edge, and ran a quarter of the way through the diameter of the table. Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy Lipper","review":"We bought a Lipper brand table 1.5 years ago and it has never been sturdy. Although the wood is of good quality, the construction is not.

The wood and color is beautiful, it's sturdy and easy to assemble. Storage underneath is great for all the little boxes of crayons and drawing necessities.

I opened it to find that there was not only a bad stain job on the table top, it was also cracked. There was a spot that didn't get stained as dark as the rest right in the center of the table. You would think that wouldn't pass Quality Control before they sent it out. Guessing the crack happened during shipping, there was hardly any padding in the box despite containing the table and 2 chairs. Also, the color is red, not anywhere near cherry or what is pictured. I'm not paying an additional $50 for espresso color and also they don't sell the extra chairs, so I'll have to live with it. I hope the replacement is better. Disappointing, as I was not able to have this in time for my son's birthday with the damage.

The characters were a little flat and she was not up to her usual research standards. While most of her information on volcanos rang true she made a lot of errors involving local Hawaiian culture and fact that I could recognize after living in Honolulu for only three years. Clearly she never had anyone from Hawaii read and critique the book. Skip this book and wait for a NEW book unless you are a die-hard Lowell fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance in a great setting","review":"The previous reviewer says that this is just a reprint. That isn't quite true. The last couple of years, Elizabeth Lowell has been rewriting some of her older romances. They tend to be about 50 percent longer than the originals, and IMHO she is doing a good job of improving them. Yes, it is the same story as her old Fires of Eden, but it is considerably longer, with added scenes, more explanation, characters fleshed out better, and a few things deleted. I read and reread Fires of Eden until my copy vanished during a move. I was more than happy to find this story in hardback. I'll be rereading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid and embarrassingly dramatic","review":"When the descriptions of Mauna Loa and volcanic regions Kilauea breathes more sprite and fire than the romance, it becomes crystal clear that the classic love story is tepid and embarrassingly melodramatic with one-dimensional characters who are too brittle to hold against the majestic Hawaiian background of the story. Nicole Ballard haunted by the emotional scars and label as frigid by her ex, relives her humiliation when Chase Wilcox, a volcano expert and misoygnst thinks her brazen to break his brother's marriage attempts to seduce her and pour cold water. Nicole is too dishy and wimpish; and Ms. Lowell attempts to cover up the insubstantial plot. The emotional honesty and cool-headed heroines are sadly elusive in this lackadaisical romance that does injustice to the readers as well as the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One!","review":"I suffered through this in audiocassette form and my head is still throbbing from the incessant drum references throughout the story. I am a true fan of the author but this is certainly a book to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did she go wrong?!?","review":"I loved the Untamed series and think of Lowell as a pretty good writer in general and a great writer when compared to others in her genre. This book was just plain stupid. Dumb characters, dumb plot, dumb writing! Ok the nookie scenes were up to her usual par, but aside from that it was pretty silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop \\"Eden Burning\\" Into the Nearest Volcano","review":"That's where this book belongs. As a long-time fan of Elizabeth Lowell, I eagerly await her new releases. I wish I had skipped this one; \\"Eden Burning\\" was a big disappointment. Chase Wilcox, professional vulcanologist, and Nicole Ballard, artist and dancer, meet on the island of Hawaii. Each has a tragic \\"secret\\" from the past that must be overcome before they can acknowledge their love. There is a great deal of drumming (Chase) and dancing to Tahitian music (Nicole aka Pele, goddess of fire) that is just too silly for words. The best parts are the descriptions of the island, the little bit that you get about its native population, and the fascinating material included on volcanoes. Ms. Lowell does her research. Save your money for the next book about the Donovan clan, or go back and buy one of Ms. Lowell's older works written as Ann Maxwell, such as \\"Tell Me No Lies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dated Book","review":"You can tell this is a book written a number of years ago. Ms. Lowell may have \\"updated\\" some parts, but it is definitely a book from it's time. The dialog was so over the top that I skipped whole sections. Ms. Lowell has the unpleasant habit of having the so-called hero have a pet name for the heroine. This could be cute if handled well, but it gets to be so annoying. I wanted to tell him - she has a name and it's not Butterfly. Stick to Ms. Lowell's more recent attempts. They are quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"Not one of Ms. Lowell's better efforts. I generously gave it 2 stars because it was slightly better than DESERT RAIN, which I generously gave 1 star). If you're like me, you'll find yourself scanning through the pages just to get to the end. Neither of the main characters are memorable or even believable. Some readers may like the descriptions of Hawaii's flora and volcanic history--but not me. It could not make up for the poor story line and weak characters. BEAUTIFUL DREAMER is a much, much better book. Try that one and give this one a bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I wish I had waited for the paperback.

I had heard of SHE LOVES ME, but never had seen it, and loved this revival - I ended up seeing it six times! The cast is enchanting, with excellent voices throughout. This is one of the rare musicals where ALL the songs are gems - no need to skip tracks here - and the voices and personalities perfectly match the roles. Sally Mayes (Ilona) has never sounded better; Howard McGillin is a delight as Kodaly, and Johnathan Freeman a terrific Headwaiter. Boyd Gaines is a charming, boyish, delicious Georg, and if Diane Fratantoni can't quite make you forget about Barbara Cook, well, who can? This is a must for any theater fan, or any connoiseur of outstanding singing. If only this show was still running!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream!","review":"She Loves Me is a treasure to anyone's CD collection. This is by far the best version of the musical. She Loves Me is based on 'Parfumerie', 'The Shop Around the Corner', and 'In The Good Old Summertime'. The show has music and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock who also composed Fiddler on the Roof! The song Vanilla Ice Cream alone is reason enough to buy this CD. Diane Fratantoni is a standout as Amalia, and Vanilla Ice Cream may just be the best song ever! She Loves Me combines Broadway with a lot of technical almost opera-like singing. It's a nice story as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rousing Revival Recording","review":"Thought the original recording of \\"She Loves Me\\" with Cook and Massey couldn't be beat.

Tim Schmit shines on the album, particularly on the fantastic Find Out in Time which may be one of the best songs Schmit ever performed. Unfortunately for Poco fans, the album would turn out to be Schmit's swan song with the band as he jumped ship to join the Eagles after Indian Summer was released.Paul Cotton stands out front once again on Indian Summer, delivering big time on the laid back title track, and the rockers Twenty Years, Win or Lose and Living in the Band. Rusty Young is not as much of a presence on this album as on the preceding albums, but still delivers some fine steel guitar work as well as giving us a taste of things to come in the future through his song Downfall, his first out-front full lead vocal.Indian Summer doesn't stand up among the best works in the Poco library, but it is still a very listenable album with some very good moments on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Country Rock from the Genre\`s leading exponent","review":"Indian Summer starts as beautifully as any Poco Album with the gorgeous, languid Indian Summer (1 of Paul Cotton\`s finest moments), thru Twenty Years onto the evocative, Me and You by Tim Schmit which is one of his finest contributions to Poco. Rusty chimes in with Downfall with soaring harmonies, chiming guitars, driving bass line in a brilliant rendition of Country Rock. Songs 5 thru 8 include the Autobiographical Living in the Band with its surging melodious rock, then two Schmit songs, Stay and Find out in Time, both up to his usual standard. The album ends with Rusty\`s The Dance which has its moments but sadly descends into a Disco/Funk blend which probably prevents this album from being the best album that Poco did. This was Schmit\`s last outing with Poco before joining the Eagles.

Unfortunately only the label knows because the packaging is quite nice including a nice replica of the original insert with the lyrics and album credits.The sound on this remaster is compressed and harsh as well as much too bright sounding.

(The U.S. Version \\"Deborah\\" is basically the same album, minus the 2 Broadway tunes, so whichever one you can afford, it's WORTH IT!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the first novel","review":"Prep was quite a good novel. The follow-up, The Man of My Dreams, is ... well, it's simply not nearly as good.The main character has real self-esteem issues. And while I might expect them in a young woman, the length of time it takes her to deal with them is excruciating. Even when people genuinely like her, she has a very hard time believing it. All that negativity is hard to take; a character needs to grow or there is no point in reading about them.She does finally get a backbone, but you have to read through a whole lot of nothing to get there. And I'm not quite sure the journey was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coming-of-age read!","review":"I loved \\"Prep\\" and while this book started out a little slow, I really enjoyed it. Great feel good book. Hannah starts out very cynical but you see her personality through this and how she grows on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I wanted to like it, but....\\"","review":"I loved Ms. Sittenfeld's first novel, \\"Prep,\\" and I recommended it to everyone I know who reads. I wish I could say the same for \\"Man of My Dreams,\\" but no. In fact, I am just going to drop it into the book return bin at the public library as an anonymous donation.There is no doubt that this author is an extremely gifted writer, and that does come through in this book. Unfortunately, it still bored me into a coma. I forced myself to finish it, but my mind kept drifting as I considered putting it down and making a red velvet cake, which would have been so much more satisfying. I wanted more characterization and plot to chew on, but I was left grinding my teeth.Maybe Ms. Sittenfeld's publisher rushed her into a second book, or perhaps I expected too much after \\"Prep.\\" Anyway, I do believe that she will give us more gems in the future. I'm not giving up on this writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"I picked up The Man of My Dreams because, like other reviewers, I loved Prep. But I found myself quitting this one about halfway through. The plot is nearly identical to that of Prep, but Hannah doesn't have the same kind of depth as Lee Fiora does. Hannah's depressive mopiness got to me at times, and I found myself thinking, \\"who cares?\\" It was almost as though Sittenfeld had taken the characters of Prep, changed their names, and made them older. Sittenfeld vehemently denies that her writing is chick lit, but there's definitely a chick lit feel to her books--with, of course, the depressed teenager/ twentysomething.In all, this was a highly disappointing book because the author has so much talent as a writer, but very little creativity to create new characters outside of those that she knows. If you liked Prep, don't say I didn't warn you about The Man of My Dreams. It's just not up to what Sittenfeld put out the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Was expecting much more from the author after Prep. Although not a complete waste of time, this book does little to endear us to the protagonist or say anything original about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sittenfeld's genius","review":"is in taking you places -- from her past and your own -- where you're not entirely sure you want to go. But nonetheless, you go there with her, and somehow the act of having done so helps you to make sense of things, icluding your own life. I found parts of this book absolutely haunting, as I have with her other works. There are scenes which she has written which I find myself tucking away to ponder later, and which somehow I know I'll carry with me forever. The relationship which she describes between Hannah and her volatile, angry, unpredictable father -- and the way in which that relationship shapes Hannah -- is a scary, tough subject and one that I don't think any other authors have really approached in the same way. As always, I find myself wondering how much of her writing is autobiographical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I LOVED Prep and American Wife. This was just NOT as good. Boring, generic,...like a bad paperback romance novel from a grocery store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"Very unhappy with purchase. Very poor quality. Wear 18 hour bras,snaps to close together to fit straps properly. More trouble to return than it is worth. Straps to long, for my taste. Do Not waste your money. Also cancer warning on box, This product known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects (FYI)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Group called Smith","review":"I am very happy with the music. What I am not happy with is the way the cd is formatted Ican not down load it to my computor for my Ipod. Tried to call Dave at Hatboro music store but they closed their doors and he is selling stock from his home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Group Smith CD not so good","review":"Bought one of these Italian remakes on an auction site for $30, shouldn't have paid more than $3 for it. It is not remastered and the quality of the audio is the worst I've ever heard on a CD. To sum it up, TERRIBLE. I've learned there is another version of this CD which IS digitally remastered and includes five bonus tracks. It's a bit hard to find but worth the hunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Singer- Great Drummer!","review":"I agree with everyone else who said Gail is great. I also love this drummer! Bob Evans. I'd love to hear more by him. Great band, great record. By the way, Del Shannon was heavily involved in the development and preproduction of this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet top loader.","review":"It is minimalist. All loading is done from the top. It does have a small zipper opening on the front with pen pockets and clip. Materials and zippers are of great quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I practically salivated at learning that Liszt had written a biography of his colleague, Chopin. Upon reading it, I was thoroughly disappointed and stopped halfway through. Essentially, the problem stems from the fact that the narrative is full of verbiage that gives almost no facts about Chopin, but engages in endless verbal diarrhea; it seems that Liszt did not actually write the bulk of the book, but some bimbo who had the reputation of loving to talk at length without actually saying anything.Next time I will buy a real biography of Chopin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad and Not Great!!!!","review":"Charm looks much better in the picture, of course I understand that it's much smaller in person. The quality is not that great, unlike the description. I've seen much better in the stores!! I will not return it because the shipping will cost me more than the charm is worth. Too bad for me, I've learned my lesson! Thanks anyway - my fault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to wear at home.","review":"These socks are fun to wear, however don't match with much.

The story of Consuelo , duchess of Marlborough and her mother is a fascinating picture of the that era. It shows in detail the customs and mores of a time gone by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: The story of a Mother and a Daughter","review":"Was not able to read beyond page 74 in my Kindle as the book was totally screwed up; letters and numbers interspersed throughout; suddenly you would be at the end of the book.....totally messed up in the Kindle version. Finally gave up and deleted it.VERY DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most fiction!","review":"Long book, but very good. Seems we've always been more than just a little interested in the private lives of the rich and famous in this country. From the description of the bridal lingerie of Consuelo in the newspapers to the reportings of celebrity \\"antics\\" today. Nice to know that she, and her mother, were aware of the changing world around them, and made contributions to society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok video, not a \\"workout\\"","review":"This video is just okay. Its only 45 minutes long, including 10ish minutes of warm-up. The audio and video quality is bad at times. It goes over a few kicks, two punching combinations, and then jumps right into the Poomsae. That review is pretty good and helpful. Overall though, the video wasn't really worth my time, and definitely isn't a \\"workout\\" video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRIMUMPH FOR ARAB-AMERICAN WOMEN","review":"As an Arab-American woman growing up in the United States, I found this book to be very refreshing. I noticed as a child in America that Arab women were either perceived as very docile and covered from head to toe or as whores that danced seductively for men only to have alternative plans to get ahead as in the case of the book One Thousand and One Arabian Nights which I read when I was younger. either way, Arab women were not seen in a good light by Western culture. This is a book that presents Arab women and women all over the world as thinking, intelligent, and talented beings that deserve a say on today's social issues and women in society in general. I actually went to a reading that featured the poets in the book as a way to promote the book in 1995 and found myself to be proud of who and what I am. I recommend this book to any women (or men) that are of Arab or Western decent. You will not be bored, that I can assure you. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Joanna Kadi!","review":"This is an excellent anthology of arab-american feminist writings, each essay and poem discussing how it feels to be an Arab-American woman growing up in the US.As an Arab-American woman, I felt comforted and empowered by these writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leo Buscalia audio cassette purchase","review":"Product was described as new.
