It is doubly a shame that so many readers are willing to brush off the fact that no such \\"martyrdom\\" took place, and to embrace a fairy-tale rather than the known facts. It is triply a shame that an excellent Christian writer like Madeleine L'Engle got roped into this venture. A sad example of a \\"rush to judgement\\" and a readiness to accept a pretty lie rather than the more-inconvenient facts, that is all-too-typical of the American public at this time in our history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth is out...it never happened","review":"The fact is it never happened. The official report which is the result of 1000's of items and 100's of hours of interviews, contains not one mention of the infamous question. The Bernalls ought to be ashamed of themselves and if you want to do something good with the money you were going to spend on this book, give it to your local church or something. By no means should you fatten the pockets of the Bernalls any further. As for the book itself, it's not that good. Overdramatic claptrap designed to pull the heartstrings and open the wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Said Yes","review":"I'm going to tell you about She Said Yes. It's about Cassie Bernall who was killed in the colimbine shooting. The book tells you about how Cassie sturggeled throuh her teen age life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Make You Think About Your Life","review":"I am only into Chapter 6 of this book, but I have learned a lot of stuff by reading it. I found out about the bad things in life such as witchcraft, the occult, and suicide. As a committed Christian who has just given their life to the Lord not too long ago, I recommend this book as well as Rachel's Tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOD gives second chances..............","review":"Cassie was a typical teenager who had fallen in with the wrong crowd. But through her parents' tough love and friends at a christian school, she was able to turn around her life. Unfortuntately, she lost her life during the senseless violence at Columbine. Misty Bernall has written a powerful book about her daughter's life and how GOD works miracles in our lives. This book shows us that life cannot be take for granted but at least Cassie lived a good christian life near the end of her existence on earth. I commend her mom for sharing their story even tho it must have been extremely heartbreaking for her to have written this book. SHE SAID YES is a good spiritually enlightened read and should be mandatory reading for all teenagers (we all go through those tough times so its nice to see how someone struggled to overcome them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT easy to clean!","review":"Sure, it works fine in picking up lint and hair, but then the lint and hair are stuck to the thing and very difficult to remove. A bit of soapy water does not work well, as mentioned by other reviewers, and I agree with the reviewer who suggested they might be plants by the company. Since I end up spending 15 minutes aggressively scrubbing the thing and picking the lint and hair off, I may as well just spend the time picking the lint and hair off my shirts. Not to mention the sticky residue on my hands after cleaning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reusable Lint Roller","review":"I've only had this product for a short time by it seems to work pretty well.

The material is both in depth and reader friendly. The text takes you though a step-by-step process of planning, conducting, and evaluating research. Anyone who is struggling with writing a Master's Thesis will find the book to be a most helpful resource tool. The material is presented with a straight forward approach (along with some humor), and the book also provides useful chapter summaries and actual research reports. From a personal standpoint, the book is just that much better because it was written by a woman in a time when a woman with a brilliant mind was considered to be dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational Research","review":"Educational Research: Competencies for Analysis and Application 6th Edition is an excellent introductory text to assist in writing a Master's thesis or Research paper. The book is well organized and will take you step-by-step through the process of educational research. It begins with selecting and defining a problem, gives strategies to prepare and evaluate a research plan, selecting measuring instruments, also includes the different types of research, to analyzing and interpretaing statistics, and to writing your final research report. This book teaches the importance of reviewing and analyzing your research related literature and includes samples of educational research reports. Excellent summaries are included at the end of each chapter. It is a great resource and my book is earmarked and tabbed throughout as I am working on my Master's Degree Action Research paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"The writing is a bit small but it is a good book to buy for anyone doing a qualitative or a quantitative research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Doing Crafts, Writing, Or Eating On","review":"This Lifetime table is sturdy, easy to set up or put away.

I would not recommend this one. It was hard to follow and explanations were poor in my opionion (as well as the consensus of other students in my study group). In addition my well very experienced chemistry tutor thought the information presented in this text assumed that one had previuously taken a chemistry class, and that concepts and end of chapter questions were poorly worded, and needed further explanation in order to answer the questions presented. Overall a very frustrating text book to have. I ended up using Karen Timberlakes Chemistry text for expanations of concepts which was the text that our professor ended up using for the same class the following semseter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great textbook","review":"This text book is plain and simple but straight to the point. It is very affordable in comparisson to the newly release textbook. I would greatly reccomended it for anyone wanted to have a better understanding in chemistry for fun, pleasure or educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy metal.","review":"This is a very effective splitting maul. The neoprene sleeve on the handle wasn't secured, and that drove me crazy because of its slipping when trying to swing the maul. I glued it on and so far it has stayed. You need something to cushion the shock of the metal thru your hands and arms, and I'm not sure I'd want to use this for hours every day, but for tough splitting it's hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly balanced Woodbuster Maul","review":"The two main problems with this maul that I've seen.1. As people have said, the handle is way to short. In order to get a good swing you have to stand to close to your target. It's dangerous and makes for poor strikes. It also means it's difficult to take advantage of the extra weight of the maul.2. The handle was placed too far back on the head of the maul. It made for an unbalanced swing. When you raised the maul for the strike, I could feel the head wanting to twist in mid air.If you want to spend the time to weld an extra length to the handle, I recommend you save your money and just make your own maul. I've been swinging large axes and mauls for a long time, both homemade and store bought. My recommendation is save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even think about a different maul.","review":"If you need to split some serious wood, and want to do it with minimal effort, this is the maul for it. I like to cut my own standing dead, and here in the foothills of the Rockies, the trees can get pretty big. This maul takes cinsiderably less swing and less physical force to swing than any pther maul i have owned. And with a steel handle and welded steel collar, it will not break, no wedges to fall out and replace, and no danger of the head falling off. The rubber grip falls off easy but i don't even have mine on and it is actually better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaboom","review":"Although the handle is a tad shorter than a normal ax or splitting maul, it is amazing to swing and watch the wood burst. It is an excellent workout as well. I split about a cord in 1-1/2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but you need to learn how to swing this beast correctly","review":"I'm 6' foot and split 36 inch oak rounds in 2 hits most of the time with mine. The handle is too short as far as not hurting your lower back as much. 5 swings and I'm done for a bit. And I feel it the next day. I would recommend getting one with a longer handle. It looks like they made that revision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nabucco, The Album of the Decade","review":"I am convinced this album cannot be topped; the Hebrew slave chorus is award winning. The recording on CD is superb. I've recently introduced it to several friends, all of whom begin to sob and have later purchased copies! I love it. New appreciation yet for Verdi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opulent voices!","review":"Dimitrova is quite impressive as Abigaille. Sinopoli conducts with allucinating energy, i would say even too much.

Thriller fans will be hearing more from Joseph Badal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pillar of a thriller","review":"joe badal's the pythagorean solution is one of the best books i have read in a long time. it is well written so that the story moves right along without a lot of baggage--just a good story. the characters are well developed and the plot is easy to understand yet very believable, not like the da vinci thing which in convoluted much of the time. the pythagorean solution is very clever. also, there are no hidden clues and obscure facts that get revealed at the end; you are right there with the characters in a fast moving adventure thriller. i really liked this book. i wish genra authors would study badal's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of caution","review":"I received this book as a gift and so felt obliged to read it. I'm sorry that I did. The plot is both implausible and predictable (that's quite an acheivement, I guess.) The dialogue is unconvincing, and the characters are collections of cliches. Much of the violence is gratuitous, and the pseudo-psychology surrounding the concept of revenge is nonsense. The \\"solution\\" to the \\"riddle\\" is obvious from the moment it's mentioned, but it takes the characters (one with a doctorate from Oxford) most of the book to figure it out. Finally, the depiction of women (violence against the \\"good\\", demonization of the \\"evil\\") belongs to an era that deserves to be long gone. If you liked The da Vinci Code, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop Suspense in the Greek Isles","review":"Pythagorean Solution is a non-stop thrill ride set in modern day Greece. What I loved about this story is the main character is believeable, not some super human who I couldn't identify with. The story moves you along from one exciitng scene to the next - the story has everything! Lost gold, beautiful Aegean setting, humor, international intrigue, a love story, and a treasure hunt! For a first novel, Badal hit a home run; can't wait for his next thriller. I couldn't put the book down. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pythagorean Solution","review":"The author's experiences in Greece and with the Mediterranean Culture makes this suspence story line all the more believable. This book was a fast moving thriller with real life characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neu! - 'Live '72' (Captain Trip)","review":"Wonderful cosmic hour's worth of a live performance (or is it actually a rehearsal?) by the short-lived krautrock legend - Neu!. Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger (R.I.P.) have a guest drummer at this event that took place on May 6, 1972 in Dusseldorf, Germany. No actual setlist - three tracks are listed in Japanese. My guess is that most of this gig was improvised. I'm almost sure I hear bits of \\"Hallo Gallo\\" and \\"Negativland\\" in here somewhere - two songs off the band's 1971 debut album. Heard this live release was recorded on a home tape recorder. Considering that, I have always cherished 'Live '72' quite a bit. Track 2 sounds as though it might've been composed at that very moment. I've seen several bad reviews of this hard-to-find import disc, but I really enjoyed it. Total brain damage - just the way you like it. In my humble opinion, an absolute must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Details","review":"Amazon doesn't have track listings, so here they are:Planet Caravan (Album Version)The BadgeDomination/Hollow (live recorded 11/12/94)Great little CD.

For this author, words are impediments to expression. Enter at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Got The Blues","review":"This was the worst book I've read in ages. I gave it 2 stars just because the storyline was so goofy I had to finish the book to find out how things ended. Except they didn't end! Wiley's questions about his father and all the wackos he ran into during the storyline were left up to the reader's imagination. I'm sorry, there is no way I could imagine one guy getting himself into so much touble, with so many bizarre characters. I realize there may by men out there in the world who think like Wiley, I'm just happy I don't know any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, but a learning experience.","review":"Don't bother with this one unless you're a fan of truly bizarre, illogically constructed, yet somehow random plot lines. The wild characters and the occasional poetic turn of phrase serve to (somewhat)redeem the randomness. Perhaps the author's most insteresting device is his use of a first person protagonist who is entirely unsympathetic--but the interest doesn't last. I frankly didn't care what happened to the guy and was glad when he got out of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book! It sucked!","review":"Barrett tries to go for the Carl Hiassen-esque quirkiness and fails big time. The main character,Wiley Moss, was so cold-hearted that I was rooting for the bad guys! And what's with the super-strange characters? A blind woman who drives a truck with the help of her son? Puh-leeze! I couldn't wait to finish this book so I could get rid of it and try to put the whole painful experience behind me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a child's watch?","review":"Just received and promptly returned this watch. While it looks good, the band size might be 6\\", might. I have a 6 1/2\\" wrist and if I would have closed the clasp [big if on that one] it would probably have cut off my circulation. If you have a very slender wrist it is possible this could work for you. I am an average size, not overweight person and this wouldn't fit me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly recommended escapist reading!","review":"Was expecting this book to be just like the TV series, or just full of stories that have been ripped off by it. Instead, this is a book of pathos and interesting yarns that open your eyes to the depraved debauchery of the hotel industry.Among my favourite yarns are the 'New Yawk' lady and the Babysham tramp, although there are loads of other stories and little useless facts to make for an enjoyable book.All in all, this makes for a perfect book, especially for dinner party conversation... Btw, if you like this one, feel free to tryThe Gameby Neil Strauss or anything by P.J. O'Rourke. Both are rich in content, but onlyThe Gamematches this for Gambits..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I picked this up in the airport assuming it would be light and fun for a long int'l flight...having been in the service industry earlier in life I thought I'd especially appreciate it.However - I was disappointed. It was not as funny as I hoped and got old quickly, despite the outrageous nature of some of the stories. The attempt to make a quasi-storyline out of a series of funny anecdotes just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Skinny on Hotels","review":"Juicy beyond details.

But I'm still trying to figure why though?Really had no point to it and as a result I didnt finsih it. Maybe it goes soemwhere, but i didnt bother to try find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The anonymous author, who now manages an unnamed five-star hotel, has spent the past 15 years working in London's top lodgings. The author compresses these years into a 24-hour period (divided into one chapter for every hour) and places the events at a fictitious Hotel Babylon (to protect the guilty who may include the author).This book is nonstop fun as the narrator divulges all the dirty little details of the hospitality business. I would recommend to anyone- anyone not too squeamish or prudish that is! Also has a new book about the airline industry called Air Babylon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Stories of A Slacker","review":"Well, we learn that people are people even while in a luxury hotel...not too surprising. And we learn that Anonymous is a rather pompus lazy fellow who likes to sleep and drink on the job while feeling superior to the guests.Not too surprising that fellows like that exist.Surprising that I spent my time on it, though. Save yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly amusing","review":"I was given this book from a friend who promised me, that as a frequent traveler, I may never feel the same way about my journeys after reading it. Boy was she right!The novel moves very quickly and spans a 24 hour period in a five star hotel. Throughout the novel we are offered disturbing glimpses of what actually happens when people use a place as their home away from home. Believe me some of these glimpses are very distrubing!The novel also demonstrates how hotels make money, how they deal with needy and demanding clients, what happens when they overbook and how they deal with some of the more \\"delicate situations\\" which arise.Very fun and informative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for the business traveller...","review":"I am a business traveller, and I spend most of time in Hotels around the world. More than once I have wondered what really happens behind those beautiful facades that you find in many of the best Hotels. This book talks about the real people in the Hotel industry, the games they play, the screw ups and the simple day to day.Imogen writes the stories in a way that sometimes is difficult to know what is better, to laugh or to cry...but one way or the other you will feel the emotion and never look at a Hotel room the same way again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels a bit like an undercover expos��...","review":"I guess that's what to expect when a reporter and an anonymous hotelier with years of experience band together to bring you this story of one man's 24 hours inside a hotel. The narrator is a hotel employee who finds himself pulling double shifts. We get a glimpse not only of the wacky and sometimes badly behaved guests, but also of the hotel staff's struggles to please them. Some of the chapters did freak me out a bit, considering I read this right before I went away to a large hotel, but nothing TOO shocking here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veracruz music with African swing","review":"If you live in California long enough, especially Southern California, you'll come to know Mexican music: you hear it all around you; it's everywhere. This land used to be part of Mexico and some days it seems like it's being re-absorbed.Although the members of Conjunto Jardin are all veterans of other Latin bands, their backgrounds are not strictly Mexican: Marcel Adjibi is actually from Benin, West Africa; but his African swing and drive is an important part of Conjunto Jardin's sound.The group specializes in the music of Veracruz, Mexico: an area unlike most of Mexico which had a large black African slave population that strongly affected the local music, known as son jarocho.The famous driving Mexican tune is from Veracruz, written by a black ex-slave sometime in the 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Dance Single, His ALBUM is MAGNIFICENT","review":"Mabel is an Italian performer. His music is done in EIFFEL 65 style. BUM BUM is an EXTREMELY CATCHY EUROPOP and EURODANCE song. I can not believe that AMAZON does not carry his full length album, called DESTINATION. It is filled with MARVELOUS and FUN DANCE HITS, with some GREAT TECHNO and TRANCE as well. If you like catchy dance music with great melodies and hooks then check out this single, or better of check out Mabel's full-length album called DESTINATION. It will make you DANCE DAYS and NIGHTS AWAY. It is a solid dance, techno, and pop production.

I am a drug and alcohol treatment professional and this book introduced me to a whole new perspective on the treatment of addictions. I appreciate Ms. Pichot's ideas on dealing not only with my own misperceptions about Solution Focused Therapy - the intro to the techniques on this style of therapy is worth the price of the book alone - but found her suggestions as to how to deal with referral sources (courts, probation officers and other social services agencies)to be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bunch of scrubs","review":"Ghostface and crew drop a decent album in Theodore Unit. Many are comparing this to Supreme Clientele, but I would not go that far. Ghost and Trife shine on this album and have a lot of songs together. Besides Cappadonna, who most are already familiar with, the rest of the crew is decent as well, except for Wigs the white member. He is no Eminem and listening to him rap makes it hard for me to believe that he grew up in Shaolin.

There are many cuts on this that Pretty Toney didn't make, such as (\\"Paychecks\\") featuring \\"Ghostface\\" and \\"Trife\\" and (\\"The Drummer\\") where Method Man and Streetlife show up to add their support. Ghost really blows up the set with the opening track (\\"Guerilla Hood\\"), the next following cut (\\"Punch In, Punch Out\\"), \\"Trife\\" really holds his own. Ghostface and Trife comeback together on the \\"Big Daddy Kane's\\" (\\"Set It Off\\") beat, where they show us how the real NY cats freestyle. A suprising collaboration where \\"Bone Crusher\\" shows up to rock it with the \\"Theodore Unit\\" on (\\"Who Are We\\"). Theodore Units consists of Ghostface, Trife, Shawn Wiggs, Solomon Child and Cappadonna himself, who smashes the killer cut (\\"Pass The Mic\\").

Since I had no other information on solar-based pagan religions (i.e. Slavic) this was a good start. The selection of \\"stories\\" collected is pretty diverse and broken down into tales of Origin, Solar Dignitaries and Other Tales. There are also 2 (short) cool indexes of solar dieties listed in the back. Unfortunately despite all the information packed into this book, O'Hara's retelling of the tales isn't very good. She doesn't retell every tale but instead just sums it up. Some sections contain interesting information on the dieties, but I wouldn't consider it a story. This made the reading dry and boring. It feels like it was written in a passive voice. I would love to see O'Hara revise this book and either get permission to reprint tales from other books or interview people and get tales from the \\"source.\\" All in all, a good book to own for information, bad for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful information but too narrow in focus","review":"I learned a lot from this book and enjoyed reading it. I believe my writing has improved (or, at least, will improve) from having read this, and I can think of no better compliment for a book about writing.However, it could have been better and may not be for everyone. Mr. Knight is a successful science fiction writer and this experience is evident in much of the book. He seems much more comfortable with genre writing than with the 'literary' short story. For instance, he describes seven different types of plots, most of which seem to work only in mystery stories. Unplotted stories, which seem to be at the heart of modern literary short fiction receives half a page of discussion. Even so, the discussion of viewpoint was excellent and the entire book gave me much to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-Nonsense","review":"This book tells how to create fictional stories that entertain.

It has to work whether it's simply a story to entertain or to deliver a message. Any book on writing may declare a foolproof way to a successful tale but all the writer can do is utilize what he or she thinks is meant for them to asorb and to make their own.

Told through the eyes of the writer, this is all the more powerful because the story in it is true. Beginning with childhood living in the house of the lord of the manor in Ireland, the story shows how a life of supposed priviledge is not always an easy one. As we follow our heroine to Africa, we see how her love affair with the continent begins. A life less ordinary indeed, this gives a fascinating insight into the real world of white Africans, the complexities of living in countries full of turmoil.Apart from anything else the book is well written and interesting, not a usual autobiography, more like travel writing, an insight into a continent and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey of self-discovery","review":"Charming and poignant story about an elderly couple, Cornelius and Christina Chapman, who have spent many \\"summer vacations\\" in the small town of Willard, New Hampshire, who now decide to stay full-time. Christina becomes close friends with a local woman, Ellen, and much of the novel is about their developing friendship (it's a rocky relationship, much like the terrain in which the book is set). Interspaced with the developing story are journal entries kept by Christina in which she steps back and evaluates situations occurring with Ellen, her husband, her family, and the world of Willard. Sarton is an excellent nature writer and her descriptions of rural Willard throughout the different seasons are excellent. Christina feels at the end of the book that by living permanently in Willard \\"I am close to my real feeling now,\\" and that she and Cornelius have come into their own. A very appealing and uplifting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Case","review":"Definitely a professional made case. very well made and durable.

I did not get the feeling that the author was for or against either side.I wonder how such learned scholars can call these men church fathers. They may be fathers of the catholic church and her offspring. These men were essentially gangsters for a christ they created through philosophy. The Christ sent to redeem Israel is different from the christ these men murdered each other over. From their actions (Fruits) it seems that these were the wolves that Paul warned the church about.Good book.

It delves into the socio-political machinations of how Jesus of Nazereth became what we call the \\"Son of God\\". It pits the Arians vs the Athanasians in a heated battle to determine whether Jesus is made of God, or whether Jesus IS God. It spans several generations from the Council of Nicaea to the end of the fourth century. Is Jesus the Son of God as the Gospel states? Is Jesus made from the same stuff as God but not equal to God?

Read the Gospels, read this book, then decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One God and one lord","review":"A strong documentation of the history of the time is presented in clear and logical fashion. Written by a fairly objective author, this book presents the simple truth that Christ and his followers of the first century spoke of Jesus as the son of God.

Rubenstein has done his research very thoroughly and presents it in a very readable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubenstein writes well","review":"Rubenstein writes elegantly about the politics and turmoil in the declining days of the Roman empire, of which the Arian controversy was just one small part. From a conflict resolution point of view, the editors cut too much theory and analysis to emphasize the storytelling. From a storytelling poing of view, the editors kept the story lively.This is an important story for Christians who want to understand the politics of their faith, and for those dealing with religious conflict today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing and fascinating book","review":"I could not put this book down until I finished it; it is so well written and illuminating. What makes this book great is that it intertwines an incredibly told story with detailed and highly explicative information, the two of which make for what seems like a fiction-non fiction hybrid. This book is just plain fun, but also absorbing.

Whether Jesus was divine or not, the message and example of Jesus was, and is, an undeniably accurate manifestation of God's love and desire for His people. If Jesus were with us in flesh, he would implore all his Jewish and Christian brothers and sisters to stop the debate and love one another as he loved us.Whether this is said in the past or present tense or \\"he\\" is capitalized or not is not important. The book never makes this key point, it simply continues the debate. How long will we continue to argue with one another instead of loving and accepting fully? Who will be the first to lay down his stone and forgive? By not picking up this book, you will avoid picking up the stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I think Rubenstein did a superb job.

Ms. Hart has developed a wonderful character in her protagonist. There is something warm and inviting with Henrie O, kind of like a grandmother. The author has also developed her to be smart, brave and very observant. This makes for a very enjoyable series. Unlike Ms. Hart's Death of Demand series, this one is a bit more on the serious side, but not so much so that there is not funny moments. Also, Henrie gets to travel around to different locations. With this Ms. Hart adds the pleasure of regional interest into the story. This book is located in San Antonio, so the reader get all kinds of interesting facts about that great city and it's culture. Believe it or not, San Antonio has more going for it than the Alamo! Add all this together with Ms. Hart's good solid writing and the reader can be guaranteed a good and fun mystery. I would recommend any of Carolyn Hart's books to any one who enjoys a good mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crashing Bore","review":"I loved the other Henrie O mysteries, and looked forward to this one. I'm irked. It doesn't even merit shelf space in my home--I'll donate it to the local library. There is no action to speak of for the first 100 pages. Instead we are subjected to incredibly tedious discussions of how a store functions. I think Hart describes every piece of art in the entire inventory by the time she reaches her conclusion. The initial mystery of whether a certain person has or has not disappeared seemed contrived and left me unmoved. Plus, it seemed implausible that the store proprietors would allow Henrie O to be constantly and everywhere underfoot while they were preparing for their biggest sale day of the year. Worse, the Garza family never came to life for me: I had difficulty remembering which person had been assigned which characteristics. Only two characters in the whole book had distinct and memorable personalities. From Dead Man's Island to this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful setting for a mystery","review":"Henrie O receives a frantic transatlantic call from her dear friend who cannot contact her granddaughter Iris in San Antonio. Henrie is visiting her daughter in Texas and agrees to drive to San Antonio to try to find the missing girl. When she does, she becomes acquainted with the Garza family who owns the store where Iris has been working. She is convinced that someone in the family is connected with the disappearance. Soon there is a murder and a theft to add to the intrigue. Henrie O does some behind-the-scenes investigating in order to piece the puzzle together. The setting of the River Walk is a brilliant one and Hart's descriptions of San Antonio are vibrant and very accurate. There are a few unlikely scenarios, such as a thief letting Henrie O take a very valuable valise full of goods, and the way Henrie O decides to trap the murderer in the end, but this still remains a good read for Hart fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"20th Century Costume Jewelry is Not in My Century","review":"This book was purchased along with the sister, companion, Brilliant Rhinestones. While I can appreciate the time that the author has devoted to her book (per review on Brilliant Rhinestones obviously by the author's husband) feel that the quality of the photographs is very poor. When I spend money like this on a book, expect jewelry that looks like I want to reach out and pick it up. Many of the darker items are washed out in the background.

There are numerous incorrect dates - the most glaring of which consist of labelling aurora borealis pieces as being from the 40's or even 30's when the process didn't exist until about 1953. The descriptions are too \\"cutesy\\" rather than factual - ex labelling yellow and black pieces \\"for Steelers fans\\" and elephants \\"for Republicans.\\" Some necklaces are measured by hanging length, others apparently by total length.

Now I find myself writing my first review in two years. Fortunately for me, this movie was on Showtime last Friday night and I finally got to see it. I don't want to describe it with all the details and plots, you can look at other reviews for that, I want to relay the way the movie made me feel. It's a film I knew nothing about and had not seen the trailer, after watching it I was reminded of how I felt after seeing \\"Donnie Darko\\" for the first time without knowing anything about it. In short, imagine the film \\"Closer\\" meets \\"Memento\\". I'm surprised this film hasn't received the cult status of Darko or Memento, it's probably for the same reason I never rented it, poor marketing. My suggestion for a better title is \\"Love Again\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses steam","review":"Wicker Park seems to lose it's mysterious overtones after a while, and I stopped caring about any of the characters.

The actors do a fair job, including Josh but the boring drama of a mentally ill woman just screwing up other people's lives gets in the way. It is not scary or suspensefull at all, it's just boring.

All I have to say is that this is a pretentious, esoteric piece of crap trying to be a \\"European\\" film. I understand it may be hard for actors Josh Hartnett and Rose Byrne's age to find quality work, but wow.Pretty much, nothing happens in this film. The flashbacks and left-out details make it seem like much more is going on than it actually is. Our sympathetic villain(s?) really aren't that threatening as they try to break up a relationship the audience really isn't invested in in the first place.

There's a point where the confusing flashbacks and weird edits become so numerous and layered that any residue of good will toward this film simply vanishes.Maybe a look at the French \\"L'Appartement\\" might be helpful, since this is an attempt at a remake.

But in the year 2004, with all the advanced technology, and all of our communication options, it is totally impossible for two lovers to lose complete contact with each other. It is also almost impossible to have your one and only true love still be alive, but mysteriously disappear without a trace, unless she was kidnapped and being held hostage by a wild and dangerous gang of demented psycho baboons (which in that case one would have contacted the missing persons bureau). The couple in this movie are young, well-to-do, modern, cosmopolitan yuppies. Don't tell me they didn't have email, voice-mail, text-messaging, fax or any other way of contacting each other for those two years that they were apart. Total bull.Once you take that into consideration, the movie just becomes pointless.

Not that there is anything wrong with movies that have these sometimes necessary distractions. But Wicker Park does not need these things to carry itself and is a wonderfully suspenseful, well-written movie with medium-bodied dialogue that keeps you trying to figure out exactly what is going on, but always answering your questions. Unlike some movies that are intentionally confusing and never come full circle, Wicker Park ties up all the lose ends and makes the unbelievable work, masterfully.Josh Harnett and his 2 co-stars are down to earth, well developed and ordinary, their commonality adding even more to the movie and leaving you wistfully wishing that your brief introduction to them could last more than 2 hours. Overall, it was a great movie, and worht your rental time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicker Park","review":"Truly loved this movie. I was hanging on to every moment and my heart strings were definitely tugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"A head-scratcher.","review":"Wicker Park starring Josh Hartnett is one confusing movie. There are too many flashblacks, the plot overlaps in present time, it's just one big passionless mess. Rose Byrne scares me and Diane Kruger needs to take an acting class, overall Wicker Park should have never been released. The only reason I give it two stars is for the location of the film, otherwise than that, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood muder of French Art Film","review":"I've seen the French movie \\"L'Appartement\\" and I must say that it is beyond comparison to the Hollywood remake, \\"Wicker Park.\\"Wicker Park is so bland and ineffective no thanks to the wooden performances of Hartnett and Kreuger. They just don't have the mystique and appeal of Vincent Cassell and Monica Bellucci which made the original film really interesting.The Hollywood movie is actually a \\"happy ending\\" version of the French film. The ending of Wicker Park totally deviated from the suspenseful, climactic and tragic conclusion of L'Appartement and instead offered a glimpse of happily ever after for the love story of the two leads.Think Hans Christian Anderson's original take on \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and Disney's sanitized, happy version of the said fairy tale. That's what \\"Wicker Park\\" is, a \\"Disney\\" version of L'Appartement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much different than the previews lead you to believe...","review":"I was very surprised at this melancholy movie, after months of previews building it up as a thriller. I was even more surprised that I ended up liking it.The beginning of the movie is confusing... the flashbacks are fast and furious and you can get lost if you're not paying attention. They don't lead in very well and the endings are unclear at times.I am not typically a fan of Harnett, but I felt he really played this role well. He captured his character's desperation and emotion perfectly. I was also very impressed with Lillard, who took a serious turn in this movie and pulled it off believeably.I hate to drag out a synopsis, because I don't want to ruin the movie, but I will suffice it to say that I'd recommend giving it a shot. I expected to be disappointed after realizing it was not a thriller, but instead was plesantly surprised and intrigued."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's wicked Cute - but the movie still sucks!","review":"OK, she's pretty - he's stinkin' cute - but the movie sucks! the writing, direction, plot, etc. From the blurb on the cover, i was expecting suspence, romance, mystery - and the only mystery was - \\"why did i stay up late on a weeknight to watch this?\\" my sweet Norman even said it was lame, and he likes most any movie, but, he did fall asleep halfway through, and i had to watch the rest with Norman drooling on my PJ top and the romote in hand, trying to hear over my beloved's snoring...."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!","review":"I could not say enough bad things about this move.

Granted - it is NOT weather sealed - so don't take this out in a rain storm - but it has served me well outdoors and is pretty solid. Images come out great, little CA and color and clarity are there. For me - that extra 2mm on the wide end makes a great difference from the classic 18mm wide kit lens start point, though I do wish it went to 50mm on the tele side.Overall, for the money, this is great lens.

They hit their stride on the title track (where everyone chips in), playing with incredible, swinging concentration. (You can FEEL their appetite to play.) Jordan's tone is at its most terse and direct on this recording, and it fits the overall perfomance like a glove.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool!","review":"I found out about these measuring wheels from the guy who identified the four corners on a 10-acre lot I purchased in the high desert. Okay, I'm a woman and I'd never seen these before! I bought the Keson RR318N because of its ratings and the great price on Amazon. I've been using it to layout a \\"homestead\\" on the land and I think it's really a neat contraption! The wheel glides easily over the terrain and is comfortable to use. The numbers are easy to read and it makes measuring a cinch. It actually took me three full days to figure out where to put the house, but that had nothing to do with the Keson wheel! I will find many uses for this over the years. I recommend this quality product wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou Art Works","review":"Received the Road Runner 4 days after ordering.

It works very well and is an excellent purchase for the price. It might not be a good purchase if you need to be EXACT in your distances, as I could definitely tell that with human error involved, it would probably only be accurate to within a foot or two. However, if you are looking to get a very good CLOSE idea of a distance, it definitely measured the same both coming and going, so I would have to say it was very accurate. The telescoping handle was easy to use and functioned well. It was easy to reset and roll, and the only CONFUSING part was figuring out how to get the \\"stand\\" out of your way when rolling it over grass, weeds, etc. Turns out, it just FLIPS UP, and it was actually very very easy.

He grabbed it and ran over the fence and gone. They had knocked it down and ripped off the bottom piece of the feeder that connects to the base.

Admittedly, the picture quality is not bad. But the battery runs out in a couple of minutes if you turn the LCD on. Don't expect it will do any better with the LCD off, as the body of the camera will always be warm (hot?) as you turn on the power. It's not bad for your hands in the winter days. But how can I endure it as the battery will die in less than one hour, or after you take 10 or 15 pictures? Be aware that the retail price for the rechargable battery is no less than ... bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Lasted one year","review":"I purchased this camera exactly one year ago last week and the LCD screen went out.

It has a nice feel and theoretically, a nice design, but many of the features didn't match the documentation and didn't work the way they were supposed to, until three months later, the entire system just died. Fortunately, we purchased the camera from Dillards.com, and their excellent customer service allowed us to return the camera for a full refund, but we won't replace it with another JVC. The camera has some nutty little quirks, such as a warning not to turn the camera on with the lens cap on the lens, or you'll risk serious damage to the lens mechanism. Sounds like a definite design flaw, doesn't it? JVC makes great audio equipment, but buy your camera from a manufacturer known for cameras!

The heavy synth vibe of the up-tempo songs, like \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\" and \\"Take on Me\\", is great to dance to (even if you are alone in the bathroom with only your blow dryer as a prop), and the slower songs like \\"Hunting High and Low\\" remind me of those aches of first love. \\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\\" shows the breadth of Morten Harkett's vocal abilities and evokes the pathos of boys becoming men and falling deeply in love with no escape in sight. While some of the lyrics sometimes veer towards the silly, I wouldn't hold them against this very strong debut album.

The other tracks on the CD are certainly OK, but perhaps overshadowed by the two main tracks just mentioned, and a bit lacking in \\"catchiness\\". For those who do not know a-ha, their music can be placed in the synth-pop genre of the 80's, with a leaning towards commerialism. All in all though, get this CD, even if it is for the two hits off it.If you do not own any a-ha, then perhaps the \\"Headlines And Deadlines\\" best of compilation is the place to start.

I would definetly recommend this book to everyone, as it could fall under so many different types of literature.

Close to erudite...However, this book could use less of the photos that make it so large and heavy (there are many photos of every work covered). If it is intended as a coffee table book, it does the trick (only make sure you have a robust coffee table). But to the reader who wants to consult it for every new Saturday MET performance, it's too difficult to handle; I would take an electronic version, if there was one available. In addition, this book has a paper sleeve that deteriorates very easily even if the book is carefully handled.

Ideas are dumped, not explained. Half of the names appear in only one sentence. It left me unable to remember or care about some of the 50+ names.

It worked much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This film is a window into the 17th century French playwright Moliere's soul, and pleasingly presents the balance between comedy and tragedy that was his life story which became incorporated into the plays he wrote. The movie deftly combined silliness with gravity, and an immense sensitivity Moliere had at understanding people shone through in his scripts, which may be a reason why his acting troupe were renowned performers of court entertainment. This French version with English subtitles came out in 2006, as did another French historical biography film Marie Antoinette. If forced to choose, I would say Moliere was exceedingly more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Raise of the Fraconphonie","review":"Thre is no doubt about the fame of Moliere in France and many countries.

But apparently the french writer came late in reafirming the importance of the french lenguage.The movie remind me in moments the awarded movie \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".

It drags on and on and on, and even though you want to know what happens to most of the characters, getting there is almost painful. It does show how drugs destroy lives, but there are so many unnecessary scenes and some that don't even make any sense. The actors are okay, but their talent is wasted in this snooze-fest. It tries to tell a story about a doctor who steals prescription medications and ends up trading them for illegal drugs, and it throws in alcohol abuse for good measure. But in the final analysis, ultimately it misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"It is a shame that Eric Roberts isn't have the actor his sister is but in this movie, he was probably the best. That might give you a clue as to how bad this movie is. It drags out a story line, that probably could be covered in a half hour TV program, into a 108 minute boring movie. The acting doesn't even rate a B movie and the camera work is also very disappointing.

Thank God for that review because otherwise I wouldn't have heard about this great new artist. The thing that I love about her cd & music style is that she is not an imitation of anyone else - she is an original.I truly don't understand the music business anymore when original artists are underpromoted, ignored then dropped yet formulaic trash is shoved down consumers' throats via radio & video.

She combines a powerful voice with lyrics that tell of true life issues of the day, not hyping up the same materialist themes of a lot of today's R&B and Hip-Hop. Not afraid to take jabs at other pop stars, this is a singer that deserves a lot more exposure than she is getting, but will eventually break through to a larger and more appreciative audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow is all I have to say.

How could I go wrong? I made a mistake buying this CD because there is no soul in it, it is too folksy and the sistah appears to be running away from the likes of Aretha, Patty and Whitney. This CD may have some possibilities and maybe under the wise hand of a Kedar Massenburg, it would have turned out much better. Spend money on the underappreciated Angie Stone CD where mahogany soul music lives and inspires."},{"rating":"1","title":"honest","review":"I remember when MTV was sweating this chick. What for?

She disappeared anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Tight and different!!!","review":"Hay now!!! i heard Res's five song sample about three months ago and i fail in love with the five that were on the CD. My favorite song is \\"Golden Boys\\", but \\"Ice King\\" especailly the remix with Nas is that deal. Anyway the CD is tight as hell and i hope that she starts to make some noise in the music industry and on the radio. And she needs to make a radio for \\"Golden Boys\\"Peace Out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE'S NOTHING LIKE GOOD MUSIC...","review":"Res is simply amazing. I don' think I've ever been this excited about having a new CD and I loved Jill Scott, Musiq, Sade and Badu's latest albums, but Res' style fills a void in the music industry that no other has done before. I haven't been able to listen to anything else since I bought her CD and I hope her music is appreciated. Peace & Love..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful new artist","review":"Next to Jurassic 5 and Nelly Furtado, this is the third album I have bought only by hearing word of mouth. I am finding this method of buying, so far, beneficial. \\"How I do?\\" is Res (pronounced Reese) debut album. I was surprised to hear such small vocal range utilized by this opera trained singer. Despite this fact, the vocal stylings meshed well with the trip hop stylings used by her band. Her blend of hip hop, jazz, and rock was reminscent of Mono or Esthero. Res's vocals could really be compared to that of Esthero, whom can also be compared to Bjork. The blend of trip-hop, rock vocals, and urban savy lyrics proves to be a sweet sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work!!","review":"Hopefully she can follow it up with more great albums. Sittin Back, Golden Boys, They Say Vision... all fantastic songs. The big surprise is Tsunami.... pretty creative tune. Extremely sexy AND talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"What \\"I\\" hear","review":"It is so easy for a critic to sit back and dissect a cd or album. Some people dig the reviews. Some people are dependent on reviews. I saw Res perform live on some channel. My ear was tickled by what it heard. I wrote her name down and bought the cd. I can't say that I can classify her but I respect her. I enjoyed the cd. It reminds me of being free without worries of perception.In all genres of music, is an artist aloud to translate what's going on inside of them. For some of us music is an unction that we gotta get out of us. I truly believe this young lady has an \\"unction\\" and I like it and respect it. As my southern grandmother would say about her own prophetic singing, \\"it ain't up for grading!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUL AT IT'S BEST","review":"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JAZZY, DANCY, SOULFUL, POP CD THAT REMINDS YOU OF CRYSTAL WATERS, I DEFINATELY RECCOMEND IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Res (Pronounced Reese)","review":"Res released a dynamite CD last year to critical acclaim, but probably twelve people (myself included) bought it. But, seriously, it's a pretty good collection from an artist who refuses to be boxed into any one category. Some people might lazily box her into the neo-soul camp, but the truth is that Res also dabbles with rock, pop, reggae, and a little hip hop flava with varying degrees of success. The end result is one tight groove that makes this one of most underrated releases out there. Give this CD a chance, and the music will richly reward you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Res is the next best thing.","review":"This New York based artist is the greatest to hit the music world since Lauryn Hill. Her voice is - amazing! \\"Ice King\\" and \\"Tsunami\\" are just two of the great songs off her debut album. I recommend this album to anyone who is search of continuing the great music in their hearts that artists like Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, and Alicia Keys have brought to the world. This album has a tremendous blend of not only R&B music, but alternative and rock, through the instrumental aspects that the music brings to the album. It also has a strong singer/songwriter influence to it also, making it synonymous with great musicians such as Dido, Moby, and Bjork. The bottom line is that this album is great....completely recommended to anyone who loves music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still can't pick a favorite track!","review":"This CD is already at the top of my personal playlist! From start to finish Res has an excellent mix of sound and atmosphere to go along with her beautiful voice. The songs exhibit a wide array of musical styles and somehow manage to flow together into a sometimes head noddin', sometimes 'eyes closed-feelin the flow' mix of music. You can't pick up this mix of sounds and style in any other CD out there this summer. A little Drum and Bass, a little rock, a little R&B, a little raggae, many together in the same song... and it all works! I love it! 'nough said!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE MORE MORE","review":"I just decided to write this review, because the longer I own this album, the more I realize what a main stay it is in my collection. I constantly go back to it. It didnt take long to learn the Lyrics, and it has a nice flow. She is really hard to catergorize. There are elements of just about every type of music. Hip-Hop, R&B, Rock , Trip Hop, and even a little Punk sound on the hidden track.If you like Esthero, or Les Nubians, chances are you will probably enjoy Res as well. I really look forward to another record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new for the people","review":"This CD is by-far one of the best CDs, lyrically, that I have bought this year. It is a blend of everything, if you like to get into new stuff, I completely reccomend this CD. It has the greatest blend of R&B, rock, jazz, you name it and you can find it here in this CD. Sure \\"Ice King\\" and \\"Golden Boys\\" are two of the best songs on this CD, but it is much more than those 2 songs. You won't be left disappoined on this CD, you will only question when and where you can check Res out live!!!!! It is just too good....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two songs One cd","review":"Res is a newcomer and I was Browsing through my Music channels I happen to catch her video for They say vision I was so impressed decide to give the cd a try The best tracks were 1,2,8 Those were my favorite It's one of those put you to sleep with live instruments and her voice makes you want to cuddle up with a pillow and just vibe off her music I recommend this cd cause of the two songs golden boys and they say vision and I enjoyed the cd alot cause Sometimes slow music is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Artist","review":"I think it unfair to Ms. Keyes that anyone would compare her to Res, who is so much more womanly and connected to her musical style than Alicia. The Res debut is more cohesive, weaving lyrics and production into a nearly seamless cloth. Even the track listing seems ordered to further your listening pleasure. Aside from the bonus track, which I have to be in the mood for, \\"How I Do\\" is very much a plug-and-play CD, in contrast to the highly skippable and aptly-titled \\"Songs in A Minor\\". With Alicia, much as with Aaliyah, there is a disjoint between her startling vocal ability and her production, in Alicia's case an underdeveloped over-synthesized jangle that does nothing to compliment her behind the piano. Alicia's debut is teeny-bop pop and does not reach me on an adult level.I recommend buying Res now and giving Alicia a little time to grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"how she do?, amazing that's how!","review":"If you like that funky groove with a rock appeal, than this cd is for you....the lyrics are off the chain and on the real. if your into other artist like, Nikka Costa or, Joydrop or Anastacia, then, this is your ear candy....RES has got the chops and mad skills to take it to the top, but not too soon i want my private seranade to go on just a little longer.And for all my friends from L.b., if you still miss the grooves of Ruby Diver, like i do,this cd will keep you until the next phase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return of the Mack...Fleetwood, that is.","review":"Its not poor songwriting or musicianship. More like a lack of 'Vision'(pun intended). This disc seems like a thinnly veiled attempt to urbanize the sound and image of a classic Pop/Rock vocalist.Fleetwood Mac was/is a great band. But Stevie Nicks haunting-but-whining vocals can be downright annoying to hear at times, whether you're in your car or an elevator. Res' singing and music is like a polished and refined version of that sound. If you're wondering what Nicks would sound like singing Neo Soul/Pop, this might do it for you.And for the record my personal fave is, ironically, 'They Say Vision'. Definitely worth downloading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooooh I didn't like it!","review":"I'm easy to please I think regarding music. But I did not enjoy this one at all. I enjoy selecting music that isn't at the top of the \\"list\\"....and I get so excited when I find something that's just awesome....and it happens more times than not. I rarely select something that turns out to be a bummer. But I'm sorry to say this one is a bummer in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best used as a coaster","review":"I had high hopes for this disc, given the positive press that surrounds Res and the first single off the album but I found it incredibly dull and lacking in many respects. Some of the other reviewers wrote about funk and R&B but to me it sounded like someone trying to imitate Natalie Merchant singing reggae. Worse still, the beats were weak and most of the tracks sounded the same. Her lyrics did have some value but they couldn't make up for the overall lameness. Needless to say, I am sure it will be huge in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rendition ever of Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5.","review":"I've been listening to various renditions of Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5 since my childhood 40 years ago and I can play it myself. This Abbado's rendition (1984 version) is by far the best. I heard it on a local radio a few days ago and was astounded by the beauty of it. I quickly found the video on YouTube and got all the information from there. Then, I bought it from Wherehouse.com via Amazon.com. The used disc is just like new.

I found out things you never hear about him. Very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelangelo, Raphael and NO IMAGES","review":"The tale of Michelangelo and the pope's ceiling is well written if somewhat disconnected in parts. I truly enjoyed the story, even though it was a bit dry and lacking in available primary source material. But, what really annoyed me about the book (and also Picasso's War) is the lack of images. The color images of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling are small (an understatment). There are more-than-adequate images available on each panel, let alone the entire ceiling. Why are they not used. King speaks for pages about Raphael's 'School of Athens' but we only see the cartoon/drawing, not the painting. One should not be expected to sit with an art history text while reading the book !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"michelangelo and the rest of the world","review":"nice treatment and history of michangelo and his world at that time i enjoyed all the information and how it was presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best way to meet Michelangelo","review":"King exhibits a masters touch in his descriptive writing, panache and almost daily record of the artists life. The reader is taken into the work area of the master and provided a firsthand knowledge of how the conditions of this era played upon the capability of producing artistic results. The descriptions of the personalities of King's characters reflect the detailed research this author has done with much discipline to properly set the atmosphere for the reader. The description of the diferences between Michelangel's and Raphael's use of assistants and teaching is a typical, interesting side story. \\" He ( Michaelangelo) was interested in instilling his art in only \\"noble people\\"....and not in plebeins\\"King also is not intimidated by other authors writing on this era. In fact, it is refreshing to see his references to Condivi,George Bull, and Lehmann in much of his storytelling.Truly a \\"keeper\\" for the grndkids to read as an into to Michaelangelo Buonarroti"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining reading, good pictures","review":"It is amazing how much we know about this great sculptor and painter. The book is simply attractive, with some drops of humor the author takes you back to Renaissance Italy, full of artists and dominated by a rotten Catholic Church that left much to be desired. This was the time of Michelangelo, the time when living in Rome was dangerous because of malaria and other diseases, days with particular Popes like \\"il Papa Terribile\\", that nauseated Martin Luther but to whom we can be thankful for those great works of art comissioned by him and others. Despite all the information we have about Michelangelo, I am still curious about his personal life, a life of struggle and discontent with himself.

After reading this book, I realize that I was very wrong! This work is extremely well written and fast-paced. We get mini biographies of numerous historical figures, plus great dollops of Italian and European history to boot. The author tells a terrific story in lucid prose, and the reader is simply fascinated with how the painting was accomplished. Even though the romantic notion of Michelangelo paining by lying on his back for years, paint dripping all over his face, is not factual, the true tale is every bit as fascinating! This is one of those niche pieces of history that is well covered by this book, and I highly recommend this work to anyone with a penchant for the offbeat in historical action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are Looking Up","review":"Continuing in the tradition of his earlier book, \\"Brunelleschi's Dome,\\" Ross King explores the genesis of Michelangelo's masterpiece, the Sistine Chapel ceiling. King eloquently discusses not only Michelangelo's technique and composition, but also the contemporaneous rivalry with Raphael, who at the time was engaged in frescoing several of Pope Julius II's apartments. Written for the general reader, \\"Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling\\" is must reading for anyone visiting the Vatican and the Sistine Chapel for the first time--and indeed for the repeat visitor. What one misses, though, are more comprehensive illustrations of the various sections of the ceiling itself, which would assist in following King's descriptions and analysis. Still, by the end of the book, one realizes that the hand of God in the \\"Creation of Adam\\" is really the hand of Michelangelo, and we are all blessed by his divine inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Learning","review":"This well-researched and well-documented book makes learning about the topic of the Sistine Ceiling both easy and approachable. History should always be presented this way!King gives the reader a behind-the-scenes look at all of the intrigue, power plays, artistic jealousy that went on during this era in Italy. The painting of frescoes on the Sistine Chapel's ceiling was fraught with difficulties, not the least of which were the politics of the time.I especially liked reading the technical aspects of this monumental project: the mixing of the pigments and the logistics of how Michelangelo actually accomplished the painting.This topic has fascinated me ever since reading National Geographic's wonderful account of the restoration of the frescoes. King's book gave me all the background and particulars that I had wondered about.A most worthwhile book for anyone interested in learning the history of one of art's masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intellectual Page-Turner","review":"A well-written book that balances the telling of the rich history of the time with the many human stories involved in the painting of the Pope's ceiling. How the story ends is no mystery, but the wealth of information and well-drawn characters (especially the complex, brilliant and often impossible Michelangelo)will hold your interest chapter by chapter. The brilliant Michelangelo was a celebrity in his own time, but was still human, exasperated by relatives who wanted to trade on his fame, constantly complaining about his finances and often a source of misinformation that enhanced the self-image he seemed to enjoy of the long-suffering martyr for his art. Reading this book before you walk through the doors of the Sistine Chapel will enable you to look up and appreciate the ceiling through enlightened eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"it was exactly what i needed, and in great condition.

When I heard him do a custom rendition of Colors/Dance by George Winston I immediately felt something in his music. I bought this CD immediately and I can't even describe how it touched my when I heard his music. I have seen him in concert and listen to his CD's over and over and yet the music never dulls.

Agnes Baltsa had a great Carmen in her, so she is the great loss of this recording. Carreras is touching and vulnerable, but his French is just terrible. Even worse, the use of actors in the dialogues is completely unacceptable and ridiculous. DG has the finest CARMEN ever recorded with Teresa Berganza and Claudio Abbado. Everything that is wrong in Karajan's recording is right in the Abbado.

James Dewar and Jack Bruce, two of the vocalists featured on this hits set, were perfect foils to Trower's guitar wizardry, never trying to show him up, just perfectly complimenting him on song after song. Dewar is especially impressive on Caledonia and the live Too Rolling Stoned. Dewar has since passed away, but for the most part this set acts as a shining monument to one of the more underrated, yet consistently soulful vocalists in hard rock history. This cd is one of my favorites to listen to while traveling alone. Beginning to end, it cranks, and naturally leads to hunting down the excellent twofers that Trower's works have been featured on in the past few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless biography based on facts subsequently disproven","review":"The entire basis of this biography was disproven by research conducted in 1998 and published in \\"The American Genealogist\\", 73:161-171.

Also devotes a chapter to Service Operations reviewing different approaches. The content has a good balance between theory and practice/exercises, which is supported with bussines cases. In comparison with previous Schoreder book, it does not have the appendices (quantitative methods). I think it is right because there are other books devoted to quantitative methods or operations research topics. Maybe the book needs to develop the supply chain management topic (my comments are about this book first edition (2000))."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and effective","review":"If your doctor has recommended pelvic floor physical therapy this a good alternative to scheduling times at a clinic.

I finally receive the collection and what happens, i'am missing discs about 2 more and the reason i bought this collection because of this song, that particular CD is missing.

The grooves on here are very strong and the production is more raw than on \\"Ear Candy\\". The hooks are still there though, and Pinnick's and Tabor's songwriting is as strong as ever. The change in production shows that they haven't gone stale. This is a band that should have had a lot more success than they did, their music is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's X music has never sounded this \\"chunky\\".","review":"Groove Machine. That's all the reason you need to buy the eighth realease of the Houston trio that has achieved everything in music except fame. The album was written in 12 days, and at some points, it shows. Despite one or two weak trax, this is mainly a return to Dogman, without totally letting go of the Ear Candy influence. Chunky Chunky and Funky. That's \\"Groovy\\" with me. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King's X, King's X, where for art thee?","review":"Not to say this album completely stinks, but it certainly isn't their best. I found most of the lyrics and music redundant. Essentially \\"Dogman\\" all over again, the album doesn't explore new musical territory (except maybe Jerry playing more than four drums the entire album) or highlight their known talents. I salivated hearing just the few chords of classic King's X at the beginning of \\"Farkas\\" simply because I longed for it so much after listening to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love King's X, but ... one word for this album ...DULL","review":"First of all I am a big fan of this band. However, this CD left me greatly disappointed. It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired. Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did. Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark. Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best. I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ...

Go to any of their live shows, and you will see a house packed with rabid fans.

John Piper puts fasting into its correct position in a believers life.Personally I had never even thought that my attitude while fasting was important I just thought that if I prayed and fasted God had to move on my behalf. I have since learned it isn't God who changes but it is me and that prayer and fasting increases my dependence on God releasing greater faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is the single best contemporary work on Christian fasting I've found. Not to take away from the excellent chapter on fasting in Richard Foster's Celebration of Discipline, or any number of other shorter works, but Piper does an excellent job of laying out an approach to fasting based on a desire for God. Excellent corrective for both the \\"fasting is too legalistic\\" error and the \\"fasting will convince God to help me\\" error - Piper presents fasting as a way to train our own hearts to enjoy God above all things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very motivating book","review":"Very inspirational!

Enjoyed, not a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant and encouraging; makes me yearn for God even more!","review":"John Piper does a great job of describing what fasting is, and what it isn't.

I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hunger for Fasting","review":"This book is an incredible work on the subject of fasting. Piper examines several myths regarding fasting, and contends that Christians aren't so fond of the discipline because they've \\"been nibbling at the table of the world for too long\\".

It's not the bath itself so much that he's not keen on. He likes baths overall, really. It's just that he knows what he likes and does not like --- and taking a bath means having to wash his ears. Hopscotch does *not* like washing his ears. Will tricks work? Will treats work? Maybe Hopscotch just needs a good example.\\"Rabbit Ears\\" is a story of learning and repsonsibility. And Hopscotch learns that learning to do grown-up things comes with privileges too.

Is it really a secret that John was violent? He very famously admitted on a TV interview that he was \\"a hitter\\". The entire \\"documentary\\" was overtly agenda driven and has hardly a shred of hard evidence. Almost everything is conjecture and you'll also notice that most of those interviewed qualify almost every comment they make.

Good luck trying to run contolled clinical trials with an intervention that cannot be \\"blind\\" to the patient or clinician. In other words, much of the hypotheses of the authors are untestable.

The MIDI control is buggy and flawed, _vide infra_.All of the complaints mentioned in other reviews so far are 100% valid, so I won't list them again -- the list is too long. I would add that the heads are rock-hard and their piezo senders are fragile and produce very weak output.As low as my expectations were for this thing, it fell far, far short of the minimum acceptable function and was a TOTAL waste of money.

The toms, snare and cymbals perform adequately-no complaints here. The pads do make quite a bit of noise when struck.

If your a fan of Von Karajan, Tchaikovsky and Dvorak, get a copy before copies run out. The two serenades are very beautiful and I always enjoy listening to this CD from start to end. The sound is solid and the Berlin Philharmoniker gives out a strong orchestral performance. A cheaper alternative is the Titov-conducted Chamber Orchestra of the St. Petersburg Conservatory (infinity Digital, Sony Music Entertainment) performance of both serenades. The Titov version makes individual string instruments sing out whereas Karajan gives you a muscular orchestral version.

I hope you get a chance to see it sometime too. The music is very \\"dancey,\\" and the dancers are, well....what can I say? It's Balanchine performed by one of the two best ballet companies in the world. This CD arrived promptly from the seller, and the price was ideal. Many thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody is perfect?","review":"This recording fully meets my expectations in terms of excellent technical quality (us usually provided by Deutsche Grammophon) as well as interpretation by Berliner Philharmoniker & Karajan delivering \\"golden\\" sound. Nevertheless I should point out that this CD turned out to be the first ever for me to hear a serious playing slip by the musicians. The strings are certainly playing wrongly for a few seconds in track no. 6 (Allegro con moto - Trio) around the count of 4'00\\"\\" which caused quite some disappointment to me. I raised this point on the DG homepage and got the following answer on 29-June-2000:Quote\\"A playing slip?\\": You are right here. However, it is most likely that Karajan decided to allow the slip to stand because he believed an additional corrective take would not match the overall quality of the performance delivered albeit with that slip.Unquote"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good reviews came BEFORE the exam was released","review":"The majority of the previous reviews for this book came before MS actually released exam 70-100.

The exam will cover more of: database design, reading a case study and implementing a solution using workflow, erd, and other database specific questions.

The book covers and is a great reference for MSF, but it has nothing to do with the exam.I also find it dispicable that this web site shows a 5-star review first and calls it review of the day, even though that review was written a long time ago. The big A needs to look over their Product Review Engine, because I constantly see this on other useless books, including all 70-100 books that made the same mistake as this one.All of the 4 and 5 ratings skew the real value of this book, which is 0 for preparing for the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an exam helper","review":"I bought this a couple of weeks ago in prep of the exam.

Only a very small part of the test is multiple choice like the questions in the book and on the CD-ROM, and MSF (which this book majors on) was all but completely absent from the test.

A flow diagram thing that I couldn't get to work properly at all (You had to click two boxes at-a-time then click a connecting phrase to make a flow diagram).

Unfortunately, even the \\"knowledge based\\" questions I had were not covered by this book.

All the basic situations and relationships found in later books in the series are either introduced or have a basis in this single book. As is now typical of Ms. Cherryh's writing it focuses upon people and their relations with each other including the language they use to communicate. Ms. Cherryh introduces and builds out several major characters and builds the framework for introducing others later in the series.

In most stories the character manages to piece together some information about the attempt on his own life. Not in this book, however, as nothing is revealed until 300 pages into the story. Prior to that we get a diary of an individual who is conducting a rather lengthy and boring cultural study of a wanna-be feudal Japan.

I loved \\"They Call Me Tater Salad\\" so I purchased this one without my customary \\"due diligence\\" of making sure someone whose judgment I trust recommends it. There were maybe two funny jokes in his stand-up routine. I'm no prude and I can tolerate foul language if the jokes are funny. But 90% of this DVD was just juvenile potty-humor suitable only for preteens who think foul language alone is funny. The only part of the DVD worth watching was the behind-the-scenes section, but that was only worth $1.99. This was a waste of time and money and it will be a LONG time before I buy another Ron White DVD because of it. It was stupid and Ron's right ... you can't fix that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"After seeing Ron on Comedy Central we thought he was very funny and even planned to go see him live.

Forget the gutter language and get back to funny. I would have returned the DVD if possible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent. I agree","review":"I love Ron White. He can be riotously funny; but \\"YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID\\" falls short of his earlier \\"Blue Collar Comedy Tour\\" standard.First, the theme, \\"YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID\\" is not the theme of most of this show. He should have stuck with the theme, because STUPID is what you can do a lot with, where jokes are concerned.Second, instead of STUPID, we get gross-out (and STUPID) sexual material that ...well.....look; it's like this, if you're over the age of SIX, and have heard the ordinary profane words for genitalia, and know the \\"F\\" word, you will not be surprised to hear it from Ron White. Of course, you won't laugh either....at least, I didn't, and if hearing those words makes you giggle, and you call that comedy, then I'm happy that I did not laugh.Ron White could do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ron White's video is terrible!","review":"I am VERY disappointed in Ron White's video - it was full of talk about his member, and nothing else. What it reminded me of, is a drunk man at a bar hitting on a woman, the whole time bragging himself up to make himself feel better in a futile attempt to take her home.If it would be possible, I would ask for a refund. This is the first - and last - video of Ron's that I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare to other Entertainers","review":"We bought this DVD because it was recomened in the \\"others who bought this product also bought\\" category - this Comedian can't compare to the quality of Jeff Durham's Arguing with Myself - it's a different level entirely and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the power of some of the songs, it's incredible!","review":"I knew already the good sound of this band from \\"Illusions On A Double Dimple\\", when I bought the LP in Lisbon, when it was released and Jurgen Fritz was there promoting it: after an improvised organ session he did at a music shop there, I had no doubts about his great talent, but the group was then already going separate ways, to his stated regret (that's why the front of the CD states \\"New Triumvirat\\", instead of just \\"Triumvirat\\"). I lost this LP after using it on a Radio Macau weekly news cast, and I've been looking for it for the last ten years, also in Hong Kong. I remember the power of songs like \\"Journey Of A Fallen Angel\\", and specially \\"The Hymn\\": an incredible pleasure to the ears of Sinfonic Rock lovers! Other tracks I recommend are \\"The Time Of Your Life\\", \\"Dance On The Vulcano\\" and \\"Vesuvius 79 A.D.\\".

For example, when Christa is trying to seduce Lenda, she's wearing shorts. Then she takes Lenda down to the vaults for a more comprehensive ... encounter, and suddenly she's wearing slacks. In another scene, two women flee from the castle and are then attacked by the villagers as suspected witches, while the background switches from day to night and back again without any rationale. There are several silly side-plots involving the guests at the castle that have nothing to do with the main \\"story\\"--whatver that is. Really, this is a one star movie, but the presence of Rita Calderoni and Mickey Hargitay pushes it up to two stars. \\"The Devil's Nightmare\\" from Redemption is a much better example of Euro-horror cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Photo Book of Washington DC","review":"Anyone who has grown weary of the typical DC monument pictures will love this book, with its gorgeous black-and-white photos of less commonly photographed buildings and places in DC.

We always have friends come over that say \\"you can't really match high def quality you get on a flat screen TV\\" and they're always stunned when the see the picture. I think its the brightness more than the high definition that people are impressed with. We keep our brightness at about 50% and its still plenty bright to watch most shows--unless they're super dark shows. That has extended our bulb life as well... we're barely over 1000 hours because we're not burning the bulb as fast as we would at 100%. Also, the thing is very quiet and starts and turns off really fast which I like. I don't like it when projectors cool down for 3 minutes. This one takes about 10 seconds which is great.

Since I have a map of Europe circa 1914 in my head, I haven't minded the lack of maps. In fact, the flow of my reading has likely been enhanced by my not flipping to a map every time a place name is mentioned, and the author does verbally described the topography where needed. The sidebars and short blurbs are also well-written. I have detected a couple of \\"typos\\", but nothing serious. An excellent introduction.

Now I realise a fair amount of heavy bands, such as Pantera and Black Sabbath, have been technoed before, and to alright acclaim, but I'm not sure this is the way to go with KoRn's music. Their distinctive style and groundbreaking techniques are an island to themselves, and no-one should mess with it - EVER!

It plays a lot of CDs with a low frequency hum, and while my iPod fairs better (because it has an internal EQ) everything that comes out of the system sounds flat. In fact, it sounds like the CD player is unable to handle a great number of low and high range frequencies, and compresses them so much towards the middle that it actually causes crackling. I'm taking this back to the garage that installed it, and if they won't put in something better, I'm asking for my money back. As far as I'm concerned, this is junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid compendium of lore for major netherworld adventures","review":"This book will add amazing depth to your campaigns, by providing you with exhaustive information on caverns and the depths of the Underdark.

I am using it as added description in my AD&D 2nd edition game and boy is there ever great flavor text in here. Its a gem in the D&D world- a direct view into the game as it was intended. Quirky, often contradictory and fun. My only complaint was that the seller sent the product in a media envelope and the edges were damaged in the shipping. Otherwise great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Art from yester year.","review":"Beautiful movie, awesome sets and costumes from when cinema was having it's birth pangs. Tangerine Dream's soundtrack is a bit annoying but you can get past it. This movie deserved a orchestra for it was as grand and poetic as Dante. I suggest this film to anyone but again it pisses me off the sellers on here literally screw the customer on the price. If you don't want to empty your wallet I suggest you look elsewhere on the internet. This movie isn't completely out of stock in all places, I got mine new from a company that isn't small or independent. The high price is well worth it but I say look before you spend ridiculous amounts of money to rip off sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"I purchased two tubes of this Boat Life Lifeseal for Fiberglass and ordinarily it is a good product. I had used it before with good results but these two tubes were already partially cured...in the tube. Needless to say...I was not happy. The price was right but if the product is defective...it's not a good deal. It would cost more than the product is worth to send back so in the future I will purchase locally and squeeze the tubes before buying. The problem with buying inexpensive things on-line is the cost to ship in case a product return is needed.If the supplier reads my comments perhaps they should check their stock to ensure other tubes are not partially cured and if so...return to the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best 1987 Collection Available.","review":"First and foremost, this is a 1980s collection. Although it isn't representative of more than a single year in music, these songs are fantastic. For any 1987 collection in particular, you are likely to find at least two of my personal favorites--Belinda Carlisle's \\"Heaven is a Place on Earth\\" and Kim Wilde's \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On.\\" (This collection is no exception.) However, I can't remember the last time I saw The Jets' \\"Cross My Broken Heart\\" or Ready For the World's \\"Love You Down,\\" Survivor's \\"Is This Love?\\" or Samantha Fox's \\"Touch Me (I Want Your Body),\\"--which, in all honesty, was a 1986 hit. Still, what I love about this disc is its compiling of obscure 1987 hits that may not have charted in Top Ten positions, but are certainly vintage 1980s. Face it, none of these songs would chart today, and that's why this compilation is so charming. I have listened to other volumes of the \\"Rock On/Top 40 Chartbusters\\" series and no volume can touch 1987."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel dummber after reading this book.","review":"I can't believe this rehashed stuff in support of \\"creation-science\\".

As a scientist, I was appalled to read this section, because he was so wrong on many points! MacDowell has used \\"evidence\\" which was completely discredited well before he wrote the book; he has used irrelevant points and misleading arguments; he has attempted to expose \\"serious problems\\" with evolution but failed even to acknowledge that there are even more serious problems with \\"creation science\\"; he has ridiculed evolution for past errors which have since been fixed yet failed to see that he's using creationists' errors that haven't been fixed. These are unacceptable in any book which claims to show the truth.MacDowell asks, in the book, why more scientists don't accept creationism. The miserable scholarship in this book is a sample of the real reason why.

Please don't take that statement as an insult though, I just really enjoyed their other sailor-themed films a lot more. Especially that of \\"Anchors Aweigh,\\" which had wonderful music, memorable dances, and a little more character depth than this film that I'm rating.If you're new to Kelly-Sinatra films, I would recommend starting with \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" or \\"On The Town\\" first, but chances are this film will still turn you on to the others because, it too, is a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Me Out To The Ball Game","review":"This is such an amazing movie, and the quality is great!!

Rather all I found was at best, a statement of obvious observations and moral presumptions made by the author on behalf of the reader, and at times based off of clearly distorted facts or quotes. Furthermore it's unfortunate that it appears to use Christianity as its base of morality, when now more than ever both the middle class and the inner city exemplify a much greater religious diversity. Sadly, the book was no where near what I was looking for. Spending half a chapter on sexuality bashing homosexuals deals nothing with suburban or urban culture. Luckily the library will take this book back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical","review":"The more I read this book, the more LIBERAL I became.

Do not listen to the ones who say Pollini \\"plays coldly\\" or \\"lacks musicality\\" because this is nonesense, this man happens to be capable not only of superb technical performances, but surely of some of the most haunting musicality around. Pollini is the son of one of Italy's celebtrated architects, and it is true that some of his recordings may sometimes sacrifice color for a deeper sense of structure, but not on this recording: the Etudes have never been more interestingly played than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, these are technically impressive, but not musically","review":"I used to think it was hilarious that people found Pollini's recording the best, but now I've realized that it is only because they haven't heard Garrick Ohlsson's recording.Ohlsson's recording of these etudes contains FAST tempos, similar to Pollini (usually a bit faster still), but he actually makes music out of them; fancy that.Pollini's interpretations sound all Forte, all emotionless/expressionless.

It's easy to follow and easy to learn from. For the new to UML reader it seems like such a relief to find a book that describes it so easy. This is where the problem starts, the book is simply incorrect in a lot of cases. Some examples below:It describes the RUP as waterfall. Superimposing workflows on phases. The author thinks that the inception phase is analysis. This could essentially drive a project to failure. It's obvious the author has never successfully implemented RUP.Some of the diagrams are wrong (i.e. The extension points are on the wrong use cases) and the emphasis on diagramming use cases instead of writing them is an obvious novice mistake.Larman's Applying UML and Patterns is just as simple to read but is actually correct. Please at least review Larman's book before purchasing this terrible title."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent UML intro","review":"This is a very well-written intro to UML. The book is concise, without any fluff, and immediately useful. If you want to learn UML and don't want to yawn through the 400+ page spec or lug around some oveweight, over-appendixed book, I strongly suggest checking this one out. The diagrams are simple and clear. The examples make sense. While I didn't really take any of the short quizzes after each section, in retrospect I think they can be helpful for some. As far as \\"bad\\", there really isn't any.For experienced developers new to UML, this book also goes nicely with \\"Agile Modeling\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for beginners, excellent for future quick reference","review":"I tried learning UML by using the more popular books, but had difficuly absorbing the information mainly due to time constraints.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of missleading or wrong information. For instance, in use case diagrams, the extension points are shown in the extendet use case, not the basic use case. The close relationship between sequential diagrams and collaboration diagrams is not explained. Also, the relationsship between operations in class diagrams and messages is not covered.I got the impression, the author of this book has never partitipated in the development of object-oriented software. If you like to learn UML but not object-oriented programming this might be the book for you.

Indeed, their distinguished playing renders this Parsifal with an unmatched orchestral performance on record, as only the sharpest of players will do for Karajan's surgical precision.Sadly, it is the singers missing that last sparkle needed to carry this work to the realm of fantasy. That is not say they are lackluster or incompetent, these are very fine performances: Kurt Moll sings with command, if not power; and Peter Hofmann is memorable, if not special. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by Knapperbtusch's 1962 Bayreuth performance. Either way, that is not much more that I can add to what other reviewers have already noted.

And I'm thrilled each time I listen to to this CD. We were very sad when Leonard Slatkin left St. Louis because he had made significant accomplishments with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.

Overall this is a very good product that I recommend, but I only gave it 4 stars because although it fits & looks good, but it would have looked better if its length sizes were a bit longer for taller people like me (not only regular), so if there were longer sizes (i.e. large long, x-large long, ...etc) it would have been much better, but this one is OK. Last point is the waist size which is a bit inaccurate (little too large) but the side waist-belts took care of this issue"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing cd!","review":"if you get this cd you will NOT be sorry! its simply amazing!. i mean its upbeat and fun and theres so much creativity packed in it. its just really amazing. i mean this cd really \\"MAkes ME HAppy\\". i also recommend his 1st cd \\"telegraph\\" which i would also so rate it 5 stars. my favorite songs in his cd would seriously be every single song except \\"end it good\\".

If it's a FINANCE guide you want, then buy it. I was hoping it would have more strictly accounting advice like how to read a balance sheet, what a profit and loss statement is, what is a liability, etc. It hardy touches accounting, concentrating more on the finance side of starting up & running a business, eg. business plans, cash flows, types of companies, tax, etc. The book however is easy to read & understand but I feel should get rid of the \\"accounting\\" term in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the Accounting?","review":"This book seemed to be 98% about Finance with 2% brushing very lightly over double entry accounting with very vague explainations of how a credit increases liability, etc. I was very disappointed in it as I had hoped to get some grounding so I could at least figure out where to post numbers in an accounting program like MYOB.

These included nursing homes, day cares, literacy centers, elementary schools to name a few. My students learned how different careers can incorporate PAT (social work, occupational therapy, nursing, psychology etc).

Through \\"Lion's Heart\\" and its worthy sequel \\"Lion's Soul\\", Chevenga tells his remarkable life story with heartfelt openness; I can tell you I passed several sleepless nights unwilling to put down the book and make myself wait to see what happened next.For any fan of the fantasy genre or anyone looking for a story that will never let go of your heart, I recommend these.

There is no fixing the others since the plastic trigger is snapped. Did Polsteins know they were broken when they put them in the box? No one initialed the packing slip.

While I enjoyed the first book I found this one to be the best because it centers the most on Juliet and her family.As a guy I usually don't go with female detective series except for Sue Grafton's alphabet books but the first three novels here are witty and fun for those who get turned off at the Sherlock Holmes school of mysteries where we find out more about the crime than Holmes and Watson after hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick & Entertaining","review":"I enjoyed this book more than I did the first one. I found it better written and the main character better developed, but maybe it just took a second book for the author to really define Juliet's personality. In this episode, Juliet's babysitter disappears and she feels responsible for finding out what happened to her. Her search leads her to the Hassidic community of New York and back to L.A.

It is of excellent quality. As with anything braille, it must be read with a very light touch, this is important for accuracy.

I love it.It was well packed and arrived promptly, I would recommend it for anyone who needs a good looking high quality braille watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN, GLAMOROUS WESTERN","review":"First and foremost I disagree with the shallow reviewer who says that but you'll have a hard time noticing Moreau, since in most shots she's standing next to Bardot! First and foremost, Bardot is alot younger than Moreau here. Secondly Moreau plays a more solemn character, while Bardot plays someone more naive and very very enthusiastic, also as demonstrated on the cover. More importantly, the two have GREAT chemistry, and in defense to the comment made by that shallow reviewer, Moreau holds her own next to Bardot. It's not a contest you shallow person, it's a collaboration of two strong characters who each hold their own and demonstrate great chemistry with one another. The story is silly, it's French, Bardot is in it, Moreau is in it, it's about two bandits, frankly you can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Awaw-a-waw-awaaaaa\\"","review":"If you think \\"awaw-a-waw-awaaaaa\\" looks silly, try listening to it sung! Good lord, the track \\"Good\\" is pretty terrible. Why? Anyone with ears could listen to this song once and tell you. It's the whiny singer going \\"wwuuh-haarwww\\" at the beginning of every line of the chorus. This is what passed for lead singing in the nineties. It's annoying hearing it once; listening to it many times would be akin to being locked in a garbage can with the stars of \\"Revenge of the Nerds.\\" (No wonder the girlfriend that the singer is apparently singing to no longer lives with him; doesn't sound like it was that 'good!') Then at the end there is a lot of totally unecessary feedback noise while the whiner carries on going \\"awaw-awaa-awaa\\"; think about it, does this really add anything to the song or did they just leave it in because the band didn't know how to end it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underappreciated classic","review":"Pollini's famous recordings of Chopin's 1st concerto and etudes are justly acclaimed, but this choice album is begging for reissue in the \\"Originals\\" series. Pollini masterfully plays these microcosmic works as a cycle with trademark technical assurance and in a warmer tone than the etudes album--there is no lack of delicacy in the F-sharp major and F major preludes, for instance. Riveting from the opening C major prelude to the cataclysmic D minor conclusion (a favorite encore of his), this remains my preferred version of this opus despite more-or-less competitive alternatives by Cortot, Argerich, Pogorelich, Moravec, Freire, Kissin, Sokolov, Arrau, Perahia, Rubinstein, and Ashkenazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good (If a Bit Technical) Start","review":"After reading through this book (which is actually better described as a collection of articles about related topics,) I found it to be a good overview for those wanting to learn more about distance learning and the library services associated with it. The book is very technical, however, and is really best suited for those already familiar with the terminology associated with higher education and academic libraries. The language is dense and it is written in a style commonly associated with scholarly journals. The main drawback to this book is that it was written in 1997 and becasue the field of distance education is so fast-moving, it may some be outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but Uninformative","review":"The scenery is beautiful, especially the aerial flyovers. However, I found it very frustrating to have no idea what I was seeing. Even the most basic captioning would have vastly improved my viewing experience, without detracting from the \\"artistic\\" side of the presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a music DVD and not a travel DVD","review":"This DVD plays a number of better known English classical pieces while showing scanning shots of large English country houses. There is no narration, subtitling or labelling of the locations. The video quality is not what we expect of a DVD. Anybody buying this for the graphical content or the travel element will be dissapointed. I recommend buying a CD of Purcell's music, if that is what you want. This thing is worth about the same value (Five to ten dollars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Mystery and a Some Good Laughs","review":"Jane Heller has created a funny and believable heroine in Judy Mills, cookbook editor who has just been fired by a young know-it-all. During Judy's search for a job, her husband suggests she network at his country club. Judy is recruited by the police to help solve a murder at the club, and the resulting investigation will keep you in stitches. The characters you meet will keep you chuckling through the entire book - from Nedra, the who is having a torrid affair with the tennis coach, to Brandon, the chef who can't cook and many more. This book is fun and entertaining and the whodunnit question will keep you guessing right up until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"first class satire","review":"I just finished this book and loved it to the last page. Jane Heller is a first class satirist--the best satire is only a hair away from the real thing. I'm a New York editor (working, unlike Judy Mills) who's been downsized twice, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and board the train every day probably minutes from where \\"The Club\\" is supposed to be. I'm a lousy tennis player and hate golf. So let me tell you, she has it right down to the details of every stereotype, from the men's and women's apparel, the attitude, the commuters, etc. Of course the characters, from WASPs to radical feminists are all exaggerated, but they're supposed to be. I was laughing through the whole thing, even though one of my favorite people got killed. But don't get me wrong--there are a lot of great people in this county, and I wouldn't be anywhere else in the continental U.S. I don't mind laughing at myself and my environment when it's well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely for young readers","review":"I'm a great Lawhead fan.

However, for some inexplicable reason, book one and book three in the trilogy are available as an e-book for my kindle, but book two is not.

This is definitely for the Hendrix completist, and not the casual listener. Quality isn't bad, but it is a bit of a hack job.

I found this particular version of Carmina to be a little on the melodramatic side. Don't get me wrong-Carmina IS a dramatic piece, but too much of a good thing...just isn't good.Specifically, some of the slower solos were too drawn out. The tempo needed some help too. I felt like the entire recording was being dragged through molasses.Maybe I'm just used to a certain sound...I certainly agree that music appreciation is subject to each individual's interpretation. But if you buy this CD and feel the same way as I do, consider purchasing the Eugen Jochum directed version.

Levine gets the balance between the joyous and profane just right, except for one thing. The movement in which the swan being roasted sings a lament over his plight is too beautiful: the bassoon solo (like that in Rite of Spring, which I'll bet is where Orff got the idea) is not supposed to sound pretty. If Orff had wanted a lyrical melody wafting cloud-like over the audience, he would have scored an English Horn or oboe, but he didn't. It's supposed to sound strained, even painful (which playing a bassoon in that register is). Similarly, the tenor singing the part works too hard to make it lovely, choosing a smooth falsetto rather than allow his voice to crack appropriately; he's supposed to sound like he's being roasted on a spit, not having his toes tickled.Still, in all other essentials it is fantastic, clean, powerful, breathtaking; it remains my favorite recording of the Carmina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Warranty","review":"I have been using about a week with no change to the settings, the display looks great.

It sends signals back that wake the computer back up. This is a big pain, as I put my computer to sleep all the time. 3) I have tried calibrating the monitor four times now.

Someone once remarked that the first movement of this work is a work of \\"lofty architecture\\" and I tend to agree with that description. Mutter's playing is very precise, and wonderful, especially in the high registers. Yes, perhaps there isn't much of her personality in it, but that's the Karjan way IMHO.

The vocals cross over from death growls, to behind-the-mix black metal shrieks, to gothic singing perfectly in sync with the rest of the band. There are very melodic passages, blinding death/black metal madness and even at times a tinge of electronica, but none of the elements ever overpower each other.

Cagney plays a short-tempered failed Broadway producer trying to make a comeback by putting on a spectacular musical at the well-known US military academy. For once, in a musical, the story was quite credible but it was rather let down by the music itself, but the singing and dancing were great - with Day, Nelson and Macrae, how could they not be.

The Chrsitian lyrics are not as boldly declarative as say Dc Talk's, Audio Adrenaline's and Newsboys' but are sure cleverly writen. Each track tells a story of it's own, some with fairy-tale overtones, most with biblical concepts. Good job, Sixpence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixpence sold out?","review":"How surprised ws I to hear them played all over pop radio. Great stuff! The video is great too, although should a christian girl be dressed like that? Kidding, she looks great!The music is playful and fun I enjoy it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW Incredible","review":"I've been waiting for this album for a long time now and I must say it was worth the wait. This group has vary talented musicians and incredible vocals. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you miss Throwing Muses and Belly...","review":"you'll like Sixpence. Although a very refined and mellow album there are faster songs, and not one bad. The whole album is good. I don't know if Kristin Hersh and Tanya Donnely of Throwing Muses influenced the singer, or they have someone they derive from, but her phrasing and the guitars sound similar. Very good on its own. Whispy and hooky and can't be put off as \\"Six Pants and None that fit her\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is my favorite of the CDs I've bought from online sources such as EBAY. I only paid $3.00 for it, but I would buy their new CD at full price if it is anything like this one. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This album is probably their best. Considering it has two of thier hit songs(kiss me, there she goes). I got interested in them in late 2002 hearing Don't Dream It's over on the radio. My sister told me it was by the group who sang kiss me. Then I did research. I bought Divine Discontent. Then Sixpence None The Richer, then Collage. All three are excellent! In this album which is probably my favorite I disliked We Have Forgotten and The Waiting Room; I thought they were so slow! but with all the excellent songs in this album it covered it up to give this album a shining five stars.You might recocnize some other songs on the radio like I Can't Catch You (it wasn't on that long!) I hope I have persuaded you into buying this excelent album from a rich in style group!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They looked like a one-hit wonder until...","review":"I searched all over the creation for this disc and finally found it in the Religious section of a local record store. I should have waited. Although I got a good deal, the version I purchased was without the later added \\"bonus track\\" \\"There She Goes\\". Listening to my version of the cd, Sixpence is a pretty good,lightly flavored band with just one song(\\"Kiss Me\\") that stands out . I'd recommend this cd for people who generally like light fare (The Sundays, The Innocence Mission, etc.) It's just too bad we sometimes get penalized for getting music early. Next time I'll wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album from the best Christian Band","review":"I first of Sixpence in April '99 when I heard Kiss Me. Then I heard There she Goes on the radio and I then wanted the album. I'm so glad I purchased because its great. Christian bands here where I live in Northern Ireland don't get much airplay on the radio, but its really good to hear Sixpence None The Richer. Absoloutely Brilliant!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T JUST LISTEN TO \\"KISS ME\\". THE ENTIRE CD ROCKS!!","review":"For those of us that purchase a CD for 1 song and refuse to listen to the rest of the selections, shame on you for doing that here. Sixpence shows exceptional versatility and has several more hits to come off of this CD. So, before you keep skipping to track 4, give tracks 5,7,9 and 11 a shot as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeper Sixpence","review":"If you expect every song to be bouncy like the popular \\"Kiss Me\\" single, you will be dissapointed. However, if you like soulful, deep music this could be the cd for you. The songs are slow and almost folkish. The lyrics are great. Matt Slocum is a genius and Leigh Nash's vocals do his writing justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is way OVER-RATED ! ! !","review":"Mostly dull repetition. What's \\"there she goes\\", give me a break. Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"Sixpence None the Richer was a cd I had back in the day and I am glad I threw it in the trash. Kiss Me and Love are the only decent tracks, the rest of the album is dreadful and forgettable. Don't waste your money on this lame fluff, you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"It blows chunks!","review":"Some christian band?!

My uncle, who knows nothing about popular misic, could do better! Dead people can make better songs! Besides, when you're searching for MP3's they always show up when you're looking for the real KISS! THis CD is a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was bland. The same jargon as all other female 'jewel' CD","review":"This CD was boring. The same happy-go-lucky female crack smoker music that has been heard on all of the top female albums lately. Such as Jewel(what's up with her teeth), Lisa Merchant, and liz phair. not to mention the entire Lilith Fair.This doesn't mean I don't like some female artists. Lisa Loeb, Sarah McLaughlin, and Tori Amos are awsome. But this album bit the big one."},{"rating":"1","title":"REPETIVE SHLOCK FROM A ONE HIT WONDER GROUP.","review":"There was \\"Kiss Me\\", a #2 smash in the US....Then the next single \\"There She Goes\\" which barely and I mean barely touched into the top 40 which is NOT EVEN ON THIS ALBUM!The lead singers voice just gets so grating - with no vocal range or change in her songs. Its like one big sleepfest on this CD.I am sorry but I really feel Sixpence won't get richer with this CD, and furthermore I will bet big money they will never have a hit again.I give them 2 stars because \\"Kiss Me\\" was original and refreshing....\\"There She Goes\\" was just a remake that was only remade because it fit the singers vocal range.There she goes.........losing her recording contract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Beat","review":"Okay, so I don't usually like this kind of music. But \\"Kiss Me\\" was catchy so I bought the album. Delighted to learn it's a Christian band; the lyrics weren't obviously Christian though. I know there's a lot of controversy over the issue of a Christian band singing a song like \\"Kiss Me\\" but at this point I don't really know what I think and I really like the cd. \\"There she goes\\" is pretty incomprehensible but I absolutely love the beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it a lot. Worth the purchase.","review":"The Sixpence None the Richer CD is very good. It has a solid beginning, quick but smooth transitions between tracks and a great finish. While I cannot say that I loved it, the leader singer has an angelic voice that makes the cd a necessary \\"must have\\" addition to one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I didn't have much what to expect when I bought this CD. Now I'm glad I did because all the songs of this album are great. My favs are \\"Kiss Me\\", \\"The Waiting Room\\", and \\"Moving on\\". Great female vocals! Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixpence worth a listen!","review":"The band Sixpence None the Richer is one of those 5 year overnight successes. The masses are finally finding out what some of us have known for a few years now,this band is great! Matt Slocum is a talented songwriter/guitar player. Leigh Nash has the voice of an angel and their songs actually say something. Which in these days is not all bad. Although the beautiful little ditty \\"Kiss Me\\" has won them global acclaim, the best song on the album is \\"Love\\". It has a wicked bass line and Nash really wails. I hope this is just the beginning of many years of general market success for Sixpence. If not they'll have plenty of treasures stored-up elswhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Kiss me Cd-single instead","review":"I saw all the reviews on this page and thought this will be a great cd. WRONG!! If you like Kiss me as much as I do you will be way disappointed in this cd. Kiss me is the only happy melodic song on the cd. The rest are to depressing...Save yourself 9 bucks and buy the cd-single. I wish I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd has no variety.","review":"On this cd all the songs sound the same and out of all those songs only one is any good or a hit and even it is getting old! If they put more variety into thier songs then they would be really good but it just sounds like a bunch of folk songs to me. But if that is what you like thats a good cd for you to get. But it just isn't my style."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't like there music at all","review":"well I think if sixpence is suppose to be a christian group then they need to show that they are christians.

They are about as annoying as The Cranberries, and the only thing they have going for them is their faith. Other than that I probably wouldn't bother writing anything positive. The second half of the 90's sucked musically, and this is one of the reasons why. \\"Kiss Me\\" is a drab love song that annoys not appeals. \\"There She Goes\\" is a cover of a faceless band that did this on the remake of \\"The Parent Trap\\", or is it the other way around....either way it stinks. I usually don't write anything bad about Christian music, but this is one exception as this is just blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzz.......","review":"Someone I knew always raved about how great 6 Pence was.

I am a musician and a songwriter -- I know what I'm talking about! For secular music, sure, it's probably \\"clean\\". But this \\"crap\\" is actually labeled a CCM group? You tell me what's \\"Christian\\" about lyrics dripping with discouraging disillusionment, and singers basing everything on feelings!! I got depressed just flipping through the disc (and no, I didn't buy it)! Groups like this not only make the few good CCM hits appear the same by lumping them all together; they also give Christians a bad rap! This is not what it's all about, people! I'm not dissing their stuff because it's trashy or needs a warning label -- the words are barely understandable at best! I'm bashing it because it shouldn't be called \\"Christian\\" when it's not. Even if you call a spade a spade, this group possesses virtually ZIPPO talent to begin with -- Leigh Nash has no place in a recording studio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is pretty good","review":"i think this song is pretty good.it's not one of my favorites but it's a nice lovie type song."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a perfect mix of music.","review":"There is something on this CD for lovers of all types of music. It's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rest of the world gets to enjoy the best album ever.","review":"Yes, Sixpence is a must for all who enjoy good quality music. If you like anything alternative (radiohead to rage) you will appreciate the amazing guitar and bass with wonderful vocals. I wish their were more bands of this caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly Unique","review":"Like most people, KISS ME drew my attention to this group and I was pleasantly surprised that the rest of the CD is equally as good. Not to draw comparisons, but their overall sound reminds me quite a bit of the Cardigans.I've since listend to their previous CD, THIS BEAUTIFUL MESS. It appears that the secret to their sudden success is that the SIXPENCE CD is musically much richer, with more instrumental variety. The group has always been strong lyrically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Really nice CD.

The book is easy to read and requires to previous education in Chinese History to enjoy.The only shortcoming of the book is that the story ends with the 1949 Revolution in China.

I am a serious ROL addict and I was completely disappointed by my purchase of this set. Its exactly the same as on the show, albeit a little longer episodes. They bleep cursing, they block all the nudity, just as if you were sitting home watching Vh-1. The 3rd disc is the only one with a few extras in it, however the nudity is still blocked there as well. I was completely unhappy because I know they must have hours upon hours of extra footage, and I wanted to see things you DIDNT see on the show. Candid segements of the girls hanging out, being naked, partying, being crazy. None of that is on here. There isnt even a decent dvd menu with chapter options. Youre only choice is to watch the episodes in their entirety. Perhaps they can revamp the whole thing for season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible and dangerous","review":"I have to say I am suprised people like this toy. I think its dangerous.

It shows how each country has its own challenge and demands so much effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting folk album","review":"I'm a huge fan of Steve Goodman. Just about anyone who's heard his his first studio album is. This isn't really live, as the title suggests, but rather each song was recorded without overdubs. There are actually a number of folk singers playing on the album (Goodman gets 3 songs), and the others are pretty good as well. This isn't Goodman's best work by far, but it is notable for the song \\"Chicago Bust Rag\\" which Goodman never recorded again, unlike \\"Eight Ball [Blues]\\" and \\"City of New Orleans.\\" Die-hard Steve Goodman should pick this up. As for the rest, look at this as a mixed folk album with a mixed bag of material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Consummate Recording of the Mozart Requiem","review":"I've got CD's of several productions of this work in my CD library, and have listened to a few more. To my way of thinking this is THE Mozart Requiem recording to have.

You decide. These three women are certainly representative of their times, the way The Group was representative of its time. The portraits are sympathetic, though by the end you'll have little empathy for Neely. Only one of the three women survive fame and fortune, and only by running away.Not to be missed if you're a fan of 20th Century popular fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Chick Lit","review":"Recalling an old story of the unknown author's hubby buying up gobs of her books to make her debut a bestseller, my curiosity wanted to know just how ameture it was.

Better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"both fun and sad","review":"This is an amazingly enjoyable, funny, and ultimately heartbreaking book which could only have been written by a show-business insider like Susann. We meet the three main characters as naive girls as they are just starting out in New York City trying to land the jobs (and the men) of their dreams. Through the rest of the book all three of them become wiser, more mature, and more bitter as they realize what will be required of them in order reach their goals. \\"Dolls\\" are the downers and uppers they begin to rely on along the way... a pop culture must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply hideous! Colossal waste of time!","review":"To encounter this book in 2007 is to be reminded why women needed a feminist movement to self-actualize and appreciate that they did not need a man to fulfill their destinies or validate their worth. The book is...tres yucky on other levels, as well. The writing has an adolescent twang that is grating and inescapable; the author's inability to render the characters with any depth results in cardboard facsimiles of characters that are not believable and impossible to care about; the circumstances the characters find themselves in are so utterly cliche as to be ridiculous. Enough already with the pills! This is even worse than \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" or \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" - my first and last forays into contemporary chick lit. What a bore! Campy? Creepy! Not even ironic. Moronic, perhaps. Back to the Goodwill bookshelf from whence you came, dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any generation","review":"I read this book in the mid-80's and again last month. I wanted to refreash my memory before starting the sequel Shadow of the Dolls. This book does not age and it is dificult to believe it was written so long ago! It is a story before its time, as you follow the lives of three young women and the men that fade in and out (and in) of their lives. They face hardships and challenges but always have each other. As with many female relationships, the women have their ups and downs with each other, but still manage to reach their goals and aspirations. The thing is, after they have realized their goals, they discover there is really not that many places to go after that but down. See who goes down, who stays on top and who rises back by picking up the sequal as well. A great beach book and vacation read.

I ordered it months ago but barely sat down to read it this past weekend. It loved it and I thought very well written for Susann's first novel. The characters are well developed and considerable emotion is evoked by their losses and triumph's. This is definately a \\"chick\\" book. I highly recommend it, that is if anyone dares to enter the \\"Valley of the Dolls\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"of all the material that i have read in the past i must admit that is has to be one of the most exhilarating books that i have had the opportunity to read in my life. although most of the events have no real relavence to my life i was still very intrigued by the accounts of those women. i feel that is has truly got to be one of the better written accounts of a less than luxorious life that i have read. i also haf the opportunity to review the movie that was made not too long ago about the account of jacuqeline susan's life which stared bette midler and nathan lane. the movei, although it did not fare too well in the movie theaters was very good. i recommend it to any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a captivating read","review":"Even though this book takes place long before I entered the new york dating scene, I found myself easily relating to Anne on so many levels!

Well, I somehow avoided this novel for my entire adult life up until now, probably because of the kitschy cover? I admit I had no idea what it was about. But I was missing out on a good thing all this time. What a fun, over the top, campy read! And quite a bit less shallow than today's \\"chick lit\\" anyhow. I felt connected to the three main female characters by the end of the novel. I was rooting for them, even the ones I loved to hate. Although I did feel sad that apparently women behaving badly to impress men who aren't worth it isn't the new phenomenon society likes to pretend it is. It was like watching a slow, screeching train wreck in the end, and left me depressed for a day or so after I put it down...and yet...I have to recommend it as a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a sweet dessert.....","review":"Valley of the Dolls is not a novel that's going to reveal some deep truth about the world or make you rethink some aspect of your being.

All of the characters are unlikeable. The men are either unapologetic cheaters or weepy cuckolds. The women are simply pathetic. They want fame, fortune, a man to worship them. And mostly, they all get what they want and then throw it away to drugs. None of characters grow or learn anything throughout the novel. I continued to read to the bitter end, hoping for some redemption somewhere, but alas, there was none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad (but not bad enough to be good)","review":"A huge disappointment!! I have loved the movie version of \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" for a long time. Admittedly, it is a BAD movie, but its camp sensibility and generally over-the-top style make it a classic of the \\"bad movie\\" genre.

Jacqueline Susann may not be John Steinbeck, but this book is the very epitome of a page-turner. It's interesting to watch as Neely, Jennifer and Anne go from wide-eyed teenagers to women of the world, beset with tragedies, triumphs, drugs, and scandal. Although this has nothing to do with the book, I cannot think of this novel without thinking of Sharon Tate, who played Jennifer in the movie, and her horrific end. She's the perfect Jennifer--beautiful, worldly, sexy, but incredibly sweet. As Anne said in the book, \\"Jennifer is sweet. Neely's sharp and bright, but she isn't sweet.\\" All the characters are fairly well drawn--Henry is wonderful and utterly believable; even Helen Lawson evokes your sympathy from time to time. Set aside some time for yourself, because you'll be oblivious to everything around you while you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Groovy, Campy Blast From The Past","review":"OK, I knew going in that this was not going to be great literature, but who would pick this up thinking it was? I remember seeing this on my aunt's bookshelf when I was little and being told \\"that's not for little girls...\\" -- no kidding! The matter of fact depictions of sex, drugs, booze, abortion, adultery, gold-digging and betrayal are rather tame by today's standards, but I can imagine this was pretty provocative stuff in it's day. Still, even as I laughed at the melodramatic, stilted writing (the dialogue is unbelievable) I was hooked and finished the book in about 3 days.

OK, so I thought that the out-dated, corny dialogue was charming. But after 100+ pages of Anne, who is perhaps the dullest character ever created, I was ready to set fire to this thing. But I kept on, because I thought surely it must get better. People love this book! Nope. The characters are so painfully cliche and the situations not at all believable. Quite frankly, I was bored to tears. I think people just give it rave reviews because it is such a cult classic. Honestly, it's[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Compositions, Poor Sound Quality Recordings For This Era","review":"I really like U2 compositions, but I haven't been able to get a CD with their classic singles that has a clear, rich sound quality. They should record again their best classical singles or just release a Live Concert CD (not only the DVDs). I love their interpretations at Slane Castle Concert, but the CD is impossible to acquire these days. The rest of their concerts are only out on DVD... when you hear their studio recordings from the 1980's, it just doesn't sound good enough compared to the sound you can appreciate with a live recording today on any CD. So if they're still capable of playing their songs, then please let us hear them in rich digital sound on a CD and not re-release their same old recordings that sound pretty flat and weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a U2 beginner","review":"As a diehard U2 fan who has all their albums, plus the 2 previous best ofs, there was no way I'd buy this for myself.

It also includes a few bonuses...songs you may not have heard...and those tracks definitely add to the collection.Usually I find at least one thing I don't like about an 'album'...but in this case, I have nothing to complain about. And if you grab this at the special price, 18 fantastic U2 songs in one package is a steal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Ok, where is \\"Even better than the real thing\\"? where's \\"Lemon\\" (the remix)? I can't find \\"Who's gonna ride your wild horses\\". Does this cd have \\"Bad\\" on it? Where's the classic \\"When love comes to town\\"? \\"All along the watchtower\\" was a good tune, but this cd doesn't have it. I am also very surprised that this cd doesn't have \\"Angel of Harlem\\". \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" (live version) was great but it's no where to be found on this cd. Granted the singles are on here, but if I can recall, \\"Even better...\\" and \\"Angel..\\" were singles.

They will continue to release rubbish and tour for it til they die; and people will continue to buy it and call it great. I do notsay these things because I do not like U2; but I will not follow any band, no matter how much I like them, if they start to release mediocre albums. Rumor has it that they almost broke up after R&H, and in my opinion they should have. Their first 5 albums are great, Achtung Baby was okay, and it just goes down the toilet from there. If U2 or Island records want to cash in on this music again, they need to get with the times and remaster their back catalog or even remix some things in 5.1 surround. The dvd companion of this compilation would be marginally worth it if the videos are in surround; but I have not heard that this is the case. Move on people!

HOWEVER, my excitement was short-lived!I don't know if the marketing team for this group could actually be so ignorant or if they just couldn't bother rewarding their long-time die-hard fans with a TRULY Best of Hits Collection! So, now on to the crux of my plight... In lieu of tracks 8, 15, 16, 17 & 18, they should have at the very least included \\"I Will Follow\\" & \\"Angel Of Harlem\\"! Others, such as \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\" & \\"Zooropa\\" would have been bonuses!In FACT, the particular song line up on this CD has cost it countless sales, for the simple absence of some of its timeless gems being replaced with some NO name of songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's a great compilation","review":"I've been a U2 fan for years, but not enough of a fan to collect all their stuff, so I've been waiting for a hits CD like this one to come out for a while now.Very nice job.

The only song that has been difficult to track down is the awesome demo version of \\"Aneurysm\\" on the Teen Spirit single, which they are now releasing on the new box set. The single set is almost as bad an example of branding and repackaging as Nirvana's 2002 album aptly titled...Nirvana; Kurt is spinning in his grave. Maybe if they included ALL of the singles it would be a better gem, but save your money for the new box set, kids. I've seen the track list and it shot up to number one on my Christmas list. By the way Kurt didn't kill himself, so bugger off with all the selfish talk. 'Who did?' you may ask...I don't know, but I think Courtney does. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chance to listen some (really good) B-Sides","review":"This is one of the boxed sets that you must own if you call yourself a lover of Nirvana's MUSIC, not the Nirvana's fashion. The box contains all singles released by Nirvana, including the A-and-popular-sides, but also some B-Sides and live versions that do of you a slave when hearing. The way you stay imprisoned and appreciates the good music is something. Anyway, I paid 40 reais on this box, what equals around 12 dollars.

An overly offensive spoof that tries to hard at what it does, Boll's Blubberella is extreme badness, but surprisingly watchable here and there. Using the same scenes, actors, and sets from BloodRayne 3, Boll presents the tale of an obese human/vampire (Lindsay Hollister) as she fights Nazis and her own girth. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it definitely isn't, sometimes you'll just hang your head in shame and wonder just why you're watching this. All that aside however, there's been much worse to come out of Uwe Boll over the years, but chances are if you're reading this review on this page for this movie, then you already know what you're in for with Blubberella.

The time has come for him and having the opportunity to watch him in Caracas I could reaffirm my opinion about him.His gelid approaches sin of lack of humbleness.

In English,other variants are \\"Boy Castaways\\", \\"Two Year Holiday\\", \\"TwoYear's Vacation\\", \\"A Two Years' Vacation\\", \\"Adrift in the Pacific\\", etc.The \\"Adrift\\" part is misleading, since most of the book the boys areactually on land. I have also heard of this book being published intwo volumes: #1 Adrift in the Pacific, and #2 Two Year's Holiday.In any case the story is about a group of boys on a ship that hasdrifted away from her dock and they are blown across the globe to an islandoff South America. Unlike Mysterious Island, there is no Civil War,no adults, no scientist like Cyrus Harding, etc. so there are manymore differences than similarities.

It works great for flip phones, I know that. The only downside that I have experienced is that when you sweat, it slips down your arm unless you have it strapped on tight. When it is strapped on tight, it may inhibit bloodflow or cause a heat rash if you are performing rigorous manual labor. I think its an excellent product though based on my experience. I've been using it for a few weeks now and it is very durable. It is also machine washable, which is good since the material absorbs sweat and skin.

The best example I can give for the instructional style is this: If you were teaching someone how to drive, would you just tell them that the brake pedal makes you slow down and the accelerator makes you speed up? The book is like that in many places, talking about how button 'x' does 'x', without ever explaining WHAT 'x' is or WHY you might want to use it.

Cotrubas sings a touching, vulnerable Violetta with a nice coloratura-technique even though she wasn't a true Belcantista (She never tackled Lucia etc.) but she's unforgettable in Act II, III and IV. This creamy, Romanian sound fits Violetta like a glove. Domingo may sound a bit mature and too masculine for her young lover Alfredo Germont but he sings him ardently and well.

Her bad jokes that are funny 1/10 times really kill the flow of the show as well. Samantha caters to the soccer moms of America but is more concerned about staying in a fancy hotel and getting a fancy dinner than actually learning about her surroundings. She spends way too much time talking up her hotel & eating rather than showing us more sites or offering any kind of history or background of the area. Just like getting half a meal at a restaurant and wondering what happened, Samantha Brown's programs seem way too short and leave the viewer longing for more information, creating more unanswered questions.

I saw places selling new ones over $100. They look brand new. The noise reduction,(nothing cancels all noise)is better than my previous ones. The real test is when I get on a diesel tractor this summer. They fold flat but the other models folded once more at the top of the headband making them even more compact. The real test is long time comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphone noise","review":"Bought these headphones about 3 weeks ago and have found that I can only wear them for about 15-20 minutes max. The NR feature has a high pitch tone that drives me nuts when there is no music playing. When music is playing I can tolerate it for a little while. I have found that using the headphones with the NR feature off is a little more comfortable for me but the headphones do tend to push hard against your head getting very uncomfortable for long play listening. They do produce a nice sound if you can overlook these two things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"i've had a pair for about a year and always take them on flights, which is the only time I use them. As with all noise cancelling headphones, they remove only the low whoosh of the airplain noise, but this makes a huge difference. When I first used them, my ears got sore after about an hour, but now I can wear them for five hours without any discomfort. They have been very durable and the battery seems to last forever, or at least longer than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"I rate the Sony Headphone as a 4.The performance is very good.Clarity was outstanding.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the headphone ear pads make your ears sweat,and the adjustment can be a little more easier to adjust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I need it to do","review":"These headphones, while not the quality of a Bose (and certainly not the price!) do just what I ask. They cancel outside noise fairly nicely and produce a nice sound from my iPod. In addition, the headpieces turn so that they lie flatter than if they were 'regular' headphones.Worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They hiss and are tight.","review":"I really like the sound quality of these earphones, however, when noise canceling is on, there is an audible hiss. The hiss is almost more annoying than the noise. I haven't used these on an airplane, just in an office with a refrigerator, fluorescent lights and a lot of computers. Also, these start to hurt my ears after about half an hour because they are tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing (over 13 but did not want to give my name)","review":"I just bought the sony \\"noise-canceling\\" headphones at the local apple store after reading some good reviews. However, I found the noise-canceling feature to be extremely disappointing. When the feature was turned on, the only difference was an audible hissing noise. There was some reduction in ambient sound, but no more than with the feature turned off to begin with. However, the headphones themselves are fairly comfortable and have a fair sound, aside from the poor noise-canceling feature. I am extremely disappointed and plan to return the headphones for another pair of a different brand. I do not recommed buying these headphones unless you have the option of testing them and returning them after opening the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony vs Bose QC2","review":"I bought these and used them for a year, then received the Bose QC2 as a present. They Bose (around the ear) are much more comfortable and seem to do a much better job of cancelling the noise. The Sony are hard on the top of the head and their ambient white noise seems noticeably higher and distracting than the Bose.I know there's a 10-1 price difference, but I ended up not using the Sony pair much, even before I got the Bose, because they are just not that comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I originally bought these at a local Wal-Mart to take on a trip to Jamaica...well after the trip I decided to return them. Why?The noise cancelling didn't work up to expectations. I've tried other noise cancelling systems that worked as well or better than these, for a lesser price (price was around $60 when I first tried them). Someone mentioned a \\"hissing\\"...I noticed the same thing. After a minute your ears will adjust to it, but if you're sensitive, it can give you a headache.The bass response was also a lot weaker than I had hoped for.Bottom line: If you want sound quality, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work well on airplanes but...","review":"These headphones made a huge difference when I tried them on airplanes. That must be what they're specifically designed for. Even without music playing, you can no longer hear the plane's engine with the headphones switched on. I closed my eyes and even missed the flight attendants' offering me a drink!They performed less well on buses and trains: they made a slight difference on a noisy subway. The sound quality is pretty good, not great. However, the volume from one of the ears was noticably louder than the volume from the other ear--I confirmed this with several friends. This got very annoying with certain songs. I suspect the pair I received was defective.They're not comfortable, not uncomfortable. My ears were a little sore after a few hours of wearing them, but it wasn't too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to the Bose","review":"The are great head phones for the price. I read alot of complaints about hiss and fit. I did try the $300 Bose and they have the same faint hiss and a little better noise canceling when no music is playing. While music is playing I could not tell difference between the two. When I first put these on they hurt my ears after a few minutes but I simply switched them around (left side on right side) and it feels perfect (slept with them on for 3 hours, no pain). I could not justify the incremental cost for the Bose, it's just not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"service is good but tedious...trouble getting refund on postage","review":"I really have no complaint about the item, except one of them I bought had a little problem, and the service was great in getting me another one.

I was hoping that the noise cancellation would work well cancelling the lawnmower noise. It helps. That is, it is better than the iPod earphones, but barely.

Powered by a AAA battery, it just \\"hums\\" out background noise and in the process decreases sound quatlity. Uncomfortable as well.

It is accessible, no doubt about it, but it has no consistency. It starts fairly well and after 1 hour of flight, it is clumsy, undistinguished sound. Definetely not worth. Fortunately it doesn't cost like a Bose, but it has nothing to do with a Bose. Ergonomics also is a failure. Battery life a question mark, you never know. It hurts the ears after a while. Worst of all, NO GOOD SOUND QUALITY. Even without ambience sound like air travel. Even sitting on a temple, without anyone around, sound does not convince. I do not recommend it at all, although it is low cost. Buy I would recommend it only if in an emergency. BUt remember, it won't last. Everyday it passes it gets worse. Very short useful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise Canceling headphones","review":"I'm sorry to say that I am disappointed in this product. I had read reviews favorably comparing it to the Bose noise canceling headphones andI believed this to be a less expensive alternative. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I expected that all outside noise would be'canceled' and it certainly is not; noise doesn't even seem to be greatly reduced. I don't believe a product should label itself \\"Noise Canceling\\" unless it truely does what it says. Now I feel I must at least try the Bose in order to judge for myself. I'm sorry I did not return this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Foldable but good any how.","review":"These head phones do not fold up as stated. I will tolerate that only because for open ear style headphones they work great and were very comfortable. I finally heard an in flight movie without that background hiss from the aircraft. I hate closed ear style headphones. For the price these are definetly a good deal. They would have been 5 stars if they folded up for travel. Oh and the battery on the side does not hit your head it does look that way. These were comfortable for me on a 6 hour trip. 1 movie and several CD's to destination. Sound quality is very good, could use a touch more bass. Overall these are much better than the price, a really good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a fair warning: do not buy this set!","review":"Instead of canceling noise these headphones add a hissing white noise. It's even hard to say if the cancellation works at all. Something changes with the sound when you flick the switch, but the level of outside noise seems to remain the same. The battery box \\"strategically\\" placed on the inside of the headband will continually remind your sore skull that it is there.Whoever worked for Sony on designing this set should be made immediately available for employment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product - best price","review":"The product arrived in just a few days and in excellent shape.

Here are the very first things I checked for:1. Comfort - These have got to be the most painful set of headphones I've ever owned. If you wear glasses, be prepared to feel throbbing pain after about 30 minutes. Even without glasses, these phones lack a soft earcup, so be prepared to bleed a little.2. Bass - Where's the bass? Even after adjusting and tweaking equalizer settings, I could not get any bass out of this headset.3. Noise reduction? I found no difference at all, other than hearing a slight hiss when turning on the noise cancelling feature.I will be purchasing a new set of phones, and won't be afraid to spend a few more dollars -Overall? - dissappointed -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I'm not one to complain but...

Probably the best on the market for the price. I bought a refurbished headphone with no problems. The plug, wire are under designed and will not take a lot of abuse. The head bar is plastic, and feels like it could break. I broke my pair at where the plug goes into the Mp3 player. Knowing now that it is a very breakable product, I would not take it to the gym, or work outdoors in the yard with it.I switched to a cheaper, but stronger headphone to wear to the gym, and to do my gardening work.

The second I put these on, I started feeling like I was travelling at high-altitude. My ears started popping, there was a horrible whooshing sound, and I felt pressure in my ears. It was horrible! Worst of all, the sound quality was mediocre and I didn't experience any noise cancelling--only a loud whooshing sound that blocked out a little bit of low frequency sound.My advice: try these out before you buy them. They were highly recommended to me, so the results may depend on the individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"Not worth the money for sure.

When the 'noise-cancelling' switch is on, it has great depth to the sound, however there is one MAJOR problem - it actually enhances noises such as radio signals, wind, and any kind of percussive sound around me (like banging or clicking). It is very annoying. I listen to most music WITHOUT the noise-cancelling on because the other noises are so distracting. The ONLY thing that is good is that noise-cancelling headphones tend to brake easily, and these are sturdy, however, I don't really use them, so I'd actually be happier if they broke so I'd have an excuse to buy new ones.

It feeds you white noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the bargain price","review":"I bought these because I wanted to get a relatively decent pair of headphones with noise cancellation for a reasonable price. What I got was a piece of crap for which I would'nt pay $5. It does not cancel any noise, and is very uncomfortable on the ears. I had to take it off out of discomfort just 3 minutes after putting them on, though I would have taken them off after 4 out of sheer disgust. The sound quality is pretty good, provided you don't turn the cancellation feature on and are forced to listen to it running. So if all you want to do is listen to music without sound cancellation in increments of a few minutes each, it's not a bad buy. Otherwise, don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed good, but broke quickly","review":"From what I can discern from other reviews, these headphones break easily. After a couple months of having them, the noise stopped working in one earphone completely. I didn't drop them or mess up the plug or anything, it just stopped working completely. I went to the Sony website and it will cost me 24 dollars to exchange these headphones NOT for a completely new pair (which might be worth it) but for some other old pair that they've received from some other unfortunate person like myself and fixed.

No noise cancelling adjustment (besides on/off). The noise-cancelling isn't very effective compared to other headsets I've tried -- including no-name brands.

The friction with your ears isn't enough to hold it in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality headphones","review":"I'm no audiophile, but I can tell when headphones are just horrible, and these definitely aren't. Bass, mid, and treble seem well balanced and even without the noise canceling on they still do a pretty good job of keeping noise out.The noise canceling is the only issue I have with the headphones. Although it's very good at taking out most noise ranges (I've never had a pair of headphones, including these, do well on the high pitches), it definitely creates some strong hissing. At least it's not variable with the music volume so when the music's loud you can't hear it at all, but it's very annoying on during the quiet parts, which is when you need the noise canceling the most. :(Still, these headphones are a good deal and the price would be fair with no noise canceling at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I bought these headphones because I work in a cubicle office environment and wanted to reduce the noise around me.

I can still clearly hear people talking, phones ringing, and people typing around me. It seems like these headphones only reduce the ambient noises.The headphones when turned on seem to introduce a static sound, that while listening to music is ok, but when listening to audio books or podcasts is somewhat distracting.I might have been expecting more out of the headphones then what they were designed for. I am going to return them when I go back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Junk Junk","review":"I recently bought these at an airport at list price. They cancel absolutely nothing.

I bought them for a plane trip, and even if I could stand the pain of wearing them for very long (they press very hard against your ears), there is nothing noise-canceling about them. My 10 dollar earbuds block out more noise than these. Honestly, sometimes I think people will fall for anything-- I think Sony just put \\"noise-canceling\\" on the label so they could charge more. And with some folks, if you say it is so it must be so I guess.This is my first and only venture into the noise-canceling headphone arena, but my guess is that if you want headphones that actually do that you're going to have to go with something in the 200+ dollar range."},{"rating":"1","title":"White noise used for noise reduction","review":"I am actually Steve's wife.

After much research I found these Sony headphones. For the price, i think they do exactly what they are supposed to. Don't get tricked by the \\"noise canceling\\" feature though. This means that it gets rid of low pitched noises like plane engines or air conditioners. They don't cancel out people talking or high pitched movie sounds. Of course, if your looking for amazing quality, deep bass, or anything along these lines, you should buy Bose headphones or something more expensive.

But it will lessen it quite a bit and my music comes across crystal clear. I can't imagine spending $300 on Bose when I can get these for $40 and be just as satisfied. I AM very much into music and I'm particular about quality of sound and I'd recommend these to the most persnickety music listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica. Additionally, these are very picky about how they are positioned on your ears -- it has to be Just So to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just ok","review":"I don't particularly like the fit. It's a little straight over the top of the head and is a little iritating. When you turn on the noise reduction feature it enhances the sound which is really nice however, the noise reduction must work on a microphone feedback to some extent because when the wind blows it's noisy in the head set. It does not reduce the surrounding noise of mowers and such to any extent to where its useable. I do like the sound though and if you're just working around the yard or in a room it's fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent noise cancelling","review":"I bought these for the noise cancelling and I am very pleased with them for the price.

They are supposed to cancel low frequencies only, which means that all noise of conversations, PA announcements and so on come through as if you had no phones on. In the low frequencies, such as airplane engine noise, they are ineffective as well.I have no opinion on their performance as headphones per se, since I bought them for airplane travel noise cancellation.I was forced by the review form to give this product one star, but in my opinion it is worth zero stars.They also take up quite a bit of room, which these days of restricted carry-on on airplanes, is another disadvantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little noise canceling, terrible fit","review":"I just received the Sony MDR-NC6 Noise-Canceling Headphones today.

All of my Sony headphones died the same way. The right earphone stops working. The only difference with this model, is that it makes a deafening loud squeal before it dies. Regardless of what the problem is, its not worth the cost to repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were just OK - not great - then they stopped working","review":"I got these to use on the train to work everyday so the fact that the sound was average was OK with me because noise canceling can only do so much.

They always want to know what I think of them, and invariably they always discuss their disappointment with the model. They have the same criticisms I do:(1) There is a problem with the headphone jack. The wires seem to short out very easily. Several other people I've spoken with have had the same problem.(2) The noise-cancelling feature works great on man-made noises such as train and bus engines, but it actually makes some noises WORSE. When the wind blows, for example, the sound is multiplied by the microphones, and the music becomes completely inaudible. They're also useless for sounds such as snoring.As far as headphones go, they're ok, not fabulous.

That being said, it gets worse. I am on my third set after returning two to Wally-world because of defects at the time of manufacturing. One set was DOA the minute I opened the box and the other worked fine for about 3 weeks. Luckily, I saved my receipt and now I am stuck with a non-working set. The headphones do work when they are not defective, but the noise cancellation is not even close to a Bose headphone. I guess you get what you pay for.I can't recommend these to anyone. They are cheap, have very short lifespan, don't really work that well and are cheap... oh, I did mention they are cheaply made didn't I?Save your money and get something that may cost a bit more but offer more to you.

You pay more for the noise canceling feature and in reality its not very good. Just sounds like static to me. Overall I think the quality of these headphones is less than satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word- spectacular","review":"To give some background, I've always had a preference toward the behind the neck type of headphones that do not go into the ear. WIth that said I can say that I'm a convert. As just plain headphones the sound quality is great and the ear coverage allows for outside sounds to be muffled better than what I'm used to. My only complaint is that after continuous wear, my head started to get a bit sore where the headphones were resting. But then comes the sound-canceling feature (one I've never experienced before), which is excellent. I have used these headphones for both car trips and flights and I'm amazed at how spectacular this feature is. The hum of the car engine or the low roar from the plane was neutralized for as long as I kept the noise-canceling on. So far I've used the feature for at least 20 hours and it's still on it's single AAA, so I would say these babies have good power consumption. Too bad they don't cancel out the noises from annoying passengers :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, but poor noise cancellation","review":"I fly a LOT for work and was looking for some good noise cancelling headphones without spending a fortune. I have a lot of Sony products so thought I would give these a try. These were comfortable to wear on long flights but the noise cancelling was really poor. I returned these and instead have the sennheiser PXC250. I've only had them a short time but they seem pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you fly with a laptop, this is a MUST!","review":"I was looking for a less expensive option than a $300 Active Noice Cancelling set. This works perfectly. Previously using a decent plain open air set, I could not hear the words on DVD's while on a plane unless I pushed the set hard against my ears. With these, I don't have that problem anymore. They are not designed to eliminate ALL background noise, so don't expect them to do that. I'd say about half the noise level of not wearing them, but that is all I need to be able to hear words clearly on DVD. On one flight when I sat in the back of the plane (right next to the engines), I left them on (but not plugged in to anything) just for the noise reduction.The hiss everyone is talking about is minimal, and the background noise is significantly eliminated vs. not using these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiss and throbbing noises","review":"I cannot recommend these headphones.I do quality assurance for a living and pay attention to details. I gave this model of headphones (Sony MDRNC6) a try about a year ago and found the following, using a brand new battery (actually I tried several batteries):Headphones off: I hear background noise (to be expected) and music sounds good when played.Headphones on: Background noise lessens (good), but at the same time a high-frequency hiss and a low-frequency throbbing are introduced (not good). These hiss/throb sounds were not part of the background noise and I heard these even when using the headphones in a quiet location, when the headphones were plugged into a MP3 device and when they were not, when music played and when it was not playing. When the music played, turning the headphones on added a hiss and throbbing to the music.I found the hiss annoying and the throbbing disturbing. I cannot recommend these headphones based on these findings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work great, but a pain on the ears","review":"I bought these specifically for business traveling, but find that I can only tolerate these earphones for an hour on the plane. They work very well in noise-cancelling, but then they start to hurt my ears after only an hour! Plus, they aren't as compact as I had hoped. The ear pieces swivel inward, but the band doesn't fold at all. That means they're still a bulky item to bring with you. If I had known these things from the start, I wouldn't have gotten them. My next earphones will have those cushioned cups that enclose the ears- those look so much more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but could be better","review":"I like the fact that these headphones don't have background noise when the noise cancelling feature is off (unlike some others I tried). I don't think these headphones do a good job at reducing noise much less cancelling it out but the sound quality is pretty good for the price. I think they fit my head pretty well and the headphones have a nice long cord (5'9\\" I believe). The earpieces rotate so that the headphones can flatten but they don't truly fold up to a smaller size. The batteries also don't last as long as some of the competitors (~30 h life span instead of 50 h). I just wish they did a better job reducing background noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"These may have been defective, I'm not sure, but they didn't do the job.

BUT there is no well for your ears so the foam pads press your ears flat and for extended wear (as in anything more than about 30 minutes) they hurt. The battery compartment also presses against your head. It doesn't matter how great the sound quality is if you can't wear these for more than 30 min at a time.I expected more from Sony. This is the first time I've been really disappointed with a Sony product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm convinced you need to have the headphones totally cover your ears in order for the noise cancelling to be effective.These headphones allow too much outside noise (I'm talking subway) to reach your ears even with the noise cancelling on.Yeah I hear a difference,these headphones introduce a hissing sound when turned on and boosts the volume to drown out outside noise.Google some professional reviews on this and you'll see they shoot it down.Save your money.I'm giving these to my nephew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I tested this item at Sony store before purchasing it online. I am extremely happy and satisfied with this headphones. I use it alot when I'm at work (to avoid noise and hear personal conversation) and also when I am on public transportation. The sounds and especially the bass, which I like, are great. I cannot wait to use this when I'm on vacation (airplane). The only con: since it is new, my ears get sore (squished) after awhile but I think it will be ok if I continue to use it. I highly recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not great","review":"I bought these for the office b/c I work in a cube. The sound is good, but they are not comfortable (the padding is very thin and cheap) and they do not block out as much noise as I had hoped. I also bought a pair of the Audio Technica over the ear headphones and those are far superior to the Sony headphones. Yes, they are more expensive, but well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work well...until they break","review":"I used these on three air trips until on the 4th one they suddenly started delivering low-volume, distorted sound. This happens both with the noise cancelling on and off, and with any type of source (iPod, computer, etc.) Basically they are now unusable. True, I didn't pay Bose prices but I'd still expect any set of headphones to last more than 4 uses. I believe this is more evidence that Sony quality has dipped significantly compared to years past. I would recommend saving your money and buying a higher quality product--at least one that will last more than a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible all around","review":"I found these headphones uncomfortable to wear, they add noise instead of canceling it, and after very minimal usage, the right headphone just stopped working.

A loud AC is the perfect noise for noise canceling technology since it is so invariant. These earphones simply change the nature of the sound while giving your ear the impression of being buffeted. I would recommend getting something else.The bass is a little weak, but on the whole the music reproduction isn't bad, except for the uncomfortable feeling of listening to loud music without actually hearing loud music.Also, the battery compartment presses up against the top of my head which makes it doubly uncomfortable to wear.On the plus side, it comes in a nice little bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swivel ear cup broke shortly after I purchased them","review":"I barely remember how well these worked. Within a week or so the swivel on one of the ear cups, the metal broke. No way of possibly repairing them. In my opinion poor design.

They get uncomfortable on me after a while. Problem I and other have is that they break easily. In my case, the speakers work, but the noise-cancelling function is disengaged unless I twist the right phone so that it is at a 90-degree angle to my ear. Not really easy to use like that! The wiring connection inside this right channel must be bad, as the reviews here and elsewhere cite many problems with the right speaker. I used to think of Sony as a quality company, but my experiences with their stuff over the lat 10 years has caused me to rate them just above Radio Shack, and that's not saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Would Expect From a Sony Product... :(","review":"Typically I love Sony products second only to BOSE but in this case I was greatly disappointed.

Oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product","review":"Very disappointed with these headphones. After 1 week of using with my ipod, the right side stopped working. I returned to Amazon and they graciously gave me another product (expedited). The noise canceling was not very good but I lived with it. Now after a few more months, it is again not working properly...for songs, you can no longer hear lead vocals, just the instrumentation and background vocals. For audio books, there is no sound at all. It's weird and I'm baffled. Don't think it's user error, as there are no settings on the headsets. Even cheapy headphones that I've had for years still work. I used these for running so maybe they were not meant for that?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched product, way too much bass.","review":"I had to fiddle with all of my sound settings just to make them semi-acceptable and I've never had to do that with any speakers or headphones I've owned, ever.

Comfortable to wear and light weight these headphones are worth every cent. Given headphones wear out (especially around the ears) I believe you cant go wrong with these. While traveling from hotel room to hotel room they sure help keep the noise down especially when your room is by the elevators. The audio sound is good for capturing the highs and the lows. Overall I believe these will serve you well in canceling 80% of the noise around you.A great value for the price and performance is well above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all","review":"They're heavy, no head padding, and noise-cancelling works but the white noise is too loud for my taste.

They are great for the money and worth buying.Pros: A clear value and comfortable enough for a couple of hours wear at a time.Cons: A little bulky compared to Bose QC3 and the headphone bag doesn't offer any protection. Not as quiet as Bose QC2.Don't let the comparisons with Bose discourage you. If you have a few hundred dollars to spend on headphones and you use them all the time, go with Bose.

I'll only present the two most egregious ones:1.Incredibly, the author doesn't seem to realize that the probability of a major adversity (as defined in the book) is greater than or equal to the probabilty of a minor adversity. This restricts the applicable section of his model.2.The slope for determining profitable trades (according to the author's model) is given by (w+x)/(y-x). By choosing x arbitrarily close to y the slope can be infinite.Conditions 1 and 2 imply that a profitable trade on any and all stocks can be made under any market conditions with no risk whatsoever.This inept, incompetent book is so bad that it casts doubt upon the entire line of technical books from Wiley and Sons and their editorial process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, Wrong, Oversimplified...","review":"The author confuses game theory with decision theory. The model has nothing related with game theory in it. The author defines the whole market as a game between the speculator and the remaining market, but does not take the remaining market's (the second player's) utility into consideration. Therefore the market's strategies are not utility-dependent but history-dependent which contradicts with the notion of game theory. This makes the model a simple choice selection of the speculator from just two alternatives faced with a market-move guess, not an equilibrium analysis as should be in a game-theoretic approach. Simply DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY by buying this book, and if you don't know much about game theory, don't read this book even if it was for free as you will misunderstand what game theory is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over simplifying...","review":"I bought that book on the previous \\"don't buy this book\\" review.

My only question is how long it will be before the techniques discribed in this book are discounted by the markets. Fortunately, if you have been banging your head on statistics, time series analysis, neural nets, genetic algorithms, etc. with respect to the markets as long as I have, certain embellishments to the logical principles explained in this work will suggest themselves. In this I take some comfort. I also take some comfort in the fact that not many will recognize these ideas for what they truly are. Congratulations and kudos to Ronald B. Shelton on this work.

He uses the dry erase markers&the chalk but he especially loves the paper roll to paint! He spends hours drawing & having us draw with him-I especially like the shelf, we have separate little tubbies with lids that we keep everything in-when he is going to be there for days it is all right there on the shelf for him to get out & put back when he is done with it-I do agree with some of the others the paint cups are really of no use because you can buy such nice paint kits, but that is the only negative thing about the whole easel-I would definitely buy it again & it is a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!!","review":"I ordered this easel for my 2-year old.

And here on Amazon, I came across this CD (my album is long gone)... as soon as I heard the first track sample, it all came back, and I realized I now like this CD as much as the \\"polished and refined\\" sound of Urubamba (not that I wouldn't buy an Urubamba CD in a heartbeat, but I can't find it anywhere!).

What's up Amazon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sensationalist for my taste","review":"While the encouragement this book provides to return to the sacraments and pray the rosary daily is something I'd never argue with, I was disappointed in the book nonetheless. First of all, they badly needed an editor - the same material is presented over and over, and they slip into a \\"National Enquirer\\" style that I found annoying. More importantly, \\"Thunder\\" relies far too heavily on unapproved private prophecy, and fails to adequately defend its position in light of Scripture and Tradition. For a far better work on the same subject, read Desmond Birch's \\"Trial, Tribulation, and Triumph\\". It's meticulously researched and relies on approved private prophecy only as an ancillary source."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a tool to save souls.","review":"This book absolutely scared the heck out of me. What if everything that I learned in Catholic school was really true? What if there really is a Blessed Mother and she has been appearing on earth to warn her children to come back to her Son, Jesus? What if you really *are* supposed to be saying the Rosary?This book does the best job I've seen in looking at the \\"big picture\\". It finds the common thread in all of the messages from the appearances of Mary throughout the world. How can an illiterate peasant child in Spain say the same things as a young pagan native in Rwanda? Answer: They both saw the same \\"Lady\\".An absolutely awesome book that will help you to wake up your loved ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution!","review":"Please take much of this information with a grain of salt. The author did not have the authority of the Church on this book.

I also question the motives of this author by following suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't for you if you want Mary's REAL message!","review":"This was the first book I ever read on Marian apparitions. It almost turned me off to the real message of Mary. The book spends almost all its pages outlining horrible visions, i. e. destruction of the earth, three days of darkness with demons swirling all over the place, the Antichrist, and on and on and on until you're scared half out of your mind. Some of this stuff is so disheartening that I wondered, what exactly is the point they're trying to make? They spent too much time on these fatalistic visions and a lot of negativity instead of focusing on the real point: turn back to God and pray often. Read the Wayne Weible books on Medjugorje if you want to understand the true meaning behind Marian apparitions. His books were truly uplifting. These authors do nothing more than scare you and make you feel powerless to stop these nightmarish events. That's not the point of Mary coming here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholics don't need end-time books like this...","review":"I found this book to be offensive to my intellect as an active Catholic.

It has heavy duty Religion, resurrections from the dead, spontaneous healing and even the \\"second coming, I think. \\"Lazarus\\" comes back from the dead and \\"Abraham\\" offers to sacrifice his son. It also has thermonuclear war, exploding space stations, exploding missiles, exploding submarines, exploding aircraft, exploding buildings, exploding cars, exploding people and a nude scene. It has aliens (or is it God?) and their space crafts. Mountains explode and buildings crumble. Thousands are killed and numerous running gun battles. It has more Armageddon than the Book of Revelations. OK special effects. If the \\"actors\\" would have been computer generated too, it would have improved the film.

The first one was quite good, and had depth and spirituality to it. This one was just empty troop movements and pointless gunfights with no coherent plot behind them.

Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epoch Sequel: Evolution","review":"Pretty good for a sequel. Unexpected and unnecessary nudity at the beginning when the main character enters a \\"cat house\\" to hide. No nudity by the playmate supporting actress.

The nylon felt so cheap and terribly made I returned it. I had a guess brand bag that had better nylon than it by far. You expect the prada bag to have superior quality for the expensive name brand. I only paid $50 but it had a crooked prada logo outside of the bag and a bubble with chipped off paint of the prada logo inside of the bag. Because it was so cheaply made I question the authenticity of the bag since I had compared it to a real prada bag. However, if you're looking for a small black prada bag that can fit a cell phone, wallet, keys, and a small pack of tissue that just has the prada logo slapped on but may not be authentic then this is a bag for you. The bag does come with the certificate of authenticity but I spoke to a prada representative at prada's headquarters and was informed that you had to send it in their warehouse so they can identify if it's authentic and the card was useless to authenticate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strappless","review":"I bought this bag as a gift for my friend that helped me out with my wedding.

We thought, no big deal it was only one side of the strap and then a hour or so later the other end pulled out. The nylon is fine, the look is trendy, the bag is real it's just the stiching quality sucks. I have no odea how to return it so i have to take my friends bag to a seemstress. How embarassing, I look cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Prada","review":"I thought wow a Prada bag for under $80 (the price has gone up since Christmas). I was very disappointed.

Through some screwy plot, the three of them end up on South Padre Island in Texas, at college spring break. If you're looking for skin, as one might expect in a spring break movie, you can forget it. There is nothing sexy about this movie and more important, three good comedians are totally wasted in a plot that makes them look like members of the PTA caught in the Animal House.

Explanations are sparse and incoherent with vague references to \\"important applications\\" with no sense of the abstract concept and virtually no insight into any of the information presented; as another reviewer wrote it is quite dry, I can't see Ben Stein narrating it, but I can picture the author sitting at his keyboard haphazardly plunking in text from other 'sources' all the while wondering what it means.Skip this and get something with more substance, Peebles offers nothing more than you could find on wikipedia, perhaps less."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad book to start with..","review":"This book though looks simple and pretends to present concepts in a lucid manner, does not match international standards. Very few examples are present with less/no illustrations. I struggled with this book for almost 2 years to understand the concepts as this book was the only popular book in my UG college and was readily available in our library. It has ideally no practical examples which can easily discourage reader. After reading contemporary books from Prof Roy Yates and Prof Leon-Garcia, I could do little favor for this book by giving 1 star.However, one who is already thorough with concepts can use this book for revision. There is a huge element of risk involved in starting with this book to learn probability concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little examples, no answers in the back of the book","review":"This book does not have enough examples in the text. I tend to learn better by example and this book is not for people like myself. Also, there are no solutions to any of the homework problems in the back of the book. So you can't check your answers to see if you are doing the problems right."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"The quality of the book in terms of condition is very good and it arrived on time, but in terms of material, it fails miserably. The material is not presented well and has very few examples to show how to solve problems. One other problem is that some of the mathematical formulas are written in a circular fashion which tells you nothing of importance. Unless you need to buy this book to use as a class text book, spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on review; terrible in introducing the target subject matter","review":"This book is simply \\"okay.\\" It is formatted nicely and easy to look at. The first few chapters on the review of statistics is generally nice (and even led me to question the negative reviews from others until I progressed further).Mid-way through Chapter 6, just about when stationarity is introduced, the text becomes useless to anyone who is not familiar with the subject matter. Intuition is none-existent in the topics presented - to the extent that I was confused by the presentation of subjects that I was already strong with.I am told Gardner's book is an excellent book with deep intuition; I have ordered it and will read it with the possibility of returning to peebles after I have a much better idea of what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay True To Your Old Skewl","review":"I remember back in 1991 a friend I worked with (Brian) told me about an old project he and Gary were apart of called Benestrophe.

The setting was a whiteout snowstorm and it was portrayed chillingly! Even in Florida, (am a former New Englander), I could feel the cold, experience all the emotions of the characters; and even tho you will probably guess who the bad guy is, you do not want to do it willingly!!!This is a gut wrenching story, vividly done. I read this book in one day - just could not put it down until I reached the end.Each chapter ends hanging out there, and you rush thru the next to seek the answer!

Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just misses the mark","review":"I like Sandra Brown and really enjoyed Ricochet. Perhaps my expectations were too high when I picked up Chill Factor. The possibilities were there with an interesting plot but the characters were \\"over developed,\\" thus giving the plot away early in the game. A good analogy might be the artist using too much paint on the brush. The result is predictability in terms of \\"who done it.\\" My other gripe with Chill Factor is that the middle 100 pages got pretty tedious--too much detail and not enough suspense. Other reviewers didn't appreciate the sexual detail. I did not find it to be gratuitous; in fact these encounters were integral to the plot. This was an OK read. I liked Ricochet much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a very suspenseful book that keeps the reader turning the pages. In addition to a murder mystery, it is also a profile of a small town, warts and all, and there are a lot of characters and subplots working at the same time. The author throws out a lot of red herrings, and it will take the reader a while to figure out everything that is going on.The romance angle could have been a little bit better developed, but the strong secondary characterizations more than make up for this, as does the nail-biting ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill Factor","review":"This is 2nd book I've read by Sandra Brown.

The plot is awful and the characters are revolting. It was difficult to have any sympathy for any of them, and at times I found myself cheering on the bad guys as our intrepid heroine was such a useless piece of humanity. While I realize that this is fiction, there should be at least some believable elements in a book and they were sadly lacking in this one.If this had been the first book I'd read by Brown it would have been my last. I really don't understand all the rave reviews this book has, it's one of the worst books I've read this year and I go through at least 7-10 books a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scintilllating Suspense","review":"This is an another winner by Sandra Brown.

Not up to her usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two problems","review":"Sandra Brown is capable of pure art when she uses words to describe people's thoughts and behaviors. This talent of hers kept me reading Chill Factor. But I almost put it down for two reasons.In the first half or so of the book, Ms. Brown had so many technical errors, that the story lacked credibility. Where were her editors? Later, we have Ben, whose life is at stake, who is unwilling to tell Lilly or anyone the truth about his connection to the deaths. Any logical person would have not only explained but would have offered evidence to get out from the predicament that he was in. In short, technical details and a key link in the plot were way too weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the \\"thriller\\", it's a romance novel","review":"I got this from our library as an audiobook, believing it was a thriller novel. It is not; I was stuck with only this to listen to on a trip, and probably swerved off the road several times yelling \\"who cares!?! Get to the action, we don't care who has sixpack abs or what they did on \\"that sunday they first met!\\" Argh, this is a romance novel, plain and simple, with some semblance of a thriller intertwined, but it's buried in so much useless drivel (unless you like romance novels) that you're rooting for the bad guy, anything, just somebody do something...and no, I don't mean kiss him.Thank heaven it was a shorter trip than the book, so I don't have to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme more!","review":"In a day where Robert Jordan and Terry Brooks are passed off as great fantasy writing I just want the baser pleasures of great swords and sorcery.

Imaro is in pursuit of the kidnapper of Tanisha when... well, that would be telling and I would not want to do that.The book is very well written and Charles Saunders love and affection for the characters and setting and the genre itself all shine through. He admits to editing and rewriting parts of the stories included in this book to make them fit the story arch that he had in mind., Having never read the original stories themselves I cannot compare the two. However in this book it works well and it really does form a effective and engaging story line.If you enjoy Sword and Sorcery fiction or even if you are looking for a fantasy story set in a mythical Africa then this book may be just what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolodex Stacking Side Load Tray, Letter, Black (62555)","review":"Decent design.

This CD has been playing endlessly since the moment I picked it up. Listen to the way the first track digitally degrades into the second to understand how much work went into some of these mixes. This CD is the epitome of smooth. Don't buy it intending on recreating Sat. night's club experience, rather kick back have a drink, maybe smoke something, and really absorb the intricacies present here. This CD is dedicated to Sharam's late father and many of the vocal samples show how spiritual an album this is. Consider samples like, \\"I think I can fly... probably just falling,\\" and \\"What we do in life, echoes in eternity.\\" Just a couple examples but there are more where those came from. A must have, the deepest Deep Dish album to date, the best deep house CD in recent memory.Also, if you like Deep Dish, try there mentor, Danny Tenaglia, his Global Underground: London album is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Trance, Less House, but Still All Good.","review":"Instead of repeating the winning formula of \\"Yoshiesque,\\" Deep Dish return with a solid Volume 2 that differs in mood and flavor. The tempo is a bit faster, and we get more trance than house this time around. Disc One didn't appeal to me at first, but it succeeds by the excellent mixing and melange of diverse grooves featuring the mid-tempo beats of Chemical Brothers to other upbeat, energetic house grooves with a dash of techno. Give it a couple of listens, and it will grow on you. Disc Two (which, like Disc 1, is 78 minutes) is more my flavor, with more traditional house numbers and less trance. Standouts include the opener \\"Finally\\" by Kings of Tomorrow and Morel's \\"Funny Car.\\" Sequels may have a reputation of disappointing, but Volume 2 is a smart step forward for the remixing duo of Dubfire and Sharam. In my school of music, this CD gets a B."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"If you like deep house, this is a must for your collection.

I can't make any claims about its protein performance since I can never stomach an entire serving at a time.Pick another protein powder! Dymatize and Sci-Fit make cheap protein powder with good amounts of all of the aminos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes Good. Nice addition to my diet.","review":"I need more protein in my diet. At the suggestion of a friend, I ordered a bottle of banana-flavored Advanced Soy Pro. After reading reviews, I was concerned this would be hard to mix and have the same chalky taste as other protein powders. But, I was surprised to find that it tastes pretty good and mixes fairly well. I use about 5 oz of rice milk, 5 oz of coconut milk, and 1 scoop of Soy Pro ... mixed with a shaker that has a metal spring ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissolves well Tastes good OK texture","review":"I use this with the clean tek fit fresh shaker bottle sold here.I mix this with orange juice and it tastes great. It's almost as good as a regular smoothie. The taste is not weird at all. The texture is a little chalky but really not bad. I usually do one one scoop to 16oz of orange juice and this ratio mixes up really well.I'm lactose intolerant so I went with soy instead of whey. I can digest this stuff well and it doesn't affect my appetite. (I'm trying to gain weight) I wouldn't use this as a meal replacement because it doesn't fill you up like a real meal would.I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Product","review":"The Taste is pretty bad and they give you so little for a lot of money.

She loves the entire series and thinks it to be fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get Enough!","review":"So, I started with the first book in the Anita Blake series and will begin book 5 and have done so in 2 weeks time. Once I start I cannot put these books down! Lunatic Cafe showed a little softer side of Anita and I noticed in some reviews a few people did not enjoy her more vulnerable romantic side. But, I think it endears me more to Anita since we all go thru a roller coaster of emotional changes in our lives. She still has it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I've been on a Laurell K. Hamilton frenzy lately. I've read the first five Anita Blake books without stopping, and this is one of the better reads. All Anita Blake books can be read out of sequence, but I recommend reading the books in order.I particularly enjoyed Lunatic Cafe because there were less vampires this time, but the monsters were NOT in short supply. Anita is both vulnerable and forceful. She finds herself in love with a furry man, but the realization of what it really means to be a shapeshifter has her questioning her judgement. The introduction of new creatures was quite a joy, and I can't say I really missed Jean-Claude. I have come to enjoy Larry the apprentice and he does not make an appearence in this volume.This is not a book for the quezy. One particular chapter is very graphic, and is often mentioned again later in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor anyone?","review":"I've read several books in this series (including the short story in Bite), I've given Hamilton more than a fair shot, but this is it. The plots are interesting. Jean-Claude is saucy, but it's not enough. The heroine is a self-righteous, self-absorbed hypocrite whose mouth should've gotten her killed by book two. My biggest issue is the writing itself. The grammar and sentence structure are atrocious and they don't get any better the further into the series you go. In fact, they get worse, and shame on Jove publishers for continuously overlooking these problems. I refuse to waste anymore of my money on Laurell K. Hamilton until she finds an editor. Vote against this review if you like, but if you've ever had an English class you know it's true. If you can't see it, take another English class. This is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"_Lunatic Cafe_ is the fourth book in the Anita Blake series. It introduces readers to the werewolf pack that Richard belongs to, when Anita is called on to help them discover who has been killing shapeshifters. Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of St. Louis, also plays a part, as he happens to have an interest in Anita and the local werewolf pack. A very cool book that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard, Jean-Claude, and Anita o my!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Laurell K. Hamilton has done it again. The triangle Hamilton has created is better than ever. Reading about Richard, Jean-Claude and Anita is always fun and exciting. The case/mystery that Anita solves in this book is also very good. I did not put all the pieces together until the very end. This book also tells more and more about the Werewolves and how their pack functions. Hamilton does just a great job of giving the reader a lot of information about the world she has created and makes this a hard one to put down until finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undisputedly the best book in the series.","review":"This book has everything that the makes this particular series so attractive: supernatural, humor, blood, gore, and a lot of sexy people(?). If you have only time to read one of the books this is the one to choose. Anita Blake's boyfriends are extremely appealing, and her friends are extremely interesting. Her job, of course, doesn't leave her enough time to sleep, but well, everything cannot be perfect"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunatic Cafe","review":"I think this is one of the best Anita Blake series I've read. The library didn't have this one, so I've read the ones before it and after it. This one brought it all together. Very well- written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunatic Cafe","review":"Action, adventure, great story line, Vampires; zombies, werewolfs and decent character development; What more could you want from a book??"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommed this series...","review":"Sorry, but I didn't like it. I think I spent an hour on the whole book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"As always problematic","review":"Marcus had potential as a arch-enemy but he was given such short shrift here that when he's subsequently killed it doesn't hold the impact one might expect. Again the big whoopdedoo is Anita being raped. Which keeps as a recurring theme throughout all of the books. It tends to wear thin after awhile.As with my other thoughts on the Anita Blake series some are better than others but only marginally. I keep hope alive for this series, for this character but each book is a hit or far miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable, but too dominated by romantic interest","review":"With Anita Blake we can usually count on a lot of smart-mouthing, gutsy defiance of creatures that you'd think would tear her to pieces. It's enjoyable watching her win, and she's a definite fictional heroine to all of us who were undersized growing up.What I like a lot about this book is the depth that is given on some of the social structure of the creatures Anita deals with. Hamilton's come up with some very creative stuff in this regard. On the weak side, though, the plot is overdependent upon her love interest(s). I don't want to spoil anything, so that's all the detail I'll go into, but for me this detracted from the book.If you already like the series, you'll probably like this one more if you enjoy a strong romantic aspect, and less if you're more interested in the mystery/action angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good addition to the series...","review":"I enjoyed reading this addition to the series. The plot was good, and action-packed, and the author did a great job building the tension between Anita and her two love interests. The world-building was as good as usual, too. The only flaw that was serious enough (in my opinion) to affect my review is that I didn't buy into the love between Anita and Richard as much as I wish I could have. It seemed that they didn't have enough experiences together and affection for each other for the relationship to progress as deeply and as quickly as it did. Even with less page-time, I bought into Anita's love for Jean-Claude much more easily. I don't know why, but I did, and the \\"flatness\\" of Anita and Richard's relationship impacted my enjoyment of the story somewhat. Other than that, this was well worth the read and I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great page turner","review":"I love this seris it keeps me entertained, and I always look forward to the next book in the seris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Werewolves are yummy...","review":"This book gives so much information about werewolves. Anita is dating Richard and their relationship is great until Jean Claude shows up.I wish I would have known who the real bad guys were earlier in the book because at the end I was just like, wow so many bad guys.... But none of them were the murderers.Okay, the werewolf instinct thing? Totally hot, and I mean the hot cage scene between Anita and Jason. Even though she was close to dying.And I do like Richard but something tells me Jean Claude is always gonna be anitas shadow so I really don't see a future here.This books get better by the minute.Bloody bones.. Here I come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series so far...","review":"I started out at the beginning of this series and I have to admit that they are definitely getting better. I liked this book most of all because it gave us more of a glimpse into the characters of Anita, Richard and Jean-Claude. This is the thing that's been missing from the others, an emotional connection to the characters. I felt it here. I enjoyed this book tremendously. I highly recommend you start at the beginning of the series. Don't let the gore of the first three scare you off. The worst book to get thru is the Laughing Corpse. After that, they do get better. Ms. Hamilton's writing style improves and you get more of a glimpse into Anita's personality, why she is the way she is. Plus, there is more sexual tension between Jean Claude and Anita, and between Anita and Richard. At the end of this book, I HAD to go get the next, Bloody Bones. Each book seems to give only a small taste of romance. I hope Ms. Hamilton gives us a bit more soon. I'm salivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but the ending sped past me","review":"I am a new fan to the Anita Blake series. I have found myself totally intrigued with these stories.

However, I was xpecting her to receive the book and not the graphic novel. This product should be labeled better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Anita isnt the kind of girl you warm up too, however her friends of all kinds keep you busy to only think about her thousands of failings occassional. Books are in good condition and ready for me to fall into each ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't start this series you'll be sorry by book 5-6","review":"Don't waste your time with any more of these. They become an outlet for an embittered, sick woman. Read Faith Hunters \\"Jane Yellow Rock\\" series if you want a good vampire hunter series.This series starts out ok but believe me unless you are into sick sexual fantasy you will regret giving any of your support to this author. I thought they would get better. They got MUCH worse. It's more and more sick sexual fantasy the later you get into the series. Unfortunatley I read about 8 of them before I gave up skipping the perverted sex parts because at that point that was about all there was. This isn't good heroic fantasy. It's just sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is pretty generous","review":"This is a banal text, poorly written in every regard. Though Hamilton may have a sense for action beats in her works (which she should at this point in her incredibly-long career), everything else is marred by her lack of skill at dialogue, description and knowing when to sit back and let the story work, rather than filling it with endless, meaningless \\"witty\\" quips from her narrator. The characters are stock and unlikeable, but only because they are completely devoid of originality.If her other works are anything like this one, then she will have a statue erected in her name in the literary hall of shame before it is all said and done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Problems","review":"I have enjoyed the Anita Blake series so far, but I was disappointed this time around. Anita's character was inconsistent with her attitude between Richard and Jean-Claude. Anita would NEVER allow Jean-Claude to interfere with her personal life and give in to his ridiculous proposal to date her against her will when she's so in love with Richard. As for the thrown-together mystery involving the murders of lycanthropes, I couldn't believe the author expected her readers to believe that within the same week, three seperate killers without knowing each other were killing them off. Sorry, this is just not credible. Not to mention the obvious tip-off when the \\"bad guys\\" show up. I'm starting to really be annoyed by Anita's attitude. She can't stop complaining about her life, no matter how good she has it. She is becoming unlikable as a character... and that's not a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"This book is still good entertaining fun, just as the rest of the Anita Blake series. And plenty of body count for those who keep count ;)However a key element in stories is for the reader to identify with the main charecter. In this book that means we have to see the new love interest 'Richard' in the same dreamy light that the main charecter Anita Blake does. The relationship is stressed enough in this book that there's no just ignoring it...I could not bring myself to follow along with Anita where Richard is concerned. Richard gets an enthusiastic thumbs down from me.The fact that it is so imensely frustrating should tell you that Hamilton know's how to write and hook the reader. But her main charecter lost me in this book. I gave some of her other books higher ratings.still a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in the Series So Far!!","review":"I just love the Anita Blake books and this one is my favorite so far. The turmoil between Anita & Richard and then Anita & Jean-Claude is electrifying. And she just plain kicks butt! I have spent many hours out of my day reading this, and all her books.

Sure I know that is not helpful in any way, and please give me a vote of \\"NO\\".I should mention that Berg did not complete the opera but left extensive notes so that Friedrich Cercha completed it. Boulez mentions that a scholar named adorono felt satified with Cercha's work, and Boulez agrees.but I'm not so sure. The first 2 cds are clearly from the hand of berg, from the opening of the 3rd cd, immediately I/you notice that there is a drastic change in compositional quality. Its the best Cercha could do, and its good work. Just not near on the level as Berg's completed first 2 cds of music.Paul"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty from start to finish","review":"Famously, Pierre Boulez suggested that all opera houses should be blown up. There is not one bar on this recording to indicate any change of perspective (\\"change of heart\\" is evidently not an appropriate expression here). Bluntly and simply, Boulez loathes drama, and doesn't seem to care much for music, either. If you like your music drama joyless, pedantic, and frequently perverse, this is the one for you.

If I had leaved through this book at a bookstore, I would never have purchased it. The layout ideas are so average that one sees them everywhere, on the web, in friends scrapbooks. Not in a layout idea book. The pictures in the layouts are sometimes haphazardly put out. The format is small so that one has to squint to see the details. And I can get almost all the ideas from my Creative Memory Idea Books. There are no explanations for the beginner, no step by step instructions.

It's simply an album you can listen to over and over and over and never tire of. The melodies are just this side of catchy yet not so catchy that hearing them for the 90th time brings nausea. Tapes 'N Tapes very much do have the spirit of Talking Heads -- experimentation where the results are fascinating yet still have songs as the result vs. experimentation that may be different but is incredibly boring and is different just for the sake of being different (I'm talking to you, TV on the Radio). To point out certain tracks would be a crime, because all of them are excellent, soaring, majestic and effortlessly beautiful. Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just get it","review":"You know what? It is new and fresh sounding.

I am sure I am forgetting some other bands but you get the picture. And yet they have their own sound and deserve all of the praise they are getting. All of it. The music has no pretensions and a lot of heart and energy. And I can't believe I am the first one to post about this major indie record of 2006 (well, 2005 really).

Mary Karr writes: \\"It must be terrible to have cancer at age 50\\". So, the grandmother was 50 at the time and the mother was (at least) 30+9+9 months = 40 years old? I don't think so!I liked the way Mary Karr tells the story - for a while. I really enjoyed the tall tales her father made up in the first third or so of the book. After the second sexual abuse scene, however, I had thoroughly enough of the despicable characters. No need reading somebody else's nightmares stated as a fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see what the big deal is about this book","review":"When a book has tons of good reviews and an award to boot, I have high expectations. Usually those expectations are not met. Such is the case with \\"The Liar's Club\\". Mary Karr just goes on and on and on.....and to be honest her parents weren't bad people. So things weren't conventional in that house? The parents did show love to Mary and her sister.I couldn't get 1/2 way through this book because it wasn't holding my interest. \\"The Glass Castle\\" by Jeanette Walls is much better.

I had heard so much about it and being from that area, felt that I would have an inside track to Karr's psyche. However, I found the writing style to be tedious and due to the darkness of the story, I was more than able to put the book away for a rest.There's no doubt that Karr's descriptive writing is excellent, it just didn't reel me in as I hoped. I also wondered why she used a fictitious name for the town she grew up in? All the surrounding areas kept their names and caused me confusion in the beginning of where is this action all taking place anyway? Apparently, the used book I received from Amazon from another reader felt the same.

Fortunately she has a father who is her rock, at least when he's not drinking.As is the case in many such situations, Karr and her older sister learn to cope by relying on each other for support.

Her mother was mentally ill, herfather an alcoholic. Her mother was also a beautiful, intelligentrole model for her daughters, and her father, a hero, in the voiceof a young Mary Karr.

While the subject matter is somewhat similar, the writing style is extremely different. I found Ms. Karr's pace to be very slow and choppy. She would provide detailed descriptions about things that did nothing to advance the story. She would start talking about a particular incident, and then would get off on a tangent.

There aren't enough words to describe the content of Mary Karr's memoir of her upbringing in a seething, sweaty, swampy East Texas refinery town. But not many words are needed, especially when it comes to Karr's lyrical and poetic writing style: perfect. At the core of her tale is her family, often funny, occasionally violent, but always defiantly loving. Karr's mother is artistic, borderline psychotic, and determinedly free-spirited. Her father is a drunk, a liar, amazingly tolerant of his wife's nuttiness, and in spite of his many faults, devoted to holding his family together.

I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life. Not one good thing or good person.Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her. Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading. It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I likexd the way she expressed herself","review":"It was a good book and I loved some of the lies she told and what her life was like before and after she told a li"},{"rating":"1","title":"flat, monotonous, self-justifying","review":"I believe the reason the tone of this book is so flat is that Karr is much more interested in remembering her childhood the way she needs to remember it, rather than the way it really happened. Anyway, it rings false for me. Virtually none of the brightness and magic that shines so sweetly in childhood is present here.The great appeal of this book is, as I'm sure many have noted before me, schadenfreude, i.e., enjoyment obtained from the troubles of others. The appeal is further compounded by the novelty of the contrast between the book's dreariness and all the sugar coated pap everyone gets fed to them by Hollywood and TV. But that's just my guess. And although I enjoy a good pratfall as much as the next guy, I'm not ghoulish enough to enjoy wading through 300 pages of it. As for TV and Hollywood, people would find more nourishment for their souls all around them if they would just turn their backs on the entertainment industry. Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"So hard to believe","review":"I have just completed reading part I of this book and I am finding it all very hard to believe. I do not believe that a 7 year old can have as much psychological insight into a situation as Mary Karr claims she did when she was 7, not to mention an adult sense of humor. All in all, the gist of her life-story may very well be true, but to me, it seems like Mary Karr has made up all the little details she write about in her book. It is also very very prosaic, and it pales in comparision to Frank McCourt's beautiful poetic memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern re-fried chicken","review":"Karr has a gift for the sort of \\"colorful\\" Southern writing Yankees can't seem to get enough of.

Set out in the world she claims, in Book World(2008) Bill Matthews beat brain cancer by having a heart atack-- (lie) She also misspeaks regarding Keats(Book World 2008)-(liar) As I said, she shoots from the hip-- in no way is an academic, does not check her sources, writes anything she wants, because, perhaps, she has branded herself a liar already.

Anything by Terry Pratchett is amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful use of imagery and perspective.","review":"Mary Karr deftly utilizes imagery and perspective to create an interesting piece of literature. As she drifts through her memories of a dysfunctional childhood in East Texas and Colorado, Karr often paints very vivid pictures that are almost poetic, describing many situations she encountered in fine detail. These intense images allow readers to feel like they are there, living vicariously through the words. Also, the perspective adds to the imagery. Each incident is remembered very clearly, as a child can be very observant, yet the incidents are described with a poet's precision, utilizing the perfect words for each description, as only a mature and well-read adult is capable. The language constructs universality that will instantly hook and draw any reader in. I strongly recommend this book, if only to admire the skillful use of words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liars' Club","review":"Mary Karr takes reading and writing to a different level. Reading this memoir, I was swept up in her powerful and evocative language; I could see everything unfolding very clearly in my mind's eye. I can think of few authors who have such a gift for taking the complex subjects of life and reducing them to such simple and, well, truthful statements. Karr has a brilliance indicated by the fact that 'Liars' Club' is such a simple read. It's a stroke of luck, too, for it could make the most reluctant reader believe in stories again. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was like she was talking to me","review":"Mary Karr's memior, The Liar's Club, is an exploration into her traumatic childhood growing up amidst alcohol and other dysfunction.

The first one wouldn't pop at all, and they sent me a new one with no hassles whatsoever. I can't complain about the service, they wanted me to be satisfied.

The recipes are okay, but nothing to rave about. Justin Wilson loves to include his 'humorous' stories and jokes along with the recipes. They mainly should be considered a distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical and fun projects for the garden!","review":"This workbook is filled with beautiful pictures of container arrangements with step-by-step instructions for each. First, it has a full-page picture of the arrangement. On the opposite page, it'll describe the types of flowers used. Then there is a fold-out page with very clear diagrams and instructions on how to make the container itself (if you don't wanna buy one. Pretty easy stuff like paint and simply woodwork); and then how to arrange the plants inside.I have several other garden books, including another container garden book, but this is much more \\"fun\\"! It's a great idea book even if you don't want to follow the instructions 100%. It shows huge arrangements (for small trees), as well as small ones (with pots of pansies). I'm getting more of these workbooks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Which movie is it?","review":"The film shown on this Amazon page is a drama about a twelve year old boy (David Arnott) raised by a single mom (Goldie Hawn), who happens to be a stripper, in Key West in 1969. It's a well-made film with good acting, but nothing special; it grabs your attention to the situation, but never really resolves it very insightfully.Most reviewers here have mistakenly written about the 1949 Burt Lancaster filmCriss Crosswhich takes place in Los Angeles, not Key West.So which is this, the Goldie Hawn movie, shown, or the Burt Lancaster film, as described? I guess I'd give both 4 stars, but would like to know what I'm buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insights On Teenagers","review":"\\"Adolescene Isn't Terminal\\" by Kevin Leman is full of interesting insights and conclusions on how parents can survive the teenage years. Leman covers such topics as;1. Do not be overly controlling of your teenagers - give them room to make mistakes and learn from them.2. Dating3. Sex4. Peer pressure5. Other pressures teens have to deal with6. Hassles of everyday life7. Parents should not sacrifice their teens for a \\"succesful\\" career. They need us particularly during this time. This chapter was my personal favorite.All in all, the advice and insights were very helpful and encouraging.Read and enjoy. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sermon 101","review":"Good information can be gleaned from this book. Three comments though:1) Leman bends statistics around so that it fits how he wants the puzzle to fit.2) He likes the grabby, shock statements with punchy little antidotes that sound like a sermon to wake sleepy congregants. He does not sound like a person really trying to help you cope with teenagers. I think Anythony E. Wolf has much better information and Wolf conveys things a more personal and realistic manner(Get Out of My Life, But First Can You Drive Me and Cheryl to the Mall).3) Very Christian, even when he makes a point of saying . . . this follows Judeo-Christian beliefs . . . in the same breath he quotes from Matthew. It was a bit much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guidebook for Christian Parents","review":"I agree 100% with the reviewer that said this book should be sub-titled 'A Guidebook for Christian Parents'.

It was a suggested read by a very devoted fan (her sister). I enjoyed every page of this book. I read it in two days, not because it was a small book but because I got so engrossed in the story line that I couldn't wait to read what would happen next. We all have our family stories...and the portrayal of this Italian family was fantastic and non-stop laughing funny. She really did a great job with the characters and their backgrounds, you could almost place yourself in the book laughing right along with their antics. I can't wait to read more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"SanGiovanni Shines!","review":"What is a straight girl like me doing reading a book like this? Loving every minute of it!

Coming from a New England neighborhood with Italian friends - it was very easy to visualize the scenes playing out. It is a very easy read that will have you rolling over with laughter! This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Different Italian Family","review":"What a fun read this was! More a story of a (too) close Italian family than anything else, this book shows how hard it can be to \\"come out of the closet\\". As Mari pursues her love interest in bizarre ways, she gradually realizes that the truth, however odd, serves as the best basis for a relationship. Parts of the story made me laugh aloud. Not for children or those easily offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best !","review":"Este Diccionario es magnifico para aclarar palabras ya que las definiciones son simples y no te meten palabras raras en las mismas definiciones.Lo unico es que no traen la raiz de las palabras que siempre vienen bien."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars because it's Mozart","review":"I rate this CD with 5 stars because the pieces are by Mozart. One can immediately understand the future for this child genius after listening to these recordings. That being said, and enjoying them for what they are, most listeners will appreciate the mature Mozart instead. Good clarity of sound and well executed; not as mature as the later Mozart genius has and still does continue to fascinate us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful and informative book","review":"I am using the draft text of this book for my course in International Law at Sarah Lawrence College. I have found it to be extremely helpful in that is contains many useful cases dealing with International Law, documentary supplements such as charters and treaties, and general background information on such organizations as the United Nations, the European Community, etc. I recommend this book to anyone who is studying law, who is interested in International Law and Politics, or who is planning to study law or attend law in the future. It will be very helpful in framing your background knowlege of the subject, and will give you in-depth information on important case studies as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv the Blue Mountain Arts Collection","review":"I gave this book to both of my daughters recently.

I bought all 4 years(16 DVDs)and don't regret it for a minute. I am now lending them to a friend who is in complete agreement with me! Michael Kitchen is superb in his quiet understated role as a Chief Police Inspector in a small town inEngland at the start of WW2. The crime and wartime influences on the town are spellbinding and I am amazed how he ties up all the loose ends of the sub-plots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"foyle's war sets 1,2,3,4","review":"The genius of this series is that the detective chief superintendent Foyle, actually listens to people, suspects, and answers their questions in a forthright manner, and he expects the same from them. So different from American cop shows where the cops say, \\"I'm asking the questions here!\\" And the English language is used so eloquently in the dialogue. Never an \\"Ummm\\" or colloquialism misplaced.A true pleasure to watch.tim mcgraw"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama and Mystry on the home front","review":"The fourth set in this series, Foyle's War provides an excellent mystery drama with good acting and story line. The world war left the homeland ripe with opportunity for crime and in this series, Foyle is determined to solve each case. His driver Sam add's some excellent acting. This is good family entertainment and will draw most into the time period unlike present times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best WW II Series!","review":"Waited a long time for the fourth season, but it was worth it. Just one negative note-- in \\"Invasion,\\" the supposedly \\"American\\" expressions used were often way off the mark. Nevertheless, a rivoting series, and I look forward to more seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series.","review":"This fourth season stands up to the quality of the first three, and everyone in my house eagerly awaits more. The relaxed pace, interesting and compelling characters that are very easy to believe and care about, and the beautiful scenery add to the stark contrast created by the realities of war in World War II England.We all love all these stories and watch them over and over for the flavor of the setting and time as well as the verisimilitude of the characters and events. The mysteries are also well-crafted and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"We have purchased all 4 sets of Foyle's War after having bought the first one on recommendations from Amazon and from the reviews about the series. Each episode is almost a full-length movie and each one very well done. We give it a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Yet another excellent British series. If you haven't watched it, you should! The premise is a police drama set in Britain during WWII. The plots are interesting and the acting is low key but excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in every way!","review":"I have all 4 sets of this series, and it is most excellent! Well written, well cast and acted. Michael Kitchen is wonderful in every way. The look and feel of the film is exceptional. I highly recommend it to anyone! (Although I have to say, I bought all 4 sets of mine at Costco, and they were much cheaper than anywhere else. Costco even had them cheaper than the \\"used\\" copies being offered on line!) Even if you can't find a good sale, however, this series is worth whatever you pay, and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning with Foyle's War","review":"While Foyle's War is excellent entertainment it wins, also, because it pauses important ethical questions about the legitimacy of fighting evil with evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"great to save clear stamp designs","review":"I love using these Fiskars clear stamp sets--they are so easy to both use and clean up. I like the ability to save the design for future use.I like this much better than the hard acrylic blocks that are often sold with clear stamps. This helps line up the paper & stamps with the grid, and allows for even pressure across the stamps.Note: store the item with the sponge feet not squished, or they will not hold the plate evenly. I keep mine on top of a box, upside down (so the little feet are in the air.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiskars Stamp Press, Replacement Plates","review":"I bought these replacement plates just in case I'd need them. They are of the same excellent construction as the original plate in the press. Although I haven't used them yet, I can see that if you're using multiple stamps on multiple cards/projects and need a quick switch out, they'll make the job a cinch. I don't think I'd need them to simply replace the plate anytime soon because of the great quality of the products."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice addition","review":"these plates are nice but if you only stamp things occasionally as I do they really are not a must for the system. i personally don't need to keep my stamps set up for future use but for those that do these would be great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wast of money","review":"This was a complete wast of my money!

I left the wrap on for an hour and measured, nothing! It actually made me feel light-headed because of the fluid intake directions are strict.

To say that this movie is twice as good as any other must mean he has never seen Beat Street. When DJ Kenny drops the beat, he is the king of the street - not like that punk Turbo. While Beat Street features street icons such as Melle Mel, Doug E Fresh, Kool Moe Dee, the Rocksteady Crew, and Jazzy Jeff, Breakin' 2 would have been better served having Art Garfunkel spinning the discs and Bill Walton doing the helicopter.Wake up last guy, your review is as good as your spelling (presumably Canne should be Cannes?)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been watching this movie for 25 years","review":"Gad i LOVE this movie!!

I haven't seen the first one (I didn't even know this was a sequel; it was a movie rental, and my parents never returned it, and by the time I could read the title had been worn off the VHS). The bright colors, the dance moves, and the dance sequence at the end with all the balloons still puts me in such a good mood. I have been watching this movie for 25 years, and it is still the best movie in my collection. It makes me grin ear to ear like a little kid, and whenever life gets to be too much - I watch this.

I figured you couldn't go wrong with Herbert Von Karajan, master that he is generally considered to be, but I was wrong.The performance is almost bland, and is made almost unlistenable by the expanded volume dynamics, i.e., if you set the volume level so you can hear the soft opening bars, you will be blown out of your seat and running for the volume control when it gets louder.

It will let you know which part of your grill is the hottest and coldest, but again it takes a while to read the temp. I felt it was pretty accurate if left in one spot. I also used it to read my different temps for different gas settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usable","review":"While I find the thermometer accurate,the ability to read the temperature is difficult because of the small lettering.

As an African american woman I feel ill to see trash such as this portraying African american men in such a stereotypical light (from an african american writer no less.) Suzan Lori Parks is no more than an uncle tom who panders to the predominantly white theatre patron.

I picked up Topdog/Underdog because it had won a Pulitzer Prize. I was very disappointed. 109 pages of largely inane dialog that ends with tragedy -- tragedy that I as a reader did not feel a bit. There is a certain cleverness here: characaters named Booth and Lincoln; Lincoln works as Abe Lincoln at an arcade where he is shot throughout the day. This play obviously did something for other readers, but it did not do it for me.An idea for a sequel: a play with characters named Kennedy, Patsy (also called Oswald), Ruby, Tony (godfather to the children and a soprano), and an unnamed Big Brother. By play's end Kennedy, Oswald and Ruby are all dead and Big Brother is in bed with the Godfather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacklustre","review":"The synopsis sounded exciting enough but I was disappointed when I started reading it.Characters did not have much depth.The plot was fairly predictable after a while and all I wanted to do was to skim through the book to confirm my conclusion.I was also disappointed with the portrayal of the Chinese community in the book as its perception is that they are made up of gangs and thugs and Chinatown is a dangerous place to be in especially for a white person.As a Chinese,I was certainly unhappy with the unflattering image given to the Chinese characters in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish - From a Big Country Fan","review":"I was a huge Big Country Fan until the release of this album. I spent years trying to get into it, before eventually deciding that the band who had previously not released an album with a single weak track, had released an album with only weak tracks. The lyrics are cringingly puerile, and the music lacked any of the edge and interest of earlier efforts. Why I truly hate this album, though, is because it caused me to lose all interest in the band (presuming future efforts were just as bad). Consequently, I only recently discovered Buffalo Skinners and the sensational Road to Damascus. Nothing redeemable about this one, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as engaging as I would have thought","review":"The book has a great premise, but the writing manages to ruin it.

I imagine it would be quite helpful for the novice trainer, but even as a trainer with a little more experience I found it quite useful. At first glance it looks, perhaps, elementary, but it does a fantastic job of tying all the elements of training together so that one knows what to do and when to do it.

There is plenty of excitement and it is full of sea knowledge.

It changes your perspective on life and makes you question your own limiting beliefs to the point that you become a different person. It's message is simple: \\"You are God\\".

You begin to realize that you really are capable of doing anything and everything, no matter how crazy it seems, because God has no limits, and that all you need to do is open your mind. There are chapters that are harder to \\"accept\\" than others, but this is because of what society has taught us through the years; if you take the time to really think about what he is telling you, you'll see that it all makes sense.

Few people who like Enya will like this stuff. Not to say that there aren&#65533;t people who would like it, just not the &#65533;Enya&#65533; crowd. It&#65533;s more like the 700 Club Crowd.

As I listened I kept thinking \\"I already heard this song\\" but no, it just sounded like every other song on the CD: the same.3. The keyboards sounds like someone bought a cheap Casio like my kid has. Doesn't anyone play a real piano anymore?Now I listened too some samples before I bought this and I thought I would like it once it was one my stereo.

I realized that I continuously compared it to the SC-1200. So I bought another SC-1200 and realized that it is the best charger available for my needs. I would highly recommend it! BTW, the sound of the cooling fan is NOT significant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger","review":"I bought this charger because the advertisement said it would automatically go into charge mode when the AC power was applied. My application was for a remote diesel generator where I powered the charger from the generator output thereby maintaining a battery charge while it was running.

I have reconditioned batteries over and over with my previous unit and know what to expect. This was a lawn tractor type battery that I have had great success with so far.RUN DON'T \\"WALK\\" AWAY FROM THIS SCHUMACKER CHARGER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husbands Bday Gift","review":"My husband had been looking to buy a charger for a battery powered golf cart he is restoring.

Knowing the ways of a small group of oyster farmers in Australia and watching how they handle the wrong decisions of youth and normal everyday work, personal, and community life is just great; so different from what you would think and do... It just broadens your views and provides you with interesting new knowledge and understanding. I do not agree that this is a comedy, as the CD indicates. But it does contain humor in the midst of human drama and human growth, and so takes you through a real life experience. This would not be possible without some really good acting and obviuos hard work in the establishment of wonderfully realistic connections among characters on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and Sweet plus.. it has Alex","review":"Never heard of the movie before until I went on a search for all things O'Loughlin. Its a low budget movie that was filmed on location, literally on the river bank, in Australia. These are real people that are quickly likeable. Jack is a quiet guy who's only family is his older sister who is in a hospital following an accident. He does what he can to provide financially for her and her rehab. Everything in this movie is suble and it grows on you every time you watch it. There are funny scenes and also scenes with Alex that you want to hit your 'back' button again and again. I will never look at a boat dock the same way. Its a charming little story that is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never knew Oyster Farming could be so fun!","review":"Great story of a man trying to find his place in the world.

I am quite shocked by the few reviewers who were turned off it due to the F-bombs! But then again maybe that is a US thing. I am European and if people thought this film had bad language they don't want to rent European movies lol. Anyway the language was just an accurate reflection of the culture being portrayed.Same with the scene on the decking - nothing wrong with it - it was a really tender scene yet some were offended.If you are VERY easily offended then maybe this will not be for you - but if not this is a gorgeous film, with great acting and wonderful scenery and for me it is the best Alex O'Loughlin has been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oyster Farmer","review":"I bought this movie because of Alex O'Loughlin and found the story to be well written and well acted.

This is a typical teen slasher flick with very little slashing, horror or scares. 90% of the film is devoted to cliche teen talk...girls trashing one another and the guys around them.

I used it all summer, following the course it set out for me, and eventually it helped me come in 8th in the nation at the SkillsUSA nation championships in Max.

It has a lot of detail and at some points can be confusing but it all makes sense in the end. Like when the kids are off on their own they meet a lot of new people it is very confusing because they are interacting more with their minds and it gets harder to understand. \\"Charles Wallace's clear blue eyes focused on the red ones of the man in the chair.\\" That line from the book is where it get confusing because Charles Wallace is basically being hypnotized by the man and is talking and doing what the man wants him to.

This Newberry Medal Winner is Madeleine L'Engle at her very best.

I think L'Engle brought a lot to the sci-fi genre for kids and influenced many later authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Book!","review":"The book A Wrinkle in Time is a really cool science fiction book! The characters were pretty cool. My favorites were Mrs. Whatsit and Aunt Beast. The only thing about it I didn't like was the beginning because it was just drop dead boring!

It is the ONE book that I fully remember reading as a child. <of course I read it about 10 times> It is now on their Christmas wish list. I am so looking forward to reading this book to them and then reading all of the sequals to it. I have never read any of the sequals, so I will be experiencing it for the first time \\"with\\" them. No book has ever compared to this one, in my eyes, until the Harry Potter series came along.

I rate it as my favorite science fiction story of all time. It inspired me to read the other three books in the series on the O'Keefes.

He was a famous scientist that disappered after experimenting on his secret porject for the government.He engages in top secret work for the government called the tesseract problem. Meg, Charles and Calvin looked everywhere for him and never gave up until the found him. I wouldn't suggest this book to a customer because it took forever for Meg,Charles, and Calvin to find Meg's Father. After a while, it became boring and it became rather easy to get impatient with the characters. Even though they were having fun looking for him, I really did get impatient with their cause. Meg was also so bossy and sickly determined. She knew what she wanted and she wouldn't rest till she found her father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosh!

The problem is, a thing called IT gets in their way and he even gets control of Charles Wallace! If this book seems to interest you, I hope you buy it and read it because it is one of my favorite books of all time.

Now, I'm going to have to go to the library and get the rest of the Time Quartet.I believe most people, children and adults alike, would enjoy this book. It makes you think. It's fun. It makes you want to know what happens next. If you've never read it, take the time and do so.

This is by far the best book that I have ever read. I cried when it was over. It's not like other sci-fi books. It's a fantasy-like twist of a fairy-tale mixed with a little bit of magic.

Well I recommend Wrinkle in Time to teens and adults. You have to read it carefully. My favorite character is Charles Wallace because he is brave and talks mature and thinks that he knows everything. Charles Wallace can also read Mrs.Murrys and Megs mind (that's my favorite trait).The fantasy in Wrinkle in Time starts at the beginning when Mrs.Whatsit visits the Murry house. Also when Calvin(megs friend),Meg, and Charles Wallace and Mrs.Who,Mrs.Wich and Mrs.Whatsit tessered to Camotzoz to save Megs and Charles long lost father.It's like wrinkling in time,maybe that's why they named it WRINKLE IN TIME. After I read this book I think that the moral is you should appreciate being different and not the same.The other one is love that IT doesn't have.That's how Meg defeated IT.If you are interested in Wrinkle in Time just go to a nearby library and check it out.By:Cendi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Physics rendered accessible, endearing, and entertaining...","review":"How L'Engel manages to make extremely complex science both child- (or scientifically-unsavvy adult-) accessible AND thorough is utterly beyond me, but she does. And she does it in the context of a compelling and engaging story that allows you to not only understand the concepts of physics but also want to read more about them.A Wrinkle in Time, the first in her extraordinary series of books about the Wallace children, has won significant awards and the hearts of countless children and adults alike (no small feat that!). It centers around a family of \\"misfits\\" - most are prodigies at math/science - and their missing father; the quest to find him brings in the incomparable Mrs. Who, Which, and Whatsit.

(He has been missing for some time and all the family knows is that he is working for the government) The Three woman take them on a wild adventure where things you never could imagine happen. During this trip they learn many new things about them selves which they use to there advantage.I think this book was very interesting . It started off a little slow but the more I read it the harder it got to put down. Madeleine L'Engle wrote the book very well; weaving together science, fantasy, romance, and family love. I think this book is a classic. When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down because it was going to slow but lots of people told me it was good and that I needed to keep reading it and I did, it was well worth it! This book gives your imagination a jog on the wild side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrinkle In Time","review":"This book is very good. A girl named Madeline, hermisunderstood little brother named Charles, and a local kid namedCalvin have to save Charles' and Madeline's Father from \\"The dark thing\\". It is an excellent example of what human nature could be and I think that more people should read this (with an open mind) and they could learn many things about what human nature could be. I think that all kids should read this book at least once and maybe we might have a brighter future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"My son loves to read, but getting him to read this book was like pulling teeth. He told me how awful it was all the way through and then at the end acted really excited about the book . I think that he may have been excited to be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER","review":"In the book, A Wrinkle In Time, Madeleine L'Engle surprised me. She surprised me with her clever ideas. The main character, Meg, and her genius little brother, Charles Wallace, meet Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, Calvin and Mrs. Which. These people travel through time and space in a tesseract. They are trying to find Meg's father who has been gone ever since Charles Wallace was a baby. I loved the book because its suspenseful and the characters are strange and wacky. This book teaches you that bad things will not overcome you if you believe in yourself and others. I think this book is good for kids ages 9 and up because understanding the time travel is hard. I loved the book and I would not change it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"\\"It was a dark and stormy night,\\" that's how A Wrinkle in Time, by Madeleine L'Engle all begins. Meg, Charles Wallace, Calvin, and their good friends Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Who, are taken to many strange places throughout the galaxy. They are tessered, which is a transport through time and space. These three friends are being prepared for what they face on Camazotz, where Meg's dad is. Will they all serve IT, or will they save Mr. Murry? Read this book to find out.This book I recommend, and it deserves a good rating. I recommend this book for ages 13 or over. The math is very complicated. I barely understood it. The younger kids might lose interest half- way through. A Wrinkle in Time, by me, gets 4 1/2 stars. The only two things that are wrong are Meg's clueless state, and impatience. Other then those, A Wrinkle in Time was a really good book.

I certainly did not expect a repetitive, outre praising of the Christian god throughout an award-winning children's speculative fiction book.

This book is on the list so we have been reading it. I try to mask my negative feelings about this book. I had to force myself to finish it. It's boring and has many unanswered questions.

Its brief discussions of time and space made me feel intelligent and \\"grown-up.\\" Now as a sophomore in high school, I realize how misleading much of its content is... it merely dabbles in elementary time/space concepts- a dangerous thing to attempt- and even gives inaccurate information, much of which young readers may take for granted. For example it says that Time is the 4th dimension, which is untrue. The only redeeming quality of this book is that it has entertaining events and characters. However it contains the most oversimplified, poorly researched view of the universe I have ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this book","review":"I didnt like this book because it was boring. I thought that it was boring because it didnt make any sense to me because it would be talking about one thing and then it would talk about something else.

I think I got that for the most part except that there was a part where Jesus is mentioned among others in a way that made me question that. All that said, it is still very interesting to read and being that it is a fantasy novel, I don't think it has to be Christian to be entertaining and good literature for children.

That was the first time I understood the power of the book and became a serious reader. It's really written for children, and doesn't have the same hold on my mind at 40 as at 10, though I still do love to read her.

I cannot believe the imagination of Madeleine L'Engle. I would never have been able to dream up this idea in a million years. The characters seemed so real, as though they actually exist, but at the same time, you can never imagine these events happening. Ms. L'Engle, if you ever read this, I'm begging you to write more books, especially about Vicki Austin and her gift of kything.(By the way, if you haven't read ahead into the series, Meg and Calvin get married and have seven kids. It's very interesting, don't you think?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a children's book","review":"More than 30 years ago, I came across A Wrinkle in Time on the shelf of my elementary school library. Reading it was a watershed event in my life, perhaps in part because I could identify so much with both the Meg and Calvin characters--with Meg because she didn't feel like she fit in, and with Calvin because his home life was so problematic. Also fascinating to me were the deep philosophical issues raised by the book, which are so ably presented at a level a child can comprehend. I remember clearly the feeling of hope that I had about my own situation in life after I finished reading the book. Ms. L'Engle truly authored a classic that will stand the test of time, and I am very much in her debt. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrinkle in Time","review":"A Wrinkle in Time is a journey through time in space which catches your interest in moments. Whether it's the excitement of traveling through time or the thought of death, the interest of the novel stays in your mind. Most of this interest comes about because of the fantasy behind the plot Meg and her brother Charles have to find their father in some far off universe. This universe is so wacky it's a fantasy land within all fantasy lands. Besides the story being a thrilling fantasy, it's also a touching novel. This novel is a full package of emotions which is why this is one of the best books I have ever read. If you are the type of person who likes to be in fantasy dream lands this is definitely the book for you because that is what this book does best, pulls you in and makes you feel you're experiencing all the events that are happening.Also Recommended: The Lord of the Rings, WOT Series and I HIGHYLY recomend The Price Of Immortality"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is off the hook","review":"This a truly amazing book about a girl and her worries.

Its attempt at science fiction is out of place and corny to the extreme. I read this book expecting it to be a decent novel, but instead I encountered garbage. Oh, and don't pay attention to the Newbery Medal Award that they awarded. They probably awarded it to A Wrinkle in Time because there were no other books published that year, so it won by default. Even then, it was more than likely that the people who gave the award were reluctant to do so. It only says that I gave it one star because there was no choice for 0 stars or lower.

I think enough has been said about stars (angels?) being conceived as witches to \\"play a joke\\" on everyone and the centaur appearance of the other \\"angels\\". No matter what the rest of the story conveys, I am completely revulsed by the notion she presents that Jesus was a fighter. He is not a fighter, but represents peace & love spreading the word of the Father on this earth for all to follow. Also, Jesus has already won the battle for us.

To get to that planet they had to tesser (traveling through space and time by \\"wrinkling\\" the space in between where you are to where you're going).I really liked the story because it had a lot of suspense and mystery.

I happen to be very young at heart so this book was right up my alley.I am very glad I have read this book. I intend to buy the three sequels too. I like how the story starts right away. I identify with Meg. One of the themes in the book is accepting who you are and taking the bad with the good.

Ms. L'Engle did a terrible job of trying to explain the tesseract. Myself and the whole class were so confuSed !!!!! Even the teacher said that she thoguht the book was a waste of time. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! I couldn't even finish it! Pitiful & depressing!","review":"Similar to the case of another reviewer, I chose to read this book as part of my summer reading before my fifth-grade year. It was horrible. It was too depressing and was more about the pitiful life of Meg Murry, who was always picked on and whose life was full of distress. The sci-fi part sounded intelligent, but I couldn't understand most of the book, and I had to just flip to the end before I was bored to death so I could just find out what happened. Only read this book if you have a lot of patience. In fact, don't read this book at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"The plot was hard to find and confusing, it took me a long time to figure the book out.

I have not even read the real book.I got the AUDIO BOOK and began listening. The AUDIO BOOK is read by the author. I can't believe the editor would allow her to read her book. She has one of the worst voices for reading I have heard. Raspy, like she has smoked too much and angry like she's pissed off at the world. She shouts! (She sounds, in fact, like Hilary Clinton screaming and I'm not kidding)I will read this book myself because I love a good fantasy but I would caution you to listen to an example of the AUDIO BOOK before getting it. I don't understand how anyone, but especially the editor, could have allowed this woman to presume she had any talent for reading. Yes, it is that bad. Voice acting is a real skill best handled by trained actors.Better check it out for yourself before laying out any money for the AUDIO BOOK. As for the real book, I'll be picking it up soon and reading it to myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm... Don't bother","review":"All I can say is: this book is bizzare. In my opion, it was too new age and somewhat occultic. It was just not worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiary","review":"This book is a clear version of plagiary. Two scenes come directly out of Have Spacesuit Will Travel, written ten years earlier by Robert Heinlein. Furthermore, her \\"futuristic knowledge\\" is stolen from Heinlein as well. I find it disturbing that she won an award for this book, when such a blatant plagiary exists. It surprises me she was never sued for this when one of her scenes is word for word out of Heinlein's book, and that it is actually forced into Wrinkle. Engle should be ashamed of herself. Bypass this book and read Have Spacesuit instead. It's a much better read by a better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shouldn't even give this book that much credit!","review":"This book was horrible. I should only give it one-quarter of a star.

When you read this book you will know why I couldn't tell you the ending.I gave this book four stars because it kept me awake. I kept on wanting to read a little more. I thought the author Madeleine L'Engle did a great job. She described everything so well. The setting and the characters were pictured in my mind. Except the beginning was a tiny bit confusing.

Thebook could be considered both science fictionand mystery. I enjoyed this book because thethree main characters in the book were tryingto reach what seemed to be an unattainablegoal. They managed to achieve their goal byusing three important qualities, teamwork,hard work, and most importantly love.Unfortunately, the ending in this bookwas not what the reader would have expected.The book came to a sudden end without any ofthe adventure or excitement which came beforeit. The disappointing ending makes this bookdifficult for me to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Book, Terrible Reading","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child. The book holds up, but this recorded version is just terrible. As noted by the other reviewers, the author's less-than-sophisticated accent, utter lack of acting skill, and odd speech issues really take away from the experience. She speaks as if she's clenching her teeth on all the \\"s\\"s, giving the impression of always talking with a mouthful of spit. Some books are described as \\"unreadable\\"; I'd describe this recording as \\"unlistenable\\". The story is still wonderful, though, so if you want to hear it aloud, try a different edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME!I could not put this book down!

But the book's vocabulary and concepts were too difficult to understand (even with a dictionary). Maybe I was dumb, who knows? Now twenty years later, I just finished reading this book from cover-to-cover. It's an interesting book, but the ending is SUPER-abrupt. I expected a show-down between the forces of good and evil. But the story literally came to a screeching halt with the usual \\"love conquers all.\\" Well, I'm not saying that love is a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I just expected a much better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"We won, get over it","review":"It's shocking to reread this book as an adult and realize how Cold War it is. It's almost an anticommunist diatribe, and in this day and age it certainly wouldn't be winning any awards for anything. It's also too Jesus-y for me, but that makes sense when you realize it was written in the McCarthy era: Fear God and hate communists. If you're buying a book for a kid, look for something more contemporary and less all-American."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beloved Classic","review":"I visit this book often, for it is a childhood favorite. I recall that M. L'Engle was told once that the language was too advanced for most children. I'm glad she didn't listen and 'dumb it down'. As an Elementary student, I chose it for the title and became emersed in the story. As an adult, I recognize the quality of storytelling and talent for originality.

The six of them travel in tesseracts (the 5th dimension) together to rescue their father and save a planet.My friend Si-Si recommended this wonderful book to me.

I am 23 and first read this book in 4th grade. I had no trouble tracking the plot or engaging with the \\"slower\\" parts.

I tried to read it to my son when he was five, but he wasn't ready. He's seven now and I can't wait to try again soon. This book has so much to offer, on many levels. You don't need to be a sophisticated person to understand the meaning.One of my favorite things about the book is that the characters show up in other Madeleine L'Engle books. I've read almost all of them. I used to love making diagrams to show how the characters were all related. If you want to start reading her books, this is the one to read first.

During their journey the children discover that Jesus, Buddha and Kermit The Frog are all really the same thing and everyone should hold hands and skip through a field of flowers.

They loved the drama and tension, and appreciated the characters. I was interested in the book and \\"how it was going to turn out,\\" but I have one gnawing problem; I don't understand this book. There are some heavy Christian Biblical references (much appreciated), but this is all juxtaposed with a world of \\"witches,\\" spooky but loving aliens, clairvoyent children, and other things not discussed in Sunday School. It does not have to be understood to be enjoyed (unlike, say, Shakespeare). My kids were gripped right from the mysterious but oddly charming opening scene in the kitchen. Even from just looking around on this product page, one can see that the book has many fans and that it has been taken apart and \\"understood\\" by others; maybe I'll get to that someday.

It is the first and the best of its series and is delightful fantasy of the hightest order. I was delighted to learn that reading it again as an adult, it still had the power to move and amuse in equal order. The author's power of imagination is still quite noticeable as each chapter becomes a little stranger than the last. The book has also lasted because, like any most classics, it does not speak down to children and accepts their ability to absorb much and understand more. It is, though, more religious than I remembered, at times threatening to engulf the fantasy but never quite doing so. This is a book that has earned its beloved status and is still a joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wrinkle in Time, audio book","review":"It's not possible to completely ruin this book, which is a classic, but the author's narration comes close.

The title seemed attractive to my 5th grade teacher a few years ago, so she decided to have us read it as a class. Boy was she in for a surprise. Not even a third into the book she canceled the assignment because of the poor quality of the book. Every five pages the author piled on this and that, this and that, like a fairy tale on crack. It was nearly impossible to concentrate on what was going on. It didn't seem like the author was trying to entertain the reader, but give him or her a tumor. It looks like a two-year-old wrote this. I have read the entire english dictionary in a day, and it was easier to understand and more entertaining than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book i've ever read","review":"da story isnt gud...its sooo confusng...n da only time it gets even a tiny bit interesting is at da very end!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, after all the praise I'd heard","review":"Maybe the problem was that I was too old when I read this book the first time (26), but I was really disappointed. I couldn't really identify with any of the characters, and I felt the book didn't really flow, and it was very formulaic. As a real life scientist, I found the pseudo-science very annoying, even for a fantasy novel. I have re-read other fantasy fiction for children such as Lord of the Rings, the Dark is Rising Sequence, Narnia and I find I still love them as much as when I first read them. I guess this novel didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but dated and overrated","review":"My eight-year old read the book and said it's good - liked Mrs. Whatsit the most. I read the book too. Compared to the other children's books I'm reading with my children, this one is certainly a bit more on the boring side for me.What's good: the plot is still interesting, although the structure is a bit loose and there was too much repetitive tone for my taste. The lesson of love is a good one.What's not: the classic stereotype of the 60s of what the other cultures/worlds are like slightly disturbs me. To the innocent children of today's age, they may not truly appreciate what the author meant to convey. Doesn't matter, really, since I believe today's literature for children is much fuller.Overall, this is an OK book for kids to read for their imagination. However, I think it would be OK if they skip it. I'm not really sure if the book deserves the \\"classic\\" status it holds. Not all rejections from publishers are wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky fiction","review":"I would give this book five stars, but I feel in the beggining of the book, I couldn't understand everyhting that was going on. But otherwise I loved the book! I can't wait to get the next one, A WIND IN THE DOOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrinkle in Time","review":"A Wrinkle in Time is a fantastic Sci-Fi young adults book. It is about discovery of one's self and accepting yourself as you are.The story follows Meg, her brilliant brother Charles Wallace, and her new friend Calvin as they journey through space and behind an evil cloud to find Meg's father. They are assisted by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which, who show the children that they can do anything with the talents (and weaknesses) they have.The reason it didn't receive 5 stars is because the story fell flat in certain places and many times it seemed rushed. Also, my favorite is A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and comparing this book to that one, this book falls short, but only just a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Book","review":"A Wrinkle in Time is a great book. There are many funny, exciting, sad adventures that always kept me stuck to the book. My favorite characters in the book are the three Mrs. W's. They are very mysterious and I loved how the author was creative in making them creatures covered in human form. I recommend this book to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I recently saw the movie version of this, which prompted me to dig out the tattered and much-loved paperback of \`A Wrinkle in Time' which I have kept since grade school.This is the story of Meg Murry, a misfit at school, her brilliant little brother, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe, the unlikely star of the basketball team. These three meet an odd assortment of bedsheet-stealing old ladies, Mrs. Who, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Which. The ladies are not what they appear, and whisk the children away on a quest to find Meg and Charles' missing father on the far-away planet of Camazotz, where everyone is perfectly alike, to their detriment. L'Engle's deceptively simple prose evokes the warmth of love and the chill of fear with equal facility. If you have not read this, you are never too old."},{"rating":"2","title":"provoke your thoughts","review":"Let's start this off by saying that after I read this book I went out and bought the next three in the series. I simply could not put the book down and I found the same with the next three. The story starts off with Meg and her younger brother Charles Wallace. Their father is on a secret government mission and has been gone for a long time. They go on a journey to find him with their freind Calvin and three peculiar women they meet along the way. They tesseract (wrinkle) through space. They find their father, but they have a lot to accomplish before they can save him. I won't give away the ending, but I highly suggest this book. It is for everyone, all ages, religions, races, gender etc.It's a fast read and it's very thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-read","review":"A Wrinkle in time is a great book. All of the aspects are good. It has suspense, fantasy, and a little bit of romance.I would recommend it for kids the ages of 8-10.

Meg has to learn skill at alot of things which she has never mastered. This book deserves a big clap. She has also written A Wind in the Door and A Swifly Tilting Planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sixth dimension, a narrow mind- A Wrinkle in Time.","review":"Well, I've read this book twice. The first time, I had no idea what it meant. Later, I read it again. This time, I understood that A Wrinkle in Time was describing things many people would never percieve until they read this book several times, I did. Madeleine L'Engle was explaining in-depth pictures of the sixth dimension- not an easy task. She did that well, and I admire that. People are extremly narrow minded- but those who do have an open mind would understand the sixth-dimension as a whole, thereby also understanding A Wrinkle in Time, as more than a whole, more than a book... because it in itself is and entire new dimension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for preteens and up!","review":"My fifth grade teacher read this book to my class(over 20 yearsago). I remember I couldn't wait for him to get to reading time eachday. Out of all the books he read this is the only one that stands outin my memory - a wonderful adventure with a heroine named Meg and anevil villain that kidnaps her father. The addition of the vividcharacterization of the three witches that help Meg on her quest tofind her father are both enchanting and attention catching tochildren. A few years ago I picked the book up and actually read it.It is definately a child's book but the nostaglia value was priceless.I definately recommend this book. I can't wait until my children areold enough to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Little World","review":"A Wrinkle in Time is the only book I have read that has the capability to bring me into a completely unique world and accurately describe it. Even the illustrations on some of the paperback versions have accurate depictions of the characters described in the book! :-)I do like the little extras that this book has to offer, such as a theory involving what goes beyond the third dimension, into the fourth dimension (that being time) and then to the fifth dimension, a wrinkle in time, or, as it's referred to in the book, a tesseract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Magical!","review":"I'm not exactly an every day reader, but when I was reading A Wrinkle in Time, I couldn't put it down! It had mystery and fantacy, which are my favorite qualities in a book! The magic in the story made me so interested; it's definately one of the best books I've read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic--One of the best books I've ever read","review":"A Wrinkle in Time reminded me how much fun reading can be. I was never an avid reader, because all the books I was made to read in school were terrible. I hated Treasure Island, and Journey to the Center of the Earth. So, it's surprising that one of my favorite books now, A Wrinkle in Time, wasn't recommened at all. In fact, it was a last resort book for a book report. I wanted to read Roald Dahl's (my favorite author) Henry Surger, but when my teacher replied \\"no\\", I was left with a small book I found. Boy was I in for a surprise. A Wrinkle in Time is so entertaining because you need no knowledge at all to enjoy it. It's so weird. And I love weird. Don't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacks review","review":"so confusing but makes so much sense if you are teacher and you're reading this use this as a read-a-loud!

Although A Wrinkle In Time is juvenile fiction, it is still great literature that can be appreciated by readers of any age. I just hope that I can pass it on to a young person who will love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story - wonderful language - amazing author.","review":"My thoughts:Fabulous story. I have always wanted to read this one and recently had the opportunity to listen to the unabridged audio (read by the author)and am in love with her style.The language is captivating and visual. I was thrilled by the characters. The human characters are interesting and well developed. The non-human characters are something more than I could have ever imagined or created. The story is entertaining and has a depth that I haven't found in ages.This story has a bit of everything; fantasy, science fiction, adventure, coming of age and even just a touch of romance (the true love of the parents and the hint of the possibility of a future romance for Meg and Calvin). The concepts are magnificent. The imagination of the author comes to life in this thrilling tale filled with the power of love, a person's ability to believe in themselves and the idea of faith.I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Awesomest Book I Ever Read!","review":"I highly recommend \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" if you like science fiction because of the traveling through time and the technology on Camozot. I also like it because it teaches you about love and courage. The protaganist, Meg, from planet Earth, with her brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin, they go an adventure to save Meg and Charales Wallace's father. It truly is a great adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming story!","review":"This is a fun story for children! My daughter and son liked this as much as Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches by Robert Stanek. In a Wrinkle in Time, Meg's father disappears mysteriously and some otherworldly visitors get involved with the goings on. Meg's father worked on a secret military project. I also recommend the works of Robert Stanek."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrinkle in Time Review by Stephen Wainwright","review":"A Wrinkle in Time was my favorite book I read this summer and was full of adventure and excitement. I hope this review helps anyone interested in this book. A Wrinkle in time is an exciting book about a girl named Meg Murry, her brother Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin who go out to find Meg's father. Charles met a woman named Mrs. Whatsit and started spending time with her. Mrs. Whatsit lives with two other ladies, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which. She tells them of her father and they go off to a far away land by making a wrinkle in time to save her father. They must fight evil forces like \\"it\\" and the Black Thing but with the help of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which. A Wrinkle in time was a great book and I hope my review helped encourage you to read this fascinating story, and if you do read it, I hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read.","review":"I just recently read this book, and thought it was a spectacular read for both children and adults. The book surounds a mis-fit girl called Meg Murry and her five-year old brother, Charles Wallace whom everyone in town thinks is retarded, but is really a genius. Meg, Charles and their friend Calvin head off on an adventure accompanied by the three Mrs. W's through out the universe in search of their father who was lost in space trying to fight \\"the black thing\\" which was over-powering the universe. They must rely on each other to get through and in the end conquer their fears and are party to a tremendous victory. This book is fantastical and appealing to everybody. It gives hope in an already too real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrinkle in Time is a heart pounding story.","review":"A Wrinkle In Time is a heart pounding story that will capture your interest in a snap! Meg Murry takes her little brother and her friend on an unforgettable journey through time. On the way they meet aliens with tentacles, a huge brain that speaks, three very odd women called Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs.Whatsit, and a man with swirling red eyes.They traveled through a land of things so beautiful you couldn1t even imagine it, a planet that squishes you as flat as paper,and a planet called Camazots where everything is gray and identical - including the people! Meg and her family tesseract through evil and fight one of the strongest powers on earth! Our group would definitely all rate it either a 9 or 10 because it1s such an enjoyable book! We are all sure that you will love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay but not my favorite","review":"I thought the book had a great story line and plot but some parts were just not that great. The ending for one thing moved way too fast; it just went boom boom boom and then the book was over. A part I did like was all the adventures and trouble the children came into, especially Charles Wallace.He and Meg are my two favorite characters but you can't forget Aunt Beast; she is cool too. All the characters were very lovable and funny except for IT and the man with the red eyes. I have read this book two times and I would not mind reading it again but this book just is not my type."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like PLAGIARISM","review":"This book is applauded as a great kid's book, but it is a clear plagiarism of Have Spacesuit Will Travel, by Robert A. Heinlein, written ten years before Wrinkle. Some of the scenes are nearly word for word from his book. The 'theories' of space are ALL Heinlein. How this woman managed to publish this book without a lawsuit is a mystery to me. For those whom have an interest in this book, shelf it and read Heinlein. It's the better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back In Time and Return This!","review":"Who reads this kinda stuff? Ignore and you will be happy. Diffently NOT worthy of winning any award. Meg is so depressing, not to even mention a total bore. That Charles dude is too unbelievable, and is the worst character ever portrayed. Avoid this book at all cost. It also has the uglist cover I have ever seen. I know they say not to judge a book by it's cover, but on this one you might just have to! But the cover isn't important, although it does help. But what's inside this one isn't any better than the front. Last word: AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - Weirded the Kids Out!","review":"Looking back, this was one book I could have done without. I read it to my boys. The villain of the book is an evil heart on a tray pulsing in the middle of a stadium. No joke. A heart on a plate that is evil.Supposedly this book has time travel in it. Nonsense. The sci-fi stuff was the weakest part.I think this book was some sort of religious allegory, but it had no love. No positive vibe. It had no heart. It was filled with weird characters, and it just weirded my boys out. I hated it.I don't recommend this book. It was dissapointing. Instead, try \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\". Or, if you want Sci-Fi... \\"Ender's Game.\\" Or, for kids, a \\"step-into-classics\\" version of HG Wells \\"The Time Machine.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it!","review":"This is an absolutely horrible book. Torture. We bought this as a book on tape to listen to in the car with the kids on a summer trip. All of us (40 yo, 38 yo, 14 yo, 11 yo) were miserable. We forced ourselves to listen to the whole thing because it's a \\"classic\\" and we kept thinking maybe we'd eventually get to some part of the story that would finally explain to us why people like it. During the story, my 14 yo observed that one of the reasons she hated the story was that the author seemed to try as hard as she could to sound intelligent to the listener (reader), but it just came across as annoying. We all ended up hoping that the characters would die in outer space."},{"rating":"1","title":"wierd, depressing and strange. hated it.","review":"yecch!

I loved it back then, back then it blew my mind away to a very weird place. Now that I'm 25, I decided to read it again and see why I loved it so much. All it took was one chapter to find out how dark this book is. I don't understand why they allow these type of books to be given to kids in school, at an age that we don't really know if this is the type of stuff we want to read. What are they trying to make us believe in? This book is full of pageantry, witches, and mediums. Nothing productive, nothing to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Pain","review":"My teacher is making me read this book for class. I love to read, and until now I have never hated a book. The characters are confusing, the plot talks too much about other dimensions, and the story is bery boring. I don't see what is so exciting about this book that everyone loves, and I have always liked fantasy books. I can't wait until this part of the course is over and I don't understand why this is such a classic. If anyone asks me to read another book by this author I would say no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wrinkle In Time","review":"This book to me wasn't very interesting to me.

(Note; I am not a reviewer who gives a synopsis, you can get that anywhere, so if that's what you're looking for you'll want to go elsewhere. I'll just give my opinion, can I do that without you hating me?)Sadly, for me, I just didn't really feel the main character's longing to get her father back. It was like she was more interested in the adventure of the thing and not the purpose of the journey. I also didn't find her that interesting. I haven't dwelled on the characters at all since finishing the book (the real test of a good one, I still ponder Meggie from Inkheart, Bilbo Baggins, Harry Potter, Charlie Bucket and even old Ms. Trunchbull.) I also found myself liking the supporting characters--that clever little brother and the three aliens--more than our leading lady. All in all, still an okay work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"This is what? The sixth or seventh time I've read this book? I admit that its been too long since I've visited my old friends Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace, but the time came with the publication of the 50th anniversary.

As an American living overseas for 10+ years I could not even manage to watch this program and couldn't decide if I was more embarrassed or annoyed. I am really surprised that they were chosen to host this program as they clearly have never traveled further than the strip mall at the end of their block.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this DVD...read the book or buy other DVD's mentioned below.

The older version of the book has the study questions for each chapter at the back of the book, but the newer version puts them at the end of the chapter they're for.The book was easy to read and understand, and it drew out some great points from the Bible text. Each chapter covered a chunk of Philippians that covered a similar theme, but you need to read the Scripture from your own Bible as the verses weren't provided in the actual text of the study. It simply assumed you read the verses that were being talked about.I think this is a great book for any Christian to read. It made some important points that new Christians should hear and older Christians probably could use hearing again. Overall, I'd recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyfulness When Skies are Gray","review":"This book serves as a tremendous guide through the Book of Philippians with insight into the life of the Apostle Paul and his secrets for maintaining joy in the midst of whatever happens in life. These secrets appear as anchors within the heart of individuals to see things from God's point of view in the way of silver linings within dark clouds that may come upon anyone in life. I highly recommend this for Bible Study groups, as well as on an individual study basis.

My husband and I happened upon this movie one Saturday afternoon, and were both mesmerized. Enough has been said of this version/revision? of the Arthur legend by others. I am only so pleased to see a strong, beautiful, woman warrior in Guinevere instead of the romantic, unfaithful version that's been foisted upon me since I first learned of her as a young girl.

I'm not normally a movie critic, and I'm pretty easy to please most of the time. This was just ridiculous though. I can buy Gwenivere as a warrior. I can even buy King Arthur as a Roman soldier or the Knights as Samatian warriors. What I can't buy is everything that goes on between them or the flat shallow portrayal of the his knights or the Saxons. Plus the fact that Lancelot dies before Arthur and Gwenivere even marry.

Based on what? Crank, neo-pagan Celtic nationalism? Of the kind you find in books which have little fairies on their covers and sold alongside incense and candles, tarot cards and claddagh rings in those new-agey shops run by chubby, middle-aged, goddess-worshipping women? This movie is one of the most UNhistorical, chronologically-challenged, Anti-Catholic, over-the-top flicks I've seen in a long while.Not to mention, the acting is so hammy you can make sandwiches out of the DVDs.A waste of my time and interest. I turned it off after suffering through some twenty minutes of what I consider one of the worst movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies ever","review":"Short resume of the movie - a brief action moment - then nothing - nothing - more nothing - more of the same - then /it was 55 minutes from the beginning/ I gave up. I didn't even wait for Keira Knightley to appear. Clive Owen is a good actor, but in this piece of crap he is not even allowed to act. Do not waste Your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd be less disappointed if not for the hype.","review":"Much of the hype surrounding King Arthur was regarding the historical accuracy of this movie. Sadly, setting aside, this movie is on par with \\"First Knight\\" on terms of historical accuracy. Further, the movie was not all that great on its own merits. With a weak plot that often barely strings itself along, the action scenes are often the only redeeming element.In regards to accuracy, please don't confuse the lack of fantastic spells and a magic sword with historical accuracy. The movie is decent in the drama department, strong in the action department. Taken for what it is, it's an okay rental movie, but little more. I've been reading historical facts and theories of Arthur since elementary school, however, and the movie is far off base (Even though it professes \\"new information,\\" which is movie shorthand for \\"we're making stuff up.\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"A watered down Fairy Tale!","review":"King Arthur is a watered down fairy tale that dissapoints greatly, because of what it could have been. This non-myth take on the character has Arthur as a Roman Soldier played dully by Clive Owen, who usually seems more alive, who leads a group of men enslaved to Rome until after thir final mission. It is a waste to talk about the characters, as they are not developed and serve no purpose other than to fight. Keira Knightley does well in her small role, but not enough to save this film. The action scenes, outside of a great fight scene on ice that is about to break, is watered down and boring. The characters are boring and it is obvious by the tacked on ending and flow of the film, that they cut out the gritty scenes in favor of a PG-13 action epic- which onlyn Lord Of The Rings can accomplish. The director's cut won't be perfect, but it may make this film pass for good or at least almost good, instead of entertaining crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Too Many Commercials With No Option Out","review":"King Arthur is an awesome movie, the picture quality is about the same as the DVD version. The problem with the Blu-Ray is that it starts out with too many commercials that you have to watch with no way out. I don't have any other Blu-Rays like that, this is the only one I know of. The DVD version gives you the option to hit the \\"Menu\\" button to go directly to the movie, I went back to the DVD version, don't recommend the Blu-Ray unless you don't mind waiting 15+ minutes to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you're past the...","review":"historically inaccurity of the movie, the out-of-character depiction, and the terrible script work - this movie is still only slightly enjoyable.Although I must give props to the editing, sound, and cinematographer, overall the only redeeming moment in this film is when Knightley makes the sharp reply to \\"Theres a lot of lonely men out there...\\" Her reply: \\"Don't worry, I won't let them rape you.\\"If you aren't looking for a historically accurate piece, or any representation of the times being depicted, then this might suit you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"After hardly being able to watch this film until the end (the Director's Cut doesn't help here), I have to say that I am glad I only took it from the local video store.If you are interested in movies about historcial subjects, watch Braveheart - that's how it should be done. King Arthur has almost no storyline whatsoever and shows almost nothing but battle scenes.

I am more capativated by Beowulf or The Odyssey, tales with epic scale and human cores. But with Arthur, I don't feel it as much, and to get a movie about it done so poorly lowers all hopes for it. As if to insult the intelligence of the audience, Keira Knightley's Guinevere is put on the cover of the posters and DVD, as if the audience could not see the fact that she has about 30 minutes of screen time, thereby making her not a major character. Using someone as gorgeous as her to make money as part of advertisment is insulting; there's no getting around this one. I thought Clive Owen made a good Arthur, but he could not save this atrocity. The battle sequences were a great example of LOTR battle envy and style over substance, something an epic movie should avoid. Watch Braveheart and skip this lame, boring so-called epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $9.00","review":"This movie has nothing to do with the Arthurian legends that we all know and love. The only thing close in the film is the name of Arthur and his knights.The movie is slow. I actually fell asleep early in the film. It is mostly battle scenes and relationship building between Arthur and his knights.The battle scenes were good, though short.If you've seen a bad review somewhere, believe me it is correct. Go see something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Excalibur instead!","review":"If this is the \\"true\\" story, I'll take fantasy anyday.For instance, would you rather see Lancelot as a great swordsman & knight or skinny little guy that complains alot?

Etc etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool battles, not so cool film","review":"This film is interesting for the first 30 minutes or so; then it falters. I am a King Arthur lover-books, films, myth, Malory-yet this was disappointing. I did, however, think that the actor playing Arthur is the most handsome one to ever have played the role. So if that helps the film for you, as it did me, then watch the first hour or so. If not, just see Excalibur, The Mists of Avalon, or read Malory's version of the Arthur story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Romantic Disposition","review":"I love the romance of the old Arthurian legends. (Heck I even love Monty Python's The Holy Grail.)But this revisionist history gore-fest was not for me. Bloody battle scene after bloody battle scene, this movie was obviously competing for the kind of audience garnered by the Lord of the Rings movies. I know life was cheap and bloody in the olden days, but this is not what I associate with King Arthur and Guinevere. If you like big, bloody battles, then you will probably love this movie and be able to overlook the plot holes, inconsistencies and absurdities."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Of Pain","review":"This travesty is an insult to any movie lover particularly those with any inkling of the 'true' Arthur story or even basic reality such as the difficulty that Guinevere would have to go through in order to have eye shadow and makeup in the dungeon where they found her. Even her supposedly messed up hair had all the makings of a day at the spa with Fritz when she tells him \\"Make me look messy yet fabulous.\\"Fuqua has added yet another diappointment to his repetoire after the sizzling Training Day (in retrospect looking more and more like it was Denzel fueled rather than the director's own talent) with this mess. There is no real exceitement here. Arthur has all the emoting abilties of a piece of driftwood and the knights are all your average bawdy badasses who you could care less whether they live or die. Nice to see Guinever's character continuing the annoying trend of period pieces that feel that they need warrior queen sterotypes to portray a strong woman. STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected and boring","review":"Movies, like books, trigger your emotions through the viewers or readers relating to the story and becoming submerged in the plot; \\"King Arthur\\" does absolutely none of this.Through the entire movie, I found that the characters not only didn't have depth but were completely emotionless. It was like watching robots doing day to day activities. With that in mind, It was difficult to care whether or not the characters lived or died.Overall, If you enjoy movies where are completetly detached from the story and want to blow five dollars, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Yes, I sat through it. Fuqua must have watched Braveheart 100 times saying to himself, \\"If we spend a lot, make it really long, throw in a little romance and have ample bloody battle scenes, then we can win an Oscar...it's that simple, right? This hideous beast had the stench of Made for TV rising throughout. The script, muddled with tired recapitulations of freedom speeches and superficial treatment of...well everything, gave no life to this amazing legendary figure and time period. The set designs were cheap looking, the supporting cast lackluster, directing job amatuerish, the music score bland, the sound effects squishy-stabby, battle scenes were nothing but poor imitations of Braveheart. The lead Saxon bad guy King sounded like a biker from Houston who has to be stabbed about 8 times with large sword before he finally dies. And all these are the high points. What an abysmal failure of a film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally different from and worse than what I expected.","review":"If I had not watched the DVD and found that the Authur, Lancelot and Merlin in the movie were completely different from what I had known for years, I would not have checked the reviews here and read the message by the screenwriter that I might have rated the movie one star less.Despite the very contemporary theme about \\"freedom\\" (and made the story not that believable), and the very weak storyline of the friendship and love between Arthur and Lancelot, Arthur and Guinevere (Keira Knightley), Lancelot and Guinevere, the directorship and cinematography are substandard. I made no attempt to compare it with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. However, I must say that Gladiator and Braveheart are much better. Few fans of ancient war stories would be satisfied, I bet.Anyway, marginally acceptable for rental only. Dont buy it. In fct, if it were not for Owen and Knightley, I might not have been able to finish watching it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the same league as Gladiator.","review":"I have no problem with the concept of this movie, however the execution was poor. Clive Owen is simply unconvincing, he just comes across as too weak when you compare him to the other knights. I just could not understand why they would follow him, as he didn't convey the charisma that a strong leader would definitely possess. I think he is a good actor but he was mis-cast in this role.The cinematograhpy of the big battle set pieces was good, however the other scenes come across as flat, and the camera work is iffy.The screen play again had some good ideas but they were just not brought together very well. It just seemed disjointed---maybe this was the editing.Compared to Troy and Gladiator this movie is definitely 2nd rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is BAD.","review":"Well if your a fan of Excalibur then this movie really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Give me a break with the modern day politically correct garbage. Keira Knightley seems to have left the set of Pirates of the Caribbean and on to this one. She reminds me of Orlando Bloom where she over acts her role.This is an MTV world movie made for an MTV world. Why not just have Guinevere possess excalibur and be done with it? Don't even bother with it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.If you want a King Arthur movie, watch Excalibur. That's how it should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing","review":"King Authur was worth seeing. The real King Authur was not the romantic, chivarlous knight protrayaed in \\"Le Morte de Authur,\\" but a Briton king during the time this movie is set. This movie gives a probable alternative to the myth that has become popular. The movie was action packed and multi-layered. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The only thing worse than Clive Owens'acting is the crappy faux history presented in this movie. Leave it to some 21st century hollywood knucklehead to think that he can re-write classical literature and do a better job of it. The first fight scene is fun but every additional fight scene becomes ubsurd. This climaxes in a final battle that includes characters dressed in what looks to be Chinese and Japanese battle dress. One character even sword fights in the samurai style. The choreography of the samurai guy and main bad guy is excellent and the main bad guy wins. Then up comes Arthur and the choreography drops to levels of luke and darth in the first star wars movie, basically reproducable by any children with brooms. Of course Arthur is able to win with his inferior swordplay. I would recommend reading any of the Mary Stewart Arthurian stuff or The Green Knight or watching excalibur instead. Heck go get the animated disney movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Guenivere","review":"What I liked best about this film is that is managed not to rehash a lot of tired Christian-ethic inspired morality about Guenivere. The traditional version is so appallingly anti-female, the whole story a chastisement about the weak, inconstant Woman whose lust and lack of discipline brings down the Noble Christian King and all his Good Works. What rot. This film at the very least shows Guenivere as a strong person, a warrior and defnitely a Player in the whole story, chosing which man she wants and not waiting on the battlements waving her kerchief waiting to be rescued."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling view of King Arthur","review":"For those truly into Arthurian lore this is an interesting variation with several important historical facts to back up the film.I found the story to be lacking in several places and the character development was weak for several characters (Merlin, Lancelot, Guineverre), however the central theme was intriguing to me.Much different from the Disneyland feel of \\"First Knight\\" and the campy feel of \\"Excalibur\\", I enjoyed this dvd very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast, horrible script and movie.","review":"I rented this film just because my fave Clive Owen was in it. But man, this movie was so horrible. Very boring, no real storyline and no depth to it. The acting was ok. Ioan Gruffudd (starred in Fantastic four as Jessica's love in the movie) did an amazing job though in his part. I wish he wasent killed at the end.I didnt recognize him in this movie.

It was probably more historically accurate than any of the plethora of other Arthurian works on film. I have no complaint concerning the quality thespianism demonstrated here. The direction was excellent, the photography was wonderful, and I even managed to appreciate the camera angles, CGI used in fog creation, etc.I don't know about anyone else, but I -like- Magick in my mythology. Magick is in all mythology; even christian. It's called something else, of course, but it's all Magick, just the same.While I enjoyed this attempt, it just was not the Legend of King Arthur I embrace. The Magick and mysticism are gone from it, and it lost all attraction for me. It felt like watching Spiderman with no powers, or Superman when he couldn't fly. It completely failed to capture imagination due to its having none of its own.If you felt like I did, I highly recommend John Boorman's \\"Excalibur.\\" That was a magickal endeavor in the name of King Arthur."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW SAD","review":"At the begining it was misleading, cause i thought there was going to be Roman legions fighting against the English and he would change sides, but no, ROme does nothing at all in this pieck of crap.Basicly, its a crapy movie with a low budget, ugly girl(really, if you wanted a tom girl get someone who can act at least), cheep actors, bad story, and puthetic special effects. The only thing it did have was that a lot of people came in HOPING it would be different. To be fair though, Arthur was not too bad an actor, and with real special effects, he could really play a knight or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too little...","review":"Am I the only person who saw this film, who also happened to read the \\"Camulod Chronicles\\" by Jack Whyte?

These other reviews are several paragraphs long, and I know I was getting tired looking at all of them. Just state your opinon and get on with it. We don't need a play by play of all the historical innaccuracies that ever occurred in every single movie ever made. When you can prove to me that Arthur was a real person and his exact life history is written on paper, then I'll jump on the bandwagon. But right now, it's all myth and legend. You can say whatever you want about what he supposedly did and what happened, but it's not fact. The reason so many peeps don't like the movie, is because the story didn't go along with the stories they're heard before and the stories they're used to. So just enjoy the movie for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"I appreciate the story based on the latest research","review":"The story is based on the latest research about the origins of Arthur. I enjoyed the movie and the characters. The characterizations feel more real to me than the usual fare. The girl was great to look at but didn't add much to the story. I bought the Director's cut not for the violence which is not necessary but to get more information about the basis for the screenplay.I recommend that you use this movie as a jumping point for additional research into the origin of the Arthur mythology"},{"rating":"2","title":"A United Kingdom","review":"I won't dwell on a synopsis of the film, as you can read that in many of the 400 reviews here.It's an very good film, especially rousing to a brit, like me.

Though I always thought of King Arthur as belonging to a later period, this movie does a decent job of capturing a much earlier period in history where Rome still ruled most of Europe.Arthur and his men had been promised to be allowed to retire from \\"military\\" life are called back for one more mission. They need to rescue a nobel held captive. Though none of them want to do it, the knights loyal to Arthur will do it just to stand by him one more time.The battle scenes are epic, reminicient of some of the battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The forest people are incredibly interesting and I wish the movie could have expanded on them more.Though this movie may not be suited for a \\"sequel,\\" a prequel would definately be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Antoine Fuqua rocked just as he did on Training Day. Most reviews which are very negative on this movie is because they lack the ability to let go of their trained mind....unable to adapt to a fresh approach.

All the characters did a great job at bringing the story to life. However, Lancelot's character disappointed me very much. That was Arthur's right hand man. He was not supposed to oppose Arthur's decision nor criticize his religion. And then he died. But, other than that, it was a wonderful show.

Modern research seems to indicate that rather than destroying the natives, the invading Angles and Saxons settled amongst and intermarried with the native Britons.Also,the first Anglo-Saxons were invited to Britain as mercanaries by the Britons. The 'Anglo-Saxons' of later centuries were the decendants of both culturally Anglo-Saxonized Britons and the invading Anglo-Saxons.3.The battle of Badon Hill takes place in southern England not in the north.4.The Picts were the enemies, not the allies of the Britons and part of the reason why the Britons hired Angle and Saxon mercanaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Arthur for Pagans!","review":"King Arthur is now a pagan knight who battles the evil Saxons and Christian church.Arthur is a cavalry auxiliary for the Romans as they abandon Britain.

The battle scenes were staged to mimic those in LOTR but with Saxons instead of Orcs only with the Orcs being FAR more interesting foes than the Saxons were. The actor playing Arthur delivered his lines as if he were a wooden statue instead of a live person and his merry band of knights appeared to be rejects from every lame TV docu-drama or western ever filmed. When they were sitting at the round table near the beginning of the film, I kept expecting them to break into the Knights of the Round Table song and dance scene from the Monty Python movie.Really, not a very good movie, I'm afraid.

I've watched most of Bruckheimer's (sp?) movies, but wouldn't consider myself a big fan of his...most of his movies seem a bit flat to me.This movie was different, in that it portrayed relationships and passion and decisions and freedom.I certainly had a few quibbles with it (a Pictish warrior woman would wear THAT into battle?), but again, those fall beside the point.I enjoyed this movie and was impacted by it.

Absolute gold. Buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TRACK LISTING IS WRONG! ! ! ! ! ! ! !","review":"I bought this specifically to get a copy of CD2 Track 2 - Secret Star (Renaissance Dub) by House of Zakkariyas. Imagine my dissapointment then when it arrived only to find that CD2 has only 7 tracks on it - not 8 as listed - and guess which one is not on there?!!!It's a really rare track so I was delighted to find it but have now just spent $30 for no reason at all - how does that happen??All please note, Track 2 on the listing is NOT on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting the World of Progressive Trance On Hold","review":"I must agree with the majority of reviewers in regards to this album...it is difficult to deny the quality and skill of this remix. For this fact alone, I truely can appreciate Sasha's Involver.However, I wasn't overly thrilled with the track selection. For the most part, Sasha's talent for intricate and complex multilayering of sound shines through. This significantly improves on the original releases of many of the tracks featured on Involver. The difference for me in reviewing this album? Despite Sasha's (improved) remixed versions, the original tracks transform from average to very good...just not spectacular.Overall I give this album 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sasha brings progressive house forward yet again. . .","review":"Not what you might expect, but musical perfection nonetheless. . . Quite a masterpiece. A departure from Airdrawndagger. . . More pace, more variety, more Sasha. Hard to describe exactly how this session differs from other works. Breakbeat influences are welcome and timely (see Therapy Sessions for more of thie genre) but all-in-all everything just works. Sasha's work for the first time rivals GU:013, which says this is a must-have. Not the biggest fan of his live (was tooled out of his gourd the last time I saw him live) but he still has his finger on, and actually is pressing his finger on the vein creating the pulse of, this genre we call Prog house.Enjoy with patience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album","review":"This Album is great, it's catchy and upbeat. Slow and down tempo when it needs to be. All the tracks are excellent and placed in just the right spot. Buy this album, you won't regret it. It's Sasha. I love all the songs, especially Talk Amongst Yourselves, These ays, and Burma (my favorite). I'd give each song 5 or higher. This is my second listen and the only track I don't like really is Watching Cars Go By. Which case I'd give it a 3.5. It's ok but it's kinda annoying. But it was worth the 10 dollars at best buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SASHA'S BEST BY FAR!!!!!!!!","review":"This is easily in my opinion one of the best albums ever made, if you are a Sasha fan at any rate this is his blessed album. I've listened to all from Fundacion to his Digweed callabs and from track one to the last track it keeps it's sweet ear and soul pleasing magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5","review":"I own over a hundred trance/progressive house CD's from Sasha, Digweed, Oakenfold, Deep Dish, Sander Kleinenberg, Danny Howells, etc. etc. etc. and this is in the top 5 of my entire collection. This grows on me with every listen and it hasn't left the CD player since I bought it when it was first released. If you liked CD1 of Nick Warren's 'Reykjavik', you will love this even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mind Of Sasha...","review":"He shares his heart and soul through music. The music is a joyful noise to the world. One can't help but move to it with gladness to be alive. My Bettas, Warrior Clan, chill to it; and don't like themselves, much less any other. I will continue to support his success. Hopefully, he will not have the same end as Mozart or Elvis. Thank you very much -Elvis 1964."},{"rating":"1","title":"all mashed up","review":"I love sasha and all he has done for the scene but jesus, he kills all of these perfectly good songs with his new realtime remix tech.

Is this perhaps old, experimental trash recordings that someone threw together to satisfy a contractual agreement? This is NOT the Sasha who made ADD-nonono!And that crapola packaging? Call me a b*st*rd, but I was so aggravated with the \\"case\\" and the moronic, pointed, \\"photos\\" that I pitched the whole freaking thing while I was on the bridge.

Electronica cannot get any better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sistine Chapel ??","review":"You would anticipate your descent into hell to be intense and foreboding. Likewise as you stand in acceptance before the gates of paradise one should be filled with light. With titles like \\"wailing\\" and \\"gnashing\\" you would expect massive musical arrangements to unfold as we stand transfixed between the gates of heaven & hell. This music should act as an intermediary between rapture and tragedy. No Sibyl songs here... Fripp synthesized his guitar beyond recognition into some hybrid church organ missing some bellows. Electric guitar organs wax and wane through a shallow soundscape. Never inciting feelings that might bring us closer to promiced divine realities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altered conciousness","review":"True Story: I went to bed and put this CD on. The next day my roommate told me he had been standing in the kitchen and felt completely disoriented from this sound in his 'head'. It wasn't until he passed by my room that he realized the music was from my stereo. He thought he was having an acid flashback. That's the best way I can describe this sound - it's wonderful and relaxing - like a soundtrack to a space movie. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lightlessness of Power","review":"When restarting his solo career in earnest in 1994, Robert Fripp updated his Frippertronics technique with digital technology - instead of tapes - to create loops of sounds.The Soundscapes projects included six CD releases of new material and a \\"single\\" collection, which includes three selections from this release.The cutting-edge textures are oftentimes quite metallic and non-melodic, but Fripp is attempting to expand the potential of the electric guitar. Not for the faint of heart, the exploration delves deep into the darkness of the soul, but leaves the listener with the task of finding the way back home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. James","review":"I guess it had a moral/plot.

This book is thought out and put together in both content and style. It's a piece of art, but it's packed with real substance: that is to say, the recipes are extremely tasty! There aren't a ton of recipes here, which is a good thing because the author obviously got the chance to use only his favorites.

There were two or three pretty good, jump up whoa buddy moments but the thing looked like it was a high school film project. The story was okay, but the acting was a joke and there were a ton of unexplained situations. You are better off seeing any other movie out there (Except for Eyes Wide Shut, THE WORST MOVIE EVER)."},{"rating":"1","title":"stunning? scariest? haunting? Give me a break","review":"Who in the hell comes up with these ridiculously overated \\"reviews\\" listed on the cover of this movie. Are these people paid to write these lies about a movie they have obviously never seen? For if they have, they surely could not in all good consciousness mislead us so blatantly. Do the people responsible for perpetuating these so-called editorial reviews think we are stupid? At best, this is a made for tv movie or series episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I even write less than one star?","review":"This was the lamest, most boring movie I have ever seen. It was so bad I couldn't even laugh at it,it was just that bad. When the filmmaker put it together did he really imagine anyone would like it? Did he even like it? I highly doubt it. The acting and special effects were so poor I couldn't even begin to describe it. I should buy myself a digital camera and make a terrible movie; maybe I could just film myself getting out of bed everyday,seems about as good of an idea as Avalos making another film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"This is a terrible piece of [...] that isn't worth your time no matter who you are. The fact that it is shot on video makes it worse. Besides Cradle Of Fear, NOTHING good has EVER been SOV and this is no exception.

I had picked up 7 movies at 3 dollars a piece and was sure after reading the blurbs on the back of this one that I had hit the undiscovered jackpot (As i had felt grabbing \\"sleepaway camp\\" which I had already seen and loved\\" Anyhoo.. so I get home and I load it up and sit back...the quality of sound and video is not the worst I've seen, the acting is some of the worst though, the best actor in the film said maybe 2 lines. I found the movie predictable and had lot's of \\"tension\\" built up but never went anywhere. In several scenes I found myself being \\"anxious\\" waiting for the \\"BIG SCARE\\" and then it just never came. The effects were decent most of the time but really not the best however there were maybe only 3 or 4 \\"spooks\\" ... I dunno, if yer out of movies to see, see it... I wouldnt spend more than the 3 I spent on it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS ONE HORRIBLE WASTE OF ENERGY","review":"All I can say about this film is DO NOT waste the money on it. The acting is incredibly horrible - the effects are so-so, the lighting is even worse (looks like they shot with existing light with very little sculptural lighting) and highlights are overexposed. You can tell that this waste of energy was not created on quality film or high quality digital. My girlfriend and I both fell asleep through it and continued it the next day (for justifying the expenditure) and turned it off before it ended. You would think AT LEAST they would have had a nice boob shot to make up for the lack of creativity everywhere else....BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! The actress/model they starred in it should have aimed a little higher. She's an attractive looking actress, and it's a shame she couldn't have been in a better movie. The plot of this is horrible....and I won't even go into it to bore you to death...all I can say is DON'T WATCH IT....stick with the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really BAD!!!","review":"Ok, I am very tolerant of B-movies and find most movies that I watch to be very interesting.

Move on to a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing about this movie......","review":"The best thing about this movie is the case it came in. This is quite possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong...I love some of the \\"B\\" rated movies from yester-year, they are classics....but this movie was just plain horrible. It looks like an eighth grader made it with his/hers parents video camera. This was the one and only time I ask my video store for a credit because the movie was unwatchable. I kept hoping it would get better...but it didn't, so I turned it off. Don't waste your money even renting it. It doesn't even deserve one star but since they didn't offer a zero I gave it a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This was a real piece of crap. I could only get thru about 12 minutes of it. The only reason I got it was that my interest was aroused after reading about it Western Clippings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok story---stupid ending","review":"The movie is ok for being ultra low budget. The acting is low grade to poor...often wooden at times. It's the kind of acting you have to use your imagination with and then it becomes great acting. The plot is slow moving and is paced even slower with the acting.The only redeeming fact was a few of the ghost scenes were creepy. I liked the little boy staring through the broken fence. That was the creepiest.The end was confusing. I didn't understand why one of the leads was walking the streets crazed and the other driving a car there as if he had never been there before. I didn't get it, but then, by this point, it really doesn't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ghosts of Amateurville","review":"Honestly, the DVD cover image is the best thing about this movie. It was shot in the real Edendale area of Los Angeles (now Echo Park/Silver Lake), and the scenery tends to chew up the cast, all of whom are film school quality actors. There are a few decent moments, but most of it is obvious and unthrilling, and like most amateur films it is acted with that sloooooowwww portentousness that makes it look like it was filmed underwater. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like Her Others","review":"I Love Rachel Gibson's books. I've read every one of them, but I have to say I was rather disappointed with this book. It was very slow and very difficult to get into. If you want to read a good Gibson book, read \\"Truly Madly Yours\\" and \\"True Confessions\\". Those two books were awesome and really kept you on your feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"It must be Rachel Gibson--I loved it!","review":"Pure escapist, fun entertainment by one of my favorite contemporary romance authors. The main characters were made for each other! Both were funny and vulnerable --and adorable. Very likeable main and secondary characters (loved Joe's family), great dialog and a plot that moved along quite nicely. One complaint: I read it in one sitting and finished with it much too quickly. Wish I didn't have to wait another year for Rachel's next book. This was as good as her first book, Simply Irresistible, which is one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this...","review":"I disliked both of the main characters.

The romance was realistic and the dialoge was funny. A great read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar and Verbal Abuse","review":"I'm a big fan of Rachel Gibson and loved her previous books. However, IT MUST BE LOVE made me sick to my stomach. If you love a filthy-mouthed, rude, verbally abusive hero who is obsessed with his male body parts, then I guess this book is for you. If any man ever spoke to me the way Joe talks to Gabrielle, he'd be missing half his teeth. Joe treats her like dirt and talks to her like an immature high school boy throughout the entire story, then we're supposed to believe he becomes sensitive enough to recognize her as his other half in the last 5 pages? Sorry, I didn't buy it for a minute. And I'll never buy another of Ms. Gibson's books. If this is \\"realistic\\" romance, give me fantasy any day. No woman deserves to be talked to or treated like this by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"It wasn't so much the bland writing or the feeling that I've read this story before, but that the hero and heroine seemed more like high school kids dealing with issues most likely found on the school playground than adults.Reactions were over the top, and at times I wanted to smack some sense into the heroine. I welcome a variety of characters in my literature, but Gabrielle was far too flighty and clueless for my taste. Joe was overbearing, pushy, and crude. Hey, love alpha males, just don't like reading about obnoxious ones. I couldn't buy the premise of how these two came together, or how they stayed together for that matter.If you're looking for a cleverly written book involving a flaky heroine and a tough as nails cop, then read Jennifer Crusie's \\"Getting Rid of Bradley.\\" It's far more entertaining and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't come close to her prior two books!","review":"I loved this author's prior two novels. However, this one just slightly engaged my interest. It never came together for me as a romance either plus I didn't particularly like the characters. Although this is my most recent \\"read\\" of hers, I already remember it in far less detail than her prior two novels! That is not a good sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opposites do attract","review":"I have just discovered Rachel Gibson's books and am happily reading and re-reading several of them..

This book had wonderful, witty dialogue ..... however, I honestly didn't care for Joe's character....,he's not one I ever would have been attracted to, especially with his raunchy mouth...In spite of that, I found myself laughing outloud many times while reading it......It had cute one liners, energetic characters, good storyline, and quite a \\"sexy\\" read.....I'm sure this will appeal more to the younger, more liberal-minded readers.."},{"rating":"2","title":"HER BEST BOOK!","review":"I have read all of Gibson's books and I thought that this one was her best book.

This one comes so close to being at the top of my list. It takes off on page one and doesn't stop.....you will laugh, love and smile your way through this story. Best hero and heroine yet. I loved everything about them AND Ms. Gibson's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"A good romance, but not as much plot or character development as her first two books (Simply Irresistible and Trudy Madly Yours).

I have read 8 of her books in the last two weeks...most I read in 1 day or 2 at the most. It Must Be Love was slow from the start. I just didn't get sucked in like I have with all of her other books. It took me 5 days to finish this book and I almost just stopped but I hate not finishing a book. It just isn't very good. The plot is simple, the characters were ok, the writing was fine...just kind of blah. If you are a Rachel Gibson fan, skip this one. If you have never read her before, give one of her other books a shot. She is a great storyteller, but this book just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel Gibson Classic","review":"Read this book years ago.Was excited for its rerelease on Kindle and even happier to realize it was as good as remembered.The relationship dynamic between Joe and Gabrielle is too cute for words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humerous and Romantic","review":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book as her last two were keepers. This one is a keeper also. She blends romance and humour well. The tension between the two was definetly there and kept things hot.

A very fun CD, ideal for the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this monitor...the battery doesnt hold a charge at all...even after 24 hours of charging...the picture isnt very clear (maybe I expected too much?)...reception is lousy if you have a cordless phone, wireless network or cell phone nearby (and who doesn't, these days?). I was very disappointed in the quality of this item, especially considering the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating as hell, doesn't work half the time","review":"We are on our second unit. The first unit was replaced with a refurbished one by the manufacturer at our expense after developing an issue where it would magically drop the connection to the camera.We would have to move it around an inch or two, jiggle the switches, etc. to get it to work again.The replacement unit developed the same problem. It is most frustrating when in the middle of the night when it stops working -- the last thing I want to deal with is making this stupid thing work at 2 am. There are some serious design issues with this device. I am ready to throw this out of the window, but I like my windows and it is cold outside to open them.Save yourself the hassle and invest $80-$100 in a real security camera. I can't wait for mine to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours is also losing the sound after only 1 year","review":"It's never been dropped or abused and yet similar to another reviewer, our monitor is losing the sound more and more. It goes in and out when the volume knob is turned. We have only had this a year and paid $176 for it. WAY too high priced for this kind of thing to happen. I would expect this from a $50 monitor not one that costs nearly two hundred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for about 6 months -- then the battery dies","review":"Given how expensive this product is, I was shocked to find that within 3-4 months of having owned it, the battery life started to quickly wither down. After 6 months, you could no longer use the wireless monitor without being physically plugged in. It has gone from being a wireless monitor to an entirely wired monitor. The battery at this point holds NO charge at all. It won't even last for 10 seconds without dying if it's not plugged in. I have complained to Summer Customer care and will see if they fix this (if they do, I will revise my rating, since otherwise, the product is good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO PRIVACY","review":"I thought this was a great monitor for a few weeks. The reception is good and the picture is clear. Then one evening, my husband took our son to his crib and I switched on the video monitor. On the screen, was another person's child sleeping peacefully in her crib. When I switched the monitor to Channel B, I could see two people in a toddler bed, enjoying a nighttime story. I was horrified! I couldn't help but wonder who could see my baby, or if anyone had seen me nursing him during the past few weeks.When I called Summer Infant Products, they were aware of the problem. They are sending me a digital monitor to replace the one I have. I am glad they are replacing my monitor, but I still feel uncomfortable about the incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"We returned it the same week!","review":"After reading all the mixed reviews, I decided that the only way we were going to be able to decide was to try it out for ourselves. Needless to say, the monitor was sent back the very same week. We could only be in the next room and get a clear picture, and even that was 'iffy'. We were sorely disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"This was the 2nd Summer Infant Monitor I have purchased as the first one broke....this one broke too!!!

At midnight one night I got a static feed and when it cleared I was looking at another baby, not mine that was right across the hall. When I called Summer's \\"Fantastic\\" customer service they basically said that's the way it works and I was out of luck. This is really expensive and not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned two and both died","review":"Although I have LOVED being able to see and hear my baby, I have not liked the fact both monitors (the second purchased after the first one started failing) have broken within a little over a year of purchase. The video basically starts flipping vertically or doesn't come on at all. There has to be some kind of manufacturing flaw for them to both die in the same way at about the same time following purchase.I am now addicted to being able to see my child but will be trying the new digital mobi cam when it ships. Hopefully it will have a longer life than either of the monitors I have purchased from Summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible range","review":"What a scam! Yet another completely overpriced device for what it is and does. If you live in a building of any substance (brick walls for example) this monitor has a range of 20-30ft. It's completely useless. Unfortunately all these baby monitors suffer from this limitation. And there's really no reason. In the UK they sell two way walkie talkies with a room monitoring function. You can be at your neighbor's and still here your baby's breathing. And they cost $80."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy, radio interference and signal errors","review":"_We send back two of these before realizing that the problem was the model itself.

Highly recommended for whelping (and human babies too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor","review":"This is a must-have!!!!! Great monitor, although we needed a new one after 1.5 years.

The picture quality is very poor and the monitor is difficult to view from various angles. The screen would not operate on battery power after the first week of use. We bought a Q-see monitor for $99 from Costco and have been much happier with the performance and picture quality.Pros:1. adjustable camera angles to accomodate various mounting positions2. little interferenceCons:1. poor image quality2. limited video capability in battery mode3. poor contrast on monitor4. expensive"},{"rating":"2","title":"2007 monitor better than 2006","review":"This is a much better monitor than last years video monitor.

Though at almost two hundred dollars back in 2010, it still feels like we didn't get our money's worth. Now they want us to pay $80 for a refurbished unit with a six-month warranty. The process for getting the replacement is pretty streamlined, but that should tell you something about HOW MANY of their products break once outside the warranty period.***July 2012 update -- now the refurb unit is mostly broken. Lasted five months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working with little use","review":"I purchased this monitor before my daughter was born as I had heard from other parents that video monitors were helpful and this one wasn't too pricey compared to some. However, I only used it once or twice until my daughter was about 11 months. At this point I began to use it 3-4 times per week for her naps and while it was working I was pleased with it. Then it stopped working when she was about 13 months old. First the video went out, but I still had the sound, then about a month later the sound stopped working, too. At that point I contacted summer infant to see if they could help me to figure out what was wrong or give me a full or partial refund or a new unit. This was in September, it is now January and I have still not heard from them. I would not recommend this product due to its lack of longevity and complete absence of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"No range/a lot of static","review":"We are next room to the baby and still get a lot of static on our receiver.

Night vision quality is also better than expected. The sound quality is also excellent. Camera swivels and rotates to give you plenty of angles.

The first one we took with us on vacation and the video monitor screen failed. I thought it was a fluke and retured it.The second one I purchased about two months ago and is completely useless. It is entirely static because of some interference with either the cordless phone or the wireless internet connection in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not seem to get it.","review":"Unfortunately, I was not able to get good reception. It does not seem to work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of JUNK!!!","review":"The picture is great if you want to sit and stare at the monitor like you would dial a phone. You must be very close to see what's going on. Lots of Interference. But when you get good reception, the audio is incredibly clear! A little color during the times of bright daylight. The video portion broke on the fourth day. Will return and exchange for another brand!!! If it seems a little too good to be true... It is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound. Audio does this nicely. Video only works if you watch it, and if it has audio, as this one does, then why even HAVE video?? Video is an unnecessary expense, because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway? There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway!!!! Save the $ and get an audio. As someone else pointed out, reception isn't always good on this model either. Sell yours on ebay, spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor, and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need more sleep...get one of these!","review":"At first, I thought it overbearing or unnecessary to have a video monitor. What happened to the olden days when they didn't have anything? Well, my thoughts have changed. I love this monitor! I can peek in on my daughter with out disturbing her. And at night when she is fussing in her sleep, I can check on her with out getting out of bed. As a new and first time mom...I need to stay in \\"sleep mode\\" as long as possible. The monitor works great. I did have to move my cell phone and charger off the same table as the video monitor but the relocation was worth the advantage the monitor gives me at night. Every once in a while I will get a little static but it's nothing compared to our first monitor. As for the \\"color\\" monitor...at night you can't see the color...but that wasn't a big deal to me. I can see my baby and that's what matters...I already now she is dressed Pretty in Pink ;~) This monitor is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love this monitor!","review":"I received this as a gift and I love it. My daughter is 6 months old now and this product was so helpful during sleep training as well as those nerve racking newborn days. I can \\"peek in on her\\" with out disturbing her. When she was learning to fall asleep on her own I was able to see that she was ok without running into her room and waking her all the way up everytime she let out a cry. The monitor works all over my house includding the basement and even out in the yard. The only thing that I don't like is that it will let out a loud static sound from time to time. It is also pricey...but if you can swing it GO FOR IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that is says it is........","review":"The reception for this monitor is horrible. My bedroom is 2 rooms away from my daughters and the receptions cuts in and out. When it cuts out, it makes this awful noise. There is NO color to this monitor. I wish I had bought another one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Personally, I have been very unhappy with this monitor. I bought one from Amazon recently. When it arrived, no matter what I did it wouldn't get any picture. Both the Channels were interchanged, meaning that the camera would have to be set on one channel and the handset on the other to get \\"any\\" picture or audio.I thought that I had recevied a lemon and got a replacement from Amazon. After receiving the second unit, i didn't face the problem with the swapping of the channels ( or I wouldn't have known ) because it wouldn't get any picture on either channels.I have to say the audio part of the monitor worked well in both the units, but why pay $182 for an audio monitor?So, personally I cannot give this one a good review based on my experience. I am however very impressed with the replacement policy and the easy procedure from Amazon. KUDOS to Amazon...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"We got this after a traumatic month of sleep training.

We have a 3700 Sqft home and does not work everywhere in the house....not good..When our 900 hz phone is used, it kills unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 6 months, now it is a sound monitor.","review":"When it worked, it was pretty good. Don't expect too much. The video quality is at best comparable with but still inferior to a cheap $15 webcam. But, it does let you know what your baby is doing. However, this product is far less relaible than a cheap webcam. After 6 months, out of no reason (I didn't change any thing, didn't touch the camera), the video is scrambled, and I can only receive scrambled video from the receiver on channel A while the transmitter is on chanel B. So, it is pretty much a sound monitor now."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Range","review":"This was the second video monitor we purchased. The range and video quality were horrible! the picture was all grainy hard to see and the range was ridiculous. Literally walked out of one room and the signal died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a year...","review":"We purchased this product in December 2009. We have been happy with its reception and the screen nice. However, after about a year we had to order a replacement charger because the charger connector broke. Then after about 15 months, the speaker began to die. We now have to spend 2-3 minutes adjusting the volume button to get anything but silence. We do run a white noise machine in our baby's room when he is sleeping, so the speaker gets lots of use, but I expected such an expensive to last as long as I would want to monitor my child. When I called customer service today (and sat on hold for 30 minutes) I was told it is out of its one year warranty so the best they could do was to let me purchase a refurbished version of the same monitor from their website. Moral of the story, if you expect to need a monitor more than a year, this is probably not the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last for the price","review":"I love Amazon for its reviews, but I've learned the hard way that some things that used to be great - and therefore have high ratings - are no longer so hot.This monitor is one of them. It was great at first, but just didn't last long enough considering the price. The sound becomes really staticy. The audio goes in & out - and you have no way of knowing this unless you stare at the monitor.The video is now going out. We ordered a replacement battery and that helped for about a month.This is a $200 monitor that lasts like a $75 one."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a year poor volume control","review":"After about a year of using the monitor the volume control wheel has problems. As you turn it or sometimes when it is sitting on the table the volume will cut in and out like there is a short circuit in the volume knob. The first one, after about 9 months, we returned to Summer and they replaced it with no problem. The second one is doing the same thing so we are going to try to replace it. However I think we've had it just over a year so I don't know if they will.Other than that is it a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static & Interference","review":"I am not impressed with this product. I bought it after all the positive reviews, and because of the dual camera feature. Unfortunately, I get no reception at all on channel B, and on channel A the audio is so staticky, even in good reception that we'd never be able to sleep. By the time we get the handheld to our bedroom, the picture is extremely snowy and only works if carefully positioned in one spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy ever!!","review":"Have two of them; one for each of my toddlers.

We've had it about 3 months and for the past 4 weeks, we've been having this problem. The video turns to awful static as soon as they get a dial tone and I can hear their entire conversation from the first number they dial until they hang up! Of course I'm polite and turn off the monitor until I think they might be done talking, but it's almost as if I am on the phone with them too when I have it on! With only 2 channels to pick from, it's pretty much impossible to avoid this problem! It also picks up interference from truckers going by. The weird thing is that it doesn't pick up MY cordless phone conversations, even though my phone is a 2.4 Ghz model. If I had known interference was going to be this big of a problem I would not have purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the color?","review":"I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing this monitor.

The monitor has lost it's picture after only a year and the overall quality of this less than expensive product is not worth the money in my opinion. Also, the company does not offer a replacement monitor, they only offer a replacement camera which is not helpful when the montior, which is often moved from room to room in our house is what takes the wear and tear, whereas the monitor remains immobile for the most part and would often not need replacing.

Then we realized that wasn't her crib on the monitor. We were picking up a clear picture and not to mention sound from 7 houses down.

Also, I find the screen to be so small that it is difficult to see anything. We returned it. We now have 2 of the original models...one for each baby's room.

I WILL BE RETURNING IT TODAY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"We purchased this monitor after deciding the black and white model was not convenient because the monitor was too big. The idea of a handheld monitor was perfect. However, we had a lot of trouble with the reception and kept getting a lot of static wherever we had the receiver. During the night, the receiver would randomly blare static, which made sleeping using it very annoying. We ended up sending it back and scrapping the whole video monitor idea. We now use a regular non-video one and have no trouble. I decided I didn't need to see the baby all the time after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't leave it on too long!!!","review":"I have had this monitor for over a year now and did love it, until recently. I usually sleep with it next to me in bed while it charges, however when it is plugged in the monitor stays on continuously. I must have leaned on it during the night and turned it on, and being plugged in it didn't turn off. It actually melted, completely fried. The screen is now black and buttons do not work. It actually smoked. I would be very cautious if purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it worked","review":"Yeah, when it worked it was great, which was only for the first 8 months. Of course I didn't have an original receipt as it was a baby gift so Summer wouldn't replace it with the same color screen device.

Three months later the screen on this one stopped working.... ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound gone; battery terrible","review":"The battery life for this unit was good for about two weeks then quickly diminished.

The base stays in the same place all the time and neither piece has ever been dropped or damaged in any way.

And it works great in a VERY dark room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is a great monitor. I haven't had any trouble at all out of this monitor. If someone is looking to get a great baby monitor, I would suggest this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static static and more static","review":"I cannot use this baby monitor where my wireless router is, which happens to be my bedroom. There is way too much static. What's funny is when I walk around the room, the static gets worse. It's like my body gets in the middle of the interference between my router and my monitor. I have issues with the volume too. It's either loud or quiet. The monitor is heavy too. Can't wear this one on your pajama bottoms without losing your pants. The picture is decent and the battery life is good. I'm off to search for another monitor without interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work well in our house","review":"There was too much static with this monitor. As soon as I got out of our child's bedroom the screen would roll and there was static. I tried different settings and it got even worse. There is no way I could use this monitor at night when I am sleeping. The static is too loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the video","review":"Bought this item last week - the video is good - our son is 3 and doesn't always stay in bed. It's great to see that he's in there and asleep (or not). I bought it for the video, not the sound. I still use my sound monitor in conjunction with the video, and the sound monitor gives much better quality sound that the video monitor, but I knew that when I bought it (based on other reviews), so I'm not disappointed at all. We also have three cordless phones (900 mhz and 2 digital), and wireless airport in the house, and we don't have any problem with interference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Put My Sister At Ease!","review":"I got this for my sister and her new born boy. Like any new mother she was afraid to leave the baby alone for even a minute. For her to be able to leave the room and go to the bathroom or get something to drink or get the mail and still keep watch on the baby - that is such a mental relief. For her and her husband.The picture is very good quality. She has had no problems with interference from other devices on the same frequency in the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still loving it after two years","review":"I bought this monitor over two years ago, and still love it!

We LOVED it while it worked, however it lost complete battery charge after 2 weeks and would only work when plugged in. Last week the screen went black and was no longer receiving a signal. i contated summer infant co and they informed me that they only have a 1 yr warranty and since i do not have proof of purchase (rec'd as a gift) then they could not help me. so unless you want to spend $200 a year then this monitor is not for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor","review":"We are very pleased with this monitor. Our son has health issues and it is such a relief to be able to see him over the monitor instead of having to go in all the time. I can also watch to see if he is really waking up or just changing positions. The night vision is great. Much better than expected.The first time we set it up, we did not get a picture. We unplugged everything and tried again and it works great all over our 3000sqf house and in the yard.I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're NOT THE ONLY ONE who can see your child!!","review":"We purchased this item for our first child thinking it was going to be a lifesaver since our baby would be sleeping upstairs and it would keep me from running up and down the stairs all night checking on her. The first time we used it I had to do a double take because it was not my child's crib I was staring at!!!!!!!! I had picked up the family down the hill who owned the same monitor. I could not only see the infant and her room I could hear EVERYTHING going on in that house! When I walked around my house with the monitor I could pick up FOUR OTHER CRIBS depending on which direction I walked in. There is no privacy here and who knows what kind of person is watching your child sleep or listening in on your private conversations. I would not buy this product and I do not recommend it to anyone. It should be pulled off the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"Have used the Summer Infant extensively since it arrived. Everything operates as advertised. Picture is fine and there is no interference from other household radio signals. I especially like the automatic swithing to infrared operation. Obviously the infrared lacks color but it conveys all needed information with the black & white picture. The quality of the sound pick up and transmission is also excellent to the point where you can hear the child's b reathing. Can't think of a single shortcoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIFIED TO SEE MY NEIGHBORS BABY ON THE OTHER CHANNEL!","review":"I purchased this monitor some time ago and it worked fine (though it buzzed all the time...we just got used to it).However, after reading other reviews mentioning security issues with the monitor channels showing other neighboring babies, I thought I would check my other channel. Needless to say, I was horrified to see our neighbors little boy sleeping soundly on the other channel! After calling Summer Infant, they confirmed that if I can see them, they can see us too! We have the monitor set up to see our daughter's entire room and it runs 24/7, so when we go to tuck her in at night (in our pajamas), or anything else throughout the day, our neighbors have been able to see and hear everything! Summer realizes this is a \\"problem\\", so they offered to replace my monitor with the Secure baby monitor at no cost.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as anyone with the same monitor can also see yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair product","review":"It advertises a \\"color\\" monitor, but it is NEVER in color - always black and white. Lots of feedback from other items in the househould. Not very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"still searching for a good video monitor","review":"I was dissapointed by the picture quality of this monitor. Also, you can only see color when there is bright light in the room- so when baby is sleeping, the picture is black and white and not that clear. I returned mine immediately-it is not worth the money. I then bought the $100 bigger screen black and white summer monitor only to be let down by the reception of that model. I even brought that one to babiesrus to have then test it in the store and they too could not get good reception. Still looking for a good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to view","review":"This portal hand held monitor allows me to hear and see my baby. The closer the camera is placed to your baby the better the picture. The night mode also works best if you have a nightlite near the baby to give you a better visual of your little one. Also the monitor will not work if you place it near your computer of talk on a cordless phone. If these setbacks don't bother you, you will love this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video good, audio bad","review":"I researched video monitors to a great extent before purchasing. I asked friends, read reviews and talked to store associates. The Summer Infant Deluxe got the best reviews by everyone... despite a few poor reviews on Amazon.Once we got it home, we were disappointed with the audio. It cracks and pops frequently. The light bar across the front of the monitor bounces higher when there is a loud noise, such as your baby crying. Unfortunately, it also bounces high when the cracking noise gets loud. Therefore, unless you have the volume up, you may assume the bouncing light means your little one is crying. If you have the volume up, you won't be able to sleep because of all the noise cracking and popping.We keep the volume off, have covered up the light bar across the front, and only use the video screen. The video is nice, it is well lit at night and in the day.I don't have a better recommendation, do you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, for a while...","review":"Excellent monitor. Easy to mount, good picture for several hundred feet as long as there aren't too many obstructions. Starts to act up when you are using two monitors on different channels. We've had three monitors (2 babies in 2 years). We got the third because the volume control failed on the first. Then the other two did the same thing....You can't buy just a replacement receiver.Other models last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't ask for better service or product quality","review":"Great price, product as advertised, arrived promptly and in perfect condition.It seems that the life-span is no longer than 14 months on this product.I can't help but wonder whether exposing a child to Infra Red radiation (which is how these cameras work)for prodlonged periods is safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome anime","review":"Its about a kindova nerdy kid in junior high who meets up with a guy with a shady past who is kind of a musical prodigy who is going places. This guy drops out of his band after a fight and decides to create the greatest band ever. Through a series of run-ins and circumstances, the kid gets to join the band. They make lots of enemies and struggle to get their name out there, plus there is something sinister lurking out there for their prodigy leader. The show is really about the struggles and relationships between the band members while in the band, at school, and on the street. The Japanese dub was pretty terrible, with lots of \\"engrish\\" thrown in here and there. some of the songs are \\"engrish\\" and don't make the best translations and are kinda goofy sounding. But still, it does little to hinder the great story. I really cant wait to see the English language version and hear how the songs translate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Resource","review":"This dear book is rich with group minglings, guided meditations, other exercises, and all of the theory to go with them.

If Hammill dropped off the map for you (as he did for me), you will be glad to have re-found him in this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"space and tension","review":"This is an interesting piece to the Pose File series in that the poses include two women in the standard stand/sit/lay format.

There are many poses that also describe physical tensions caused by force (pushing and pulling) exerted on the form that a solo model would not be able to replicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Poses for models or instructor to consider but...","review":"Not good for the art student.

I tried to force it, and bent my nail backwards in the process. Anyway, I did manage to get the band around the very end, but could not push it over, and had to pull it pretty hard to get it off the visor. The packaging says \\"Fits most visors\\".

Only drawback are the generic, spongy bushings -- which I've upgraded to the great Khiro insert bushings. Also, pivot cups on my pair were squeaky at first.

If played note for note as written, the music will only become denser than it already is. My opinion is that the key lies in bringing expressiveness to such incredibly well-thoughtout and magnificently composed music. I see the music as a springboard for the musician to funnel his emotions and feelings into the cannon- and Bernstein does this remarkably well. So well infact, that these Brahms interpretations are very individualistic in that Bernstein is never shy to wear his heart on his sleeve. Sure, we all have preferences for different sets of recordings, but at least consider Bernstein's Brahms for its very emotional approach. Of course, if you're into very academic and strict Brahms, then forget this box and go somewhere safer- Haitink and Concertgebouw is not a bad one for the money either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great compact and sweet!","review":"This is a great way to sharpen your memory, skills in points and foundation!

Carreras is great too, though he struggles with the accent and trying to sound unoperatic (Te Kanawa doesn't because she famous for being unoperatic, with her A Lloyd Webber or Gerswin recordings). His voice sounds great though. Didn't think that much of Tatyana Troyanos - she's SO deep and throaty, but she does fit the part very well - just not my kind of voice I guess.

Bruce uses concise and \\"to the point\\" examples and syntax that are used in everyday programming. He doesn't boggle your mind with huge source code that will confuse the reader.

I would like to have something more useful. I did'n buy this book to learn C language.2. Eight pages of reader comments with all this \\"brilliant\\", \\"the best computer book\\", \\"excellent\\", is too much. These pages could be better used.3. When you buy the book online you don't know that you have to pay extra for the solutions to the exercises. The solutions are sold on Bruce's site. Not bad way to make extra bucks for the author, but it's bad for the readers who have to pay extra money.4.

I'm warning you that sometimes you are going to feel like you don't get it, that this book is not doing the work, but believe me, everything is going to fall in place if you move forward. For example, for me the chapter about inner classes was the most confusing thing that I have ever read. Closures? callbacks?, nothing seemed to be explained enough. I decided to keep reading and in the next chapter, when Mr. Eckel explains how to compare Array elements, he shows how to implement the interface Comparable and its method compareTo(). His example showed clearly how the java standard library method Arrays.sort() was using the technique of the callback. Only then I fully understood!This is a wonderful book.

Of course, a lot of good restaurants have opened since the publishing date in 1999, but I was surprised that some very established restaurants near my home in Winter Park were not included. Since the book seems to like every restaurant it reviews, perhaps only those restaurants considered good were included. \\"No-holds-barred\\" is not how I would describe it. The book also seems to have, for better or worse, a lot of Asian restaurants in it. Instead, I would recommend the Zagat's for Central Florida, which includes far more restaurants in the Orlando area, along with both the Atlantic and Gulf beaches. It covers more low-budget alternatives and it also includes far more warning rather than praise type reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie!!","review":"This movie has it all, humor, drama, adventure, love, hate, good, evil, everything.

A rival bounty hunter, mob goons and FBI agents are also after him. The way in which these various elements cross paths and converge for a suspenseful finale is just one of the marvels of this well-constructed script. The interplay between DeNiro and Grodin is even more wonderful. There are no jokes here, but the two characters are so well-drawn and mismatched that the laughs are inherent in the situation.

The P is the Producer of the work (record label) the \\"c\\" is the copyright owner of the work, the people that own the master recording. In KISS' case, they own all of the masters. The label cannot do anything without KISS' permission.This is just Gene & Paul repakaging the same old stuff and parting their fans from their money. If you want it, more power to you.

Now remastered AGAIN (how often can you 'remaster' a recordinbg ???) both discs sound as good as ever but both as single discs this time. Alive 3 has a bonus track originally only available outside the USA and the only 'new' thing here is disc 4, the over 6 years old Millennium show. A bit of a disappointment as this disc plays only 1 hour and many more songs from that show could have been included on this CD. The packaging however is something that Kiss is very good in: \\"How to make old stuff hot again?\\"... by putting the discs in an amazing packaging with a perfect thick colorfull booklet for a VERY nice price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better","review":"Had this been done earlier. For instance, if none of their albums weren't ALREADY available and they were just now releasing them on Disc. But since the \\"KISS\\" albums for the most part were already re-mastered way back in '97 up to \\"Crazy Crazy Night's\\" anyway, there really wasn't any need for this box set save for the re-master of \\"Alive 3\\" & the unreleased \\"Millennium\\" concert. Just another part of the M-O-N-E-Y game, the all mighty dollar. Sure, this is a great place to start, if you're just getting into KISS, but who didn't already have everything in this box set except the \\"Millennium\\" concert?

I found the questions the author posed to be unclear and subject to criticism, or to alternative interpretation. The individual quotations from adults who experienced divorce as a child have a complex underpinning that deserves further analysis: I suspect that many of these respondents are synthesizing an experience, sort of \\"making the best of a bad history.\\" In any case, I don't think this book does more than try to substantiate further the theory of good divorce by interpreting grown children's responses to the best advantage of that theory. Not convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING Artwork","review":"It is completely without a doubt one of my favorite modules. It is simple yet epic.

For levels 7-11, this 128-page supermodule will provide your players with over a hundred hours of unforgettable adventure. Highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad artwork and lousy editing DO NOT equal charm","review":"The reviewer who thinks all modules contemporaneous with Scourge had lousy art and apparently no editing should check out Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth or the Giants modules or Tomb of Horrors, all of which had good to great art and decent proofreading, and, most importantly, pre-date this truly awful example of a decent adventure ruined by carelessness. I bought the original modules new, and I was appalled at how lousy this collected edition was.

The vagaries of style and diction between the Padre Guardiano and Leonora in their dialogue - for example - makes you wonder if they are indeed supposed to be singing the same language. Carreras copes heroically with his dimishing resources and Bruson handles his under-sized voice very capably. Sinopoli's conducting, hasty, ill tempered and poorly organized, is particularly sad when compared to Serafin, Marinuzzi or Schippers on other (more or less) complete recordings. Overall, Levine's RCA cast pulls together for the best Forza in stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wayward conducting","review":"The singers - Plowright, Baltsa, Carreras, Pons, Burchuladze - are all adequate, but the thing that makes this recording abysmal is the terrible conducting of Giuseppe Sinopoli. He drags the phrasing this way and that so that often the music is almost unrecognizable. If you can recognize it, sometimes it is too fast or too slow and at times both. I would urge any buyer of a recording of this opera to avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If this is ever discontinued, I will be most disappointed. Works as it says.

It was disappointing that at less than 2 minutes the molding material was to hard to even start the cloning process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not attempt alone.","review":"I ordered this for my girlfriend whom lives across the nation. We thought it would be a great and sexy idea. It was more frustrating than anything. The product itself is a great concept, the way it works is not. The biggest flaw is that the gel hardens WAY to fast. You have about 2 minutes from the time you mix the gel compound with warm water, then it hardens. In those two minutes you must: mix the gel for 60 seconds, pour the gel into the tube, scrap all you can into the tube, get an erection again, then stick it into the tube. Even with a penis ring I still could not get an erection fast enough. The creators need to consider a slower-hardening gel. This product is near impossible to use alone. I would not suggest this product if your partner isn't there to take care of the mixing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough time","review":"Bought this item with hopes of surprising my wife, and found it to be impossible to do by yourself. You have 2 minutes MAX from the time the water hits the the mold putty until its unusable, it requires a good 1:15 to mix it and another 30 seconds to get it in the tube. By the time this ordeal is over and the stress of having only a few moments of time left good luck being in a position to be able to use those last few seconds. Severely disappointed with this product. Might work out if done with 2 people, but unless your partner is fine with you getting some assistance, find another solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"The powder was old and ineffective","review":"I think the molding powder was old. My roommate did mention that the powder does have a shelf life. Maybe that is why it was $18.25 instead of original price of almost $40.00. THis pisses me off so much.

It was our first time and we had read the instructions several times. We had everything perfect until we poured the molding gel into the tube. It hardened up before he even had a chance to get into it. We didn't realize it hardened that quickly. We ended up having to throw the entire thing away. In my opinion, it was the worst idea ever. He was in pain most of the afternoon afterwards from the molding gel bending him up. The company should really send extra gel mix in case you mess up, that way, you don't spend $20-40 (depending where you buy it) only to throw the entire kit away before you get to the fun part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really pissed off","review":"So I bought this because I thought it would be absolutely wonderful my boyfriend was in jail and he got out for a day and had to go back.

The powder turns to jell instantly (which we knew it did fast but we both sat there wondering how much faster we could have done it?) The product says its okay if your touching the side when you make it COMPLETE lie one side comes out container shaped and its almost impossible to get out of the packaging later.

I purchased it for recording demos, but I have even used it as a replacement for my workstation (MO8) at a gig!! Once again, this is a MIDI keyboard and you will not like this product if you do not know how it works and what software to purchase alongside it. The semi weighted keys are a nice touch, as fully weighted keys on something so small would be ridiculous. I would recommend it only if you have access to upper level recording software, it is compatible with most popular software (Logic Pro, Ableton, Pro Tools, even Garage Band).Yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Midi Keyboard","review":"Nothing bad to say about this product.

Come Away with Me is the best IMO. Her passion and talent shine through. Each song was worthy to be on the CD. In Feels Like Home, it seemed she relaxed a bit, had a little more fun, but lost some of the passion, a couple of the songs were not up to what I expected, but passed as entertaining. This third CD is the worst. My impression was that now that she has made a name for herself she can put any track on a CD without much scrutiny. I have listened to it a few times, but it just doesn't do anything exciting for me. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I bought this after seeing her recent interview with somebody or other. I loved her first two CDs, expected to love this one.

To say the least I am disappointed. I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep. Where is the range of work? All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.

Anyone.1st rate, damn fine songwriting!-Murray Dunlap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work like her other albums","review":"When I first got this, I had also gotten several other albums and didn't really pay much attention to it. I loved Norah's first two releases, but \\"Not Too Late\\" didn't grab me right away (the politicized stuff was noteworthy only in that it was blatant and had been talked about in reviews), so I kind of forgot about it for a while. When I recently loaded it back up on my MP3 player for a listen with fresh ears several months later, I was actually disappointed. I don't know if it's the new songwriting, or if it's the baggage of \\"political writing\\" that weighs down what used to be very evocative work, or if it's just Norah fatigue, but I just didn't get into it. There are a couple of good tracks that I'd rather append to 'Come Away With Me' as my personal version of bonus tracks, but overall, I don't care for this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than \\"Feels Like Home\\" but...","review":"...still not quite on par with her debut, \\"Come Away With Me\\" which was pretty much flawless. \\"Feels Like Home\\" was about 30% good, this one is closer to 60-70% which is really about all you can ask for in most albums.\\"Sinkin' Soon\\" was by far the best cut, with a gorgeous horn section...has the sort of gleefully dark energy often found in Eastern European music.The songs I didn't like were the rather bland numbers, such as the first track, \\"Wish I Could\\"---but there was nothing outright unlistenable on this CD, which is a huge improvement over Norah's second album."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD","review":"I am a real fan of Norah Jones and was anxious to hear her latest.

The ability to do that takes special talent.This is the type of record you can listen to as background music or enjoy peeling away its layers on the headphones. I can't think of too many records which work that way.Her voice will sink into your consciousness, and stick with you forever.I don't like all of her records, but this one's for the most part consistent from beginning to end.Great place to start if you don't have any other Norah Jones albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Late","review":"Not Too Late is the third studio album and her 2007 release is a very nice smooth jazz album that blends easy listening, jazz and some pop elements. \\"Thinking about you\\" and \\"Not to late\\" were both released as singles and are really nice tracks with well written lyrics.

I don't know why all artists, or nearly all, think they have to go away from what people liked about them in the first place and \\"experiment\\" or \\"grow\\" or some other existential bunk.This album contains a collection of mediocrity and experimental dumb stuff that is nothing like what drew me to Norah Jones in the past.Take a good listen to the on-line examples before you waste your money on this one. I didn't do that and bought mine in an advance sale, based on my appreciation of her previous work. That was a mistake.Sorry, Norah. Try again, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"A couple of \\"typical\\" Norah tracks, some new stuff","review":"Norah Jones- immense talent in a compact package. When first I heard Norah Jones I immediately flashed on a mental image of a slender, dark haired, dark eyed lady, mid 30's, too many cigarettes. Then I saw a video or two. Boy was I wrong. Young and attractive, great voice. Her new CD fits the \\"Norah Jones\\" model.I use a number of her tracks for the \\"cool down\\" part of an indoor bike class. A couple of the tracks on this CD fit perfectly into that application. There's some new stuff for Norah, too. My take on the CD is that one is either a Norah fan or not; if you are, you probably already have this CD; and if you're not, you'll probably not get the CD anyway.Bottom line: I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed of this new album","review":"I have all her 3 albums and this is the worst album among all. Some more I purchased the imported version from Japan, maybe my expectation of this album is too high and end up not that good. That's why quite disappointed here.

I like her first album the most and never bored of listening this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but.....","review":"well, that's all I can say. Norah sounds nice, soothing as usuall, but she doesn't sound refreshing or that musically creative or anything. If this album were her debut, it definitely won't be a breakout for her or anybody. But it's Norah, if you are a fan, 10 bucks is really nothing, just to hear her soothing voice. Otherwise, there are lots better albums worthy of your money. Like Amy Winehouse, Corrine Bailey Ray, or Robin Thicke, Paolo Nutini, James Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"A skipper....","review":"I was dissappointed with Not Too Late.

This album strays from the entrancing melodies of her previous albums, it's just not pleasing to the ear [at least not to mine]. Even more disappointing was her choice to insert a political statement. Regardless of whether I agree with her political views or not, politics needn't pollute every aspect of life, I wish she'd left that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running out of music already","review":"Well.... I am not surprised...After a great first album and a middle of the road second album Nora did what i thought would happen run out of gas and music. These performers today have such little life experiences that how can they have 30 year careers like the great singer/songwriters of the 40's 50's 60's and 70's. Just another flash in the pan, however the recording quality is awesome ...typical BLUE NOTE quality. An audiophile will love the sound quality but can you sit through it!!!!!!!!!!!NOT NOT NOT"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and lacking in effort. Nora needs a good producer","review":"Her former producer Arif Mardin has passed and she did this with her boyfriend on her own for goodness sakes she is a grammy winner and should have hired someone big to help. I'm a fan of Nora Jones, loved her first album, liked her second but this album is dull. The first nine songs are dreadful but try to hang in there because it does improve at the end. Once you hear Rosie's Lullaby, Be My Somebody, and Not Too Late you'll remember why you're a fan. I bought four songs from this album so I don't feel cheated just disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphorical Political Statement","review":"You can't deny this woman has an incredible voice and is a joy to listen to. I was very excited for this album, but was very disappointed. It is a very dark melancholy cd. The lyrics are a catalyst for political metaphors making the album more of a lecture than a listening pleasure. If you read the lyrics, make sure you have someone around to cheer you up after. The only exception on this album is 'Sinking soon'. The combination of the instrumentals and her voice is fantastic, regardless of the lecturing tone of the lyrics. Despite that, Sinking Soon is the only reason to purchase this cd. I look forward to another album of hers but I will not jump into the waters to quickly, I will wait to hear the music and lyrics first to make sure she has created to entertain and not lecture or politicize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"First of all, I really like Norah Jones. I mean, I REALLY like Norah Jones. She's the most unique female pop vocalist to come along in 20 years or so, and that's saying a lot. But \\"Not Too Late\\" is a big ol' snooze. There's not a single song with a hook you can hold on to, nothing here you want to hear again, nothing engaging or even entertaining. Given that she's written most of the songs, perhaps this is the real Norah Jones. As a big fan who's adored her previous two albums, I sincerely hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait! It's not too late","review":"If you're buying this C.D because you loved her first, Come Away With Me, and are hoping that it compensates for her second album, Feels Like Home; DO NOT buy her latest release. However, if you are intrigued by her artistic progression you may enjoy It's Not Too Late.I personally felt as if I were listening to some scary soundract of a carnival film during the first half of the C.D and just didn't enoy the rest. I was really hoping that this would be a rivival of her multi-grammy winning unique sound. But not to be too critical of her. There is no doubt that she is a courageously talented women who isn't in the business for popular approval but rather her own artistic indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"I loved Norah's older work, but this one just seems to fall short. I hate to see her do this, but she seems to have settled into a place musically that lacks something, that charm that was so rich in her older songs. If I were you, I'd get this CD from a friend first to see if you like it = ("},{"rating":"1","title":"Her first two CDs SPECTACULAR...then this?","review":"What happened? After the magic and depth and beauty of Norah Jones' first two CDs, this CD disappoints to the point of being traumatizing. I LOVED her earlier work, worshipped it. I actually was so upset after listening to Not Too Late (just NOTHING, nothing going on, nothing at all) that I couldn't play my CD player for a few days...when I put her Come Away With Me on, everything was restored again. Someone better get the real story out of Norah - something happened, something definitely happened. Unless the first two were just magic miracles and that's all we can expect from this talented star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointing","review":"I own all of Norah's CDs and this is, by far, the most disappointing. She is a very talented performer/singer and this is just not her best work. The entire CD is quite forgettable. I have played it numerous times and quite honestly don't even find myself paying any attention to it.Perhaps this will begin a change in direction that will lead to more stellar artistry that she is fully capable of producing. All artists eventually produce sub-standard material during their career and I am not completely giving up on Ms. Jones yet... However, I probably would not have purchased this CD had I heard it prior to purchase. I pre-ordered it from Amazon before it was even released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a sip of fine spirit","review":"Think of the feeling when you take a sip of a fine Cognac! You feel the warmth touch every part of you from the inside and the body tingles with joy. \\"Track 6: Thinking About You\\" does exactly that and is your reason to buy this album. What Norah Jones had done with \\"Come away with me\\" and her other Grammy winning classics, she now does with \\"Thinking about you\\". She could have done a 100 things with that melody that would only make it less pure. As always, she decides to keep it simple with her angelic vocals and light accompaniments. This song will be a classic.I bought this album as a gift for my wife. It worked! ;-) \\"Track 2: Sinking Soon\\" is her favorite though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Late","review":"If you are a Norah Jones fan, you should buy \\"Not Too Late\\", but don't expect it to be on par with her previous efforts. If you are not that familar with Norah Jones' music, don't buy \\"Not Too Late\\", go for an earlier release. \\"Not Too Late\\" has flashes of the Norah music I really enjoy, but for the most part it is uneven and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Better than the last two. With every song you get a different taste of Norah and her band at their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, Good, Bad","review":"I loved her first two albums -- 'Come Away with Me' is amazing. I used to play it so often that my male friends started to give me a hard time about it. I could die for the title 'Shoot The Moon'. I also liked her second album 'Feels Like Home'. But this one is simply bad. If I can get myself to give it another try and put it in my CD player, I always end up utterly dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody \\"Wake *ME* Up\\"","review":"If you've heard Norah's last 2 albums, then you've heard this one too. Very boring and uninspired. Lack of range and lack of emotion. There's nothing new or fresh about her new album at all. Everything Norah's done has been done over more than twice. She should've gotten in touch with Timberland and The Neptunes and they would've produced something for her that would've been much better. This is lullaby music all right. It made me extremly sleepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grammy material!","review":"Oh, my goodness! What happened to Norah Jones' jazzy side? The first 2 songs on this album had me sleeping! I thought after listening to the entire album a second time around I would enjoy it, but in fact, I despised this album even more. What a waste! This album isn't anywhere near Grammy contention!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Insomnia? This CD Is The Perfect Cure!!","review":"Where to start ? Okay I'll start by saying that I'm glad that a friend loaned me this CD, it saved me from buying this awful cd.I don't know what she is trying to do on this CD, and I'm sure she does not even know. Where is the soul,the passion, and the heartache? This CD made me want call the suicide hotline. Although if you have Insomnia this is the perfect cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"More beautiful music at an amazing price","review":"Download an entire album for $3 is amazing. Who is going to hesitate at the price? I'm sure that the artist can earn more if the business is set up right, and the fat cats are cut out of the process.I hope this might be a sign of things to come. Like the Apple App Store, providing great products at a great price means high volume and more earnings for the producers.A very nice album by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing CD.

Just a rich brat complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"blech blech and more blech","review":"I have two other albums by Norah Jones and I love her voice. When I found out that this CD was coming out I bought it right away and was so excited to pop it into the player. I will never listen to it again! It is cynical and depressing. She must have just gotten dumped by a boyfriend or betrayed by a friend. If you have a miserable life and want company, then this is the CD for you. And that's too bad, because her voice is fantastic. I wish I didn't know what the words said, because then maybe I could at least enjoy the sound of her voice. This might make me hesitant to listen to her first two albums. If she is smart, she will stop production and issue an apology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, Boring, Blah","review":"This cd is so bland! Every single song sounds the same. It's almost so bad that you think there is just one continuous 45 minute song! Her voice is not that special either. It's almost like listening to Patsy Cline on downers. She makes Enya sound like a rock star. At least Enya does vary the sound SOME. That album cover makes me cringe. Could she have chosen an uglier frock? The best song isn't that great. She says over and over...It's not tooooo late....ooooohoooooh....it's not to late...for loooove! I think she knows that people will buy this cd no matter how bad it is. She needs to try a little harder and spice it up a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one bored with this?","review":"Based from the other reviews, obviously not.

The same style, the same exceptional quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREAT NORAH JONES","review":"IF YOU LOVE THIS ARTIST, YOU MUST GET THIS PRODUCTION.

I wasted money on the last two albums; I won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Bomb","review":"Norah's still the bomb. She hasn't failed to produce. It's one of those nice, laid back albums, though not particularly upbeat. It's a rainy day in the city type groove. I love the flava."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe how disappointed I am!!...","review":"I was so excited to see Norah had a new CD coming out that I pre-ordered it. BIG mistake! I'm not doing that again with NJ. The first album was incredible, the second almost as good but this third one I'm having trouble even getting through the whole thing. I like mellow music but this is ridiculous, I'm falling asleep! I am making myself listen to the album a few times, but besides a couple of songs that are just ok, I am not really enjoying it. I'm fighting myself to keep from forwarding to the next track in mid-song. Most of the songs sound the same and I can't tell one from the next. To the reviewers who insist you have to read the lyrics... Yes lyrics are important but this is music, if I can't bare to listen to it, what's the point? The magic of the first album is no where to be found in this one.My advice: Listen to it before you buy it because obviously there are some people who love this cd, maybe you are one of those few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"I couldn't agree more with the preceding two star reviewers. I was expecting so much more than this monotonous, quite frankly, boring album. There's really nothing to sink your teenth into. A couple of the songs at the end have some promise, but as a whole the album falls flat, lacking emotion or depth or variety. Her voice does sound good, but there seems to be some disconnect, as if she sleptwalked through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Late Norah Jones","review":"No one else has a voice like Norah Jones - so you won't be disappointed. I think Come Away with Me is her best. She is incredibly versatile and this album will sooth away the pressures of the day. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth yet nothing overwhelming","review":"Listening to this cd can make you realize that many of the songs have a similar sound to them. Actually if you aren't paying close enough attention you could get through the cd without really hearing the songs. It's unfortunate that Norah who has such a beautiful voice doesn't seem to be producing songs that can attract new fans. What is even more unfortunate is that Norah seems to be loosing her base audience. I was not overly impressed with any one song in this collection. It's nice but nothing will make a top 40 list. This cd is generally good to listen to when you are taking a relaxing trip or just using it for background sound. I will continue to enjoy this cd and hope that Norah is willing to take more chances. She is young enough that she should be targeting a new audience. The audience that she captured in her first cd is not going to hang around long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Shame on you Nora. I love her voice, have totally enjoyed her previous albums and this one comes as a very big disappointment. Having a poilitical opinion is great and is admirable because it indicates an awareness and concern for a person's country. Perhaps those views would best be shared in a different venue rather than imposing them upon people who purchase music for the sake of enjoyment.The songs became monotonous due to there sameness in tone, tempo, and to add to this, the words were difficult to decipher. Good thing lyrics were included.I am a Nora Jones fan and will continue to listen to everything she produces with the hope that soon she will reclaim her unique style that endeared her initially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Late Review","review":"It's not too late for you to sell this if you mistakenly pick it up. I really appreciate Norah Jones's talent and dark beauty, but her lack of range has become tiresome, and the songs on this album are weird and lack musicality or hooks. I could not wait to get it out of my CD player in the car and safely on Amazon Marketplace for sale.Better luck next time, Norah. These songs just don't make it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Great Norah","review":"I own everything she has ever released, and this is a worthy addition to the collection. If you are a first timer - start with Come Away With Me as it stands out, but this has some great moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah's Soothing Music Notes","review":"The first time I listened to Norah's new CD Not Too Late, I was a bit surprised at how different it sounds when compared to her very first hit CD Come Away. A part of me wants to hear music exactly like Come Away but another part of me appreciates Norah's music no matter what the underlying melody sounds like. Not Too Late is very much like her sophomore CD Feels Like Home. I just love her voice, her acoustics, and her band because the music they make together is meaningful and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one...","review":"This CD is a great effort by Norah.

I own her first two great albums, but I definitely will not buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing for the soul!","review":"A very nice effort from this talented young lady. Adding a bit sharper edge, Norah is still evolving to musician par excellence for seemly the gen-boomer. The SNL gang once joked when NJ turned 25 saying \\"Norah Jones turned 25 today while her audience turned 50\\". \\"Not Too Late\\" provides us with a nice mix of tunes while maintaining a somewhat delicate disposition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't it all sound the same?","review":"she has a beautiful voice - no question about it... but somehow I think that all the newcomer magic that surrounded her first album is suddenly gone and she hasn't been able to transcend... with a rare exception throughout the album (i.e. \\"sinkin' soon\\"), she pulls the same notes, same inflections, same dynamics, same attitude, same instrumentation, same arrangements, perhaps the same background voicings and harmonies... just new lyrics and therefore new songs... but not new music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 3rd Album","review":"Norah's third album is by far the most varied in musical styles. She does a great job on this CD. The videos on the deluxe edition are also great. I can see Norah now holding all 6 grammys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"In my opinion, Nora's first album was her best. Her second one wasn't quite as good as the first one, and the third one wasn't special at all. The third one had too much thought behind it and not enough emotion. Too much mind, not enough \\"feel.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was hoping that the negative reviews were not correct but I have to agree with them. This cd is such a disappointment after years of waiting. Too mellow, too low key, too one sided. We know from live performances and collaborations (such as with the Peter Malick Group) that Jones is not a one-trick-pony and that there is so much more potential. Why she chooses to go the safe route on her own cd's is a mystery. This cd is not horrible but it's not great either. I'm not in a hurry to listen to it again and that's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD. Sounded like recycled tracks of her first two CDs, and there was not a single song that caught my attention. I listened very carefully, more than once, because I love her voice and her first two efforts.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Norah Jones. And the couple of songs she did write on her previous albums were actually pretty good. With this album she writes or co-writes all the songs. And frankly, the melodies are such a disappointment. That's the hook that grabs me and pulls me in to her music and it is just not there on this album. I listened to this cd over and over. Gave it a rest and then came back to it hoping, praying it would jump off the player at me, and nothing. I was very hopefull for her songwriting and was wishing her all the best, but this one goes to the bottom of the stack for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's true - this album stinks.","review":"Like everyone else, I love Norah Jones' voice - but the lyrics on this album are just dumb.

Now, I wonder: \\"Whatever were you folks thinking?\\" This is Nora at her best--great--simply great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very talented dud","review":"This is one of the most boring top ten albums of all time. There is not one catch song in the bunch. The blandness may even be intentional. Like she is saying, \\"leave me alone!\\"I suspect Nora is uncomfortable in the intense media eye of celebrity. It must be like the unblinking eye of Mordor watching her every move. She just wants to be left alone to hang out in NYC with her pals and have fun in the clubs where she can jam in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!

There's nothing that Jones does to distinguish herself the same sounding songs over and over. With that voice I'm not quite sure how she has accomplished 3 cds already.

But I really do not care what musicians think about politics, they are far from being well informed. If Norah Jones wants to use her music for political attacks, it's her right of course. But I have the right to vote with my dollars and add her to list that includes Dixie Chicks, Mel Gibson, etc. - they will not get any more money from me.Alice Cooper said it best:\\"If you're listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to vote for, you're a bigger moron than they are.

The lady cannot write songs. And her vocals are limited. Even the songs that she wrote on her first album weren't that good.

The guy has like a 20% approval rating (ie. we get it, really!) Its been done before by too many artists and brings nothing to the music. If you happen to be one of the few remaining George W.

I didn't get that on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not To Late","review":"The whole album is great. When you buy a Norah Jones album it's like buying a Beatle's album, most of the songs are really good and at least 6 songs are really great.My favorites in order are:1)Until the end, 2)Not too late, 3)Thinking about you, 4)Not my friend,5)Wake me up, 6) Broken, 7)My dear country, 8) Little room.She is the most talented writer and musician out there. She is soulful with her singing, soulful playing the keyboard or piano and she is naturally beatiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has got to stop","review":"I feel foolish for having bought this one. Norah #1 was great, Norah #2 was bad (with some flashes of greatness), but this is....well.....amateurish blather. The song lyrics have all the complexity of a high school diary (at least most diaries don't have really bad rhymes in them) with a level of musical sophistication to match. Her voice is tired, lifeless, and wearing. I am embarrassed to say I've bought all three CDs and am as guilty as anyone for assuring that Norah #4 will be out in two years and will once again make mega-bucks for her record label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and useless...","review":"Unfortunately, this CD is much below all what one could expect from Norah Jones.

I've used and adapted more recipies from this book than any other I own. Bertolli strives to describe what you should be looking for, smelling, and feeling in a product.

Overall, this is a fantastic book, particulary the chapters on Tomatoes and Balsamico.

There is no distinction between the *recipes* and the prose and the whole thing is so flow-of-consciousness random that I have no idea why anything is where it is. It wouldn't have been bad as a Kindle book for 9.99 but no one should have to pay more than that for it. I'm looking up how to send it back or sell it.

The front steering wheel doesn't turn really well. It nudges 10 degrees to the left or to the right. Remember the Austin Power movie when Austin was stuck in the hallway with that cart? That's how I felt when I tried turning this batmobile. In addition, the jumping feature has not worked for me. I read the manual on how it works. At this moment, I still have not made it jump.On other hand, the sculpture is superb! nuff said.The remote control is cheap like any other stock remote control.This product is not worth $40.

In fact, Amazon states, in writing, that just (1) 9V battery is required. This is clearly false advertising and misrepresentation of a product. Amazon is responsible for this and I am emailing them with my complaint. This is no way for a major online retailer to do business and simply irresponsible.

The search for this other battery is something I would not recommend for another parent to endure. Best advise - DON'T GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous design","review":"The worst part about this toy is that, not only do you have to purchase a separate battery pack, the pack has to be removed from the car to be charged. This entails unscrewing a hard to reach piece. After sliding the battery in, you have to plug the wires in and somehow get them out of the way of the cover...I wasn't able to do this. The only way to get the pack out is to pull on the wires. They are sure to break after a few times.Now, as far as the use of the car, you can't steer it very well at all, the front wheels barely pivot. It just bangs into things because you have no control. You can't slow it down. Never did figure out the jumping thing.this is an overpriced piece of crap. My 8 year old didn't even like it. He was happy to have me take it back for a car he could control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"My son received this car for Christmas and I was appalled.

I didn't know that I would have to purchase an additional $20 battery. NO WONDER WHY IT WAS ONLY $19.99! ITs a piece of junk. I also got the batboat, but I'm afraid to see what that might need.

It's hard to master and I suppose if I was buying it for a young child, I wouldn't give it to him right away. Maybe wait a couple of years. It is difficult getting that battery in and out and it does stick out the back, but this car goes SUPER fast, zips over a cat's tail with ease, and it does jump.

Great bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Santoku for the money","review":"I have 7\\" santokus from Shun, Henckels, Wusthof, Tojiro, and Global, all cost several times as much. Yes, this Calphalon cannot compare in terms of workmanship, but the workmanship/quality is better than most cheaper knives. More importantly, it's an excellent knife: sharp, well balanced. Somehow it's heavier than all the higher end knives mentioned above. I've been using it as my main knife for 3 years, still sharp, love it. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent weight, feel and sharpness","review":"My wife and I have had this knife for 2 years. It is still the first knife either of us pick out of the block when we cook - reaching right past our Henckels and Wusthofs.The blade has remained very sharp with only a honing after every other use. We can still make razor thin slices of ripe tomatoes and it's never been professionally sharpened. Of course, you should only cut on wood or plastic boards - never on glass, granite or Corian!The weight, balance and feel are perfect.The scalloped sides do the trick *sometimes*... not every Santoku works as it should and this knife is no exception. Some vegetable slices and other thin stuff can stick to the blade. It is great for most prep, though, and perfect for carving and slicing meats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third time's a.....charm? [Calhalon's great CS]","review":"[EDIT: After talking to a Calphalon rep (who was as surprised as I was,) they promptly provided an RA and shipped out a new one. No problems so far, though the blade is a little less than I bargained for. Revised rating - 3 1/2]Like the reviewer below, I had spectacular luck with my new Santoku blade on the first two veggies I cut. By the third, however, it seems the Calphalon ran out of steam and I was squashing tomatoes instead of slicing through them.I'm not sure if there's a quality control issue with these, but I'll be returning mine and going with a higher-end Wusthof for a few dollars more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"I had been wanting a good santoku knife for a while when I ran across the Calphalon Contemporary 7 inch Santoku. I figured for 40.00 I should at least try this knife. So I did. I love the size, the weight, the grip and even how it cuts when it is sharp. I have to sharpen this darn knife WHILE I'm using it or it goes so dull it's about as effective as a butter knife. When I first got it, it was razor sharp. I used it twice. Twice meaning, I cut 2 limes up for drinking Corona's. On the third lime it was dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good knife....","review":"Believe it or not...I bought this knife as part of a set of 3 for $10...on a whim because I thought they would be poor knives. Turns out to be a very good knife that I've learned to use fairly well. I use a Smith's sharpening stone every 3 weeks or so to keep it sharp...takes a minute or so. Didn't know at the time they were made of German steel. The indentations on the side are not real effective at keeping things from sticking.....but you can't have everything. I made a wall rack for them and a cutting board from cherry wood. So I'm now a real chef....I use EVOO and have ordered a pepper mill. ;-)I'd guess a good test for blade sharpness would be the tomato skin...that's how I can tell it's time to resharpen. I've also learned to use a little forward motion when cutting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good weight and balance for a smaller person","review":"As a smaller person, I find a lot of chef and santuko knives to be too heavy and the handles too large to comfortably manage while cutting. I have both the Calphalon 5- and 7- inch Santuko knives and love them both. The blade glides through vegetables, and the weight, balance, and handle are all very comfortable for me, even with the larger blade. I feel I have good control over the knife, and have never had an accident with them. We have a set of Cutco knives, but they are just too large and heavy in my hand, so while the blade was very sharp, it didn't feel safe to use. I've had the Calphalon knives for about three years now, and still love them as much as when I got them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Bachelor by Design is a book by Kristen Gabriel that is the first in her Cafe Romeo trilogy.

You had to have more background knowledge than high school and college humor to understand the wealth of jokes. Rarely are there comedies anymore that have you laughing at every turn or quoting lines for years to come.

Should have trusted my memory... Mel Brooks really bottomed out after he stopped working with Gene Wilder (and ditto for Wilder, but that's another story). The jokes are limp as a wet noodle, the comic timing is terrible. I did not laugh ONCE. That's a total of ZERO laughs for those of you keeping score at home. The commentary track is also painfully boring as Brooks continuously explains the obvious and pats himself on the back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has no spaceballs","review":"\\"Spaceballs\\" was Mel Brooks' attempt to cash in on the Star Wars craze. Other than \\"Hardware Wars\\",George Lucas' beloved space epic hadn't yet been subjected to full-on,well-deserved parody. Mel Brooks knew about cashing in. Like the leads in \\"The Producers\\",Brooks set out to make an awful movie... and made tons of dough.\\"Spaceballs\\" mocks the rampant Star Wars merchandising. There's Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis),John Candy as a Wookie-like creature,and the \\"power of the Schwartz.\\" Pizza the Hut and Yogurt are nauseating to look at.

Following from the classic BLAZING SADDLES Western parody, SPACEBALLS takes in all and every science fiction movie, breaking every rule and recycling every cliche for maximum comic effect.No sci-fi movie is safe: STAR WARS is the biggest casualty, with plenty of laugh-out-loud references (Pizza the Hutt and Dark Helmet being just two of many). The plot loses it way to the insane jokes, much like many of Mel Brooks' movies, but that really doesn't matter. You'll be laughing too hard to notice.Obviously this isn't going to appeal to everyone just as science-fiction doesn't appeal to everyone. However, if you're prepared for a riotous, zany cast (Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet brings pathetic bad guys to a new level) armed with a funny script, then SPACEBALLS is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Mel Brooks","review":"In this Mel Brooks classic he'll have you laughing at all the jokes like a teenager.There are lots of hidden jokes and funny background items to take notice of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as above","review":"I bought it for a Christmas gift for one of my brothers that like movies that Mel Brooks stars in."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS","review":"I've wathced this movie at least 15 times, and each time i still laugh! it has a lot of replay value because there ar lots of little funny things that you do not notice when you first watch it.

Austin Powers and Scrooged came close, maybe even tie, but that scene where Dark Helmet is playing with his dolls (12 inch replicas of the heroes and bad guys potrayed in the film)made me laugh so hard I fell out of my seat in the theater and almost passed out laughing...and yes, I'm in good physical condition, so it really was that funny.I give this film my highest rating, and Mel Brooks an oscar for being the funniest and most brilliant comedic director alive...at least up until Spaceballs, after that, he didn't do anything nearly as funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE EVER.

I am disappointed that this is the best they could come up with for Star Wars spoof. Doesn't make me want to watch more of Mel Brooks, maybe I'll let the kids give Monty Python a try.I almost bought this out of nostalgia, glad I rented first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my DVD","review":"I still have not received this product :( First it was said to be here by the 3rd, then the 4th, and I still havent gotten it. Uusally everything comes to me so early."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD review","review":"I love sci-fi and satires so I like this film mainly for the few hilarious scenes. I'm disappointed with this DVD though. The commentary by Brooks was recorded sometime after 1994 and he doesn't have much to say. Brooks is silent though much of the film and when he does talk, he often digresses and talks about his film career in general. When he talks about this film he mainly mentions names as \`so-and-so' did the special effects on that. When he is silent, the dialogue audio remains muted you can't hear anything. The commentary track is not very interesting and I certainly won't listen to it again. I'm surprised that the commentary was so bad concerning his very good commentary for \`Young Frankenstein'. The \`making of' documentary gives better insight into the making of the film, but it's only about 7 minutes long. Overall, this is a DVD I have in my collection because I like the film and not for the DVD features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant wait till its on DVD","review":"Over the years my 18 year old son and I have worn out our VHS of this classic. A loose parody of Star Wars gives Mel Brooks a famework for a string of brilliant one-liners. Its still our antidote for seriousness, hassle and life. Probably the most watchable comedy around - please MGM put it on DVD so we can throw out the tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Spaceballs\\" sufferes from writters block!","review":"Some jokes are funny, but too few to save this over long, dull spoof of the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy and beyond.

The rest of it was well-meant, but I can't understand why this is a \\"cult classic.\\"Legally, though, I couldn't stop wondering why, if the guys from FAMILY GUY were able to do a send-up of the same movie but using all the actual characters, storyline, and Lucas material, why couldn't Brooks? It would have been so much funnier. As it was, John Candy playing a half-human / half-dog probably looked a lot funnier on the page than it wound up being on the screen. Did the law change or something? Why was Brooks prevented a direct attack but Seth McFarlane allowed one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEWARE : This version is NOT anamophic widescreen","review":"Anamophic widescreen fans should avoid this version . I mistakenly bought this disc : It is in a matted 1.78 aspect ratio format within a 1.33 frame .Instead I should have bought the 2 disc Special Edition version which I understand is in proper anamorphic widescreen but the downside is that it is alomst twice the price !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Paradoy of all Time","review":"The classic \\"combing the planet\\" scene has stuck in my head since I first seen it on VHS as a kid.

I had to pick this up when it was $2 during the Black Friday week sales on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spaceballs","review":"This is a good movie and is very funny and it stars Mel brooks. This movie spoofs Star Wars to a pretty good effect. The only problem with this movie is it is to predictable and the story to it is thin. Released in 1987 this movie didn't do well at the box office. This DVD is good featuring trailers and extras and is worth the buy, but I can only watch it a couple of times or It will tire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Can Only Do This Right!","review":"Mel Brooks is a comic genius. Although Young Frankenstein is still my absolute favorite (followed closely by Blazing Saddles)Spaceballs is a fun frolic the paradies all the science fiction films to that time.Mainly mirroring the Star Wars universe with little jabs at the Star Trek universe - it visually matches the sets design and costuming of Star Wars.Bill Pulman and Daphnie Zuniga are histerical. And there are a ton of cameo appreances. Mel Brooks himself (also writer and director) plays two roles...the most notable...the all powerful, the all knowing, the all wise - YOGERT. (A Yoda rip-off.)This film is funny and fun. Mel Brooks has one of the most creative minds in the industry. His wife, Ann bancroft must be in histerics all the time!

My buddy Daryl, whom I got this for as a birthday present, and I also like it for its many great puns (witness one of Dark Helmet's lines to Colonel Sanders! LOL!) The merchandising gags are great as well. My favorite scene, though, is Dark Helmet and his henchmen watching the \\"instant video\\" of Spaceballs! That one takes the cake!One caveat: Parents should take the PG rating SERIOUSLY, as some of the humor is off-color.Also a technical note -- if you get the widescreen version, be aware that it's in the 1.85 to 1 format, not 2.35 to 1 as it says on the tape. Also, snap it up quickly, the folks at one widescreen advocacy website note that MGM seems to be phasing out their widescreen VHS tapes in favor of DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"Very funny movie.

It's ludicrously funny and gross at the same time. The best casting was in Rick Moranis as \\"Dark Helmet\\" and the scene where he plays with his dolls is hysterical. The double entendres keep you rolling in your seats. It's not Mel's best work - \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\", but it will really strike a nerve with sci-fi lovers. I especially loved the rip-off scene from \\"Aliens\\".

As one of the few critics to diss this, I will keep it brief. Several of my friends-not just one-recommended I see this, so they brought it to our group get-together. In a word, the film was cheesy. I know it's a parody and I've seen some great parodies, but couldn't the quality have been better? Not only the film quality was aggravating, but the characters. The princess, Yogurt, and Pizza the Hut were probably the hardest to sit there and watch. Long before the credits rolled, I was out in that chair.

Pass!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So unfunny it's scary","review":"I saw this when it came out in theaters and I wasn't the only person not laughing. How Mel Brooks is able or was ever able to get any films financed is beyond me. Who thought it would be a good idea to release a Star Wars spoof in the mid-late 80's when no one cared about Star Wars anymore. It only goes to show how comedically out of touch Mel Brooks is, when he thinks that Star Wars is still the cutting edge of pop culture 10 years after the movie left theaters. Loaded with unfunny line after unfunny line. This is the kind of stuff your grandpa would tell you and think it's funny. Well, I guess it makes sense seeing as how old and crusty Mel Brooks is. All these jewish references in the movie don't do anything for me. It looks like Mel Brooks has confused a Sci-fi spoof with Yiddish theater. I guess you have to be jewish to find this guys \\"humor\\" funny. If 2nd grade level fart and booger jokes really crack you up then you'll love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE STUPIDEST MOVIE EVER MADE","review":"I cant even rate this movie its so horrible.

My favorite scene was when that frog-like creature comes out of the man's chest and starts dancing.This DVD may not be the best DVD ever, but it's on my top ten list. Mel Brooks has made one of the greatest movies of all time. I give this book a ***** rating for its humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks Best","review":"I went & saw this movie 3 times in 1987 & I snatched up the laserdisc, widescreen copy when it came out several years ago. This is my favorite Mel Brooks movie. Being a 20 year Star Wars collector, you knew this one would work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect parody","review":"Having seen most of Mel Brooks' works and being a diehard Star Wars fan, I have to say this is probably Brooks' besk work. I enjoyed how the counterparts matched and deviated from their equivalents in Star Wars, the funniest being Dark Helmet compared to Darth Vader. The movie closely parallels the first movie the SW trilogy with small bits from the other two thrown in for good measure. On another level, it was a wonderful comedy with great characters. A must-see and May the Schwartz be With You :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Centaur Review","review":"This film is a work of art. The style the film is shot in is found footage, also being one of my favorite styles of film. The acting on everyone's part is amazingly realistic, also hard to pull off, but very needed for this type of film. The story is rather unique. It is a story about revenge, but this revenge story is looked at from a different perspective, yet still focusing on the character getting revenge.The writing is dark, but sarcastic and funny at times, while keeping the mood of the film.This is a Film Noir that everyone should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN METAL OR PLASTIC!","review":"I bought this chair when my 4th child was one year old because he had destroyed the first chair we bought him. Within in a month of buying the metal and plastic chair, he had figured out how to get the tray off with his feet, recline the seat and climb out. He is no genius..it was the crappy chair. After owning several metal and plastic chairs over the years, I finally opted for wood and I couldn't be happier!! This chair is SO sturdy that my son (now 2) can climb into the chair by himself and it doesn't tip over. It is a cinch to clean up and my son likes it. It may not be ideal for everyone, but if you are looking for something sturdy, durable, attractive and timeless, this is the chair for you. Other reviews have said it is hard to get kids in and out and I don't find that to be a problem at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the plastic tray insert won't stay in once your child figures out how to remove it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent chair great pice...","review":"I am very happy with the chair.

I have three children and have been through quite a few high chairs and this was the worse!I wish I had bought a Stokke Kinder-Zeat. I am buying those for my sister who has twins. If I had bought those I would still be using them for my three children age 2, 5 and 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"My parents bought this High Chair for me upon my request. I thought it was lovely, nice and netural to match the decor in my kitchen. What I didn't realize was that there is a wooden bar, under the removable tray, that is a \\"permenant restraint\\". Since it is not adjustable, it is very difficult to get a child in and out of for feedings. There is hardly any room from the back of the chair, to the bar. I could only imagine the difficulty, and the amount of discomfort, if I kept this chair and my son grew with age. This chair is not meant for practical use.

The recorded dynamics are not good and I found myself running to my receiver turning it up and down -annoying. Yes, Battle has a pretty voice but it also has a hardness to it that I don't like. I prefer Lorraine Hunt (Lieberson) in Pelleas.If you want the quiet one, more in line with what Faure wrote try Cambridge Singer's on Collegium.

We had to read it in class. I think that the writing was horrible, the storyline was horrible, and it was overall bad. The girl in the story is crazy. (Winnie I mean) She TALKS TO TOADS!

DON'T WORRY YOU WILL AGREE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"This book was boring. The protagonist characters were too innocent and trusting. In some books the antagonist characters are interesting and enjoyable even though they're the bad guys. The antagonist in this book was not one of those characters. In the beginning, the story had no clear problem. This made the story seem pointless. After that the author simply reiterated what she had said in the prologue, but this time she said it through the characters which gave it a little more context. The end of story resolved some of the problems, but not all of them. I also think that the author should have left off the epilogue, which was meant to be a tear-jerker. The epilogue just put what you knew was going to happen into words, which took out most of the magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book smells","review":"this book was too short and the events take too long. there realy isn't a climax and the author could have tried harder but she completly fell of the edge, took a wrong turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better, still okay","review":"I had to read this book for an assingment in sixth grade.

Thirsty and tired in the woods next to her house, she sees a boy drinking from a spring and wants to drink some water.

It tests their imagination so that they must look beyond fact and look a bit into fiction. Babbitt also does a fabulous job describing the characters in great detail to where each and every reader may identify with at least one, if not more than one, of the characters. It interests a child much more when they are able to step into the book and compare their life to one of the character's. I give the book 4 stars because I recall having read it when I was withint the age range which is preferred for the book and I remember following it well and ejoying quite well, too. One thing that every child has which is theirs and no one can take it from them is their imagination and this is a great book that brings that out in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple story with a simple message","review":"The characters were amusing enough, but I thought it unrealistic that while the young boys were actually over a 100 yrs old, they still acted the age they appeared.Surely they would have matured during there life mentally, even though they stayed the same physically.The message about the life cycle is supposed to make you appreciate every age, obviuously that is something everybody must come to understand, because in reality, eternal life isn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever placed my hands upon","review":"This book was the best, by far, I have ever read in my life.

Tuck Everlasting is about a family of four that drank magic water and lives forever. This story is with a girl named Winnie who finds out the Tuck's secret about life everlasting. The genre of the book is fantasy and adventure. The theme is about the circle of life and how dying is apart of life and the Tuck's are \\"like rocks on the side of the road\\" and no longer a part of the circle of life. The quote I like best is,\\"Don't be afraid of death but the unlived life.\\" I like this book because it makes me think a little more of life and death. The thing I don't like about the book is how over protective Winnie's family is with her.Natalie Babbitt was born in Ohio and lives in Rhode Island, her and her husband have three grown children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuck Everlasting","review":"Tuck Everlasting is a wonderful mix of fantasy and action. Even the boys will like this one. It's nothing like the movie in that there is no romance, but plenty of action, and it's a book that you will want to read with the whole family.

This book is often used in Children's Literature courses, and is also used in grief counseling for children.

Young Winnie Foster finds out their secret and so the Tucks take her home to try and explain the secret and the importance of keeping it. Yet now the town is in an uproar looking for the Tucks, and the family needs Winnie's help.The writing is excellent, and the story will keep you turning the pages.

This idea seemed too far out and didn't make sense. I, personally am more interested in mystery books. This book seemed a bit too short to describe things in detail and make an interesting story.

That's what Winnie Foster is faced with.My mind could see the pictures in the story. . . it was well written with not too much action. There was enough break and natural stopping to keep it from being \\"Fast Fast Fast Fast, sort of Fast, Fast Fast Fast\\" as many books are. I suggest you read it, but don't expect it to end happily ever after. It's well written, and I admire Natalie Babbit for her bravery in writing on such a subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuck Everlasting....","review":"Though I love the idea and story of this book, I didn't particularly like the way the story was told. It is a little over 100 pages. I know this is a young children's book but they are learning nothing by reading the bare minimum of the strong subject matter of immortality. Except for Winnie, the character depth of the Tucks only skimmed the surface. I would have loved to read more about the in-depth feelings that each family member was having. All in all, the story was over in the wink of the eye. Events and occurances slammed right against the next, hardly giving a moment to consider what was going on. A little more storytelling would have helped this book reach its full potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"My View of Tuck Everlasting","review":"Winnie Foster was just a little child who lived in a touch-me-not-cottage near a wood that her family owned.

The boy and his family kidnaps her, and the Tucks tell her that they can live forever. First Winnie thinks that these people were crazy kidnappers, but gradually realized that they were telling the truth. A man that always wore a yellow suit figured out the Tuck's secret, and he wanted to sell the spring water for profit. The Tuck's ended up getting away, but Mae had to club the man in the yellow msuit in the head.This book was an ok book, but i'm not a big fan of it. Natalie Babbit did a great job at describing places like Winnie's house, the wood, and the Tuck's house. The story itself was kind of corny. I didn't like how Winnie gave the toad the spring water either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eternal Story of Winnie Foster and the Tucks","review":"Tuck Everlasting is a story of a 10 year-old girl who meets an incredible family.

This story contains such things as a stranger in a yellow suit, a kidnapping, a horse and a toad, a touch-me-not cottage, a new jail house, and a long-forgotten shot gun.I personally did not enjoy reading this book as much I have enjoyed reading other books because it had many dull moments and when it finally did get exciting, it only lasted a brief moment. The story line wasn't that bad but the way some parts of the story were phrased didn't appeal to me as much.

One of the children's books that I most desired to read was TUCK EVERLASTING.Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this as much as I had hoped. Primarily this was because I felt so little sympathy for the title characters. The plot is simple: a frontier family in early nineteenth century America accidentally drinks from a fountain of eternal life, and are cursed with living forever. Or, at least, it is explained in the story that it is a curse. The difficulty I felt with the plot was with the family. For these people, since they really didn't seem to have much in the way of lives to begin with, eternal life really would be a curse. (...)As the novel stands, my only reaction is: Lord, I wouldn't want to live their life for even ten years, let alone an eternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuck Everlasting","review":"Tuck Everlasting wasn't my favorite book.

Did he ever steel it? Would you drink out of it?I think Natalie Babbitt, the author, is trying to tell her readers that you should never want to rush your life away.

I imagine young children would love it and find it magical, but more me (I'm 21) I just found it a bit tedious. Especially since I knew the story. All that was really left was the writing style (lots of lots of descriptions, right down to the ripples in the water) which I found annoying.But I do recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12.

The book is full of suspense surrounding \\"the man in the yellow suit\\" and at the end of every chapter is a cliffhanger.

When I first started to read, I thought that it wouldn't be a good book because some of the words were put differently and I couldn't understand them. But I went on through the book and it got very good. This book has a combination of fantasy, love, cruelty, murder and intrigue. I especially liked when the man in the yellow suit got what he deserved. My favorite characters were Jesse, Winnie and Mae - and also the frog. I recommend this book to readers from 4th grade on up. It is wonderful for people who like to use their imaginations and like magical things. Check out Tuck Everlasting at a library near you, now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting.","review":"My one word to describe this story: enchanting. It's the kind of story that a child would dream up laying on moon-drenched grass on a summer evening... you know, the kind that gives you shivers because it just might be real. I love this story for its simplicity--the author doesn't try to force it to be more than it is. She just lays it out in front of you and leaves you to ponder. And it's magical. You've just gotta love a book like that!I recommend this book for older children who are ready to contemplate the issues of life and death, but who can still appreciate fantasy (It's not one of those depressing my-best-friend-died-and-it's-all-my-fault-Betsy-Byers-type books, thank goodness!).

The question you find youself asking throughout the book is whether or not she accepts it.This book would have been a fast read for me had it not bored me so much. The plot was slow to develop, and was lacking in action. It seemed too much a fairy tale for my interest, and I feel I've outgrown books like these.I would recommend this book for fans of a more mystical type of novel.

Whinnie finds her first love, but then lets him go so he can be with his family for a little while. I was really suprised when Whinnie gave the water to the frog and then didn't go back to the spring for more. My favorite part of the book was when Jess comes down stairs to talk to Whinnie and he ask her to drink the water when she turns 17 so they can run off and get married. I think that Whinnie made the right decision in not drinking the water because 3/4 of the Tucks were not happy, and therefore Whinnie probley would have regretted drinking the water and would just want a normal life like she did have.By:Nikki"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuck Everlasting","review":"I do believe that it was an ok book, until the ending.

Those who drink from the spring never grow old and remain the same age forever.I loved this book. It was one of the best books I've ever read. I loved the scene when Mae and Winnie are switching places in the jailhouse and they were saying good-bye. Natalie Babbitt definitly has a great talent. I think EVERYONE should read this book.

These books and movies seemed to be in parts of this book due to the love of a young girl and an older man but appeared to be young, and the living forever part.

Winnie though ten years old in the book seemed to have a higher maturity level and understand the importance of things in life more than anyone especially the man in the yellow coat.

It remains one of Mozar's finest. In Italian, the story is of Don Juan the infamous lover. It's a romance and a dark comedy. When you hear a Mozart opera, you know it's good. There are many memorable songs and arias. In Don G, the highlights are La ci darem la Mano a love duet and the Commandore Scene. There are other love songs as well. Karajan is a well known conductor and leading the music to Don Giovanni is a jewel. I've heard great reviews of the recently released version with Sutherland. Enjoy the opera. In Amadeus, Salieri is drawn to the darkness of the theme- death and revenge. \\"With my influence,\\"says Salieri, \\"I saw to it that the opera be performed only 5 times in Vienna.

Which is good, because this is one opera I listen to frequently. Sure, the \\"La ci darem\\" here isn't the best I've heard, but it isn't bad. (That was Furtwangler's version, by the way.)

The opener, \\"You'll Remember\\" has a jazz beat and could easily have been covered by Holly Cole. \\"Trapeze\\" is a story-song in the tradition of old folkies like Harry Chapin and Woody Guthrie--add to it the duet performance with Emmylou Harris and it's tops on my list of duets.In my opinion, the only 'miss' on this CD is \\"Up On a Mountain.\\" Patty doesn't have the sound or the range to carry this song off--but I'd love to hear someone like Shelby Lynne cover it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad There Isn't A Zero Star Rating","review":"You really have to wonder how some of these people get their work published, or recorded.

This is a small bump in her road..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much guitar banging","review":"I found this CD disappointing. The lyrical, melodic qualities that I love about her music is missing in this CD. It has too much loud guitar banging. I was very disappointed. I would like to see her go back to her style from 1000 Kisses and her earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer/Songwriter Breaking Through","review":"It seems Patty has finally broken through with the release of her latest album. And, deservedly so. I thought she would have a very difficult time ever approaching the quality of her \\"Impossible Dream\\" release. But, she may have actually exceeded the high standard set by that unbelievably creative collection. It will take a few more listens to make a final determination, but clearly, this album is no disappointment, as follow up releases sometimes are. Patty's vocals on \\"Heavenly Day\\",\\"I Don't Ever Give Up\\", and \\"Crying Over\\", are so good, they hurt. At least 5 of the other tracks are worthy inclusions, especially \\"Trapeze\\" and \\"Railroad Wings\\".It's great to see Patty finally getting her due. I've been collecting music for more than 40 years, and I've only seen a handfull of artists with back-to-back albums of this quality. If you're a fan of great music, and don't already own and play both of them, how sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I think that this is a really good cd. I really like the arrangements and the lyrics. they are very cathcy without being too poppy. I think that everyone should at least give this cd a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A finely-honed, hilarious portrait of life in Kentucky.","review":"For many years as a Freshman English instructor, I assigned this book to students from all over the country. Though many of them groaned at the thought of reading a book \\"about hillbillies\\" when they first heard the title, Gurney Norman's wonderful comedic touch and unique, likeable, well-rounded characters never failed to win them over. Though Norman's book, in the best tradition of Southern fiction, is strongly rooted in \\"place,\\" the author succeeds in transcending his stories' locales, making Wilgus and his family seem like people any of us might know and many of us would wish to know. You don't have to be from Kentucky coal-mining country to enjoy this book. You only have to love fine writing, powerful characterization, and sharply-honed humor in the best tradition of Faulkner, O'Connor, and Norman's friend and fellow Kentucky author Ed McClanahan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biofreeze","review":"My wife has MS, and she experiences a lot of pain for which she takes handfuls of medicine.

Also the smell was strong & lasted to long. I would not reccoment this product & threw away $48."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The concept of the Long Boom is an important one, but this book does not do it justice. The authors attempt to make their point by combining three disparate text threads into one theme, but this combination of non-fiction and parable comes off more like dueling banjos. The first thread is a fairly shallow narrative recounting the familiar causes to which most now attribute our current prosperity - network effects, globalization, info technology etc. The second thread follows a fictional American yuppie's life through his annual Christmas letters to several buddies. This recounts his journey from sensitive college grad to Big Chill Volvo owner. The third text is a \\"transcript\\" from a fictional news show from 2050 that identifies the Open Source Movement, the downfall of Microsoft and similar developments shortly after the turn of the Millennium as the key turning points that make possible the ensuing 50 year long boom.This book could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book That Should Not Have Been Written","review":"I read this book when it was first originally an article in Wired. Sure, it's optimistic of what we can make of our future, but it's riddled with inconsisencies, too many to cover in this review or even explain in full to the author. He glosses over faults in logic, and makes generalizations of how two non-conjoined events will translate into result \\"X\\". That it was an article in a magazine, fine, his comment at the time was that it was just one view of what might happen...now he's spun off that one view into a mass-marketed book in the hopes of having a best-seller and making gobs of money? Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is full of hope and optimism, yet grounded in the reality of today's world. The authors have developed a \\"possible\\" vision of the future...not a \\"prediction.\\" That, to me, means there is something beyond the horizon that is worth working towards. The content of the book also provided me a wealth of information about our world today and I feel I had a chance to get caught up on \\"current events.\\" Furthermore, the authors put these events into a context that gave them new meaning.I also liked the way the book was written. The letters written in current time and the documentary broadcast in the future looking back at the past 40 years added some very interesting perpectives.The Long Boom should be required reading for everyone as it opens up a door to what is possible that most people don't consider in the narrow viewpoint of daily living."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"This was a fun book to read. If you want to be optimistic about the world, read this book. The book is about the global economy growing, and how humans will benefit from such economic growth.Many problems can can be addressed by economic growth, while some problems are created by such growth. The economic growth is created by technology and globalization, as are the problems created.There are rules to follow to sustain the economic growth, and the book outlines ten such rules.If you are worried about global problems like climate change,terrorism, or poverty, read this book. You will learn that theseproblems will worsen if we're not careful. You will also learn that these problems can be minimized if we change our way of thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"These staples arrived two weeks afer placing the order.

It comes with two DVD's. Many of the better known comedians are included in it.I was looking for a bunch of mini stand up comedy acts. But what it turns out to be is a bunch of mini-round table discussions with each discussion having four comedians. Byron Allen asks a question to someone \\"when did you first get into comedy\\" and the person answers then someone else jumps in with a funny reply, and so on.So as I was looking more for single comedy acts. This DVD is more like round table discussions. Some people may be looking for this, and if you are, then this DVD is for you.Oh, and one last thing, the Byron Allen laugh and giggle.....I think that is really, really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"when i ordered this product, i suppose that i'd hoped for a steady line-up of comics emitting their greatest material. i was disappointed. two dvds held about 10 episodes of the show. in each, byron comes on for a few minutes and offers maybe a dozen jokes. then, he sits with 4 comics who talk about their lives and shows they'll be in in the near future. occasionally, a comic provides a 3 minute skit. there was as much music and introduction and pauses for \\"commercials\\" (not shown here) and the ending as there was anything funny. overall, i think that probably half of the comedians were somewhat funny. given that the comedy channel is freely available to most people today, i think that i would recommend it over the purchase of this tape. if you don't receive a comedy channel or you're a fan of byron's, then the purchase of this product, used, might be a laugh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unleased! Well, kind of....ok not really....","review":"Byron Allen. I'll be honest, I had never really heard of him till I got this dvd. And as a comedian I will say he has a couple really funny jokes. And the idea is solid as well, get a bunch of comics together and let them have a round table discussion. Good idea, but unfortunately bad execution.The comedians are funny, but unleased is a wrong word for it. You can tell the show is carefully (and considering some of the comics they have on there ie Dane Cook for one!) edited. The comics all use very PG language and keep their jokes tame.Also the discussion never breaks out into anything even remotely non politically correct. They talk about Bush once. But in general every episode talks about plastic surgery and dating.The show has an excellent premise. But unfortunally it should have been called Comics Leashed....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully unfunny.","review":"Byron Allen manages to take people who are just funny on the spot, people who can pull out great jokes anywhere from what's around, and make them absolutely shockingly boring. It's like some horrible inverse proportion dimension of comedy, where Dane Cook is actually better Katt Williams and Ralphie May. Hell, where Dane Cook doesn't make your ears bleed simply by existing, thanks to how bad everyone else on the show ends up being."},{"rating":"1","title":"HBO anybody?","review":"We need to bring this show to HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, Spice (sorry, not that one), or any one of those channels. The host: Andrew Dice Clay! That would be perfect! We'll really be able to see the comics strut their stuff, or get booed right off their seats. Anybody agree?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description, and not that funny.","review":"Sure, this DVD features a lot of comedians. However, the DVD description reads as if the comedians are performing. They are not.This is a talk show hosted by D-list celeb host Byron Alen. It features a panel of comedians delivering obviously pre-written lines about uninteresting topics of discussion.I would love to have seen clips of standup from the likes of Howie Mandell and the rest - but alas, it's not here. This is just clips of a (I assume) syndicated late night talk show you're likely to see on basic cable when you have insomnia and don't want to watch another infomercial for Kevin Trudeau's \\"Secrets of Ripping-Off Consumers They Don't want You to Know About.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rupert Pupkin and his hostages","review":"I love comedy and thought this was maybe an anthology of current comedy acts. Wow, I could not have been more wrong. This seems like a failed pilot or a vanity project for Byron Allen. It is horrible on almost every level. The production values are worse than my 1970's high school AV squad. The \\"guest\\" comedians look vaguely embarrassed to be on. A couple of them even ask \\"Is this going to be on TV?\\".... \\"What channel will this be on?\\".The only way I could even get through this 2 disc set (I watched the entire thing) was to pretend this was a version of \\"The King Of Comedy\\" and that Byron Allen was a black Rupert Pupkin and the comedians were his hostages. It didn't make it any better but it did occupy my mind for the 176 minutes. I looked in vain for the \\"featurette\\" but could not find it. I confess I didn't look that hard.Please save your money. Or buy \\"The King of Comedy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't give Dogs a Bad Name!","review":"If this is \\"the best of comics unleashed,\\" then they should have kept them on the leash, or at least tried to clean up their messes. I like dogs, but this could give dogs a bad name.Seriously, this is an example of why most comedy shows are carefully-written and carefully-scripted. They may have been hoping for spontaneity, but the ugly little secret is that good comedians don't just ad lib. They have carefully planned \\"routines.\\" Yes, there are a few like Robin Williams who appears to ad lib, but in most cases it is material he has carefully thought through, and filed away for an opportunity to use it \\"on the spot\\" as an apparent ad lib.These comedians are mostly nice people--good when their material has been written and practiced. It must have been as embarrassing for them to see this video as it would be for us to have paid for it. Keep these dogs out of your house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your momma's comedians!","review":"This is a nice little compilation featuring the best and brightest who have appeared on Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen. From Dennis Miller to Cedric the Entertainer and more, these comics sit and discuss everything: pop culture, entertainment, even bad dates. The resulting back and forth between Byron and the others is strangely reminiscient of The McLaughlin Group, but it's even funnier. I'd highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Are Not Amused","review":"How can such a funny bunch of folks turn out to be so UN-FUNNY? Watch this DVD, and you'll see how it happens.First, line up a great cast of comics, including Jon Lovitz, Howie Mandel, David Brenner, Margaret Cho. Next, invite them to a \\"talk-show-format\\" show, and feed them stilted, stale one-liners. They respond with the same.Second, add in a live audience that is as stiff as the comics, reacting to the \\"hilarious\\" jokes as if they (the audience) were a canned laugh track.Third, allow just a minute or two between segments, before blacking out to commercial (no commercials on the DVD, just the blackouts).B-O-R-I-N-G! Seriously folks, as they say, you won't miss a thing by passing this up, except perhaps a few yawns."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even slightly funny","review":"There are some good people involved with this project so I expected it to be good. Was I ever wrong.This is the most painfully lame program of \\"comedy\\" I have ever seen. It is not funny. Lame..lame...lame. Everything about it. I cannot think of even one good aspect. A total waste. Straight to DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the best I would hate to see the worst","review":"This DVD is billed as the 'Best' of Comics Unleashed. First off, the description of this is a little off. If you are looking at this in the hopes of seeing stand-up routines by the comics listed look some where else. This is more like a sit-down group where there are a few funny moments.In terms of new material I was really disappointed that not much seemed new. In fact much of it has been repeated time and time again and has, for the most part, lost its luster of being funny.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy comedy and enjoy stand-up comedy. But the ratio of funny stuff to mind numbingly boring stuff is skewed more towards the boring. For a rental this may be ok. But, I don't think I can recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Setup With No Payoff","review":"I didn't know that this show existed until I saw the DVD. After watching the first few episodes, I thought maybe it never made it to air and went straight to DVD. But it looks like it actually aired on Comedy Central. The guests sit around with Byron Allen and he throws out a topic and they each say a little something. Not a bad premise, but it just doesn't work. There are a ton of breaks for commercials and no one ever really gets going. \\"Unleashed\\" really doesn't fit at all. No one knows when to talk. They all seem a little uncomfortable and then relieved when the episode is done.Bottom Line: This isn't all that funny. It was a chore to get through the entire two disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I borrowed the 26mm model from a friend and tried it out in my scope and loved it. Sure, it has a fishbowl effect at the edges, but I don't use the edge of the field anyway.I have a 16\\" f/6.4 and the coma produced is not as bad as it might be in a shorter focal length scope, but for me, it didn't affect my observations of over a dozen faint galaxies that night. The center correction makes up for the edge.Since then, I've obtained a set of the Orion Q-70 series, which are almost identical, and I'd give them a five star over the four stars I'm giving the Meade version because their edges are a little less distorted.I'd go for these over a Nagler any day, as there are fewer elements the light has to go through and I don't really care if the field is flat all the way to the edge. And don't get me started on price! But that's just me. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good eyepiece for the price","review":"This eyepiece is good for wide field, initial looks at messier objects and star parties. Views are decent in my 8\\" f7 Discovery dobsonian but in my Stellarvue nighthawk7, the design flaws really come out.

Though I willingly became involved in the character's lives, I felt as if my own heart was enlightened as I read.Anne de Graaf describes Africa first-hand so that you can almost taste the dust and feel the heat. Her story is based on real issues and happenings. I guess that's why, at the end of the book, I realized I had to do something about what I'd read, especially about children forced to be soldiers in Africa.I'm looking forward to the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still impressive, still USA made","review":"If you need a beefy adjustable wrench then the Crescent is a fine wrench.

Unwritten Law has been on approximately 500 million labels through the years. Thus a true \\"greatest hits\\" is nearly impossible. So what we're left with is new recordings of songs that are almost 15 years old in some cases. I have heard CPK many, many times in my life, I've seen them perform it live many, many times in my life, but even Scott Russo, completely drunk on stage, is still better than this version. All of these new versions have lost their edge (seriously, what is with the \\"ooh oohs\\" in CPK?). Maybe I'm just old, and seeing these kinds of CDs makes me remember how much I once enjoyed a band, but at the same time, makes me remember why I gave up on their music in the first place.

Te Kanawa's glorious lyric soprano voice fits perfectly, and her accent imitation and diction are both perfect.Carreras' obviously struggles with the diction, and his voice is not totally right for the part. However, he still sings his parts reasonably well, and does blend nicely with Kiri Te Kanawa. Tatiana Troyanos sounds pretty terrible. She slurs and slides her way around, and sounds generally half out of whack with the rest of the cast. The entire ensemble, however, do a great job and fit in well. All round, it's a good, value for your money CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force Is Strong With This One...","review":"By far, the most complete account of Lucas' life (from birth up to the release of \\"Return of the Jedi\\"). This book is certainly entertaining, and insightful about his life (including a high speed car crash that nearly killed him, his early film career, \\"THX-1138\\",\\"American Grafitti\\", \\"Raiders\\", and oh- that \\"STAR WARS\\" thing. It also includes a synopsis of an early draft of \\"STAR WARS\\" that is quite different than what made it to the screen. Did I mention this book rules? Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"I first bought this book in 1983 and have read it hundreds of times. I was initially disappointed in the 1990 \\"update\\" (which contained only a new Foreword) but that changed with the newest version of this book. It's too bad George Lucas dismisses it as being \\"as accurate as the National Enquirer\\" because for someone who hung out on the set of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" and conducted interviews with Lucas himself, Pollack delivers a highly interesting account of Lucas' life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I found this book to be incredibly interesting. I love biographies, but some are much more compelling than others. This one really kept my interest. I think one of the best things about it is that it starts with Lucas's roots, and that gives a much better idea to the reader of why things have happened the way they have. I was also impressed by the inclusion of substantial information on Graffiti, which is sometimes ignored, even though it was great, and an important part of Lucas's development as a filmmaker.I have really enjoyed watching both Graffiti and the Star Wars trilogy since I first read this book, because now I see things that I didn't before, and I notice cuts and editing and story points that didn't seem as significant until I read the book.

I need to watch all the DVDs to find out if any of them are damaged as a result.

I loved this series and I revisit \\"The House of Eliott\\" once a year. I just love those clothes. This series was also educational because I was not aware that the \\"ready to wear\\" was created during the 20's. Also the fashion industry is a cut throat businesss.
