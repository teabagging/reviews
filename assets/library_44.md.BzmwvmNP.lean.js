Too many implausibilities in too many ways along with no character you really care much about adds up to just another WWII flick, with a ham-handed cheeseball ending.I watched it only because I loved Hoblit's Fallen, but aside from the visual quality (very nicely composed shots and a busy but intelligent camera POV are the highlights of the film), this film leaves no lasting impression. Some pleasant moral platitudes, but it just never hits your gut. The actors are fair, but don't have too much to work with.I wanted to like this movie but it never really gave me a reason to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performances, interesting plot!","review":"\\"Hart's War\\" is one of those often forgotten war movies, sometimes hard to find in the rental aisle, but a good part of any collection. It features one of the best performances by Colin Farrell, a then promising young actor (pre Alexander, Miami Vice). Bruce Willis also offers understated yet solid acting. Notable performances by Marcel Iures and Terrence Howard are also worth mentinoning. The plot offers intrigue, action, a courtroom drama and relevant issues. Highly entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out with a bang, but....","review":"then incredibly lapses into a \\"Oh, feel sorry for da black man\\" flick.I'm sorry people, but this is nothing but more brainwashing coming out of the propaganda matrix called Hollywood.

The American POWs treat their fellow black POW airmen worse then the Nazis do . A complete playing of the race card in this movie, I was waiting for OJ to appear in a Tusk a gee Airmans uniform so the white folks could frame him. This was not even a war movie as it was advertised, it was a soap opera of a black hating cracker picking on to black airmen in a POW camp-American against American. The bad white cracker being the embodiment of evil, worse than the Nazi scum . The movie trailers said this was a great war movie, it was a sham and it is a disgrace to any vet of ww2 especially after 911. [shame on] Bruce Willis for taking a role in a movie of this nature. It is anti white, anti black and anti Ameican. A disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this ment to be a comedy?","review":"or is it because Bruce Willis is such a bad actor.

Not exactly. Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell can bring in an audience, but movies that have to do with Germans, Russians or Middle East just are not popular anymore. I was disinterested with the film .Bruce Willis, with all due respect, is almost a natural for this role. He was born in Germany and is half-German in real life. But I am glad he's all American. This disc offers Full Screen and Wide Screen. Special Features are on the Widescreen side.

I really only watched it to see Jonathan Brandis, who wasn't even in it! So that might bias my opinion of the whole film, but oh well.It did not depict an accurate perspective or scenerio of what a real POW camp would have been like in Germany during WWII.I thought the whole thing about causing a distraction with a court trial was rediculous. POW's wouldn't be allowed any such privilege in the first place. I mean come on, what rights do prisoners anywhere really have from the inside? Not much.Every moment of the movie was so inaccurate and just impossible for me to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, plodding.... and boring","review":"Hart's War could have been a good movie if the director had cut about twenty minutes out of the running time. Instead, we are left with a slow plodding movie that tries to milk the tension out of every scene with lingering camera shots of characters giving anguished facial expressions in response to the moral dilemmas they are facing in the film.This movie has little action and instead relies on interaction between characters to build tension in drama. Too much time is spent watching characters do nothing. A quicker movie would have been better because the cast is appealing and the story is pretty good, if not someone far fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, poor movie","review":"If you are in the movie-making business, you must first read John Katzenbach's book (Hart's War) and then watch this movie. It is a good learning tool on how to turn a great book into a poor movie. I cannot believe how the director was willing to direct this movie (I am assuming he read the book). The movie has practically nothing from the book, and as a stand alone film, it leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh...","review":"well, this is one of colin farrell's not great movies. i thought the plot wasn't really organized enough so i had to pay a lot of attention to this stupid movie. this movie wasn't very good and i don't recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogan's Heroes","review":"If you want even one iota of anything approaching realism then forget this movie. Because it has Germans in the movie it, of course, has the obligatory Malmedy Massacre scene along with the Jews being deported on trains scene and the Germans are all ruthless nazis etc, etc. The scene in which the American POWs form the letters \\"POW\\" in order to stop a low level air raid is pretty hilarious. The plot is poor and the acting even poorer. As usual for an American film everything explodes in flame: one wonders if American special effects producers have actually ever seen an explosion. The film looks as though it was derived by reading an old style war comic. It is bad. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A civil rights movie in P.O.W. clothing","review":"This movie is reasonably well acted but the material is not what you are expecting. Bottom-line: there is VERY little action in Hart's War. Instead, there is a kangaroo court staged in the midst of a Nazi POW camp with a honorable black defendant and lots of white racists. Yawn. How many creative ways are left to show that White men are evil and Black men are oppressed? I'm white and this movie felt like a sucker punch.

Twice it has stopped working. First time was just four months after the purchase. We got it fixed from the Panasonic repair shop but it has stopped working again just two months after the purchase. Now it has been out of order for more than a month. I sent emails to Panasonic but they never responded. All this when the product is still under warranty period. I sincerely believe that Panasonic should have replaced my microwave after it stopped working the second time. This is not the only Panasonic product that I am unhappy with. I had bought a TV-DVD combo from Panasonic in Oct. 2004, its DVD player has not been working for past three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dry and Dull","review":"I would term this book a nightmare. This book is about as dry as three day old non-buttered toast. The authors premises is that the activity on Wall Street during the 80's - the junk bond M & A items will kill corporations due to the debit levels thus decimate the equities markets. Not that this is that unique of a thought and the book only gets duller from that point. I picked this book up because I wanted to learn something, but the wooden writing turned me off so much I finally had to close the book after the longest 100 pages in my life.

Why is it that today's shock rock bands like Maralyn Manson don't seem to be able to shock people without acting depraved?.

In this narrative about his children's mental illness and the failure of his marriage, he has confessed his own failings and weaknesses about as much as I think is humanly possible. He has been faulted by other reviewers for the very failings that he has had the insight to recognize and report in himself, and surely he must have known that his book would garner such judgmental responses. He wrote it anyway, and I'm grateful to have been able to read it.Acquainted With the Night is powerful, memorable, and likely to be helpful for families who are dealing with mental illness. It is also a riveting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry and discouraging","review":"Mental Illness is not a warm, fuzzy topic, but Raeburn's account of dealing with his mentally ill child offers little hope, encouragement, or direction. Additionally, it implies that family dynamics and social situations may be at the root of illness rather than biology, as proven over and over by science and medicine alike. If you want a parent's perspective that provides both the unvarnished truth and a real sense of hope, power, and wellness, read Kate McLaughlin's \\"Mommy I'm Still in Here\\" instead.Mommy I'm Still in Here: Raising Children with Bipolar Disorder"},{"rating":"2","title":"acquainted with the night","review":"Well-written and moving.

My wife read it too, and we've been talking about this book for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"As an individual working in the mental health field I was looking forward to learning more about the experiences of parents in dealing with mental illness in their children. However I was greatly disappointed in this book. I felt the anger and bitterness of the author towards his ex-wife dominated the book. Though I respect Raeburn's honesty I felt the great depth of detail about his ex-wife and their problems was unnecessary and came off as him trashing the mother of his children. I am fearful that this book will drive Raeburn and his ex-wife further apart and damage his children more. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"When Raeburn isn't busy trashing his wife or excusing his own inability to understand his children's mental issues (even though he is interviewing some of the world's top experts simultaneously), he spends a lot of time rationalizing the behavior of his kids, who manipulate him blatantly and deftly. Were it not for his narcissism, you might feel sorry for the author. But it's impossible to excuse his willful ignorance, social climbing (after all, he HAD to live in the right neighborhood...), and vilification of his wife and the rightly fed-up teachers and administrators who had to put up with his spoiled offspring. Certainly at least one of his kids needed medication, and ultimately got it. But if this book is supposed to enlighten struggling parents, it fails. I was offended by the author's use of his family problems (or his use of this book, for that matter) to explain away all his own failings, which, by the end, are at the core of the family's problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A skeptic's encounter with mental illness","review":"2 of the author's 3 children became ill with psychiatric disorders in their middle school years. Raeburn writes for the skeptic. Trained as a scientist, he was resistant to the idea of mental illness until circumstances left him with no choice but to seek psychiatric care for first his son, then years later, for his daughter. He chronicles the events--mania, depression, drug use, truancy, cutting, attempted suicide-- as they played out over a decade. One is struck with his courage and humility. He shares how toxic his marriage was through these years, a factor which contributed to the severity of his children's illness. His children are now doing well, and I was encouraged all in all by this account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic comfort changing pad plush cover is too small for this pad.","review":"I was surprised to discover that the Basic comfort plush changing pad cover does not fit onto these pads, despite the the fact that the measurements indicated on the packaging specify that they should be a perfect match (same brand, same size).

The book is very poor in pictures content, the pictures are all blurry and the colors are all faded out, doesnt have any info on how to treat a sick or infected coral. The levels of difficulty of each coral are not very well presented and identified, the author identifies each with a color, and the trouble is the colors are very poor in quality and are all faded, a yellow is almost like an orange which is very similar to a red, and its confusing sometimes.In sum its a book for a beginer but not for the advance aquarist. If you are on a middle or higher level do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok as a second or third reference","review":"If I had to do it over again I would have really listened to the first review on amazon!

I was very sad when he died, for it meant that there would be no more books of this kind of quailty from one of the leading authors in America. This particular book was Grizzard's life story, but he managed to tell it in a funny, new way. I generally stay away from autobiographies and biographies, but since this one was written by Lewis himself, I gave it a try. It proved to be as funny as all his other books and really touched me. This book was just as funny as his other works and I was not disappointed by it's quality or content.

Infidelity, friendship, maturity and life choices are some of the subjects present in this little movie, providing a couple of laughs but not many memorable scenes.

The main difference is that the old collection transfers are very contrasty (not much detail in shadows especially) and the picture is just plain old 480 lines of resolution. The Blu-ray is amazing both in the incredible detail that resulted from remastering to 1080 lines, the dynamic range (detail in shadows, lovely black and white), and the vastly improved sound along with the image clarity (abscence of significant noise).

You need this!!! Whether it be a first time purchase or replacement for the regular definitive dvd versions, the crystal clarity and remastered sound is simply stunning. The resolution is so high that, in close ups, you can see the pores on people's faces and see the individual fibers that make up their clothing. I am simply amazed that they could take old film and make it look so good. What you see on this set is likely better than anyone has ever seen them, even when they were originally broadcast. The bonus features are cool and also in HD as well. I love the packaging. It's slim and the same size as any other single disc bluray release. It has two sturdy flaps on the inside that hold the discs very nicely. If I could give it 10 stars I would.

The special features froze and jumped around. I sent this first set of discs back hoping it was an isolated case. Unfortunately, the replacement disc I ordered has the same exact defect.

It is without a doubt one of the finest series ever produced for television. The show had numerous a-list actors in it, the production values were high, and the stories were simply incredible.So what's the gripe? Pricing! Aside from the fact the show has been released on DVD at least twice before, once as individual disks of four episodes each and once as a box set of five but not in chronological order. They were way overpriced then and they are way overpriced now. Take a look around at the other tv season box sets. Heck just look at the Outer Limits (the original series). That set was almost half the price they are asking for the TZ. As far as I'm concerned what they are charging is way out of whack. Other posters refer to this as Corporate Greed. I agree. There's no question the consumer is being horrendously gouged here."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the Twilight Zone it was to become","review":"I purchased this first season hoping for a fun nostalgic Halloween viewing with friends, and it turned out that Rod Serling was just warming up here. The classic music was not a part of the episodes that we watched, and the (four?) episodes- out of many, it's really a lot of episodes- were all about alone-ness. After seeing these few, I wonder if Serling was in a reflective, perhaps depressed time of his life. They may have been ground-breaking at the time, but they aren't the mind twisters that I recall from late night television. Maybe season 2 is better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, corporate GREED.","review":"Give me a break. I am soooo tired of studios releasing version after version of the same movies. Think about how ridiculous it is: special editions, extreme editions, unrated editions, director's cuts, collector's editions, Ultimate edition's, etc. But when they start re-releasing TV shows, this is total BS!! I am sticking with the versions I have and NOT buying into this corporate greed!! I am sick of it!!!! Expecting people to pay over and over agian for the SAME thing. Oh, let's just add a few more extra features, make the picture a little better, and make MORE money. These fools will buy it. That's right. If you buy it again, you're a fool. Don't support this BS!! If people stop buying these re-issues, maybe they will stop doing it and release it right the first time!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earlier disk problems appear to finally be resolved","review":"Despite reading the bad reviews about problems with this set, a price dip caused me to take a chance and purchase this set. Unfortunately, when the disks arrived I had the same problems reported by many other earlier buyers: some disks, specifically #1 and #4 wouldn't load at all (FWIW this was on a Sony BDP-N460 with the latest firmware). I really love The Twilight Zone, though, and was hesitant to give up so I deliberately waited until just before my return window was going to run out and in early February requested a replacement set from Amazon. It arrived today and I'm happy to report that all of the disks load and I've successfully played some of the episodes that were reported to be problematic before such as \\"The Big Tall Wish\\". I obviously haven't had it long enough to be certain that there are no problems anywhere on any disk, but as best I can tell so far this set of disks works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the correct item ASIN: B00068NVMK it is supposed to have the book ,The Twilight Zone Companion and it does NOT. :(","review":"This set is suppsoed to come with the softcover book, The Twilight Zone companion and it does NOT.I am usually very happy with my purchases from Amazon and the customer service is the BEST! :), but this is a BIG MISTAKE Amazon!

It was my best Christmas present, and the finest Blu-Ray collection I own.I also own the Definitive Edition DVD set, and this totally blows it away in terms of quality. If I can point to one scene that would demonstrate the detail that you can see with this edition, check out \\"And When the Sky Was Opened\\" and go to the scene where the airman breaks into the bar after closing time. Before he breaks the glass, you can see the wavy lines in the glass....it's stunt glass, or candy glass!

Disc 1 and 2 skip, Disc 3 randomly returns to the main menu, and disc 4 just flat out won't load. Why Amazon hasn't been willing to fix this in the past three months speaks volumes to how dedicated they are to selling quality products. There are dozens of documented cases of defects, yet they only randomly pull the product in one week increments, and then relist it and hope that nobody notices.Come on Amazon, either stop selling it entirely, or do a full recall until you get a new shipment of product from the manufacturer. It's dishonest to continue selling a product you know is defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent First Season Collection","review":"Having viewed the six DVD's in this set, I have to say that CBS/Image finally got it right. The image transfers are as good as you can get (being from the original film negatives) the same can be said for the audio. I was glad they left in the \\"bumpers\\" and CBS show promos at the tail ends of each episode. My only reasons for giving this collection 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the \\"next week show promos\\" are audio only, which (to me) means either the video quality was really poor, or there was some sort of sponsor tag on them burned in (I believe the former would be the more likely scenario). The other is, on the Extras DVD, they have the original billboards for the show. I would've preferred that they inserted these where they were originally before the first commercial, instead of giving us a comp reel of them. I'm definitely looking forward to season two when it's released in March, 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Edition?","review":"This looks to be a fine collection Image Entertainment has put together, with lots of bells and whistles, but if it's a Definitive Edition then why wasn't the ORIGINAL 'pilot,' from 1958, included?\\"The Time Element\\" was aired in November of 1958. It was scripted by Rod Serling and intended to be the pilot episode for TTZ, but CBS instead showed it on Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. It starred William Bendix and Marin Balsam. It's about a man who has a recurring dream that he's at Pearl Harbor on December SIXTH, 1941. The show received such favorable viewer response that CBS ordered up a TZ pilot. RS wanted \\"The Time Element\\" but now couldn't use it, so he delivered to them \\"Where Is Everbody.\\" That 35 minute pilot is included in this collection by Image Entertainment.Anyway, I'm just trying to help. I thought some of you might like to know this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, light viewing that held my attention and transmitted feelings","review":"This episode shows the genius of Twilight Zone. The drama uses only three actors dressed as early 1960 astronauts, the desert as the set and a canteen as the main prop. It's that simple, and only 25 minutes long.The acting and directing is excellent. A theme about survival and rules is explored. Twilight Zone frequently used the subject of astonauts, reflecting the concerns and outlook of the time, 1960.You can hardly find entertainment like this without going back to 1960. There is no canned laughter, special effects, rapid-fire screen shots or product advertising in the segment. It's thoughtful. Compared to what we're used to now, it feels a little slow-moving and more like live theater. The message and feeling transmitted also remains with the viewer longer than most of what we get now in TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 4 and not 5 stars?","review":"Of course a Twilight Zone fan, but I gave this manufacturer only 4 because they did not include an option to play all episodes - you must manually go back to the main menu and select the next episode to view.You would think with the decades of Twilight Zone marathons the manufacturer would have enabled the buyer to have the option to watch \\"marathon style\\" - but they chose not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Set but","review":"Wonderful set, but Disc 4 doesn't work for me either (except in my Playstation 3).

Here's to hoping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Zone is aweome at any age","review":"As a kid, I grew up watching the Twilight Zone and still watch it till this day. This set however only comes with the 1st season which is a bummer. With this one, you will get all of the episodes from the first and most important season. They work in any dvd player and ps3 or xbox. This series is from 1959 and is by far one of the best seasons. If you are a die hard Twilight Zone fan like I am, the entire series definitive collection set is what you need. I got mine and I can't be happier. You will get all 36 disk complete with Rob Sterlings voice over for the next weeks show. It really takes you back to when Twilight Zone first came out and is totally worth it.

Topper was long and slow and mildly amusing. Topper Returns was an embarrassment to watch. Poor Rochester was forced into the only kind of roles that African Americans were allowed to play, and the other actors did not fare much better with that lame attempt to play on the success of the original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabelled","review":"Picture quality and sound are excellent, but the product lacks the closed-captioning listed both on amazon and the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim McCutcheon","review":"I saw the Topper movie way back in the late 40's as a kid and was entranced by Constance Bennett. Viewing this film again so many years later I am still struck by her vivacious looks, wit and humour, as portrayed in this film. The story is timeless about a car crash couple that appear as ghosts and figure that a good deed will get them to the Pearly Gates. They latch on to Topper, a hen-pecked banker and straight laced as, and proceed to brighten his existence with extremely comical results.The next movie with Joan Blondell does not shine to the same extent as Joan is no match for Constance Bennet. It is OK but only scores 2 stars in my book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Topper","review":"Uproarious comedy was yet another step to super-stardom for Cary Grant, who proves himself a gifted comic player as well as handsome leading man. Bennett (older sister of Joan) is the essence of high-toned style and beauty as wife Marion. Still the revelation is Young, who's a consistent delight as the put-upon Cosmo, a man who must cope not only with a rigid, controlling wife (Billie Burke), but a couple of goofy, upper crust specters who keep turning his well-ordered world upside down. A genuine screwball classic. Note: this DVD also includes the sequel \\"Topper Returns\\", which brings back Young (sans Grant and Bennett) and is good fun, though a tad contrived and not up to the first entry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor transfer of a great film (and its so-so sequel)","review":"The divergence of opinion on the quality of this disc is remarkable. Well, here's my two cents' worth: this is a poor quality transfer, hardly distinguishable from a VHS rental tape. I agree with those who say that this DVD must have been mastered from a tape of poor quality, and the heavy compression required to fit two movies on a single-layer DVD has hurt the image quality even more.Lack of detail, poor contrast, and jitter in the outer portions of the image are among the many visible flaws that detract from enjoying this disc. That's a crime, given how superbly funny \\"Topper\\" is. Unfortunately, unless and until somebody like Criterion does a fully restored release, this shoddy edition is the only game in town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Movie - Quality of DVD is AWFUL","review":"I bought this as a gift for my mother's birthday along with other classic movies she loves. The other 4 classics I purchased were fantastic. Topper, however, was truly, stunningly awful. The movie itself is hilarious, and well worth watching. This particular DVD skipped constantly, paused, stuck, the picture wobbled. Just in case it was something wrong with our player or TV we tried it on three different DVD Players and TV's with no better results.Another strike against this particular set - no closed captioning. One would think when marketing classic films that would be a rather essential addition. Then again, a non-skipping, non-wobbling picture should be at the top of the list as well.To say it simply: get this movie, because it's a great one, just don't buy this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic & Funny","review":"For those who remember the black & white TV show Topper and loved that, you'll really enjoy \\"Topper\\" the film-which I never knew existed until watching TCM Old Movie Channel recently. \\"Topper Returns\\" is entertaining too, but a little slow and predictable. However, worth watching for the fun. With both you'll enjoy Great Slapstick Comedy! Great collectors double feature DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgic comedy","review":"Enjoyable, but not rip roaring humorous. I think it was more driven about showing off its then new technology than the script. It was fun, and I enjoyed the old fashioned humor.

Constance Bennett and Cary Grant were great and Roland Young and Billie Burke were fine additions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topper great Topper Returns strange This DVD Horrible","review":"Please buy a different version of these two movies. The 2010 reprint by Big D is horrible. The first movie shuddered throughout and the second froze after 42 minutes. Both were poor prints.Topper is top rate screwball comedy with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett; while Topper Returns is a mix of screwball, Draculaesque scenery and elements of film noir mystery. Topper returns features Joan Blondell, Carole Landis with Roland Young and Billy Burke returning from Topper.Again, buy the movies, but buy from a more reliable company."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE, CLEAR PRINTS","review":"I have both this edition and the IMAGE edition of TOPPER RETURNS. I bought this DVD more for the first TOPPER film than anything else, having last seen it on MGM/UA home video, and I must say this is a very good print, very clean, much cleaner than I remember it.

Jimmy turns the rides from an amusement park into space ships and launches himself and his friends into outer space to follow the aliens get them back.

He will be attending a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineer and Mathematic)magnet school. I am using Jimmy Neutron DVD's to help \\"BaKari\\" create a love for Science, Technology,Engineer and Mathematics. Jimmy Neutron is always inventing something.

I don't know who the heck would want to make a movie about some stupid kid who is a genius. It doesn't make us feel for the characters in any sympathy whatsoever. The parents are extremly stupid, but not in the funny way like patrick or timmy turners parents. The characters are cliched, and the plot of this film is cliched. Lilo and Stitch is better, even though i didn't like that film. Overall, rent before you buy.

I went in with high hopes but was soon faced with utter disapointment. The comedy quickly grew tired and the characters poor animation was sad. The main character looks like something you would see on the side of a Wendys Kids Meal bag. The rarely working invention concept has been seen time and time again. After watching movies such as Shrek and the Toy Story movies this movie is nothing but the desperate attempt of Nickelodeon to get into main stream computer animation.

Just Howard and a piano and a percussionist. So how on earth did the result end up sounding so cheesy? Maybe it's that over-equalized percussion that floats on top of the music instead of driving it. Maybe it's the strange digital chorus effects on the piano and vocals. Or perhaps it's because Howard, showing excessive laziness, lets his tone-deaf audience sing half of the lyrics. In any case, somehow, amazingly, it doesn't work. What a shame that such a brilliant songwriter has yet to produce a recording as sophisticated as the songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As they said in the 80's - TOTALLY EXCELLENT!!","review":"I won't pretend to be a professional reviewer/critic.

I wish this movie was meant to be bad on purpose but it wasn't. The DVD has no extra content, not even a trailer or commentary, just play movie and scene selection.

This is a must for Clancy fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book.","review":"Hey now.. how can you review a story when you only know half of it? That is pretty hairbraned.

All of it is possible, sure, there are some really grey areas. All in all though, I do recommed this book. It was actualy the frst Clancy book that I ever read.

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vicarious exp. as Kelly (Clark) eliminates bad boys.","review":"I enjoyed this book. Clancy contrasts very well the mood evoked by the Chesapeake Bay (for those of us who know it) with that of the mean streets of Baltimore. I enjoyed the 2-level plot, wherein Kelly is dealing with drug-dealing dirt-bags on the one hand, and his mission to Vietnam on the other. The plot was realistic--the professional manner in which Kelly carries out his dual missions was, I thought, very thoroughly thought out and presented. I enjoyed also his portrayals of the American and Russian spooks, and the Russian Air Force colonel. My main complaint with Clancy's writing occurs when he's trying to convey tender love thoughts towards the women in Kelly's life--too much syrup (of the corn type). I don't think that subject is Clancy's forte'. Otherwise, this would make a great movie, as good as \\"Clear and Present Danger\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy's best book!","review":"I really loved this book. I've read all of Clancy's fictional works and this is definitely my favorite. It was great to get some background info about \\"Mr. Clark.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Serial killer as a hero","review":"Only Clancy would make a serial killer the hero of a book. The truly sad part is how many other characters in professional positions look the other way. In the past, I have enjoyed Clancy's works. This one went over the limits good taste. I added the second star because like many Clancy works it is well written. I did finish it. Readers should be cautioned that it is a disturbing concept. In the real world, this hero would be seen as an evil villian of Manson or Gacy dimensions.I will admit a personal bias. I am a strong supporter and advocate of local police departments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's worst","review":"Clancy should stick with the techno stuff. His attempt to show the more human side of his characters flops. Kelly, and every other character, is one-dimensional. It is simply too trite that a man could fall instantly in love with a hitchhiker, without our having any hint of what he really sees in her, then spend the rest of the book obsessed with avenging her death. Not that the guys didn't deserve it, mind you. He does play with the gray areas of justifiable actions outside the law, kind of a human super-hero vigilante for whom police are probably grateful behind closed doors. But this book has the literary depth of your average Sergeant Fury comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A last good one","review":"This is not one of his best, but considering what manure or tree wasters he has written, this is almost good. I have stopped reading this author, he seems to get paid by the word and in later books puts in subplots that have nothing to do with the book so he can make political or religious statements.Buy this book second hand, and keep it handy for a camping trip. It will give you something to read on rainy days and will give you a nice supply of toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Excuse for this book","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. I had seen some Clancy movies and thought I would enjoy one of his books. Boy was I wrong. I'll never read another again. The characters were so one dimensional. The \\"hero\\" was, in my opinion, a cold-blooded killer who was as bad as the \\"psychopaths\\" he was out to get. He actually tortured one of the bad guys to death. It was also apparent that he couldn't be without a woman. During the six months between the time his beloved wife died and he met his new love, he \\"visited\\" hookers twice. He then fell in love (in a matter of hours) with a hitchhiker he picked up. Within a week after she was gone, he glommed on to the nurse who treated his wounds in the hospital. Everyone in the book was either all black or all white. I don't have one good thing to say about this book. Hard to believe this author actually made money from this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the familiar","review":"For me, Without Remorse by Tom Clancy is a very well written novel containing more thrilling and exciting activities concerning several of the characters we have enjoyed over the years. Since his very first \\"Jack Ryan\\" thriller I have looked forward to each and every new work. Without Remorse will not dissapoint any of his long time followers and it will entertain those new fans who have just recently discovered Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Remorse","review":"I became very bored with this book almost from the time I started reading it. It is the first Tom Clancy book that effected me this way. I'm still a fan of Clancy but I will choose the next book with more caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Clancy","review":"Yes, Clancy does write about different characters than Jack Ryan. This story was one I couldn't put down until I got to the end. Sat down with the book one Saturday morning and read it cover to cover. The hero is a little tougher than Ryan, and definitely not someone to fool with. But it's still the same old Clancy weaving his web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some typos...","review":"This review is of the Kindle version of the book and not of the book itself, which I enjoyed greatly. (The short version: if you like \\"Clark\\", this book is a must read. Jack Ryan fans, be warned that he has only a short \\"cameo\\" in this book.)The purchase and download process was flawless. I do not have a Kindle (yet) but downloaded the book to, and read it on, my iPhone using the Kindle for iPhone application, which is a free download from the iTunes Store.The copy of the text, however, has typos here and there. It seems that a print copy of the book was scanned and converted to digital text via OCR software; it also seems that no one bothered to proofread or at least do a cursory spelling check.This did not hamper my enjoyment of the story, but there were occasions during which I stopped reading to focus on a typo and figure out what the proper word was supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy at his best","review":"This is one of my favorites. One of my favorite types of hero's are the Anti-hero variety. Such as the Punisher and Batman. John Clark fits the bill of the typical anti-hero and Clancy did a wonderful job in creating the transformation character of John Kelly into John Clark.I read this novel after I got hurt and it was a page turner for me, it allowed me to take my mind off my present problem. This also served a second purpose, which is why I like the anti-heros, who would not like to have the ability and means to go after people who hurt you and do it very well and call it \\"justice\\", this leap is great, because normally we could never do such a thing and when a good novel comes around and does that for us, we have to pause and read it. I would never condone such actions in this book, but, nevertheless, it is always fun to see bad guys get what they deserve. And Clancy does an excellent job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Effort By The Master","review":"Tom Clancy has figured out that the John Clark character is the more interesting character to write about.

The part about Clark's girlfriend is dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin has failed again!","review":"I'm not sure why each book converted to a Kindle version done by Penguin Publishing is so poorly edited. Whether it is placing semicolons where there should be letters, or not putting a break between obvious perspective changes causing the reader to wonder if they missed and entire page or paragraph. To say their work is amateurish, is to insult amateurs. If the publisher is going to charge this much for their books, they should at least have someone who passed high school English be doing the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Fun to see where Mr. Clark came from and what makes him tick.Interesting on the introduction of Jack Ryan and his connection to Mr. Clark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-Wrenching. . .Clancy's Very Best","review":"The enigmatic Mr. Clark was always my favorite character of the Ryan canon, and this book takes him back to his beginnings, in the 1960s. Really Clancy's only \\"historical\\" novel, this thriller is probably his most emotional, with a story that pulls you into a vengeful thrill ride.It's been a common ploy in thriller fiction, the highly trained soldier going after the criminals who murdered his girlfriend, but no one does it in such a visceral manner as Clancy in Without Remorse. I've read the book probably five times since it came out, and it never gets old. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"wow. i loved this book. i am only elven years old and i have read 8 of clancys novels, and this was by far my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book after an unrealistic start.","review":"In this departure from the John Ryan series, Clancy develops a really great character in John Kelly. The action is non-stop and the supporting characters are mostly believeable. Two things keep this book from being a 10. First, Kelly picks up a stranger and falls in love with her -- right after being devastated by the tragic death of his pregnant wife. Second, the sub-plot of Kelly leading a raid in Viet Nam seemed to be a very elaborate way to set up the book's ending. The Viet Nam raid actually went nowhere.

PRETTY FAR APPARENTLY. WHAT A TURKEY. INFANTLE. THE GRAMMER WAS HORRIBLE. BUT I READ THE GLOWING REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK AND I WONDER, WHAT IS A REVIEW? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT WAS THE ONLY BOOK IN MY BAG SO I SLOGGED THROUGH THIS CONSERVATIVE, JUVENILE POT BOILER WONDERING WHICH CHARACTER WAS THE DUMBEST. IT WAS LIKE THEY ALL TOOK STUPID PILLS. IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF EVERYBODY DIED IN THE END. I WAS CURIOUS, OFTEN, ABOUT WHO WAS PROOF-READING THIS FIFTH GRADE LEVEL ATTEMPT AT STORY TELLING. WHAT A MESS. IT WENT ON AND ON AND ON.

It makes me wonder if Clancy writes these books as some kind of subconscious therapy rather than entertainment for us. What happend to Mr Clancy early in life for him to have this need for violent revenge ending in death? This whole book is basically just one big revenge story; character falls in love with druggie girl, girl is murdered, character extracts revenge by torturing and murdering those responsible. Why would anyone want a 700+ page novel about that kind of thing? I'll discreetly book a psychiatry appointment for Mr Clancy and hopefully when he's better he won't inflict such travesty's on the reading public. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because he had the sense not to turn it into a 1000+ behemoth like he often does. Or maybe he just ran out of ideas. Anyway, I'm grateful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...","review":"You should really read this book. If you're tired of Clancy's long, drawn out narratives describing every-last detail of a situation...then try this book.

I've read a number of Clancy's novels, this is my favorite. He does a great job of developing the character, Kelly, exposing his warts along with his many strengths. Unlike some of Clancy's other books, you don't need to take notes to follow his cast of characters, this one spends most of the focus on the main story. The book also does a nice job of building background on one of Clancy's main characters. This is a great book, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without Remorse","review":"This book is very good. If you are a loyal TC fan, you will enjoy this book. Its a little long, but the story being told takes a long time to unfold. I have read it twice (both times on vacation) and enjoyed it both times.

If you havent read it, you'll notice a familiar name when you read of who is trying to catch him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"Tom Clancy did a great job as usual.

It's a shame then that I have to give this 2-stars, but I am reviewing the PRODUCT here, and that means reviewing what I paid for.I've never seen a Kindle book with as many typos/punctuation errors than this. The paperback is fine, but the conversion was really messed up. The errors are often enough to significantly detract from the reading experience. I knew this problem existed before purchasing, due to reading others' reviews, but I enjoyed the book so much that I had to have it in portable electronic form and there were no other options.Bottom line: avoid purchasing the Kindle version unless you really are prepared to ignore much-too-frequent typographical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"My father gave me the hardcopy right after it came out, as he knew of my addiction (shared by him) for Tom Clancy works. It was my first introduction to Mr. Clark. I started out, like most, with Hunt For Red October, and until this book, it (Red October) was my \\"most appreciated\\".

It starts out with a number of seemingly unrelated incidents. The author apparently knows where he is and when he is, but it would be nice if he would share that with his readers. The novel then proceeds with a bunch of parallel plots, jumping continually from one to another. That is compounded by the author occasionally telling you how to build a watch when you just wanted to know the time. Do we really need a manual on building sound suppressors for handguns?The various plots eventually start to come together but, by that time, I was losing interest and skimming over substantial amounts of material trying to get on with the story. I regret that I followed the advise of the majority of reviewers, who rated it with four and five stars, and purchased the novel. It is a skimmer rather than a page-turner, and it is not on my listing of recommended novels for other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total remorse","review":"This book was full of technical errors, misspellings and the multi-facet plot lines were very discombobulated and difficult to dicerne where one stopped and another began thru out the entire storyline.

The pimp/drug lord has a hit done on Kelly and kidnaps Pam. Though Kelly is left for dead, he is taken to the hospital and recovers. In the meantime, Pam is brutally tortured and murdered.This triggers John Kelly's vengeful attitude.

Mr. Clark is an awesome character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"What makes this book a treat is all the technical information that goes into it. I'm not a soldier, weapons expert, or engineer, so I found the plethora of information a bit overwhelming, but I did come away having learned a few new things. The fact that this book is so well-researched gives a solidity to the novel that utilizes this information to tell us what is going on and what is being used. This was my first Tom Clancy book, and I was not disappointed at all. This tale of revenge and the man who metes it out rather meticulously - can't help but admire Tom Clancy for detail - made for a very enjoyable read. I do feel that the ending was just a bit cheesy (I shan't spoil it for you) but it was overall solid and satisfying. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than punisher","review":"If you like Tom Clancy's style and revenge stories then this is your book.The book writen by Tom Clancy is a revenge story of an ex vietnam soldier whos girlfriend got killed by drugdealers.He also has to rescue some pilots who were still imprisoned by the vietkong.Interesting plot full of issues and love for details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Vigilante, not techno thriller.","review":"Clancy diverges from his typical techno thriller to bring us a detailed story of one man pushed to far.The ability of Clancy to tell this detailed story leaves you wondering how far he went in his research.This novel is for the vigilante/police detective story type readers.Rather refreshing in its simplicity of plotline."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambo","review":"There must be many Charles Bronson fans here. In Clancy's world, Clark would be (and probably will be) an ideal president who would brutally execute all undesirables. I'd sooner vote for Hollywood Hulk Hogan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same formula, same result","review":"This book does not deviate from the formula that has made Clancy a successful writer. There are actually two or three plot lines going on at once, that all tie together in the end. The downside of this method is the same in this book as it is in his others as well. Interesting beginning, followed by several hundred pages of less than interesting material, followed by an exciting finish. It works well in some cases, however this book seemed to lack the suspense that his other novels have. There were a few twists and turns at the end, but nothing too surprising.My other criticism of Clancy's book is the same as my other reviews. Too much profanity and the repeated use of violent rape scenes to move the plot along. That's not entertaining to me. If it wasn't for the fact that I already have his books sitting on my bookshelf, I wouldn't be reading any more Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Audio Version Was Not Without Disappointment","review":"This review refers to the abridged audio book, read by David Dukes.The story was entertaining enough, but Mr. Dukes' reading was quite disappointing. He seemed to squeeze all of Mr. Clancy's many characters into one of a few vocal catagories: noble, pinched, gruff, and female. (The \\"female\\" voice, a too-soft falsetto southern belle, was particularly painful.) Many passages began with Mr. Dukes reading spoken dialogue which I mistook for a completely unintended character. Also, his voice tends to taper off at the ends of his sentances, I suppose for dramatic effect. I often got the impression that Mr. Dukes was thinking, \\"Man, I really sound cool reading this really cool book...\\"FYI - On a side note, I'm not a fan of written or verbal profanity, and this book has more than its fair share."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stand alone story but a great guide to the human condition","review":"I made the mistake of reading the condensed version of this book which seriously delayed me reading the full version (which is something I rarely do, along with seeing a movie first then reading the book...what a disappointment)Mr. Kelly-Clark figures pretty prominantly in most of the Jack Ryan stories by Tom Clancy. Without Remorse finally answers a lot of questions everyone must have had (I sure did) about what motivated this guy to be able to do the things he did which are kind of a evil walter mitty type. I cried, I cheered and at the end was grateful that Tom Clancy had given us a history to go with a great character. I sincerely hope he does the same for a few other recurring characters from earlier and current volumes"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Clancy","review":"First introduced to Clancy with The Hunt for Red October (don't know how to underline) I have read nearly all of his books but to be honest Jack Ryan has always dissapointed me. It is ridiculous to use the same character in so many unconnected plots and still hope to mantain realism. Ryan himself seems to have become an even weaker character now than in Clancy's early works as he now seems to be preaching his ethics constantly. I personally feel that Without Remorse is the only story of Clancy's with true character development. I did not give the book five stars as this will be reserved only for my absolute favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Tom Clancy does a superb job here. Many people say that when he gives up th\\"techno babble\\" he is much better. Some people say that when he does he is worse. I don't agree with either side, I think that he's always great. this story explores fundemental things like right and wrong, while at the same time talking about other why people do things. Also, for all you action lovers, this is action packed. \\"Mr. Clark\\" is a ex-Navy Seal. he has brains and strenght that add another edge to this story. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense. Thrilling. A must read for any Clancy fan!","review":"Clark is the mysterious agent who helps America out of so many jams. Now Clancy allows us a look into the man's past. Where is he from? How did he come to be with the CIA, where at times he seems to resent them so? Clark's life is one of tragedy, love, determination, violence, and revenge and how they come together in this man. I give this book one of my highest recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-techie, good series background story","review":"I admit I am one of the Clancy techno fans.(Ex-Navy) If you are like me you could skip this one but I also love the references he makes to previous novels and want to be ready for them. This one will give you some insight to comments by Mr. Clark in Clear and Present Danger. Still a good story with some military/cia angles, but not the gripping thrillers of previous Clancy fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot's good, but spare me the meathead stuff.","review":"I like Tom Clancy overall and I did indeed like this book. It contains the best and the worst elements of his writing. The plot, as always, was intriguing and interesting. I'm usually able to remember the details of Clancy novels years after I've read them, and 'Without Remorse' will be no exception. At the same time though, enough of the conservative ranting and raving! Drugs in the inner city and how they corrupt our innocent youth. A girl victimized into becoming a prostitute, but saved (for a while) by the main character's love. The typical goody-goody theme that people of different backgrounds CAN get along (like Clark and the doctor who runs aground on his island). Maybe it's just me, but I get enough of this 'big-hearted' stuff on TV. So yet again, another good book, but not a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Remorse","review":"Umm yea this was my first experience reading tom clancy so I don't have any strong feelings one way or another. So yea it's very obvious that he does do a lot of research before writing so much so that i myself got lost in some of the military jargon and weapons lingo. But it was a compelling plot, straight forward and easy to understand. Sometimes it was a little confusing to keep track of characters especially the navy admirals because they mentioned like 3 different names for each character, first, last, and nickname. Then he wouldn't talk about them again for another chapter or so. So by the time you think you've figured it out you've forgotten the next time the characters come around. The characters themselves were a little two dimensional and the dialog also needed some work I doubt very much that people are straightforward. All and all I give it a 4 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, kindle version has many typos (poor OCR???)","review":"This book is one of the best from TC! I'm glad my kindle purchase was for a re-read however. There are many typos in the kindle version (e.g. a 1 rather than a I). Some/most of these are just annoying, but some make the text unreadable/incomprehensible. I don't know what the process is for converting a book to kindle format, but if I had to guess based on the types of typos that I'm seeing in there I'd guess it's some for of OCR (which is fine, but they really need to do a better job at proof-reading the digitally converted text).

I am a huge John Clark(aka; Kelly) fan, and also relished the beginnings of Jack Ryan's story.

It showed how the 3 friends reacted to and with one another in somewhat closed place. I think it showed how true love with triumph between all of the characters. I think my favorite character was Kyle as he was the level headed one and pretty much kept the other two in line. I would recommend this Alex's other books for gay teens or any one to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to a great series!","review":"I just finished reading this book today and I can honestly say that this is among my favorite book series'. This last book in particular didn't connect to me as much as the previous two though, just because it wasn't in the school setting, I think.But besides that, this book was marvelous. Sanchez's writing style is great. It's a quick easy, and unforgettable read about the three boys' trip across America. They covered a lot of good things surrounding the lgbt community too, which was awesome. : )Overall, if you've read the first two, it would make absolutely no sense to not read this one.

Nothing is sugar coated - a few hunters are shown being killed (but no REAL animals were harmed).Linda Hunt is the narrator for 'Mastering The Beasts', while John Slattery's voice is used for the 'How We Know What We Know' segments, with their timelines, maps, and archeological information.

Recommending this historical fiction book for 11-13 year old boys is a no-brainer. It was awesome!As a side note, I used the Paces study guide along with the book. The character chart in the study guide helped me keep track of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Treasure Is Funny!","review":"I am a 12-year-old boy, and I thought Snow Treasure was amazing and funny. It had lots of facts and tidbits weaved throughout the story about how the Nazis invaded Norway. The Norwegians had $9,000,000 worth of gold, and they didn't want the Nazis to get it. The gold was sledded 35 miles every day to get to the pick-up spot. Every day kids would take down four bars of gold each and bury the bars of gold and build a snowman over them so a freighter could pick them up and take them to America. They had several close calls where they almost either ran into Nazis or had the Nazis suspect something and try to take their gold away.

However, From The Underground is bay far my favorite between that era and an excellent album throughout. It was a good change in direction while Metallica were getting lighter, Overkill got heavier. Killing Kind was a new direction and a rebirth for Overkill, it was heavier and slower with tuned down guitar to give it a harde edge. However From The Underground is even heavier and slower with a near death metal sound in parts. From the Underground gets a solid 4.5 stars and my highlights which I'd recommend hearing are F.U.C.T., Promises, Save Me and The Rip and Tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mi paladar exigente es","review":"el que califica con cinco estrellas a estas recetas...MI MUJER LO CALIFICA CON VEINTE !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A recipe book with many outstanding qualities:","review":"Authentic, absolutely Mexican, even published in Mexico.Delicious without being heavy for your stomach.Easy to follow"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"the bigger they are, the harder...\\"","review":"Eric Clapton was my undisputed hero during the seventies, even with schlock like \\"Lay Down Sally,\\" or \\"Wonderful Tonight.\\" But here, mid 90's, he drags in Babyface to produce a song for a J Revolta movie.

Those were fun books with tons o' action and hot warrior and cylon action. They were like really good episodes of the second season that never was (BSG 80 doesn't count). But all of the collaborations with Brad Linaweaver are just plain awful. Linaweaver is a simply horrific writer. His sentences and dialogue are completely disjointed, illogical, and nonsensical. The plot and story don't go anywhere. There is a lot about what people are thinking and no one is actually doing anything. Hey Hatch, how about some action and some Cylons!!! How about good story and plot??!! Too much to ask, I guess!! And Starbuck is once again turned into a minor character, whereas Hatch's Apollo is a divine god.

Not even a discussion of the obvious juxtaposition of \\"Backstreet's Back\\" and its pull on current zeitgeist. One wonders if she is even qualified to discuss her subject; her credentials are not even listed, nor do we get an annotated bibliography. And where are the footnotes? You call yourself a critic? She is COMPLETELY out of her realm when she declares that Howie D.'s dance riffs are a throwback to dada genrists, when he himself declared that he's a disciple of Berthold Brecht.I await the definitive answer to this tome, \\"Backstreet Boys Forever in Your Heart,\\" by my esteemed colleague, the University of Pennsylvania's Dr. Bruce Wayne Issalbacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"A Michael Connelly endorsement led me to this one.I simply either didn't get it or didn't like it...probably a combination of both.I found it too dark, depressing, bleak, unfun and almost hopeless.

But, most of them are from California folks. So maybe it wasn't meant for me in the first place. Perhaps one needs to have the California experience to appreciate this.

The cult stuff in the first half is all pretty formulaic and not very relevant, even in 2000. And after Shannon exhausts his one-liners about cults and religion in general, he moves in the second half to a completely different problem, one to which there really is no solution, so he brings on the proverbial truck.I enjoyed The Concrete River, but Shannon must have switched editors or something. Everyone, including Shannon himself, spends time connecting him with Raymond Chandler, but a more apt comparison is with Carl Hiaasen. The difference is that Hiassen's kooky Floridians have something to do with the plot, whereas Shannon's kooks don't have any plot to connect to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Child-proof For Stair Rail","review":"We used this clear plastic netting to cover our indoor stair rails that have too much space in-between each post. It has worked well at keeping our baby/ toddler and children from dangling their limbs or falling from high heights. This product is made from somewhat stiff material and I do not recommend it if your rail is not straight. If it is slanted, the netting will not protect as well because there will be triangle-shaped open spaces at the bottom. The plastic bands included for securing the netting to the rail is not great. It does the job but I would have liked this product even better if the netting had finished edges and a more attractive and practical way of securing to the rail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor durability","review":"I would not recommend this product for outdoor use. I am writing this review approximately ten months after installing this product on my deck and it is completely disintegrating. I actually took it down this evening because I was tired of cleaning chunks of it out of my yard.For the cost and time it takes to install, I would definitely consider other alternatives. The reason I installed this product is b/c there is a large gap at the bottom of my railing that we were concerned our son could fit through. I will now be installing new balusters -- yes, at a higher cost, but I could have put the $100+ I wasted on this product toward the new lumber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favourite in the series...but still good","review":"As the title says...but still an excellent book. The entire series and especially the best books in it really immerse you in the story lines and this does it exceptionally well.

There are no videos available that depict what life is like traveling the circuit looking for crops to pick. This was the closest I found to the subject. It depicts Jamaican workers in the east coast and there is a short piece showing what it is like for a Mexican Immigrant out of work and down on his luck. Not exactly what I was looking for but I used the short pieces in between my lecture and the end interview with the director was interesting. I am not sure if my students got anything out of it. Not terribly memorable.

This new CD is a phenominal live set of all their greatest hits (minus Don't Let it End, and I really miss that song). But the highlight for me comes in the new tune penned by Dennis DeYoung called \\"Paradise.\\" Originally included in his brilliant Hunchback of Notre Dame show on Broadway, DeYoung reworked the lyrics to fit it well into the band's long list of power ballads. It's simply amazing to me a band of this stature had trouble getting a recording contract. Styx still has the punch and bravada many of today's bands only dream of. Todd Sucherman does a wonderful job of taking John Panazzo's place on the drums (RIP, John...your time to go was too soon) and gives many songs new drumming arrangements that freshen up the beats a bit. A great CD...can't wait for the new album. Here's hoping Dennis gets well soon and comes back out on the road with his band."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG HITS !","review":"Styx has so many Big Hits.

These are two of the three new tracks featured on this '97 release. From there, we are taken back to the \\"hits\\", with the ever-familiar show opener \\"Rockin' the Paradise\\". Live, these guys can ROCK! No doubt, all through disc 1, and on to disc 2, it's new, but familiar. The song \\"Show Me The Way\\" is very emotional. Personally, this song is much better than the original. \\"Renegade\\" rocks like never before, and at the end of disc 2, we find the last new song, \\"Dear John\\". Written by Tommy Shaw, it is a very powerful tribute to the late drummer. This is a must get for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thanks to Styx","review":"This album is a must have for anyone in their 40s who was a fan of 1970s Styx. Listening to the live recording, it's hard to believe that these guys are about 30 years older than when they recorded some of these earlier songs and that it was about 25 years ago when I saw the original Paradise Theater tour.The music and vocals are just exactly as I remember them - maybe even better. It is great to have Dennis DeYoung back and I am thrilled to add another Styx+Dennis recording to my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Styx!

And let me make one thing clear: I love Styx, and have most of their studio albums. The album contains some sentimental moments, like \\"Dear John\\". But apart from this memorial song the album is of no value what so ever. Styx just doesen't seem to fix live recordings. It's \\"Caught in the act\\" all over again, only worse.

There are no emotions and no thoughts revealed in the long closeups of his ugly mug. You fill in the blanks for what he might be thinking or feeling. This isn't acting, it's filming. Although the plot ostensibly concerns four past romantic relationships of Murray's, nothing is revealed about them when he travels to see these women. In the absence of dialogue and detail, the viewer is free to make up their own story about what happened in the past as well as the protagonist's present perspective on it.

The story bits along the way are bazaar and pointless, just like the movie and absence of resolution at the end.

I was quite suprise considering all the glowing reviews when the movie was first released into theaters. Murray plays a depressed late lifer. I'd say midlife except Murray is actually 55 but looks more like 65 in this film. His character Don Johnston has seemingly lived (and continues to live) the life of the carefree playboy sleeping with various women (most of whom are 20 years younger). Now he gets an anonymous letter claiming he has a son who is trying to find him. There is very little laughter, mostly serious moments. This may sound crazy but at times I got the impression Murray was bored with doing this movie. As if he was painfully sitting through some of the seens hoping the director would hurry and get it over with so he could go home and do other things. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the punchline","review":"I sat through this whole movie, granted, but not so much out of interest but out of curiosity - trying to figure out what it was about and where it was going!

It being Bill Murray, who was I to doubt?

It's second only to \\"All About Schmidt\\" in the mind-numbingly boring department."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting and a bore","review":"Interesting acting by Stone, Swinton, Wright, Lange and others.

Acting aside this is like watching paint dry or contemplating your navel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible gift for the man you love","review":"I cannot believe that this movie was suggested as a Valentine's day gift for a man. This movie is about a depressed and ignorant womanizer. What message would one be sending with this gift? \\"You're a jerk like this guy, but I love you anyway?\\"I haven't even mentioned just how bad this movie is to begin with though. There are dead moments all over the place.

Overrated. A complete waste of time. It's like eating stale bread for almost two hours!!! By the time you're finished you feel like throwing up. If Jim Jarmusch was a painter he would be one of those artists that paints a canvas black and calls it art. There is absolutely no life in this movie and this is nothing more than a black canvas painting.

Stop thinking about it because your head might explode."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mean Trick","review":"What can I say? I expected great things when rottentomatoes.com had this rated at 86% fresh on their tomato picker (that's pretty damned good). Now I'm completely backed in saying that the majority of critics in the USA are full of sh**! Why no one had the balls to flunk this piece of garbage is beyond me. This film was simply dreadful! It was too long, too boring, and too uninviting. By the end I could give a rat's ass if he ever found his son! That's how uninvolved was. I have heard the film was a dead pan comedy but the word dead pan is an understatement. The film IS dead. Broken Flowers has no pulse! Nothing happens and nothing is resolved; how aggrivating! I am so sad that all these wonderful female actresses (from Lange, to Swinton) in this film were missused and uncared for (many simply have one or two liners). However, I do give points for films that make me feel something. This one, unfortunately, made me feel pissed off. I want my 8 bucks back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slice Of Life with great mood and cinematography","review":"View this movie as a slice of life rather than as most other cliche films that have a build-up to the plot, climax then taper off into an explanation together with the standard happy or sad ending. If you bear this in mind, you may be pleasantly surprised by what see.Don Johnston (Bill Murray) just exists. That is until he receives a mysterious and anonymous pink envelope which contains a letter claiming he has son he has never seen. This leads him on a fully-planned (thanks to hilarious weed-smoking, amateur-dective Jamaican neighbour Winston) road-trip to visit each of his former flames in an attempt to find the mother of his child. But things are not as straight-forward as he would like.After following a trail of red herrings will he finally be able to solve the mystery of his missing son?My advice: Don't analyse, just enjoy the ride :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough one to watch","review":"This is one of those films that you either roll with, or you don't. I found it a failure on nearly every level, but can at least say that it has a distinctive style that elevates it above 1-star fare. I enjoyed director Jarmusch's \\"Mystery Train,\\" but struggled to make it through this one -- cutting 15 minutes might have helped considerable; the long scenes that Jarmusch constructs had me begging for an edit.The acting was competent, but I didn't see the greatness in it that many critics did. Only Tilda Swinton registered strongly. Bill Murray seems to be doing this type of character to death recently, and while he does have a few classic moments, they are way too far and few between.The film does step it up a little in the final 15 minutes, but by then it's too little, too late. 2005 was a disappointingly lackluster year for indie fare, and this film is, unfortunately, another letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"www.sportofdistraction.com","review":"Excellent film.

To me.Murrays' previous \\"hit\\", that underwater-movie, was also horrible. Too easy, too simple. \\"Lost in translation\\" was beautiful. And proved a variety in Murrays' acting skills. Hoping for a more demanding part for him soon, it is easy to put a lot more into a movie that \\"Broken flowers\\" that in truth it deserves.

The main character, Don (Bill Murray),gets an anonymous letter stating that he has a nineteen year old son. Then he goes and visits all of his ex-girlfriends from the 70's in order to find the one that fathered his child. It started off well, the characters were quirky and it there were some pretty funny parts. However, after he visits his first two ex girlfriends, the movie really started to drag and most of the scenes had no significance to the story at all. Also, it had no ending! This movie just leaves the audience feeling unfulfilled and confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical comedy","review":"I'm a fan of Jim Jarmusch's simplistic, real life shooting style. And that's what this is. If I be so bold as to call it \\"real life comedy\\". There's no over the top scenarios in the Hollywood sense. The story is a little bleak, yet for some reason it appeals to me. Think \\"Lost in Translation\\". Bill Murray is a master at being depressed yet still making you smile. This movie is also accompanied by a great soundtrack.No, this movie isn't hilarious but it's a great movie with many different emotions and left open to many different interpretations. It's worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Jarmusch directs another great film","review":"Jim Jarmusch is one of the last truly independant filmmakers around. Completely original and beautifully acted. Bill Murray's performance rivals that of Lost in Translation, but still doesn't overtake it. This film is one of the more underrated films of the year along with Gore Verbinski's The Weatherman and Harold Ramis' The Ice Harvest. This film is quirky, funny, and depressing all at the same time. All of Don's former lovers all are acted wonderfully, especially by Sharon Stone. This is a very mellow but sweet comedy. One of Jarmusch's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word - SUCKS","review":"I almost turned it off in the first 30 mins but I thought I would see if it got better. It never did.

For everyone else, dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I really am a Bill Murray fan - but this one is ridiculous - why on earth would he accept this role? The movie was stupid, boring and not worth one's time - there are too many other good films out there to watch. The plot was shallow and uninteresting. The acting was good but not enough to redeem the film. Find something else to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooooooring!","review":"It took Jim Jarmusch two weeks to write this script?

A BIG F**k You to Jim Jarmoooooosh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor -","review":"My first point - Bill Murray's performance detracts from the film. He's a 'downer' from start to finish. Second, the ending is terrible - Murray has met a young boy that might be his son. Murray repels the boy by asserting that he knows the boy is looking for his father. Boy runs off. End of movie. What was the point? 3)The entire movie, start to finish, is boring. It's about Murray looking for a woman who might have born his son 19 years ago, and at the same time that 19-year-old looking for his father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Actors","review":"I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life.

I almost slit my own wrist while watching this incredibly boring movie, just so i would be spared from having to finish it. What is going on with Bill Murray these days?

I dont understand why Jim Jarmusch keeps showing these boring scenes where you see Bill Murray, lying, sitting, being on the plane, driving or whatever and just nothing happens. with all those scenes out, the movie would have been half as long. That way i would have only wastes 45 minutes of my life, cause the rest isnt much better. Especially the end pissed me off.

He shows zero feeling when he is acting, there seems to be nothing there....gather to guess that in his heyday, he may have done too many drugs or something. Ever since Osmosis Jones, his acting has not been something that I seek out. Terrible, not even worth a chuckle or anything in this case. Yuck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me sleepy.","review":"Several years ago, when this film was released, I paid 35 bucks for a ticket to attend a live interview with Jim Jarmusch, the director of this film, at NYU with my buddy, Mike. It was two hours long, but it felt like six. Mr. Jarmusch stated that he wrote the script for this movie in two weeks. In my opinion, he took too long. It shouldn't have taken him longer than two days, three tops. It's as slow as a brontosaurus, boring as a Presbyterian, trite as a tube of toothpaste, and the story has nothing interesting to say about anything. And the film ends without the slightest resolution of its paper thin premise. It's like the movie ended because the director ran out of film. Mr. Jarmusch is a pretty interesting guy. But, let's face it, if Bill Murray wasn't in this film, you couldn't give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"ground hog murray","review":"Really went in expecting a smart, sophisticated story like Lost In Translation. What it is is a very inferior movie with Bill trying hard not to be trying hard. He takes the low key style that worked perfectly in Lost and mangles it. Sorry Bill, unlike Ground Hog Day, you can't just rehash the same role over and over again. Has it's moment - too bad it doesn't make up enough of it to salvage the movie. One thing that is very good - the soundtrack!By the way, I think a lot of viewers missed the point of the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost loves Character study","review":"Engaging tale about a guy who receives an unsigned letter from a former lover who tells him they had a child together and the child is 18 now and may come looking for him!The guy shares the letter with a friend and the friend goes about locating the guys former loves so he can trace them down and figure out which one sent him the letter.The first one is Sharon Stone and they have a pleasant memorable reunion. The next is a gal who is married and doesn't appear to be happily so. Next is Jessica Lang who throws the flowers he gives her back at him. Finally is a gal at a farmhouse and her two friends beat him up, each meet goes progressively downward.At the end Murry's real life son passes by in a car. The features consist of outtakes and some director comments. has a catchy little tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz....","review":"WOW...I think the only reason people are giving this film good reviews is soley because Bill Murray is in it. For this movie, that isn't enough. Let's be honest here, after sitting through this bore-a-thon I was at least exspecting the ending to be make up for it..Absolutely not. I swear he was playing a Zombie in this one. And included a very akward and VERY unnessicary pre-teen nude scene. Very Upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hours of My Life Wasted","review":"I don't remember ever being so utterly disapointed in a movie, as I was while watching Broken Flowers. There aren't enough words in the English language to describe how stupifyingly BORING this movie is. Its not deep, its not profound, it doesn't make you think (well, it did make me think about the $5 and 2 hours of my life I had just thrown away).I have been a Bill Murray fan for decades. I've enjoyed his comedies, and I've enjoyed him in dramas. Why anyone would enjoy watching him in scene after scene of sitting in his living room staring into space, or driving down the road, is beyond me.Its really baffling since this movie has such a good premise, and such a strong cast. If I could give it less than one star I would. It was boring and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've seen ...","review":"... both for Bill Murray and one in general. Slow, boring, pointless. 10 minutes of Bill Murray laying in his hotel room doing nothing. 15 minutes of Bill Murray driving in the car doing nothing. 20 minutes of Bill Murray sitting on his couch doing nothing. The rest is even more pointless and stupid, if that's at all possible. If you've seen \\"Lost in Translation\\", this is basically the same exact movie. (I would've said \\"with a different plot\\" if there was a plot, but there wasn't...)What a complete waste of time. I am starting to agree with my wife who keeps saying \\"I hate Bill Murray\\". I am starting to get there as well. One more movie like this, and I am done watching anything where he is one of the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staring at drying paint - would be more interesting!","review":"This is another of Murray's catatonic performances, in a plot that might be worthy of a 20 minute short subject, but is stretched into a full length movie mainly thanks to his ability to sit in a stuporous state with a lobotomized stare - one always expects to see him raise his hand to be excused to the boy's room. Sharon Stone's career must be at rock bottom to bag a cameo role in this stinker.If you can read something into this film, then you must be able to devine tea leaves or stare at a monotone paiting and see Breugel.I wouldn't have watched this for free, and showing it to detainees at Gitmo would peg the torture scale.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, LET ALONE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what movie were other reviewers at?","review":"in contrast to other reviewers, I found this movie extremely missable - kept waiting for it to move past its deadly slow pace and basically unbelievable story line. By the end of the movie I (and all friends who have also seen it) wished I had saved both my time and money.Give it a complete miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jarmusch loses the plot...","review":"Don't believe the hype people - just because it's a Jarmusch movie does not entail it's brilliant by that fact alone. The cracks were starting to appear in \\"Coffee & Cigarettes\\" - about half the stories in that film should've ended up on the cutting room floor.Bill Murray was playing the role he's always played but to the nth degree. His character was dull dull dull - maybe that was the point but I don't watch films to be bored to death. Further there was a scene with an attractive nymphette (daughter of one of his ex-lovers) coming on to him in a big way - totally unbelievable. Bill's nearly geriatric, he sure ain't no stud, and his character had all the charisma of a dead fish. This film was completely self-indulgent and looked as though Jarmusch was showing off the \\"A\\" he got in Symbolism 101. Stultifyingly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Murray","review":"It's sad to see how desparate Bill Murray has become in his pursuit of the Oscar. His new mantra appears to be \\"the more obtuse, the better\\" as he has moved from bad to worse in his last several movies. He plays the same comatose, walking-through-life-without-purpose vegetable that he started in Lost in Translation; with less connective tissue. Murray's \\"Don Johnston\\" is hardly a convincing Don Juan, as he walks through life with a perma-frown borne from a life with less purpose then EuroDisney in France. The best part of the movie is when Murray's character gets knocked out flat. It's just-desserts for the formerly funny and talented actor, who has sold the last few years of his life for trite material in the pursuit of respectability. It's too bad because he used to be respectable, in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead, Dull, and Dumb","review":"This is a very flat, dull, lifeless movie. An absolute waste of Bill Murray's talent, and a waste of the audience's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a movie","review":"I generally like Jarmusch's work and I was very disappointed in this movie.I thought this movie took the concept of \\"spare\\" much too far in terms of plot. I found the film lacked sufficient cohesion to make it the gem it could have been. When the credits rolled, I found myself saying \\"Huh? What happened?\\"...and not in a good way.There are some sweet moments and bits of lovely performance work. That doesn't make a movie for me. If you are a Tilda Swinton fan, please know she is almost unrecognizable in this film.

(If you understand French, add one star!)But the music is also interesting on its own. In order to balance the Burt Baccharach-inspired style of his previous album (Mes mauvaises frequentations), Katerine draws here on a more jazzy tradition, playing with improvisation, with elaborate rythms and sometimes odd harmonies. The result is not very catchy, but it gets more engrossing after a few listenings.If you have the occasion to see Philippe Katerine live, go for it, it's quite unbelievable how such an introverted person can transform into such a showman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great french avant-pop!","review":"A unique mix of old Serge Gainsbourg, modern jazz, world music and even avant-garde.Katerine wrote great, funny french lyrics about himself and strange things like his love of a chicken, things he never did, etc.A wide open album that is not perfect, but that is very, very original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice pep talk","review":"If you want to know the structure of a purpose statement or research questions, or formats for a desertation, this is NOT the book for you.

It is, as most of the DX lenses, a plastic based barrel and is light enough to travel and easy to hand hold in most lighting situations. Although I have not had the lens that long, it seems to be fast focusing and sharp optically. If it holds up as well as it appears from other reviews I have read, the price makes it a good general usage lens. The plastic construction should not be held as a negative as it seems to be sturdy nonetheless. The manual/autofocus switch is easy to use and the lens shade bayonets in and also stores reversed by bayoneting as well. The mount is plastic but, unless you abuse your equipment, seems to seat well and does not appear to be a negative factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Quality Lens for the Money Paid","review":"I liked this lens.

For the money, it's a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter Telephoto lens","review":"I bought this lens because I was looking for a decent starter telephoto lens. This Lens does fine in good lighting but lacks the aperture to shoot at night without adding speedlights or having a very slow shutter speed. I was looking a buying the VR version but decided it was a uneeded feature since I do have tripods. That said I haven't had any issues with blurred pictures except in low lighting when the shutter is down around 1/60th.Overall if your are looking for a lens to shoot your kids games, wildlife etc. during the day. This lens will not let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Add to your Camera Bag","review":"I use this lens more than I use the 18-55mm.

And see the details. I noticed a little noise on completely zoomed in images if they are cropped, but I love this lens. It does not have VR (vibration reduction) so hold your hand steady, or use a tripod for slower shutter speeds.

A cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints. Very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm). I disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (D200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 VR lens from Nikon.If your interested in nice sharp pics, then pass on this lens.

I can find a doll half that price at Target. The \\"crying\\" is just a big mess to clean up and as for going \\"potty\\", that is not even worth the hassel! We got my daughter the Baby Born wooden highchair, but the baby sits up in it and she has to be slightly laying down in order to feed her!! Doesn't make sense to build a highchair that can't be used with the doll! As for the \\"sqeeling with excitment\\" it is literall just a squeek!! Like a dog toy would make!! While the doll is adorable and my daughter seems to enjoy playing with her, I would look for something else.

K-ci is the man and he is representing JODECI to the fullest on this one !!! PICK IT UP !!!!PEACEFALLON"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow moving book","review":"On his first solo release, Kci still shows he can BLOW & SANG but without big name producers the release doesn't show his full potential. The disc starts off with a standrard calling out the haters track called My Book. After that the disc is pretty much by the numbers R&B. Kci does shine on two tracks which are Conversation (Can I Talk 2 U) and Much Too Soon.Much Too Soon featured Al B.Sure & Aaron Hall and all three singers sounds as good as they did when they were in their prime. I wish that Kci had a bigger budget so he could work with big producers such as Babyface, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis or even hook up with fresh talent like The Underdogs & Stargate. Buy this CD for the vocals and not the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"J","review":"I had different expectations for this album, so I was completely surprised by the topics of the songs. I wasn't expecting K-Ci to be singing about the hood, ghetto women, and something about a thug. What I was expecting was more songs like Conversation and Woman's Gotta Have It. This album is a far stray from the albums with Jo Jo and a much farther stray from the Jodeci days. The lyrics are disappointing. Hey, but you decide for yourself. It seems like more people than not likes this album. You can have mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"k-ci my book","review":"this album is very late in the making. We the listening people, wanted this album when he was with jodeci!!! Before his voice went to this bobby womack transformation.You'll find about 3 songs you can listen to all the way through! Not the same k-ci that was with jodeci. I know how this sounds, this album needs better production! From the words, beats,and chorus. Like ronald isley, charlie wilson, needed, k-ci needs a good producer & songwriter to rejuvenate his career!! To name a few, R Kelly, Anthony Hamilton, Bryan Cox (from joe albums and many artists)and timbaland. These guys can write & produce soul for him, especially anthony hamilton!!! All in all the album is ok!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a great cd although it had very poor promotion. I love the cd because it is smooth, soulful, sexy and easy listening.

The author doesn't restrict himself to historically accurate recipes or ingredients. He suggests Babylonian tomato paste? Sliced Egyptian tomatos in a salad? (Tomatos are a New World ingredient). Imaginary \\"lead\\" cookware is an added distraction! (Did you ever try heating a lead pot?)The author says his inspiration was various Hollywood movies and Classic Comics. He also admits he knows that his stuff isn't accurate, but it is created to give a feel for the cuisine. The recipes will be different than what you probably are accustomed to eating, but historically accuracy is less than excellent. I would use this for making a high school \\"feast\\" but serious re-enactors and living historians can give this book a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlighting the history of food preparation","review":"Impressively compiled and presented by Oswald Rivera, The Pharaoh's Feast is a unique and impressive collection of 110 simple recipes that have been passed down from antiquity to the present day.

The action is all very credible, a testament to the quality of acting. If you want to understand the concept of Femme Fatale, you should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen w/o the music w the Sex!","review":"This film is an adaptation of the original story that the opera Carmen was based on. It has a great look ( very Goya in it's landscapes ) and it has an actress, Paz Vega, who is quite believeable as a woman who could make most fellows stray off the straight and narrow!!!Well worth a look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should read \\"based on Mérimeé's short story\\"","review":"This film is an almost line-by-line retelling of Prosper Mérimée's short story Carmen, which, decades later, became the source of Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy's libretto for Bizet's opera. The American DVD edition cover dutifully dumbs this down for our consumption: \\"based on Bizet's wildly popular opera\\".So much for ignorant marketing! At least, we get an anamorphic transfer -the Spanish edition is woefully letterboxed!Superb photography, beautiful actual locations, and Ms Vega, who is not at all shy about performing head-to-toe, full frontally and rearly **clothed** in more than one scene!What an eyeful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the opera Carmen","review":"I should have read the description and reviews before ordering. I thought I was ordering the opera CARMEN, which I have loved since seeing it on television in the 1960s, even though I was a teenager and a fan of The Beatles and other pop/rock music. I've always had an open mind and loved all kinds of music.This is not a musical. It is a movie based on the storyline of the opera. CARMEN is in Spanish, but has the option of subtitles in English as well as other languages. The film and sets are beautiful, as is the actress Paz Vega, who plays the part of Carmen.I can't give it less than four stars, because it is a very well made movie. I will now have to find a good version of the opera to order. I would appreciate any suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensational","review":"Although this is an old story played over, Paz Vega brings new excitment to it.

The bands energy and cameraderie is infectious. The \\"unplugged\\" arrangements of the songs are nothing but amazing. Living in the US, I'd never been able to see the Unplugged, but had heard bootleg copies of a few of the songs. This is a musical treat that I can watch over and over. Ruben Albarran is in top form, with his trademark voice, gravelling his way through tunes like \\"La Ingrata\\". Then, he turns around a sings a song like \\"Esa Noche\\" in voice so pure and beautiful it can break your heart. Just a top notch performance. If you think you won't like it because the lyrics are in Spanish.. this is your chance to open your mind to something a little different. I promise you, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must!","review":"If you're a fan of Cafe Tacvba you must complete your collection with the Unplugged DVD.

I waited, then called, it was on the way they said and then found out it was sent to a home in Texas. Just make sure if you are buying anything on Amazon it says SHIPPED from Amazon and NOT from another company that is using Amazons website to sell their items. My little boy was so sad that Santa didn't bring the tapes he wanted. I was not to happy with this order and will think twice before I order things on line again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Magnum","review":"Most everyone knows this is an excellent detective series filmed in beautiful Hawaii. What I would like to mention that makes the DVD sets better than most is that the menu for each episode shows the airdate and a short synopsis of what the episiode is about. In addition each set includes a couple episodes of another TV series from the period. This set includes an \\"A-Team\\" and \\"Knight Rider\\" episode from their second seasons. So in addition to watching this great season of Magnum, P.I. I got to view a couple other TV series. I recommend all the Magnum series. My only complaint is the picture quality is not consistently sharp. Some parts do not look cleaned up. Otherwise I would give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show, bad DVD","review":"Three episodes do not play correctly and when you look at the DVD itself you can see that they are poorly made with stains and de-lamination on edges and the center.

I think people should have just look at his acting talent and recognized his diversity. He did this great series (which is just plain fun to watch) some fantastic Western movies (some of the best ever made), Jesse Stone TV Movies (excellent and suspenseful) and now his current TV series, Blue Bloods, which is getting great ratings!

SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Show Ever,...DVD is JUNK","review":"Another reviewer, Mick Black from Cleveland had it right. The video skipped and stopped cold on a few episodes. I carefully cleaned the disks, and the same thing happened.

Season 2 is BETTER THAN EVER!","review":"Magnum, P.I. is a classic TV show that never ages. Although the clothing can be humorous, the acting is timeless and the scenary is breathtaking as it ever was...both the actual coastline AND the Ferrari! :-)Season One was great, and Season Two doesn't disapoint either. Tom, T.C., Rick, and Higgins are at their best after a season of getting into the groove of working with each other, and I think it shows in the comradery and chemistry that they have in the second season of the show. It is not a stretch to believe that the Tom, T.C., and Rick served in Vietnam together, or that Higgins and Magnum really DO have a love/hate relationship. Which can only mean that they did their acting job really, really well.After watching the first two seasons, the only thing that I was left to ask was, \\"WHEN ARE THEY COMING OUT WITH SEASON THREE?!\\" It can't be soon enough for me.Recommendation for purchase (as opposed to renting it) of this series: ***** (5 Stars)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Perfect","review":"Just got my copy of season two today and was pleased with the more user friendly packaging compaired to the awful packaging of season one. There's just one problem. All 24 episodes (including bonus) should have been on at least 4 discs, not 3. The season 2 episodes end a few seconds premature at the end credits and do away totally with the Universal logo at very end. No doubt, this was due to 3 disc space limitations and cost savings by Universal which of course increase corporate profits."},{"rating":"2","title":"First part great, second part not as good","review":"As another reviewer has stated, The Old Stone House takes up more than half the book while the other stories are quite short. That story rates 5 stars, in my opinion, and the other stories collectively about a 3. They read so quickly, though, both separately and as a whole, that the impression of the book after it's over is largely of that first story. These are not detective stories - their appeal comes from their atmosphere. Not Anna Katharine Green as we generally think of her, but a good read nonetheless. Very much recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and gloomy","review":"I confess I did not read past the first story in this anthology. What promised to be an interesting historical novel turned into a tale of increasing horror as the themes of jealousy and murder emerged toward the end of \\"The Old Stone House.\\" The author's craft was quite appealing, and there was never a hint of lewdness, but nothing could make up for the all-too-vivid portrait of the destruction and despair brought about by human hearts blackened with unholy passions. I gave this book one star because that is the lowest rating available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with Lion (10.7.2)","review":"The first one I was sent didn't work at all, but tiger direct's customer support was great and the second one came working fine.

You see Ichigo growth in developing his power and skill as a Soul Reaper. What was disapointing was that they did not show how Ichigo was able to reach \\"Bankai\\".The scene in which Ichigo takes out four squad lieutenants bare-handle was great. The real surprise is the identity of the \\"traitor\\" in the Soul Society to learn that a character with whom I thought was a noble personis an accomplice to the conspiracy.

I have a little experience with XML and have to admit I bought the book on impulse - I liked the title & was encouraged by some of the reviews. This book is not for anyone who has even *basic* knowledge of XML or the Web. There is a very long, very elementary description of how the Internet works, which I found odd in a book published in 2002.The XML & semantic web descriptions were very general and not original by any means. If you have a manager with a bit of a techie slant who, for some odd reason, does not understand the Internet or the potential of XML, this book might be perfect. There are better books and websites out there on both XML and the semantic web. Definitely a waste of my $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/4 mile wide - 1 inch deep","review":"If you know anything at all about XML and the semantic web - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. This book covers nothing in depth. I just spent 3 nights reading this book - waiting for something to happen - it never does. The author does not go into any decent technical detail on anything. If you have ever worked with XML and want to learn something about RDF etc... this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broad overview of XML and the semantic web","review":"The author provides broad overview of the semantic web and XML. It gives a beginner some insights into the field. It does not go into depth on XML, but gives several references for the reader to find more information. It also takes a database perspective in discussing the semantic web rather than an artificial intelligence perspective. I find this aspect very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broad but very well written","review":"This books covers a lot of topics very well. It starts with a discussion of web databases and semi-structured databases and then goes on to discuss XML, RDF and finally ties all the concepts together in a discussion of the semantic web. Semantic web is still evolving and the author clairifies the various concepts quite well. While this may not be at the right level for a technologist or a developer, this book will be quite appropriate for a manager or executive who wants to get q quick introduction to the semantic web and XML."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Book","review":"I am new to the field of web and databases and found this to be an excellent book.

As Dilbert says, \\"I ask for so little, and boy, do I get it.\\" A great many of the songs sound like leftovers, and with a couple of exceptions (most notably the pretty acoustic ballad \\"Maybe Someday\\"), Loverboy seems to be just going through the motions. They're still a fun band to see live, but this record sounds like an attempt to cash in on their renewed success as a road act. Only for the most absolute die-hard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loverboy- My, how they've lost it!","review":"Remember when Loverboy ruled? For me, it was back in High School, when I first heard \\"Hot Girls in Love\\" on the radio. I couldn't wait to get my hands on their album. Unfortunately, when I first heard \\"VI\\" (Yes, they actually NAMED the CD that!!), I couldn't WAIT to get my $ for it from the used CD store...because that's more than the CD is worth! No hooks, no melody...no saving graces.I hate to be negative, especially about the fab Loverboy, but it was so disappointing to hear what they've evolved into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, easy to use, good value","review":"Purchased one for front and side entry points.

The author ToniAnn Guadagnoli knows how to write children's literature. The simple rhyming text carries the reader along, while the stratchboard style illustrations exactly illuminate the text.

Originally labeled on the amazon site as David Bowie and Queen I purchased the album. I was hoping this might be full of collaborative gems between the group and Bowie. To my dismay it is the London Symphony playing Queen. While the music is good it is just not something that I would keep. Off to the delete bin for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Well, as live shows go...this would be a \\"2\\" with some \\"6\\" around the middle and heading back to \\"2\\" through the end.Jani wasn't even trying to sing through most of this, not even trying...and we all know that you don't listen to Warrant because of the irreplaceable band members right?Bummer.

And if you close your eyes and MAYBE squint a little, you can see the cabaret girls dancing, the absinthe bottles lying around, and the dancing.Paranoiac is a completely different style then his previous works, and really makes me curious as to what the remainder of the album will sound like. It very much resembles a slow MDFMK song, which makes sense seeing as how Tim Skold is their new bassist and helped produce the majority of the album.I came to see the mobscene, and I wasn't dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This truly is a great Mob-scene!!","review":"If you haven't heard the entire song yet, then listen to the sample up there and multiply it a 1000 times, and if it doesn't make you want to grab the entire album, then nothing will.. MOBSCENE is far greater than I was expecting and I was expecting a lot!!.. Because, although I was very concerned after Twiggy left, when the band hooked up with Tim Skold, I was no longer worried.. Not that Twiggy wouldn't have added a lot (because I believe he would have) it's just that a change in main-collaborators will naturally create some change in sound, and since Tim Skold has already proven himself to be a very talented Musician, adding his own style to MM's already unique style, they simply couldn't miss.. I knew that this new line-up was more than capable of making great music together, and they did!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the album isn't this bad...","review":"2 songs for a CD single.

I love mOBSCENE. I had already bought the Golden age of grotesque when i saw the mOBSCENE single in the store. I was to tempted so i had to buy it. It was the best purchase i have ever made. even the re-mix of the song Paranoiac is excallent. Many people say its the same but i dont think so. The music is dark and creepy and it puts more feelings into the lyrics.

It's a good read for most readers, even if it suffers from several flaws.The writing is mostly good, if somewhat artificial at times, especially when the author seemed to overreach in trying to be too lyrical. Behind the words, the story struggles to be told, even though one has probably guessed what it would be after the first two chapters. The historical background seems of uncertain authenticity and could have benefited from better research.Somehow I wish that the author had not yielded to his editors and done things like reversing the traditional order of Vietnamese names, or making them easier to pronounce in English but unrecognizable in Vietnamese. After all, how would Americans feel if they were to read a Vietnamese book where George Bush is referred to as Bush George?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I deeply appreciated this brilliantly woven tale! Highly recommended.","review":"Wow - this amazing book is so remarkably well-written that it's hard to imagine this is the author's first novel. He has brilliantly crafted a vividly stunning story, immersing the reader into a mysterious and exotic culture that is often misunderstood by those of us who live in the modern Western world. The detailed descriptions of the setting and of the various traditions and rituals were fascinating! Despite difficult to endure scenes of torture, severe injustices and executions, this story held a tragic beauty that was spellbinding. Full of action and suspense, it very artistically and soulfully captured the true spirit of the Vietnamese people. It has all the qualities of a classic epic novel, yet it's fast-paced and not an overwhleming number of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tapestries-a retelling of Chinese Serial Drama!","review":"Tapestries: A Novel captures readers' interest at the beginning, with vivid descriptions of a tradional, pre-arranged wedding. However, the author get caught into unevolved, unnecessary details that are not historically accurated. The novel does not accuratedly portray Vietnam in any periods (though some details are revelant to the Vietnamese history). Reading this book reminds me of a Chinese soap and a drama series in which the rich oppresses the poor; son carries the burden of family and seeks revegence; sacrifies and unjusts portray upon female. There is no originality in thought and plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"A treasure to keep for ever! Nguyen describes everything with such passion, I feel I'm there all the time.

I could not put the book down for entire nights. Certain details in the book seem to lack authenticity. However, as a whole, this book is a masterpiece...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tiring read","review":"I was disappointed with this book as it is full of lengthy description of landscapes, food, foliage, buildings et al. It was a chore to complete reading it and I found myself occasionally skipping parts of it. The storyline was OK and the entire tale could have been told much more succinctly. I read the first book by the same author and would highly recommend that. It was much more gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive. tastes like rotten roses.","review":"I love tea. I have a cabinet with over 30 types of tea at any given time and we drink tea nearly every day in my home. This tea, a \\"blooming\\" white tea with rose petals needs only to be brewed a brief time. All white teas are best brewed briefly to retain their delicate taste. Having said that (so you know that I know how to properly brew this tea), this tea tastes like fermented/rotten roses. It is disgusting. Sweetener helps, but white teas should not require a lot of sweetening to be good. Try Davidson's rose tea varieties or Zhena's Gypsy Love rose tea, they are far better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Get","review":"If anyone wants to get aquainted with the music of Djavan I think this album fits the bill perfectly.

It was too bad I wasn't paying more attention to the details. This DVD release has an unfortunate \\"R\\" rating. So, when I began to watch the film I noticed when it came up to the good scenes, all the action was left out. This unfortunately left the rest of the film lacking all positive quality. Since the story isn't the selling point of the feature. My suggestion is, you should avoid this DVD release, if at all possible. But, if you are desperately looking for this title.

Before you go there... I'm not counting bad language as a reason to give a movie an R rating. Even so, if Amazon knows or is told about this... they should demand a disclaimer from the producers on that the movie stating that the movie has been edited of original content and refund payment no questions asked when returned for this reason. That goes for all movies that are sold (for example:[[ASIN:B000VL7VEQ Killing Heat (1981)]this version is heavily edited but still has an R rating.)

I can live with 1970s hairy bushes and saggy rear ends. When it is combined with a really lame story, increadibly bad singing, and ugly actors two stars is being kind. I was expecting it to be viginettes based on Fairy Tales, but with adult situations. It was one big romp, with the made up prince looking for someone to marry to produce an heir so he can inherit his kingdom. He finds a virgin sleeping beauty in a whorehouse that the Old women who lives in a shoe runs. If you are looking for a good adult themed movie, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tales, no no no","review":"Disappointing- unless you want slow slapstick that is more of a turn off than turn on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"Netrebko had the voice of an angle, sang like an angle and die as Violetta like a healthy soprano! Her voice had purity and power few can match, despite some lack of expressiveness in her lower register. As violetta she conveyed effectively strong passion. I hope to see as well as hear her in a DVD of the Saltzburg performance. If the Bonus DVD was an indication, this production should be unconventional and exciting.On the slightly negative side she seemed to pause (breath?) at strange places and glossed over some notes every now and then. Perhaps these were to be expected in a live performance.The CD was well produced with nice, clean sound. It was very good for a live recording. The singers and orchestra seemed to be at two different acoustical spaces.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Villazon good, but Netrebko mis-cast","review":"Traviata is my favourite Verdi opera and I have gathered at home quite a collection of cds and dvds with some of the greatest Violettas: Callas, Gheorghiu, Sutherland, Moffo, etc. I bought this item based on amazon reviews, but the fact of the matter is that I regret having bought it: I like the tenor and the baritone, but Netrebko did not convince me as Violetta. Her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET. Add a frustrating enunciation that would have Italians scream in horror and a phrasing that would get one booed at La Scala before the end of Libiamo...So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this item for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes reader's stamina & determination","review":"After reading every word of the paperback, I find very little to say positive about \\"The Winter War\\".

Within a year, I was able to run 2 half-marathons and a full marathon. These shoes eliminated all complications...great for my overpronation and low arches. I have ordered 2 or 3 pairs at a time, paying up to $100 for them. Amazon's deal of $39.99 is a steal...I was told by another shoe dealer that this model was discontinued back in the spring.

Good thing too! The by-play between the twin brothers in this novel is unbelievable at best; the transformation from General to religious dictator is ridiculous; and the alien robots which suddenly turn up to save the day?

Although it does remind us of the sickness history has taught us about,especially around the period the movie is set in(circa 1949),it is too shocking brutal and unforgiving to offer any hope,let along enjoyment.Dennis Hopper's performance is fantastic!He is sadistic and paranoid and eventually pathetic.Hersey and Harris are excellent as they almost always are.The problem lies with the pattness of the movie.It's the familiar plot taken a little(or a lot)further for the shock value.I don't think I like this director and the screenplay might have been done by one of those slasher/gore types.The two stars are for the performances and that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzonka","review":"this movie is excellent,I purchased it for my mom on mothers day and she loved it. the best of Dennis Harpor and Barbara Hershey."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Beautiful Book","review":"The Great Chiefs is a true gem. This tells the tale of so many great Chiefs and warriors. One man that it does talk about is Geronimo who was not a Chief but a Medicine Man as well as a Revolutionary. Chief Joseph is also in there as well as Red Cloud and Sitting Bull. The tragedy of the Sioux is told in this Book and that is why I got it for that tragedy is one of the saddest moments in not only the history of the United States but the whole of mankind. Thunderheart is a tale about the tragedy of the people on the Ogalala Reservation in the 1970s, and the sadness of the tragedy of the Sioux is shown in continuation in that epic Motion Picture.Again for all who love history and the Old West please get as many copies of the Time Life Books collection on the Old West.

I end up taping over the mouthpiece and putting the cup in a ziploc plastic bag to prevent milk from getting everywhere.I was so excited to see these with travel caps. Imagine my disappointment when I realized my SEVEN new cups came with ONE cap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good sippy cup for the price","review":"I bought these because they look like the ones my daughter uses at daycare. They have held up pretty well through several dishwasher cycles and only leak a little bit when my daughter tosses them to the ground from her high chair. Biggest complaint is that they do leak a little and I got sent the \\"boy\\" colors instead of the ones pictured. I would buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea bad product","review":"I got these cups for my 15 mo old son. I thought that they would be great, a nice cup to take with us when we go out that I would not mind if we lost. I bought two packs and opened them right up, wash them, and then handed one to my son while he was sitting at the table. Not even two seconds later he had pulled the cap off and dumped the cup. This would be a great idea if the lids screwed on like the other sippy cups. The lids are really easy to take off. I would not recommend this cup to anyone unless you want a cup that your kids can open and you want to sit right next to them when ever they use this cup. Me I would just rather give him a regular cup he can not make any more of a mess. I love the other take and toss items and am really disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a cup we like!","review":"After trying many different sippy cups, we've been using these for nearly 2 years. Why?1. Easiest to clean by far - no valves or hard to reach places that end up collecting gross stuff you can't get out2. Easy to drink from, and still relatively good at preventing spills (my 13 month old does turn hers over and shake it from time to time, and yes, liquid will drip out. They are perfect for my 3 year old though.)3. Cheap & stackable - we have enough of them to put them in the dishwasher like regular glasses so we're not constantly handwashing. Plus, 8 of them stacked up takes up the same room as 1 or 2 other sippy cups alone.My only complaint- my son went through 6 months of chewing on them which does ruin the lids. I wish you could buy replacement lids only.I really recommend these - just came online to buy some more and thought I'd write a review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the, and don't toss","review":"My kids love these cups and so do I. We reuse them but it is good to know that if any or all of them get misplaced or lost I would not be out a fortune. Also, replacing them would not be costly either. They are spill resistant, I can't say 100% spill proof but if not being shaken up and down they do pretty good. All around I love these cups!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The lids come off way to easy. Too many messes!!!!!!!!!!","review":"They worked great for the first few times than the lids started to come off and if your child drops it the lid pops right off. I would not recomend on a consent use, maybe a take and throw away right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i could give them zero stars","review":"I used to buy these cups for my older kids and they were great but the last set that I purchased (about a week ago) is AWFUL! Every time my son turns the cup over, a large amount of liquid comes out. It's like a little watering can and, as you can imagine, he has tons of fun with it. I called Learning Curve to complain and the woman I spoke with informed me that they were \\"spill proof, not leak proof\\" and said that if they were turned onto their sides or flipped over, they would \\"leak\\". I have no use for a sippy cup that \\"leaks\\" -- that entirely defeats the purpose and I told her so. She kept insisting that is how the cups are designed. So buy these if you want your kids to have fun and make a huge puddly mess but not if you'd like your house or car or wherever to stay dry. If I wanted my son to have fun playing with his beverages, I'd give him a regular cup without a lid.Worthless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading! 5 oz cups, NOT 7 oz.","review":"I've been using these cups for several months and they are perfect for what they are - easy to drink out of, durable enough to be washed & used several times and cheap enough to recycle after a month or so.The last pack of cups I ordered from Amazon was NOT the same. The cups are almost identical to what they have been, but smaller. The item is listed as a 7 oz cup and that's what the packaging says, but the cups are much smaller than ones I've bought previously. I filled a new cup and poured it into a bottle with ounce markings. It was only 5 oz! I won't return these because they still work well for my daughter, but they are mislabeled and others should know they will not get 7 oz cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cups for some, may not be for others","review":"My kids are 2.5 years and 1.25 years respectively, and both enjoy using these Take and Toss cups. The lids stay on tightly and the liquid inside is easy enough for kids to drink out of. There are no valves to clean, the cup itself is easy to clean, and the optional caps are great for capping the cup while in a bag. This cup, however is not completely leak proof when on its side, and if you have kids who shake the cup while it's upside down, you will have drops of liquid coming out of the cup. Thankfully for us, our kids keep the cups upright and are beyond the cup gnawing phase; these cups are perfect for our family.That said, this cup is probably not the best for beginning cup users or kids who still like to throw cups around, but are great for those who are just trying to learn how to walk around with a drink and may sometimes drop a cup by mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not leak proof","review":"I bought these for my 10 month old because they looked easy to take care of and they were a very decent price. They leak all over. Not a good cup for a child. He was also able to take the lid off and spilled it allllll over the floor. Really bummed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our everyday cups","review":"We use these cups more often than our \\"permanent\\" cups. They're the right size and it's nice to have a huge set with matching lids (for a change). I'll probably buy even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you're only using as disposable cups","review":"I bought a bunch of these to keep in my car and my husband's car so we would always have sippy cups if we decided to go out to eat. The cups are very reasonably priced, so they are great for the \\"take and toss' function, but they don't last. My son chews on the tip, and it instantly blocks up so he can't get any fluid out. When this happens, I have to through that one out and give him a new one. So, if you have a normal child who chews on his sippy cup, don't be surprised if he goes through these pretty quickly. If that's not a concern for you, these are an inexpensive option for cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sippy Cups","review":"These are great but will need to be replaced after a while.

A little different than the previous two with a more earthy and soulful sound but still very much in the same vein. I don't think you could honestly be disappointed with this one. It has passionate lyrics, some decent backup singers, fun guitar and keyboard licks and you can tell Cat is enjoying the music he is making if only that it is showing his growth as an artist. Strings and keyboards really make this one stand out on its own. I would definitely pick this up if you are into the his music from this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last truly great Stevens album.","review":"Before his carear tailed off, Cat produced this one last masterpiece. Based more around keyboards than the acoustic guitar, Catch Bull catches fire. From the sanguine opener,Sitting to the Latin cadences of,O Caritas this album is a collection of wonderfull songs.

The first Cat Stevens LP to feature a promotional label: (2 different labels on one record), and I believe the first of those 4 albums to feature electrical instruments. This album contains the top 20 hit \\"Sitting\\" as well as the acoustic masterpiece \\"Boy with a moon and star on his head\\". Cat's first big rocker was \\"Freezing Steel\\" from side 2. Also included are \\"Angelsea\\" and \\"Silent Sunlight\\" which i think are the best ones on the album. The remastered CD has brilliant sound, just like the LP right out of the shrink wrap. If you are just discovering the sound of Cat Stevens, \\"Catch Bull At Four\\" is an excellent first choice. The musical energy will fill you up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next step....","review":"Catch Bull At Four is Cat Stevens reaching the next level. Incorporating more keyboards into his sound, this album succeeds greatly.Highlights include the main singles off the album, Sitting and Can't Keep It In, plus The Boy With The Moon And Star On His Head, 18th Avenue, and Ruins.It is a very good album, but does not reach the perfective-ness that the album's two successful predecesors had.But it is a \\"transitional\\" album (if you will) between the more acoustic driven earlier albums, and the more keyboard/guitar driven albums that follow (especially Foreigner and Izitso)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Motörhead album","review":"Everybody always talks about the old Motör-albums. They are great, sure, but the albums that the band hase during the 90's and in the new millennium, are fantastic!Sacrifice is the last album that has the two-guitar line-up with Würzel. Sacrifice is also a great demonstration from drummer Mickey Dee, whose role in Motörhead has become very important. His style of playing is FAR BETTER than Phil Taylor's (or Pete Gill's), and without him, there couldn't be songs like Sacrifice or Make 'em Blind.The title track is probably the greatest Motörhead song written for more than a decade. The album is very strong, typical Motörhead, though I don't think that it is quite as good as the previous album, Bastards, which I think is their greatest ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as ace of spades","review":"everyone is always ranting about ace of spades. i love that album but the new motorhead stuff can't be missed. this is pretty much the same classic motorhead sound. its actually a bit heavier but it still has the punk/metal motorhead sound. it appeals to a wide variety of listeners, if you like iron maiden, the ramones, or slayer you would probably like this. it is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works if you follow directions and do some research","review":"What a dolt \\"Busy Guy\\" must be.

If you include the unofficial errata from OReilly's Website, the book becomes about 200% more usable.(2) Why has this book not been reprinted? At LEAST OReilly should have released an official errata for this book at this point!!!(3) This book does NOT cover 10.3 and the XCode software (still uses project builder). In most cases this is ok and you can figure much of it out.

So when you've gotten through Hillegass, you're writing your own app, and you scratch your head and say, \\"Now how the heck do I do...,\\" this is the place to look. There's a fair amount that's outdated. Heck, the book IS 10 years old (hello, O'Reilly? Have you considered a new edition?), but Cocoa to a great extent still works the same way, so this is worth exploring.They tried to make this book for beginners, but, as I said, it is 10 years old, so this is not the place for a newbie to start. Once you've got the basics, though, this is worth having for all of the detail it goes into."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy Hillegass instead","review":"This book is upperquartile (as books of this type go). It has many good points. But it has one fatal drawback: there is a much better book available. Hillegass (1) is a professional trainer with oodles of classroom experience and that shines through in his book - he trained many of the Apple coders who now work on Cocoa, (2) has been involved with Cocoa from its inception. As icing on the cake, the 3rd ed of his book is up-to-date (2008), whereas this is not.I ploughed through Garfinkel and Mahoney first (on the strength of the O'Reilly reputation and good experiences with other O'Reilly books). I still did not understand Cocoa particularly well. Then I ploughed through several hundred pages of the Applie Guides. Finally, I bought Hillegass. I wish I had found it first. The Apple guides, or some of them, are quite good, but you need a good grounding first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful - but limited to objective C","review":"I am about a third of the way, working my way through this book. The book seems quite useful for learning Cocoa quickly. Note that it is also a \\"you must learn Objective C\\" book, and the authors are distractingly enamoured of the language. Expect a bit of biased advocacy in favor of Objective-C, and how wonderful it is in every way. Hey, I program in C++ for a living and I know very well that it has warts, but I doubt ObjC is perfect. I would have appreciated a section (even an appendix) on how to use Java or C++ guts as bound to Objective C for the GUI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content OK; Needs Editing","review":"This book's content is all right. The authors have a writing style that keeps you moving along. Unfortunately, the numerous editing errors (both in the text and in the code) keep tripping you up.I gave up after finding many, many errors, both of simple grammar/punctuation/spelling, and of the more serious coding sort, in the first five chapters. So many of the things they tell you are just wrong. Examples contradict what is written in the previous paragraph. Sometimes it appears as though someone's search-and-replace went wild and the wrong word appears repeatedly in a paragraph. And on and on.This is another disappointing Cocoa book from O'Reilly.

I enjoyed this movie because of the inventive plot-concept Fulci uses to engage, not confuse--as in some of his flicks such as City of the Walking Dead. The characters, a trio of cleptos, find themselves caught up in a time warp started when they accidentally kill an old couple in their clock-ridden mansion. Don't give up until the end, the twist is deadly and I admit, it put a twisted smile on my face. There are a few gory moments--a lot of bullet wounds--in this movie, but if that's all you care about, then look somewhere else. Fulci fans need this as much as I need a damn good zombie movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"If you're in the mood for something different, I would suggest this film. It's setting and general mood is strange, especially considering the demeanor of main characters. The set designs are great, and they really give the house a unique look. It's a different kind of film from Fulci, and it shows versatility and great imagination on his part. I was entertained from start to finish. I felt that the ending was satisfying, and it gave me a good chuckle. Some people have a hard time understanding this film, which is too bad. I wasn't confused at any point, but it does demand attention. I recommend films, like this, that require you to bring your own imagination to the table and have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Snores","review":"I'm still trying to figure this movie out. I got it mostly because I loved Lucio Fulci's great \\"Zombie.\\" House of Clocks was made for Italian TV and looks it. Bad photography, lighting, terrible performances and a script that makes zero sense. The story involves a large Italian villa filled with clocks and clock hands that turn endlessly backwards. An old couple murders a maid. Then three jerks--a gal and two guys--break in and mayhem ensues. The clock hands turn even more furiously backwards. I think it means that the past keeps coming back to this one villa but then you're confronted with a dead married couple whose bodies lay in coffins in the attic. They suddenly come alive. Then...oh, I can't go on. It gets so confusing that I may have to go back and watch it again. God forbid. For Fulci addicts only."},{"rating":"1","title":"KR","review":"I love the songs on this disc.

So be wary of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PS2 game we have ever bought!","review":"After all of the PS2 games we have purchased. This was worth every penny and more. My 8 yro and 11 yro spend hours singing. My 13 yro and his friends have fun being \\"funny\\" with it during sleep overs. We have even had a family karoke night where we all took part. It was a blast! The stage effects and the different characters are great. The sound system was better then I expected and it is nice to have them doing something a bit more creative then the typical video game. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more PS2 Karaoke games","review":"My kids love this game. They play it almost everyday.

Our parents even like it.We recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun, whether playing alone or with a group!","review":"What a great game for parties and get-togethers! It's always sure to provide a few good laughs. The songs on this game are popular hits that most everyone knows. It offers a way to sing karaoke, but also makes it a bit of a challenge, knowing that you can get boo-ed off the stage or trying to beat each other's scores. One of the best features of this game is the two-mics mode, where you can sing duets. This game also offers sing and dance mode, where you can combine karaoke with the dance revolution game - this is really quite hard though! We have played this in teams, where one person sings and the other dances! Regardless how you use this game, it's sure to provide plenty of fun and LOTS OF LAUGHS for you and your friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karaoke Revolution Party for PS2","review":"A fun game with a great array of songs that's fun for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally sweet game!","review":"This game is a blast, plain and simple. It's especially fun when you've never heard the song, so you have no idea what pitches to sing. The point is, if you're looking for a fun way to waste some time, this is one of the best. Pair it with the Logitech microphone and you're golden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Only Holds Quart Jars","review":"This works perfectly at a good price. I am unable to process anything other than quart jars in the rack provided. Technically I could try to use pint and half pint jars, but they do not rest properly and end up falling over or even through the rack when it is in the lifted (hanging by handles to rim of pot) position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"After only a week of canning with this water bath canner, it developed a hole which not only ruined the pot, but also from all the water leaked from it, ruined my electric stove top. I called the company and they did send me a replacement (which also developed a hole in under a month), but refused to replace or repair my electric stove. Stay away from this product and company. I've now owned 2 of these water bath canners and they both were ruined within 1 month of summer canning. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is dangerous to use","review":"One month into owning it and the bottom is peeling. Do not purchase this product. It is not safe to use. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for quart jars","review":"This canner is fine for small jars of preserves, but it is too short for quart jars. We could not keep the recommended level of boiling water above the jars. We had a terrible mess in our kitchen, and had to keep the mop handy during the processing time. We also had to keep adding water to replace all the water that boiled out. We will never use this again for anything bigger than pint jars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot's OK, rack not so great","review":"By the second time I used this, the rack was completely ORANGE with rust. Thank you china."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for making Stocks & Soups","review":"I can't honestly say if this pot is good for canning. I have a flat electric cooking top and the bottom of this pot is concave so I can't use it for canning, I can however use it for making stocks and soups. It is perfect for this application use. I usually check my soup/stock every 15 minutes to give a stir or poke and have had no problems on my flat cook top. I did however have problems with using it on the electric coil type stoves. Because of the bottom, it gets a hot ring from the actual coil so anything that stays there can get burned unless you are constantly moving it. The electric coil doesn't create enough even heat for this pot. Perhaps if all you were heating up was just a liquid it would work.Either or, for my use and my stove it is great and it looks good sitting on top of my cabinets. A real focal point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The pot is so big it takes forever to heat up the water since it doesn't fit on regular burners.After about 1/2 hour when the water boils you can put your jars finally in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granite Canner","review":"This was such a good deal the price was over 2 1/2 more at the big box store that starts with W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great canning pot.","review":"Great pot for canning.

After one batch of canning the coating on the rack is all bubbled up and peeling off, Not sure if it is safe to use again, not sure what chemical is spayed on it. I tried to email seller but it is the only item I have purchased from amazon that there is no options to leave feedback for seller. Not sure how to return one piece of a product. The pot is a great size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service Stinks","review":"True Value sent us a defective product.

The only problem I did have with it was that it was so large, as a result of it's size it took a long time for water to heat up. However, once the water was boiling I could fit about 9 jars in the pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined after one use.","review":"The rack rusted after only one use. It would not clean up.

The hooks for holding the rack up on the side kept giving way and allowing the jars to fall into the water before the rack was filled"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Canner","review":"I like the canner and have used it many times since purchasing it. The only problem is the holder that holds the canning jars. It is made such that 8 oz. and 4 oz. canning jars fall through making it difficult to lift the jars out after processing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concave Bottom","review":"Mine dented when weight was applied. Contacted customer service (not Amazon) and they've never responded.You need to know that the bottom of this water-bath-canner is very concave which is only recommended for gas stoves. The National Center for Home Food Preservation recommends only flat bottomed canners for use on electric or flat-top stoves. I will not be able to use this canner now because of this.At first use, the shiny coat came off of the bottle rack. It left a terrible dust coat over all of my bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't need one","review":"I'm a beginner canner and have been looking into the different supplies needed- including a water bath system. After reading the reviews on this product I went to a local store and checked them out. The negative reviews were confirmed- these are very flimsy and cheap, even the one I was looking at was all dinged up and damaged. I went home and looked into it and it turns out you can use any large pot for water bath canning so long as you have something between the bottom of the pot and the glass jars (connecting some canning bands together seems to be the cheapest and easiest option). Although you miss out on having a rack that you can elevate and rest on the pot- I don't think I'd trust this cheap rack to elevate seven quart jars anyways. I thought this information might be helpful to anyone who doesn't have a lot of extra storage space for a really big pot but wants to start canning, like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Novice canner","review":"I only started canning this year and this canner is great. Although I use mostly pints this canner is large enough that I don't have to add water during the process. I bought a pint rack separately and it works great in this canner. I have a ceramic top stove and this canner heats up quickly--especially with the lid on."},{"rating":"2","title":"manufacturer has great customer service","review":"Bought this at a big box store here in UT. When I got home I saw that the lid had a pretty big dent in it and the enamel was chipped. I called customer service for the manufacturer in Indiana, no computer queue, and they just took my address and are sending a new lid. This alone makes the brand worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the canning begin!","review":"This is perfect for low acid canning.

Can't wait for the farmers market to open. Wish I could garden myself.(handicapped)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 2 years...dissappointed","review":"Loved this canner at first. I bought it because it was slightly taller than my older one so it didn't boil over when I was processing quart jars. I can quite a bit but I expected the life of the pot to be longer than 2 years. Just this evening I filled it up and there was a small hole in the bottom edge...it leaks and is totally worthless. I have seen this happen in much older pots but not one that was this new. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Also, had to purchase a stainless steel rack after a month as the one included had rusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"As noted in other reviews, the spacing on the bars of the canning rack could be a bit closer. It's fine for larger jars, but causes smaller jelly jars to tip if they aren't balanced correctly between the bars. I'm going to try to make some sort of small adjustment to the rack to provide support for smaller jars since I do a lot of jelly jar size canning. Other than that, I'm happy with what I got for the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Done!","review":"As an Orthodox rabbi, I applaud R. Chaim Rapoport's attention to halachic detail but also his recognition of the human aspect of this issue. With enormous sympathy, R. Rapoport describes the dilemma of the Orthodox Homosexual and tries to offer a religiously and psychologically sound course of action. This book will be THE definitive work on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The frontier IS space.","review":"Officer Lon Salonikis had discovered the answer to the information leaks on Freedom Two and was killed because of it. The problem is he never passed on the answer to anybody else. Solar Police Joss O'Bannion and Evan Glyndower (Lon's ex-partner) now must go to the space station and find out why somebody is willing to kill a police officer over something that should be a minor crime.The first of three sci-fi books set in the future of space, which is treated like a frontier, where law officers are few and far between and life is cheap. The settings are gritty and realistic, a dirty, somewhat pessimistic future. The science is slightly hard, which I like, but most of the focus is on characters and plot, which is also something I prefer. Lots of humor also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and flawless!","review":"Accept's later years showed a different kind of monster. The twin guitar attack was gone, but guitar god Wolf Hoffmann managed to produce a richer, heavier, meaner more melodic sound. Although Accept's last three studio albums (Objection Overruled, Predator and Death Row) lacked commercial success, they are simply outstanding. They are not commercially oriented like Balls to the Wall and Metal Heart, something that definitely alienates some fans that still longing the mid-80s metal scene.Playing at its best, this live album demonstrates how an incredibly good band Accept became with the years. Accept never sounded tighter and more powerful than during their last three unheralded albums. We need more music like this today. Thankfully, both Udo and Wolf are still producing great music in their own projects. Final Chapter has an excellent recording sound, and it is definitively a must buy for any real heavy rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same album as All Areas Worldwide","review":"Brilliant double live album, but exactly the same as All Areas Worldwide, just a different cover and artwork - don't get caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Badly needs another guitarist","review":"Overall, this is a good live album. Unfortunately, as good as Wolf Hoffmann is, this album just doesn't sound right with only 1 guitarist since most of these songs were written for 2 guitarists. The best examples of this are \\"Breaker\\" & \\"Restless & Wild,\\" which don't sound nearly as good as the versions from their older live album \\"Staying A Life.\\" This wasn't a problem for their 90s studio albums because they overdubbed, but they couldn't replicate the sound live."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Case Is A Case","review":"Well, how much can you really say about a camera case? For the price, this one remains an excellent choice. It's very comfortable on the belt (mostly you can't even feel it on); the camera slides in and out quite easily; and the closure snap is magnetized, which aids in one-handed operation. Though I never banged into anything while wearing it, I feel confident this adequately padded case will provide any necessary protection from such shocks. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is this guy??","review":"This is a great album start to finish..I'm amazed he hasn't put out anything new since 2006...Where the hell is he??

It deals with a FBI agent or some government agent trying to stop a government coup.Jack Scalia plays the agent who is enjoying a social function when it's taken over by miltary terrorists. Of course Jack Scalia saves the day, gets the girl and saves the day/world!This DVD is rated R for violence,murder,death ,partial nudity and swearing. The DVD transfer is pathetic.The only extras are a trailer, a actor bio and a very bad scene selection!!buy this movie if you are fans of Jack Scalia(a B grade actor who was big in the past) ,or if you love B grade action movies or just a pathetic DVD transfer!!my advice rent it .But this DVD may be hard to rent and or buy!! So if you want this movie, buy it online here at Amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"This is an awesome cd!!!!!

I'm not an old school traditional gospel loving person. I like contemporary, traditional and all that. I dont' pigeon hold gospel artists to a specific genre because God can and will be praised through whatever sound is sweet to him, HOWEVER with this CD I just felt like Deitrick really wanted to be an R&B singer. There comes a point where enough is enough and I didn't feel any anointing in this and nothing moved me about it. I like Deitrick as an artist but this CD just wasn't it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't believe the reviews-get for yourself worth it","review":"Anyone who knows D Haddy knows that he likes to mix it up. I almost didn't get his new cd's based upon others reviews. I tried it for myself and I like it alot. one reviewer said he doesn't mention God - well I would like to know what CD they are listening to, because he talkes about God through the whole cd and mentions his name.Just get the CD it is really good and yeah a little different, but DH always mixes it up so accept change and understand and appreciate the message being delivered. Praise God that he is still keeping it real. I do not believe he compromise or sold out. He is being who God made him and using his gift to get a message through and I appreciate it and thank God for him. hopes this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change is a bit much...","review":"I absolutely agree with the reviewers who gave this album a low rating, mainly because Deitrick's sound was put in the hands of R&B producers, therefore churning out music that just doesn't fit. I miss the \\"Crossroads,\\" and \\"Lost and Found\\" Deitrick. What this album is, is Bobby Valentino's album. I invite anyone to listen to both and tell me I'm wrong. Thanks, Tim & Bob. At least J. Moss can produce a gospel track and an R&B track, and we're able to tell the difference--and not by just SOUND either. I still loooove Deitrick Haddon, but this album was a slight letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess....","review":"I found this album to be a bit pretentious. Most of it is overly secular and a touch obvious. The artist seems too involved with himself from the cover to the tracks. Heaven Knows,on the other hand, is a strong seletion which speaks to the moral compass in everyone saint or sinner. I actually bought this cd because of it, unfortunately I was sorely disappointed in the lack of originality or depth of spirituality in the music. When you can't feel it ...why bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"I think Detrick must have bumped his head...hard!!! There are only about three good songs on this album. On the remaining tracks Detrick doesn't know if he wants to be Michael Jackson or Prince. I am also disappointed that he sampled music from El Debarge. Christian muscians everywhere listen up!!! If God gave you the gift, stop stealing from the world. If you want a gospel album, even if you want a contemporary gospel album, this is not it. Detrick Haddon needs to go back to his praise and worship roots and stop trying to fit in to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm grateful she's back!","review":"Jackie Kramer is a talented author who's been missing from the romance scene too long.

Pretty poorly. There's zero extras (some of their Presley releases don't even include the trailers) and, worst of all, many of them don't even have chapter access to the SONGS. Like this one.

There's one pug \\"shot\\" that has a tan pug on steps, with a long scarf around its' neck. It's totally cute, and i feel really happy when i look at these. They're almost too cute to send! If you look at all of the different pug shots, you'll see some black pugs, some tan pugs, and pugs doing just...things!

But 36 days into owning it, the picture went out completely and the TV has now become a VERY expensive paperweight. What's the problem? Well, Amazon won't exchange it because it was 6 days past their policy. And Sony? Well, they've sent out an \\"authorized\\" repair person who has proceeded to strip half the screws that hold the TV together and despite replacing everything but the panel, its still not working. Sony's solution? Keep me on hold and force me to have a new panel installed - in a 36 day old TV!!! They refuse to replace the entire TV with a new one and are telling me that I am \\"screwed.\\" I suggest you buy this TV from a local retailer - at least then you have somewhere to go when everyone treats you like $2000 is nothing.

I first looked at one of these at our local Sony store. After going to all major electronics stores and Costco to look at what was available we decided to go for this Sony. Amazon had by far the best price of $1849 at the time with free shipping. In my novice opinion this TV is the best for the price. I can't really give an in depth technical review, however, the picture is beautiful, the sound fantastic for a TV (we ended up buying a Bose system for more of a theatre sound) and set up simple. I ordered it on 12/1/06 and was a little sad when it told me it would be delivered after 12/27 due to the holiday. The next day I received an delivery date of 12/13 and I'm happy to say it was! The delivery guys brought it into the house, unpacked it and took the debris away...at the free shipping price. What fantastic service.

Further, the remote is easy to use...the satellite remote mimics all the features of the one that came with the tv nicely. It is lightweight for a unit of this size. The only flaw is something I read about but had to see to appreciate. There is something called \\"refresh rate\\", and it refers to an LCD pixel's ability to quickly change to the next color. If is is fast, you notice nothing out of the ordinary. If it is slow, objects tend to blur slightly. If someone moves their face quickly, they might appear to have saggy jowels. The most obvious example I saw was small flying insects that were flitting against a black background. They appeared as moving lines, not moving spots.

We can't wait until most all programming is in HD. The TruSurround sound is great. Playing games on PS2 or Wii is so much more fun on the big screen.

We are continually amazed at the 1080p on this TV. We have it mounted in our game room, and we find ourselves drifting up there to watch TV instead of watching our Sony projection LCD TV (720p) in the family room. The picture looks great with Blu-Ray, as well as with our PS3 games. We're very happy with the purchase. Amazon's white glove delivery was also great.

The backlighting is very strong and there appears to be uneven levels of black when there is no input. The intensity of the problem varies from set to set and there is no fix for it. Some owners have reported seeing the problem in movies that have dark scenes. Sony is aware of the problem in other bravia sets, but they do not admit that this model has it too.For the money, you should not have this problem or the potential for it.

Unfortunately, I found the same problem with the Sony KDS-40XBR2s as well.Sony is not officially acknowledging this problem and either tells customers it is \\"normal\\" or suggests they return it to the store of purchase if that is an option.This is very disappointing, in my opinion.

I bought it in August and wanted to use it awhile before writing a review. The only issue I had was a mysterious white line at the top of the screen. It isn't the TV though because in HD and in DVD mode it disappears. When you raise the vertical it disappears. Now it is perfect. I see other manufacturers discuss this line.

The directions for using this TV with a satellite dish are in need of a rewrite. I finally asked for info about how to have it picked up again by the shipper but about that time I stumbled onto setting it on Video 3 to get a picture. So don't dispair.The other thing that could be better are the sound controls. Eventually I will connect it to the external sound system to get more treble.

The TV is superb and setup was easy.I called the company that administers Amazon's extended warranty and was very disappointed; they were vague about what was covered, and weren't quite sure who might be doing the warranty work. I took another reviewer's advice and called Sony direct and bought the extended warranty from them - they are very clear about what's covered (100% of pixels) and they only use Sony-qualified technicians for repairs.

Four ne'er-do-well heckel her and the rest of the sideshow during it's stay. Meanwhile, a young outcast pities the wolf-girl and gives her a serum his scientist mother made that may make her normal. As she continues to use the \\"medicine,\\" though, we find that it has a reverse effect: the more human she appears, the more animal she becomes.That sounds interesting, but it could've been done better...maybe without using full frontal (doctored?) male nudity? Plus, I like my werewolf movies to have werewolves. The cover is VERY misleading, there is no large beast in this film. The only beasts are the heckling teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic werewolf","review":"Everytime I think something amazing is going to happen or some transformation ...zip happens.

Like he would forget about the Tanners after all those years, and like they would move to Iceland. Because he never got back to the Tanners, nor even to his fellow Aliens, it was pretty upsetting to my children, some of whom were in tears over it. Anyway, there was no happy close for Alf lovers.

I would have preferred both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Substance","review":"The book purports to analyze the Italian mind. Rather it is very superficial and adds little insight to the field. There is occasionally an amusing bit but overall, it is a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly stereotypes","review":"I really enjoyed Severgnini's \\"Ciao, America\\" and was looking forward to reading what he had to say about Italians at home. What a let-down! If a non-Italian had written this, everyone would be yelling that it was stereotyped and insulting. It's a series of gross generalizations about Italians that provides almost no insights into the country and culture. There were a few valuable moments but not nearly enough to make up for the many pages of triteness. I think I'll stick to the author's political and economic commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun info about the Italian way of life","review":"This book gave me a good insight into the Italian way of life and how they view food, family, government, etc. I recommend this for those who are planning to travel to Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deludente","review":"Having close family in Rome, and thus having to travel there several times a year, I looked forward to Severgnini shedding some light on the sometimes mystifying Italian mindset. Alas, his writing reflects all too perfectly the disappointment too many of us experience when encountering most facets of contemporary Italian civilization with its disorganization, its embrace of cheerful incompetence, and its artful charade projected on the glorious ruins of it past. Would that he had actually cast a critical eye on his countrymen and had been writer enough to overcome these limitations to give us more than this opaqued glimpse of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian mind","review":"I found the book quite superficial and rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a tremendous disappointment!","review":"La Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian MindI, for one, love everything Italian. So it's easy to see why I picked up this book with its very engaging, colorful cover. In the past I have read many funny books and articles on everything from Italian driving to trying to get a phone installed in your new Italian apartment.(Forget it!) So when I picked up this book I was ready for a humorous read. Well, what a tremendous disappointment. The writing is flat and uninteresting. One finds themselves reading along and reading along waitng to get to the good part, but hey, there is none! Skip this book completely and everything written by this author, Beppe Severgnini. Sorry he's just way too boring and NOT FUNNY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Book","review":"I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this truly dreadful book. I can only assume that the various newspaper critics that are quoted on the back cover were personal friends. He states correctly in his appalling offering that it appears to have become a pass time of uninspired anglo saxon authors to write about Italy. He should have known better than adding to the marass of garbage himself. I would recommend Matt FreiItaly - the Unfinished Revolution, Tobias JonesThe Dark Side of Italy.

Unfortunately the scientific informations provided by this video scarcely fill one disc and the remaining topics in other 3 discs are only about curiosities, popular beliefs, ancient legends and bugs being used as medicine and food. Differently from David Attenborough's serious documentaries where his interference is minimun and necessary, the presence of Georges Brossard (a mixture of actor, clown and ontologist) is annoying. He wishes to be the star of the show more than the insects. Unbelievably, even the scientfic informations provided by him are limited and not new: The only insects' way-of-life he focus in detail are ants and termites but all of these informations can be found in documentaries not specialized in insects such as BBC's The Life of Plants and Trials of Life. The two stars go to some beautiful closes on insects and that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"THis is not a documentary about insects. It is a collection of amature caliber location shots starring the commentator - sparingly peppered with stock footage of bugs purchased from WGBH and others. The only thing that is good about this set is the packaging that it comes in - which is what led me to purchase it. It is, however, quite deceptive as to what the content of the DVD's actually is. I cannot emphasize enough - If you want a box set about the \\"Crocodile Hunter\\" of the insect world shot with a cheap video camera - this is your DVD. If you were looking for information and footage of insects (as I was) you will be totally dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrified","review":"Zero stars. This is NOT a nature video. My daughters and I were disgusted. The commentator gives us a tour of cruel practices, including the use of beautiful dead insects for jewelry (and living beetles with glued rhinestones on their backs chained to safety pins). Instead of the wonder of the life of insects, we are taken to examine the harvested dried insects in the jars of a Chinese herbalist.The insects are not respected in this film.We see the narrator eat lemon ants. He captures a horned beetle in one scene and kills it and places it in a white box. All the while he has a disgusting conspiratorial look on his face.The box IS beautiful.

Now guess what the only way you can accomplish that is! By buying this software package. So, you get to spend your fifty bucks on one piece of software and the upgrades for the other 3 that are available for FREE from Apple.

I had never heard of the book, so I got right on Amazon to order it. Frankly, I am surprised that the movie was allowed to say that it was based on the book. While the movie is about a poor widow with three children who can't have a Thanksgiving meal, a rich grandmother who comes to visit after a letter, and a romance, the book is entirely different. It is a rather dull tale of how a large household of children have to partially prepare the dinner since their mother is called away when told the grandmother is ill.

There is a lot going on, many sub plots - normally that makes for a much more engrossing book, but here it did not work as well. It seemed to me that he had so many plots he could not devote enough time to each one thus detracting from the overall effect of the book.

It also ranks third in quality of the three I've read. It's not a bad book at all, and it is well worth reading. It just lacks the higher quality of characters I found in the other two novels, Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof. The story has plenty of Turow style surprises and is quite interesting. To me, the thing that pulled the book down was the character development. I just didn't find Mack or Brushy to be interesting or well developed. Toots was the most interesting character and he was a bit player in the story.

It's a little different. There's not much courtroom drama, which I like so much and which Turow does so well, and there's not much of that sort of grudging nobility which lurks in the eaves of stories like Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof. Instead the hero of the piece is very pedestrian, a colorful, creative, but pretty well beat-up ex-cop trudging along in the corporate world, looking askance at all about him. A great tale of life in the big law firm, on the streets, and in the dark corners.

Scott Turow couldn't stick with a subject for more than 1/2 a page without regressing back to another subject for three or four pages before getting back to the point he was trying to make in the first place. He did this over and over. Just like many other authors that have nothing much to say, he covered all the \\"hot\\" topics of lesbianism, male homosexuality, mafia, drunkeness, and even masturbation. This is a ten page, poorly written story which Mr. Turow managed to stretch into 464 pages.

CD 1 is funky, deep and dark. The style used in CD 1 is like none I have heard before and I like it. But, CD 1 does not even compare to CD 2. Of the CDs in my collection, CD 2 in this set is the only other 10 (the other being Global Underground 006: Digweed, Sydney CD 2) out of 10 rating CD that I own. From track 1 on CD 2 until track 12, Fontaine keeps you moving and bumpin'. Most notably, ATB's \\"9 PM\\" (track 04, CD 2) is one of those tunes that will be incessantly played and chanted in your head.Fontaine mixes both CDs flawlessly to generate a set that is absolutely astonishing to the ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Amidst the large number of Rave music that disappoints, this 2 CD set captures the best of the afterhour club scene.

Seb Fontaine is the first dj to be on the prototype series and he does not dissapoint.The first disc is much more harder and darker than his usual set that he would play. However it's because of this why i love this cd so much, it's a nice change from the usual commercial stuff that he would usually play and gives us a side of Seb that we havent heard before. The first disc builds up with acid breaks and all things break loose with the easily recognizable Durango 5:55.The second disc is more of Seb's usual set with lots of clubish tunes and anthems. However it is still very enjoyable to listen too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic, eclectic, and beautiful","review":"This is one of the most diverse mix CD sets I have heard in quite some time. Mixing everything from banging house to acid and trance, the mixes are clean and the transitions keep building and building upon one another. He mixes genres in ways that others have tried and failed at (DJ John Kelley's \\"High Desert Soundsystem\\" comes to mind). There's lots of recognizable tracks on this CD, such as DJ Dan/Needle Damage's \\"That Zipper Track\\" (one of my favorites) and Jan Driver's \\"Drive By\\", but it's the ones that aren't as recognizable that bring this CD to life. I'm definitely looking forward to the rest in the Prototype series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I like this set a lot. They were playing it on the stereo at Tower Records in the Village, and I just HAD TO HAVE IT!Disc1 is supposedly stuff that Seb likes, but he doesn't feel like he has the liberty to play at clubs. I liked this disc but found it repetitive - he stays too long on one idea in a track. But still a damn good disc.Disc2 is the best techno I've heard yet. The first half of the disc is better than Disc1, and the second half just goes to a whole other level. Feels like I'm meditating and I just take off when I hit about track 7-8. Very recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Score... I Could do Without the Songs","review":"What a masterpiece by McNeely!

Mulan had that strong \\"reflection\\" by christina aguilera when she was first coming out, that established her as THE best voice, and that song, in spanish or english works well on it's own also.

If this sophomoric home movie took five hours I would be surprised.It's so easy to get into the art scene these days.

Not only cannot not copy numbers, just simple numbers, the software staggers like a bar fly constantly missing the stool, but foolish enough not to know it. So my pen, after a generous probationary period and attempts to rehabilitate is being returned to send never to come back to this house again under any circumstance. It is a very bad pen!

The posted technical advice from users should have been the warning to me not to buy this and the negative reviews are accurate.

I liked the idea of a battery-powered lantern, as opposed to a propane or liquid fuel lantern, around little kids.It turns out that the Coleman battery lantern is the best lantern I've ever used. Most importantly, it throws a ton of bright white light - this is \\"hang the lantern on a tree branch and have enough light to pitch the tent, build the fire, cook dinner, etc\\" kind of light. In addition, the Coleman battery lantern lasts a lot longer than I expected on a set of batteries, turns right on, is easy to find in the dark (when you leave the night light feature on), is easy to carry... I could go on and on.Sure, 8 D cell batteries are expensive, but that's the only down side I can see.

This book also contradicts its own advice - frequently - as when it says to \\"always hang pictures 10\\" above seating\\" accompanied by a lovely photo of a sofa that is backed up directly against framed pictures. Or when they advise not using scatter pillows on chairs or stools, yet this is done throughout the text.750 is a bit of an exageration - they break down \\"how to build a fire\\" into many small tips, counting each one.Overall, a fairly useless book, but the photos are pretty.

Therefore much of the story is left blank or filled in by the authors vivid imagination. The online story \\"Behind The BlueWall Life of NY police officer Kenneth Eurell\\" is more detailed from the corrupt officers (Dowd & Eurell) point of views and, gives vivid detail of the crimes involved from an inside look.

She leaves no stone unturned in bringing out the essentials of the femme world - from makeup to high heels to home decorating to the joys of nonmonogamy. I liked that she also covered femme/femme dating as well as butch/femme dating.

The book comes across like a long late night chat with a femme diva-y friend. Some will love the style (like me) and others won't. Rednour does chat alot about friends of hers and places where she lives, but since they are used as illustrative examples so it works. I highly reccomend this book for femmes (or those who love us)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless ...","review":"This DVD is misnamed.

You'd think that combination would turn in an outstanding reading of a Bruckner symphony. They didn't. As the Penguin Guide said in the only edition that rated this CD, Abbado was clearly uninspired and the orchestra was on autopilot. Nothing about this CD suggests anything significant about Bruckner or his ambitious First Symphony. My advice is to look elsewhere for satisfaction.

Although he is not as well known as musicians like Darrell Evans or Matt Redman, these musicians credit Kevin Prosch as being a major influence. Kevin is more than a musician - he is a Psalmist in the tradition of King David. Reckless Mercy is a wonderful CD, and Kiss the Son is my favorite song ever. Kevin leads his listeners into a different level of worship - he challenges his listeners to be authentic and broken before God - more than any worship leader I've ever heard. His music has blessed my life tremendously, and this CD is a good start to a collection of Kevin's music. I also recommend Come to the Light, Palanquin, and Black Peppercorns.

Text is serviceable, but it's the pictures that carry the narrative.Have lived in or visited Toledo from 1947 to 2005. It is a reminder of how cities rise and fall - it was once the \\"Glass Capitol of the World\\" - but as corporations flowed and ebbed, so went Toledo. But there are still glimpses of the past - Toledo Art Museum was one of the first institutions to build a Frank Gehry building - a bold move and an interesting contrast to a classical building.

I had previously assumed Norris to be more saintly than how she portrays herself here in this biogrpahy. I appreciate her honesty and found myself unable to put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This book has been poorly reviewed by the professional reviewers, and I believe Kathleen Norris has been badly advised by her editor. Perhaps it should have been entitled, \\"The Mentorship of KATHLEEN NORRIS, famous author, with biographical notes on her mentor.\\" That is snottier than I had intended, but it does describe my feelings. I have read Norris' earlier works with great interest and benefit. I have recommended her books and poetry to many privately and in public places, but this book will receive none of that from me. There are at least three good books Norris could have written (a) a thoughtful, creative, but not didactic review of a Bennington education, (b) a coming-of-age memoir up to the time of the writing of \\"Dakota\\", and (c) a biography of Betty Kray, a person whose life sounds very worthy of a good biography. I give this book two stars out of deep respect for what Norris has meant to me in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was the title picked by someone who had read the book?","review":"A valuable history of several decades of poetry and \\"poetry politics\\" in the United States. As many other reviewers have noted, the title has little connection, however, to the contents. This fact was annoying to me, and perhaps detracted from my appreciation of the book's contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read, reread, recommended, and given as gifts both Dakota and The Cloister Walk. I have seen Kathleen Norris speak. I couldn't wait for her next book, but what a disappointment. It should have been titled How I became Betty Kray or The History of Poetry in the United States. There was little of herself in the book and little of her writing. The historical perspective was interesting, but that was about it. Maybe I missed the big picture, but I don't think so. A quick read--wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Disappointed","review":"I'm a huge fan of Norris and especially love Dakota and The Cloister Walk. I found this book to be boring and I was disappointed in Norris herself much to my own personal dismay. I agree with one viewer's comment that she found her voice in South Dakota."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses momentum","review":"This is less a memoir than two separate books that don't fit together well as one. The opening section, about Norris' feelings of marginality as she enters Bennington and then later works in New York, are mildly interesting, although lacking in depth. The bulk of the book is about Elizabeth Kray, founder of the Academy of Poets, rather than about Norris. It doesn't work for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever.","review":"I've seen lots of bad movies in my life. Sometimes these bad movies are kindof fun, like the recent Doomsday; other times they're just horrifyingly lame, like Wing Commander or Dungeons & Dragons; and then there's the epicly bad movies, like Waterworld. But this movie... this movie was worse. It was amazing, watching actors I cared about (Robin Tunney, Angela Bassett) do a fairly good job, and still not save the the movie. The plot, the concepts, the visual effects, the sound mixing - rarely do I even notice this! - they all add up to something worse, and more boring, than one can truly imagine.Worse than Blair Witch 2, than anything by Roger Corman, than... well, anything, period. This movie is one for the ages. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unwatchable sci-fi turkey","review":"This blatently derivative (hat tip to Ridley Scott's Alien, with a hint of Stanley Donen's Saturn 3 thrown in) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is, presumably, employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills. Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space. James Spader and Angela Bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot, but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull. The \\"happy ever after\\" finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness. Supernova's only redeeming factor is that it is very short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"This movie has some cool effects, but the storyline is terrible.

Plus, James Spader makes a likeable hero and Robin Tunney is fairly sexy. Yet, once Peter Facinelli appears the film becomes a bore for the next 50 or so minutes. It isn't until the last half-hour that the film manages to pick up some sign of life and feature something exciting, but it's not enough to salvage the film. For much better sci-fi films, check out Event Horizon, Pitch Black, or Mission to Mars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn - Good effects, Absent story","review":"The only thing this movie really has to recommend it are the effects and Peter Facinelli's b*lls out performance. You won't recognize him as the confused teen from \\"Can't Hardly Wait.\\"Kinda like \\"Sphere\\" in that the crew picks up and is menaced by the effects of a strange alien device (can you say, \\"2001,\\" boy and girls?)

This movie is not just badly written or acted, not that I could tell. This movie is so poorly made I can't figure out if it is poorly acted or written because I could not even follow the picture. It has to set the record for number of cuts per minute, because every second or two the camera angle changes. Everything is chronically underlit, in some scenes where (I guess) important details are being passed the only light is from the instrumentation and dials and things. Nothing was on screen long enough to discern what it was. I didn't even figure out the little chase scene until after I figured out the couple of shots of a woman looking scared and some, uhh....dude (they never said who he was, and he was the big villain of the movie!) looking scary means chase in the Supernova universe. I want my hour and a half back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my. Stinky.","review":"This movie was bad. Very bad.It's nothing but a contrived, silly plot made up to wrap around lots of T&A;, so that it looks as though it's about more then just an excuse to show lots of T&A.;It plays like a _bad_ late-night Showtime flick, if you catch my drift.The formula has been done many, many, many times before, and so much better (check out _Alien_, perhaps THE best sci-fi deep-space-alien-terror movie ever made. Or to a lesser extent _Sphere_ or _Event Horizon_).I got this for $...out of Wal-Mart's clearence bin, and I regret every penny. I DO NOT reccomend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is it!!","review":"Recently, somebody asked me \\"What was the worst film to come out in the year 2000?\\"Hmmm... I had to think for a minute. I ruled out the standard Roger Corman-esque garbage, I was thinking about films that were \\"honest\\" attempts at film making with lofty goals but were miserable failures. SuperNova is such a film.Lots of special effects and plenty of senseless violence are the highlights of this lowbrow piece of film. Calling it a work of science fiction is an insult to the genre. Also, the acting was questionable at best, I half expected to see wires sticking out of James Spader's neck since his performance was so wooden. Note to the Special Effects Dept.: \\"TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN!\\" Glare is not a real nifty special effect.I went to see this garbage at the movie theatre, stupidly believing that it would be good solely based on the hype. Bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rarely give a bad review...","review":"I give this movie 2 stars only because it's fun to watch. Otherwise, it's a lame attempt at sci-fi action. \\"And now, another pointless scene of explicit nudity\\" seems to be the best caption for this movie.The only good things to this movie's name are the special effects, which are among the best I've seen, and Angela Bassett, whose performance is the only hint of acting talent in the film, despite having a usually great performing cast.The ending made little, if any, sense and left you wondering \\"so...what happens to Earth?\\"Final verdict: Ok, if absolutely desperate to see a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it?","review":"This is what happens when you mix sex with science fiction. Well to start off you will know right off at the beginning of the movie that it's going to focus more on sex than on the plot. You'll probably ask yourself at the end of the movie, where is the supernova. I didn't see it, so what's the point of the movie. First this is your typical MGM DVD regardless what the box says, it says \\"Stellar special features.\\" The \\"stellar\\" features is one theatrical trailer and about ten deleted scenes (very short ones at that). Although the introduction on the dvd is pretty good, like most MGM's. To tell you the truth the dvd isn't worth $20 not even $10. Just stay away from this film. I admit it has some great effects, but just not $20 worth. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS DO NOT MAKE UP FOR THE HORRIBLE PLOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abort Mission!","review":"James Spader really hit the weight room and protein powder for his role in Supernova. You have to hand it to him: He gives his all to even the most mediocre movies.Supernova offers us a familiar story. Intergalactic cruiser receives mysterious distress call from a distant mining colony...should they investigate, or not? Naturally, this is always a no-brainer: Should they not investigate, there would be no movie.They investigate... Naturally, they all come to realize that they should not have answered the distress call. Improbable, and gratuitous relationships are pointedly developed at the expense of original plot or characters. Movie is so muddled and poorly developed, it's no surprise that Walter Hill took his name off it (he goes by his \\"nom de dreadful-movie\\", Thomas Lee)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old-fashioned sci-fi","review":"This movie does have its problems. Some things are not quite clear as to why they happen, and some things regarding the faster-than-light pods used by the crew are hit-or-miss. The special effects are excellent, however, especially the sequence when the ship enters light speed. The concept is a good one, and the acting is very good - you can always count on James Spader. Overall it's a solid, better than average sci-fi effort that is clearly a step above the B-movies that clog rental store isles. Don't hesitate on this one just because it wasn't a blockbuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, innovative plot, superb acting","review":"Very pleasantly surprised by the intelligence of this film.

Sound strange ? Well incredibly this is actually the most interesting thing that happens in the entire movie.

The plot and screenplay are awful, but what really surprised me is the incredible poor acting of Spader and Basset. Maybe it was the hand of the director, I don't know ...

It was a remake of Alien essentially, just with fewer people to wax, and the bad guy in this one had nowhere near the charm and charisma of H.R. Giger's creation. James Spader has been accepting some pretty horrid roles lately, and this certainly was one of those horrid ones. The story revolves around a starship receiving a distress call, and zooming off to answer it. When the ship reaches its destination, it pick up the guy that sent the distress call, and he basically kills everyone and the movie ends. The characters were all very flaky, and didn't convince the audience that they were worth caring about when they were killed. It seemed to me that the film was rushed into production, seeing as how the plot and script were lacking what I would consider quality. If you want a good space movie look elsewhere, since Supernova should never soil your VCR/DVD Player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of eye candy","review":"I really loved this film.

A clerk had been teaching me how to say simple phrases regarding housekeeping, etc. I can carry this book in my pocket while I'm at work. Already, I've been able to communicate better with the other workers and to remember how to say the words because the pronounciations are all here. If you want to learn Hindi, this is a good book for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pocket Book","review":"This book is ideal for popping in a purse or pocket. I carry it with me and when I am waiting for someone in the car, I can learn a phrase or two. I have been experimenting by teaching my husband the odd phrase or two that he shares with the Indian men where he works, and they good naturedly send him back with a phrase to try out on me in turn. The Devanagari script is a little hard on the eyes, but it gives so many useful everyday phrases that, in conjunction with other Hindi learning tools, I have found it speeds up the practical application side of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited usefulness for people on a short time budget","review":"I was disappointed in the book. There is a lot of information in it, but the author explains some of the pronunciation in terms of how you speak French, which did not help me much. The pronunciation guide is in a modified phonetic spelling which may be understood by linguists, but which was not terribly user friendly to a layman traveler who had time to study the language only very briefly before arriving in India. This was not the \\"down and dirty\\" survival phrase book I had hoped for. Lastly, being a 1981 publication, it does not really reflect all of the English jargon now incorporated in the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"It's about time that these older Godzilla titles are given a proper release on DVD. This one, Godzilla VS Mechagodzilla is my favorite G movie of all time. It is the very first one I saw as a kid and has many of the qualities that attracted me initially to the series. This film ranks among the cheesiest of the series along with Godzilla VS Megalon and Godzilla VS Gigan. The \\"ape men\\" aliens, silly prophecies of doom, funky soundtrack and laughable effects all add to the inevitable charm of this movie. I still love watching it today, nearly 20 years after first seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, that's about it","review":"godzilla battles his mechincal twin in this outting.

I dont see why there are so many negative comments about this movie. Okay, maybe the aliens look like their from planet of the apes, and King Seesar looks like a dog crossed with a goat, but in essence, it is really a very good movie. Lets see, what do people want in a action/horror movie. Special effects, they were great, like the explosions and mechagodzillas eye lazer. Sound, it was pretty good, like the roars and the explosions. Action, it was very good, the mechagodzilla rampage, the chase on the boat, the fight with Angurus, the battle between Godzilla and mechagodzilla at the oil dock, the battle between humans and the aliens, the mechagodzilla vs seesar fight, and the final Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best","review":"This is one of the best Godzilla movies because it has a plot that is belivable.

WHAAAAT! but yeah mechagodzilla is created by the planet of the apes with horns and they return in the sequil with stuping helmets. bu this is a good movie one of the getter G movies. um king Ceasar fights at the end after a long song and he gets his kaiju ass kicked and godzilla rips off MG's head and MG dies and so on. GET IT ITS MECHA AWSOME"},{"rating":"2","title":"GODZILLA VERSUS MECHAGODZILLA","review":"This is another one of my favorites from Toho's original series. The evil space invaders plot, which has been used too many times and is usually very weak, is actually a good idea in this adventure. In order to conquer earth, the apelike Simeons use MechaGodzilla, a robotic duplica of Godzilla. When Godzilla is defeated by his metal clone, MechaGodzilla goes on another rampage. Meanwhile a group of humans are trying to destroy the Simeons base in order to stop MechaGodzilla. When MechaGodzilla is sent to destroy the Azumi palace, a girl summons the lionlike King Seesar to battle the robot. Before long, Godzilla returns and the two of them destroy MechaGodzilla and save the world in an impressive battle. Highly reccommended for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best classic godzillas around","review":"this movie had a good plot unlike some of the other movies where they just had monsters stomping around and King Seesar did not do a lot of good helping out the G man.

Damn good movie though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great special effects, godzilla as you've never seen before!","review":"It is well worth watching just to see Godzilla pit his radioactive fire breath against Mechagodzilla's eye laser/particle beams. As it may seem that in this one Godzilla has finally met his match, Godzilla shows a few new tricks whereby he transforms himself to become ultra-magnetically charged, drawing Mechagodzilla into his grasp, and thereby tearing him to pieces.

I'll admit that I'm a Nine Inch Nails collector, if not a fanatic, but I can't fathom lying to people by telling them that this is good. Trent, what in god's name were you thinking? This sounds like random machinery malfunctioning with a few screams thrown in. Now I can completely relate to the screams of pain, as I can't help but do that myself after listening to this for a minute, but this is just awful noise. There is nothing distinguishable about anything on this album aside from the fact that it's horrible, please don't ever buy this, Trent should not be getting money for making this so let's not give it to him.

Fortunately in this case, it is great. Calling NIN industrial is a bit of a stretch, but not this EP. You get a bunch of good things for a nice price. Two remixes exist of both \\"Wish\\" and \\"Happiness in Slavery\\", the latter which has a great remix in the pounding \\"Slave Screams\\" version. The regular \\"Wish\\" remix is great as well.It starts out greatly though with a remix of \\"Gave Up\\" that is perhaps even better than the original. It sounds really insane because it is really insane. It's like listening to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music', because some people are scared to admit to liking it although it's a masterpiece. This and 'Further Down the Spiral' are great buys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remix EP!","review":"It's a bit short, needing a smaller price, but still making it a 4-star rating. I love Broken, and the remixes include some that sound the same a little. The original \\"Fist F***\\" was on a vinyl single, Wish. Wish is now my second fave NIN song (10 Miles High replaced that) with a still great remix even though it wasn't as loud as the original. The Gave Up remix still shows the great form of singing Trent uses. Throw This Away is a bit like a remix of Last and Screaming Slave was a bit like the second remix of Happiness In Slavery. The version that's track 3 on this album is what I call an instrumental, but says \\"slavery\\" four times on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"the book is a collection of recipes from book that do not even come close to be The Year's Top.

The whole point of the canning rack is to keep the jars in place and from touching. At most you could do 5 jars. It is also a bit on the shallow side.

Its just a great basic genre-blending album with an awesome, sadly under rated singer/songwriter. While there are some filler songs on this CD that arent that great, (AKA \\"Concrete Sky\\", tracks 6-7) There are some real gems on this album. The 3 that stand out to me the most are A) Anywhere- a great song with a trumpet intro, and a great melody. B)Daybreaker- the title track. This song really shows all of her electronica influence with a trip-hop beat, and her classic chorus. The other one is \\"This one's gonna Bruise\\", an emotional trip with the acoustic guitar, her voice, and a helluva great melody. Theres no reason not to give this album a shot- those 3 songs alone deserve the 5 stars. There are other great songs on the album too. Dont be fooled by this reviewer that judged the CD by the album art- thats shallow. If you are a true music listener, you wont judge the album by the cover art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Her whiny voice, dreary music style, and jaded lyrics are enough to put me to sleep. 3 tracks were good but none of them incredible: \\"This One's Gonna Bruise,\\" \\"Concrete Sky,\\" & \\"Daybreaker.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"what happens when you listen to the fans and critics...","review":"Having read good reviews and reading what's posted here I thought I'd try this CD.

Songs need a chorus or at least something of interest to make them listenable. Not even the William Orbit-produced tracks are worth buying.

It's a shame that someone with so much talent could release such a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nick Drake comparison?

This one's for all you out there who actually think \\"Sea Change\\" is Beck's best. I wouldn't even spend the money on a CDR to burn this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album From Orton","review":"Yet another artist who seems to get much in the way of critical acclaim while somehow bypassing the public at large, Beth Orton continues her chain of great music with her third full length release, Daybreaker. Her songs are skillfully written and her voice is beautiful and real, with a slight rasp when needed. Although some would label her folk, I think that is too narrow a definition. In fact, The Chemical Brothers and Everything But The Girl's Ben Watt guest on the album and add electronic ambiance and soundscapes to Orton's tales of longing and truthfulness - hardly typical of a \\"folk album.\\" Orton is the type of artist that manages to pass you by the first few times you hear her (I heard her first album when it came out, but didn't pay it much heed until a couple years later) but in those moments when you're by yourself and just want something introspective, Daybreaker grows with every listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECTION","review":"When I bought \\"Central Reservation\\" via Amazon, I had to pick it up from the closest UPS station. On my way home, I popped the CD in. As soon as the first song started, I had to pull over and listen--her vocals are that moving.This album is just as good, if not better. Her voice is haunting. Her lyrics are brilliant.You need this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Special","review":"Other than the song \\"Central Reservation\\", I have little experience with Beth Orton. As suggested, the music on this CD is subtle. Listen a few times, listen on a good stereo or better yet some good headphones, and you will be blown away. There are nuanaces and subtleties. Like an onion, the music can be found in platable layers, each revealing more to this CD than initially meets the eye. Intelligent lyrics, good music, Beth's strange but satisfying voice, and great production make this CD something extraordinary. Don't worry about the Chemical Brothers - their input is as subtle as everything else is on this CD. In the future, I'd love to see even more in the vein Beth seems to be going with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Gogh Cafe was magical to read.","review":"The book I am reviewing is The Van Gough Café by Cynthia Rylant.

As a read-aloud, small-group literature circle, read with a parent or partner, or read independently, this book fits any situation. Because of the short chapters, the large print, the extremely interesting stories told within the novel, and the fluent writing style, virtually any reader right from emergent young chapter book reader to struggling upper elementary reader right up to adult will fall in love with this book.

The first time I played I had to train for about 5 hours after I reached Indigo Plateu so the Elite Four didn't kill me. (Lorlei was the hardest, thinking my starter was Charizard ><)The 4-7 Island sequence wasn't as good as I thought it would be, though.

The following quote is from \\"The Joy of Baking\\": The beans are first plunged into hot water and then the 'drying' and 'sweating' process starts. The beans are dried in the sun during the day and then wrapped in the blankets at night so they can sweat. This process can last anywhere from 2 to 6 months until the beans become a very dark brown color and develop a white crystalline substance (or frost) on the outside of the bean, called vanillin. The vanillin is what gives the beans their wonderful flavor and aroma and these beans are prized.[...]So PLEASE, disregard these other bad reviews and try this. It is a STEAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not special, just regular vanilla","review":"This is just regular vanilla. It does NOT have the special mexican vanilla flavor I am looking for.

I wanted to see if I had a counterfeit product. Closer inspection shows that it is clearly listed as being a blend when you read the ingredients. The flavor is weak and flat.

Heaven knows why they dropped using the Anton book in favor of this book. The book lacks in-depth examples when it comes to prooving/disproving vector spaces/subspaces. They also omit in-between steps when it comes to describing the solution of a problem. Sorry to say this but this book is cr-p! Even though this is our textbook for the class, I also have the Anton book and use that book to explain the concepts to me (that this book cannot). This book is only used in doing homework problems. All in all, very wordy and just not that good. Again, get the Howard Anton book \\"even\\" if you don't have to use that book for your course.

Not even the better smelling Ionil-T Plus works for me, just this particular tar shampoo, which is getting harder and harder to find. It is expensive but so is going to a dermatologist, and they don't come up with anything better than this. If you haven't used it for awhile and your scalp is itchy, it feels great to wash your hair with this shampoo. It tingles and goes to work right away. You would think that it was a harsh shampoo and would damage your hair, but this is not what I've experienced at all. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy feeling. Yes, the smell is strong when you first use it and it takes some getting used to and it is a very liquidy shampoo, but the results are worth it.

Otherwise, even at 7 bucks, this is pretty much overpriced. Apparently, Bert I. Gordon lost his touch sometime in the early 60s. Not only is the print absolutely horrible, but the sets, costumes and acting are almost at Ed Wood level. The extra knights, with their fake accents and dubious deaths, Sybil and her malfunctioning magic (not to mention her \\"three\\" assistants), the evil sorceror with the semi-dramatic entrances, the valley-girl princess, the occasionally-glowing horse, the cheesy monsters and the villian that resembles Lyle Waggoner all combine for a true laugh-fest in the MSFT vein.

This film plays as nothing more than a poorly made Saturday morning childrens show. The special effects are ridiculous and so poorly done it's obvious that this film doesn't even rate as a B-movie. If you are over the age of 5 and love classic movies such as the two mentioned above and \\"The Knights of the Round Table\\", \\"Ivanhoe\\", \\"The Crimson Pirate\\" etc. please don't waste your money on this film.

And Dido's White Flag is wonderfully done- though cut a bit short.The remainder went under \\"Disable Selected Tracks\\" -- a lot of divas caterwauling through some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever had to struggle to hear.

If you're a fan of Switchblade Symphony, Rasputina, post-70's Siouxsie & The Banshees, Chris Vrenna's soundtrack for the video game American McGee's Alice with a dash of Dwayne Goettel-era Skinny Puppy thrown in, this is for you. Vocalist Jaymie Valentine has a breathy and cool voice. It's hard to pick a standout track as they're ALL good, but the ones I listen to most are: Disintegration, Medicine and Dying Kind.

In a spirit of adventure, the author purchased a powered sailboat (the \\"Gypsy\\") and traveled some the waterways of Florida. Some of the events, largely mishaps, are described and a conclusion for each is written in parable form. While the tone of the parable is biblical, this is not a religious book; the substance is more along the line of Aesop's fables.Through several mechanical breakdowns, encounters with reclusive people and meteorological difficulties, the \\"Gypsy\\" and her crew sailed on, living out their dream, at least for a short time.

Two minutes of cranking gets me about 20 minutes of play time.The light works well enough for a small LED system. I am thinking about upgrading the lights to a 3 LED set.

There were a lot of typos, a lot of jumping around and the plot did not move forward in a smooth manner. One story line involving two women and a bump on the head were self-serving and unnecessary.

It seems that her last two books, Seduction In Death and this one, Reunion In Death has had a more interesting approach in telling the story. Both Seduction and Reunion shows us the side of the murderer and tells us their story as well as the main characters Eve and Roarke. Therefore, we weren't allowed to guess who the murderers are because it's already revealed, which is less fun for us, I believe. However, Reunion focuses more on the development of the characters instead of the murder itself. It shows how Peabody has developed both personally and professionally to Eve and the Peabody family shows up on Roarke's premises, minus the brother. If you're looking for a more romantic side of Eve and Roarke being shown, this is not quite one of those books. There is still romance but less than the older In Death series, but when there is romance, it's very sweet and intimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge Cop","review":"This is a book that spends more time on the psychological weaknesses of a police officer, who spends more time on her psychological problems than on her work. She is so self centered, that she sees nothing but her own importance. And instead of acting like a good police officer, she wants to end an arrest in hand to hand combat with a criminal. The author should take a lesson from one of the scenes in Indiana Jones when confronted by a sword wielding enemy, baiting him for combat, Indiana calmly shoots him. Eve Dallas should have let any of the swat time take out her enemy instead of playing gladiator. As with any book, no matter how boring, I read them to completion to fairly assess them.

Can't wait for the next one. I'm off work with a new knee so am catching up a little faster with my reading!

Robb book, and love them all. However, even though i love this book too, our beloved Lieutenant Dallas seemed a little more vulnerable than usual. The Dallas scene was particularly heartbreaking, but she got physically hurt one too many times. What happened to the good old, \\"Touch me and die!\\" attitutde? THat and sometimes i got confused, like when Roarke mentioned his Dad. WHen the heck was his father in TX????"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Eve and Roarke's first anniversary...","review":"and it's another investigation for Eve.

It is the tenured professors who stuff the college bookstores and their own pockets with money while saying nothing but superfluous fluff on the pages.when I first met Hal Himmelstein I was told of the many accomplishments of this young professor. I failed to see how his accomplishments made him a good teacher or writer.I have read this and other books by Mr. himmelstein and they ahve enforced my belief that the college textbook industry producesthe same fluff under differant titles and second and third printings as a way to pick a students pocket every semester.This book will not teach you anything you do not already know.Himmelsteins writings are those of a holier than thou liberal who has achieved academic nirvana and now as many elitist liberals do.

I take my time to do research and settled on this one. I'm very happy with my decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful & switch location","review":"I love the functionality of wall mounting for my small bathroom. I bought the first one of this style earlier this year and paid much more than the current price. Yes, it is plastic and looks a bit inexpensive BUT it has much more power than previous wall-mounted ones from other manufacturers. The power switch on the handle is MUCH more convenient than having to reach to the wall to change settings to turn on/off! The noise level seems less, or comparable to other models. The cord became overly stretched out when the painting contractors decided to use it to dry their ceiling repair work so I'm replacing it; otherwise it is still functional. I've recommended this brand and style to family members as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty By Torchlight","review":"With her cigarettes-and-whiskey alto voice and her been-there, done-that-twice persona, Marianne Faithfull, 53, packs all the tools a modern-day torch singer might need. Since 1979's brilliant and brutal Broken English, the former hippie goddess (and long-ago flame of Mick Jagger) has carved out a niche as a sterling interpreter of other people's material -- notably Kurt Weill's -- and as a significant songwriter herself.Here is Faithfull's first pop collection in nearly five years. As might be expected, her interpretation of pop is somewhat more nuanced than, say, Britney Spears's. Especially effective are the up-tempo title track, which celebrates a life lived too close to the edge, and the quietly sad \\"Incarceration of a Flower Child,\\" which chronicles a poignant morning after. With producer Mark Howard, Faithfull paints a dark but never dour portrait of lives out of focus and of love gone wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"The story line is fairly interesting, but the constant flashback-within-a-flashback motif is really cumbersome, and the actual quality of writing is somewhat lacking. Also, attention to detail is lacking in simple things like punctuation and spelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"A dense, realistic story of the impact of war on a man and his family. Timeless in it's depiction of a father and son's struggle for love and understanding, the story will remain with you long after you read it. Well-written and very moving... you will not be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching","review":"It's easy to overlook writing flaws when a story like this is so good. I can't knock this book in any way. It was a well thought out story with an unpredictable ending. I would tell you in advance that the story jumps back and forth from present time to WW2 quite often so be prepared. Some of the time the authors transitions weren't done that well and a few more narrative set ups would have been nice but I was never lost except in the comfort of the story.

He has a lot of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Book!","review":"A friend of mine recommended this author's book and wow was I glad she did! I can see this story on the big screen!!!

In those, like Bo Derek's \\"Tarzan\\", the heroine was tied up (for our delectation) while natives(cliche) hooted and hollered. Well, that IS about what this film is about, except unlike Hollywood, they show the natives as being pretty barbaric. While this might be more faithful to reality, it is not something I want to see. This is not a documentary. We want to see Ursula Andress(which we do somewhat) but not native witch doctors doing some very odd and disturbing things in the background. To the film makers' credit, they do warn us about what we might be about to view with the title, so be forewarned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST movie EVER","review":"I hope you guys will be grateful for this review it will save you time & money.First off,this movie sucked.NO good gore/violent scenes.Basiclly 0 special effects.The director is lazy so he threw in very disturbing animal violence scenes.Yeah,congrautlations,you can kill animals.Can you make special effects? Didn't think so.Also another problem with this movie,Ursala Andress was way too over the top with it,made the whole thing just look...fake.Its NOT a horror movie.Its more like an adventure (if you can call it that) movie.Through in random shots of ugly dirty looking cannibal chicks masturbating and you've got the worst film of the year!! Story is very hard to follow,and pretty boring.Its offensive that this movie is rated the same as Cannibal Holocaust,I guess this director was just trying to give us another pathectic attempt at one-upping the masterpiece?PLEASE dont buy this movie,real horror fans will not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"This movie really doesn't have much going for it.

One scene where they rip a live iguana open, and another closeup of the face of a monkey slowly dying in the jaws of a croc - it was on-and-on and that's where I turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever?","review":"What can I say about this movie?!? A rescue team sets out to find a woman's (Ursula Andress) husband. They spend most of the movie getting to a mountain top where her husband disappeared. Most of the rescue team is killed before they arrive (even Stacy Keach). Ursula Andress is stripped and covered with some red stuff (dye, blood, dead husband's goo??...who knows). Ursula escapes with the sole surviving man and they float down the river.No gruesome deaths (except perhaps a snake's). No real story line. And definately, no acting ability used in this film. It had NO redeeming qualities what-so-ever (unless you really want to see Ursula naked). Wish I could have given it no stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Gross!!!!!!DISTURBING!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this one for the same reason anyone ever watched this putrid film. The beautiful Ursula Andress. Yes, she is a goddess, however this movie ruins even her near perfect looks. This film is so bad I had to put it outside in the garbage. !WARNING THIS MOVIE CONTAINS EXTREME ANIMAL CRUELTY! The producers and director of this film should be brought up on charges. I was so disturbed by this film I have been upset for over 24 hrs ,and I've been to third world countries. DO NOT BUY THIS FILTH! This is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen.

I would rather buy the foreign DVD or a bootleg copy of this movie, just to stay away from that damned pig raping scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was cool.","review":"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars, instead of 5, is because the summary and title make no sense at all. It had very little relation to the story. It sais on the back, that Jessica's class of first graders are getting out of control. But that's not what happens at all! But, other than that, it was an enjoyable book, and I reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jerry Goldsmith's Best","review":"My favorite Jerry Goldsmith film score will always be his Academy Award-winning work for THE OMEN (an excellent Special Edition CD is available too, by the way).But I also loved his stylish and elegant score for THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. He manages to capture the pomp of 19th Century English society (or snobbery, depending on your attitude) along with the excitement of the robbery scenes throughout the entire score--the sound of classical music with the fun of a winking romp.I had the soundtrack on vinyl back when the film came out and I'm thrilled that it's been remastered and released on CD.Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"budget model - poor construction","review":"I just disassembled and fixed one. It was having trouble switching to new tunes - instead would just make a whirring sound.Problem was that the head motor was loose and flopping - there was no sign of anything that might have held it in position - not foam, screw, clip, or glue.Construction-wise, I am not favorably impressed. It's a budget model. That's why the display is so small and primitive.Also compares very poorly in features to the other CD-MP3 players I've owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I really like this MP3-CD player. It has great battery life and playback. It also works nicely with CD-RW discs, and the grouping option is great. I've had mine for over a year without any signs of damage/breaking, even though I don't always treat it well. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a CD-MP3 player.

It died completely after only a week's use and, of course, Amazon's return period had gone by.

Some nice shiny pictures, a lot of information rehashed from the game manual, a few good character ideas and a fairly good walkthrough. As some one who played this game way too much, it's clear the creators had only modest familiarity with the game just by the descriptions they offer for feats, items, etc. If you like having a walkthrough it does a solid job of that, but otherwise I found it mostly useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Editorial Description is Misleading","review":"There is no coverage of the Aurora toolset whatsoever in the book, the builder coverage was the only reason for my purchase of this book, I am very disappointed with what I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"the unicorns pull a \\"milli vanilli\\"","review":"there is a contest to enter a music video so the unicorns decide to do it, but none of them can really sing, so they got a classmate of theirs to sing and they lip synched to it and sent it in thinking they won't win, but when they won a trip to perform the song they are stuck.

The lesson of this film is how love, even if missed but accepted in oneself, can bring both authentic life and creative risk. The fun is the magazine TOI ET MOI really does exist in France, according to my French translator, and is quite popular. This makes Depardieu's character much more real. Cotillard, of course, disappears into the cellist; her cello work is great, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon didn't advertise correctly","review":"From the way it appeared on Amazon I was expecting to receive the full collection of Politically Correct stories. I only received one.

The reason I say this is because of the inspirational value it has to me. Seldom has one made me go to my kit every time I watch it. There is tremendous relevance in what JR is presenting here. Lots of things can be practically applied to ones own playing and they are attainable! Things I haven't thought of before come up.Many DVDs focus so much on chops and technique that the musical drumming portion gets left behind. I love JR and Steve Gadd for their absolute gift to the music they're playing.The DVD is recorded very well and the fellow musicians that JR has with him are superb! It's worth every dollar to have this video.I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with JR last summer (2011) and he is one marvelous man as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much valuable information, explained very well.","review":"Mr. Robinson's DVD is an excellent source of information about John's musical concepts and recording work.

If you like submarines, the Navy, and spies, this is an absoutlute must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed, yet appropriately so...","review":"\\"Hunt For Red October\\" is a great thriller, which allows its readers to understand, in detail, the complex workings of various political and military bodies. Though the book's primary focus is on the events concerning 'The Red October', Clancy does not fail to outline the surrounding elements; given that the writing gets very detailed, this is only because the bodies cited in the book have a very complex make-up. Anyone complaining about the detail given in the book should perhaps try reading the \\"Goosebumps\\" serious for a less thought-provoking thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"red october review","review":"I do not usually give lengthy speaches. I have read all of Tom Clancy's books, and the only one I did not care for a great deal was Patriot Games. Hunt for Red October was one of my favorite ones as I had been in the Navy. I really enjoyed the edge of your seat reading on this one. I could really feel as if I was there and really new and understood each character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mind-Crushing Bore","review":"It's pretty hard to make a movie better than the book, but therein lies the problem with Clancy's The Hunt for Red October: he's a genius at laying out a plot, but then he makes the mistake of writing the story.The Hunt for Red October reads more like a dry government report than a thriller. Characters are cardboard vehicles of the action, nothing more. Clancy gets lost in describing the forensic details of every machine the characters go near, from fuel capacity to maximum range, regardless of whether they're relevant to the story. It's hard to bore me with a tale of espionage, international intrigue, and military adventure, but Clancy has done it. See the movie instead (rare advice). It has the depth and flow that the book lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red October","review":"Very disappointed that Amazon would be representing what appears to be a pirate copy of a book -- once shame on you - there will not be a second opportunity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the popularity of this book","review":"This is Clancy's first book, and it shows. He writes like someone who has never written before. His plot is clever, yet his writing is cluttered and slow. I felt like I was trying to read the instructions to program my VCR. It was slowed down by his constant acronyms (what do you think ASTDC stands for?) and technical language. I was so excited to read this book because of Clancy's reputation, yet now I will never read another one. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"This has to be one of the most boring \\"thrillers\\" I have ever read. It starts out strong, but just when Clancy has succeeded in getting you interested, the book dramatically runs out of steam. The plot then becomes embroiled in a welter of names, details and acronyms-too much to keep up with. The hero, Jack Ryan, is completely abandoned while the author plows through labyrinthine policy meetings and technical descriptions that sound like regurgitations from a textbook. If the writing had even a bit of spark or flair, it might have redeemed the book, but Clancy's writing is flat and uninspired. Worse still, he attempts to conceal this by throwing vast amounts of information at his readers, in the hope that they will be sufficiently impressed to overlook his deficiencies as a writer.This is a perfect example of a great plot ruined by a terrible writer. Save your time and money; I'd vote for Frederick Forsyth as a far better representative of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowring!","review":"This is the most bowring book I ever read, it makes the russian navy look as If they were stupid. I think that you can spent your money in something better, look for THE RAINMAKER, thats a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Film","review":"Jack Ryan's first novel a superior tale of defection and a big submarine. As to be expected lots of military hardware and plenty of action. But not really one for those who like lots of character driven plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book, Clancy's first, is still one of his best!","review":"I am fourteen years old, and I own every one of Mr. Clancy's novels. This book, his first, is a little bit less refined in the writing, but is still a top-notch book. I loved it, and I plan to buy as many of his non-fiction books as I can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. Tom Clancy scores a hit with this realistic and exciting book. It is about a CIA anylist who finds out that a Russian nuclear missile submarine, Red October, is defecting to the US. Almost the entire Soviet Navy is trying to find the Red October, but they can't. That is because it is equipped with a new type of drive system which is almost impossible to detect. Jack is flow aboard a destroyer to try and find then rondezvouse with the sub before the Russians find her and destroy her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Red October is a very good book. The whole thing is frighteningly plausible. One of Clancy's best. Why a 9? There is a lot of bad language. Other than that, this is a first-rate thriller. Extremely realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately Needs an Editor","review":"I enjoyed the overall plot and Jack Ryan's character; they were the only elements that kept me dedicated to completing the novel. Clancy could have edited 40% of the text out and had a much better story. This novel is bogged down with irrelevant character descriptions, military acronyms, tedious sub-plots, and background stories that have nothing to contribute to the novel's overall focus. I found myself constantly frustrated with the monotonous length it took to cover simple plot points. Clancy obviously has a huge audience; however, he needs an effective editor. This novel is a very slow read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This book is amazing. Very good, if you like see books and submarines then this is the book for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but don't see the movie first!","review":"Clancy's first book is a winner, although the movie detracts from the military stigma this book provides. Read the book and then see the movie. It will make the movie all that more pleasureable! A winner for a first try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Under Raps Sea Adventure","review":"The Book was wonderfull and very precice to the tiniest details. The Battle with the cook was breath taking. Ramius was very powerful and everything was technical to the paint on the tip of a fighter plane. Tom Clancy made his first the best, the first is always better than the sequals, but you have to remember the sequals were very good, so you can only imagine how good this is!! Even the Russian millitary tactics were precice to how they march and eat. The Americon tactics were very precice too, and even the security at Langley, the White House, and the Kremlin was correct and even the parking security was explained to the very last detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Suspenseful Read!","review":"The idea of having a Nuclear submarine on the loose is simpily brilliant! The detailed descriptions of every aspect provides real adventure. I picked it up and didn't let go. The plot was well laid by Clancy, definitely one of his best books. The movie, based on the book, was not nearly as good as the book itself. The suspenseful climax was neatly placed in a unsuspecting location of the book, a real surprise to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Addictive","review":"RO (Red October) is the first TC novel I've read. Since then, I've read Red Storm Rising, Cardinal of the Kremlin, and Politika. God, what an intro to Clancy's amazing authorship. I had always loved subs and the navy before, but this basically told me everything about a nuclear sub. The story of the defecting Russian, Cap. Ramius, who tells no one of his betrayal but Russian Admiral Yuri, is a gripping tale. The work of CIA analyst Jack Ryan and his mentor, Adm. Greer, was highly suspensful. The climax was the most exciting I've read in a book. Absolutely mind-blowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange format, but amazing detail and story.","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel that I have ever read. I saw the movie of it a few times before, and loved it. When I read the book, it was strange how he formatted the switching of scenes to different places and times, but I got used to it quickly. By the middle of the book the \\"strange\\" format made sense to me and I could not think of another way of writting the book.Although I am not \\"nautically-inclined\\", the book was filled with many acronyms that kept the book moving. The acronyms were difficult to figure out at first, but once I did, I just flew through the book.As I read through the book, I wished that I had not seen the movie yet. I thought that because, while I was reading the book one night I began to picture what was happening and could follow along in my mind. Tom Clancy has an excellent balance of details in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunt For Red October","review":"I really like The Hunt for Red October. It is an action book for kids and adults. It's about a russian captain that steals a submarine from Russia. He gets caught by the Russians just south of America. The Russians blow up one of their submarines trying to attack the stolen Russian submarine. The United States help the captain that steals the Russian submarine. The captain ends up being untouched by the Russians and is safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start for Clancy","review":"Tom Clancy is now a household name because of his writings, but lately he has lost his touch. This is evident in The Bear and The Dragon, in which is out of his element. However, this book has perhaps the best plot and characters in any of Clancy's other books. This book has a different kind of suspense from the film, where you knew Ramius's intentions from the beginning and were wondering how he would accomplish it. In the book you don't know until near the end, and it keeps you guessing. The ending is better than that of the movie, in my opinion, and many of the characters that eventually become bigshots, like Jack Ryan, Robby Jackson, and Bart Mancuso, are in this book and are more interesting than when they become bigshots. This book is almost perfect. I would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me into reading","review":"I never read novels until a long time ago when a friend told me to read this book. I've been reading ever since, and am at the bookstore the moment a new Clancy title is released.

I suspect the sellers are afraid telling you it's 13 CD's and 15 hours will scare folks away. Me, I can't wait to hear the next CD.This is the complete unabridged book read aloud. There is so much more in this audio version than the movie.The movie is one of my favorites and the CD is a great listen. If you liked the movie, you'll love the CD set. On receipt I immediately ordered two more sets as gifts. Too bad it's up to $29 now. Still worth the $$ by a wide margin though."},{"rating":"2","title":"First class","review":"This is the gold standard of cold war naval politics. I recommend the reader to watch the movie too. Most interesting to me are the personalities of Marco Ramius, Jonesy and Manusco. Although Ryan is the reason the story unfolds all the military, executive and diplomatic characters so perfectly depicted by Tom Clancy is the reason that makes the story so great. Tom Clancy also shows the reader the details of the SOSUS network and the skills and risks of submarine navigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunt For Red October","review":"The Book The Hunt For Red October by Tom Clancy is one of my favorite books. I like it because it keeps me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this book to people from 14 to 21 years of age.A rogue Russian sub named the Red October starts to sail to the U.S. heading for Cuba. The whole Russian fleet is looking for it. When the U.S. sees this send ships and subs to capture the sub. The Red October was captured by the U.S. or was it?In the beginning of the book everything goes by so fast that it is hard to understand at times. The book gives many details and explanations of what the codes are in the book. I was always wondering how the U.S. was going to find and capture the Red October."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This book rocks!I think this is one of the best books i have ever read.

This book is still riveting. I have read many Clancy books and this and Red Storm Rising are my favorites. Although similar to the 1990 film of the same name there are also some major differences in plot, so if you have seen the movie first (coincidentally like I did) you will not be bored reading this book because there is so much more action in-between what you see in the film that is represented in the novel, granted I didn't have the clearest imagination when reading BECAUSE of the fact I saw the film so I was thinking about Jack Ryan being Alec Baldwin, Vassily Borodin being Sam Neil, and of course Marko Ramius being Sean Connery, but don't that detract you from picking it up its a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"submarine ride through the Atlantic","review":"Take a submarine ride through the Atlantic during the 'cold war'. Another engrossing war games novel by Tom Clancy. Not as good as \\"Red Storm Rising\\" but right up there. He moves us quickly through the scenes aboard U.S. and Russian ships and submarines, along with making stops at the Capitol and the Kremlin. The tension builds, as the U.S. maneuvers to try and stop Russian subs from killing the defecting Red October. Exciting read, with occasional poetic interjection. Clancy delivers a powerful clash of cultures.Wish you wellScott"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy","review":"Another great book but I tend to read extremlly fast and I found this to be a slow read but nontheless it was great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's First and Best Book","review":"The Hunt For Red October is a great book.

The action packed end makes up for the slow begining. I don't know much about the military but clancy sure sounds like he knows what he is talking about I mean he uses the military lingo he knows about allof the different subd.This may have been my first Clancy novel but it definitely won't be my last.

Tom Clancy's research is legendary so I don't know how this got by him. Captain Marko Ramius is the Lithuanian-born commanding officer on the Soviet nuclear submarine Red October. That's the problem right there. The Soviets would never, ever, ever, ever, ever let a Lithuanian (even a half Lithuanian) be captian of anything....ever. It never happened, it never would. So that ruined the beginning of the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but pretty slow","review":"I read the book for school.

And I don't mean that in a nice way. The story displays complete ignorance of Russian military culture; the dialogue is unworthy of cartoon characters; the \\"action\\" is a far-fetched excuse for long pedantic discourses on weaponry lifted from the pages of Jane's and Aviation Week; and the author is a draftdodging hypocrite rightwinger who somehow elected not to fight in Vietnam and spent the rest of his life becoming enormously rich lecturing fellow cowards on the wonders of modern warfare. In short, it's the perfect book for the American electorate. You go girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Skip...","review":"This is quite possibly the most boring book I've ever read. If you want a several hundred page analysis of the inner workings of a nuclear submarine, this is the book for you. If you want a gripping, fast-paced, satisfying spy novel with well fleshed out characters, stick with Follett or Ludlum. I know Clancy sells billions and billions of books, so there must be something to them that I'm not really digging. However, if this is his best book I don't want to waste my time reading any others. I'm a person who believes in sampling the best from all genres, a la Lonesome Dove for westerns, Dune for sci-fi, etc. I figured Clancy was the pinnacle for the spy novel, but he is simply not my bag, baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"If you want to know everything of submarines, here is your chance. Learn all the technical ins and outs and get a crash course in tactical warfare.However, if you want an action-packed thriller do not open this book.

However, it is good if you want to go to sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there ever was a waste of money this book is it","review":"Im 15 but read this waste of money when Iwas 14.First of all I dont like it because it shows Russians and all people from the old Warsaw Pact as stupid and dumb both of which they are not. (Eastern Block) I am Russian, Hungarian, Romanian, German (East Germany was in the Block) Ploish, Czech, Slovak, and Italian.I was offended. All these countries were in the Block except Italy of course. This book is boring and dry. Too many Military terms and one boring plot. Also Clancy makes it look like Americans are the best and they always win and he makes Russians out to be the bad guys which they arenot.

It was a huge disappointment; not only was the technology totally uninteresting, but the \\"humans\\" in the \\"story\\" did not act like humans, and the author obviously did not know (or care) anything about how non-American minds operate.It all became clear to me much later when I learned that this was Ronald Reagan's favorite book: It sinks to depths of narrow-mindedness and self-importance that I hope are shared by only a small percentage of the U.S. far right.Read Fred Pohl's \\"Chernobyl\\" if you want a thriller \\"with a heart\\" about Russian technology, and see the difference that intelligence makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most incredible chase in history is on!","review":"THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is still one of the best books ever rated.

The book helps make long drives worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Submarine Spy Thriller","review":"When this book first was published, the Navy and CIA were worried there was a leak in Naval operations, that is how accurate Clancy was in his story telling. The stalking of Soviet subs by the US subs which were better, quieter and more aggressive, the \\"Crazy Ivan\\" moves, experimental propulsion systems all add to the realism of this novel.It's addictive reading. It's believable (OK, so Jack Ryan is perfect all American father/husband/patriot, but shouldn't our all of our hero's be?). It is a techno-thriller, but sets the standards by which others have been measured since Clancy wrote this one. It has politics, good guys vs bad guys and plenty of suspense. There are many things to be learned from this novel about life on board a modern sub, the tactics both sides used....maybe that is why it has been so popular and still stands the test of time. The movie was also excellent and faithful to the book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was a real thriller. It kept you turning the pages. As the first Tom Clancy novel it is very well written. It is about a defecting Soviet submarine and the race of the Soviets and Americans to get to it. Really recommend you read it. I couldn't put it down, and got it done in 3 days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Breathtaking.......Absolutely Great!","review":"This book is about a Soviet submarine, Red October, defected to US. Captain Ramius of Red October use his navy tactics to go through the American patrol and also Soviet submarines. Because of a GRU spy sabotaged the ship, Ramius only had the choice of using nonsilenced propellar to travel through water and detected by USS Dallas. Ramius let the crew of Red October out of the ship to the American ship and a few officers stayed aboard. Jack Ryan of CIA and a few officers of USS Dallas entered Red October and drove it to the Norfolk Navy Base. On the way, they met a Soviet Submarine and they end up in a brutal battle. By using Soviet tactics, Ramius easily saved the ship and destroyed the attack sub. To my opinion, this book is great and very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great action","review":"Probably the best book Clancy ever wrote. He does a great job of detailing the story without becoming verbose. Exciting readin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top and Bottom","review":"It's hard for me to rate this book. I thought the story was exciting and probably deserves a 5. I thought that reading Clancy's dull, flat, monotonous sentences, which plodded on for more than 600 pages, was torture. I simply could not subject my mind or my spirit to this drudgery. The author does not love language: he has no concern for words, sentences, sentence structure, or variety. I skimmed this book as fast as I could, just for the story. I would have to give the writing a 0. Even though I liked the story, I have never read another Clancy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overated; Clancy is better than this","review":"I have read many of, and am a fan of, Tom Clancy's books, and have seen him mature as a writer. I say this because after reading this \\"novel,\\" it was clear that he had a lot of maturing to do! 'The Hunt for Red October' was, I thought, nothing more than an excuse for putting a virtual glossary of submarine warfare terms onto the printed page. It really appeals only to people with an interest in naval affairs. That said, I have an interest in naval affairs too, and I still found it boring. However, it does function well in describing to the audience what the world of warfare under the sea is like. In some ways, the movie was better than the book, which is a rare occurence indeed. By the time he wrote 'Debt of Honor,' Clancy had learned quite a bit more about how to actually produce a good read, and it showed. Historically, of course, the book is quite important as it ushered in the age of the \\"technothriller\\" novel that is still very much with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"the book was quite entertaining but was nothing special. Since my family comes from a former communistic country (hungary) I know quite well how life was behind the iron curtain. I think the author is absolutely misleading the reader with his clichee that people from russia act like robots in the aparatschik, that all russians are dumb and that the american technology is far better then the russian ones. It is absolutely not true. Unfortunately these books do not help to much to get a better understanding about other cultures and lifes. it puts a wrong middleaged understanding into american people minds(rusky = enemy, stupid, robot etc) which is not very helpful for the global future. (by the way I am not very fond of the russians (neither of the americans))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wonder why defectors are heroes in the eyes of Tom Clancy? He curse people trying to cheat US but eulogizes people running to US. Morality is lost somewhere along the way. Defector is a defector, it is treason and stealing property of the state is a bad act. Your moral judgement is just plainly wrong here.People do have pride for their motherland and this book is just very disrespectful toward Soviet Union."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunt for Red October","review":"The book that I though I was getting and as I thought was being advertised, was to be signed by Tom Clancy.

While in the book, the story sidetracks to different subs and for like two chapters is on a aircraft carrier. There was also a scene in the book where one sub ran into another submarine and they both sunk. In the movie they don't show that scene which I would have loved to see.If I were to recommend this book to someone I would recommend it to my brother.

This book was very good, very plot oriented, and very exciting, but there was not much in the way of character development. This was a great debut novel for Mr. Clancy.

Grant Morrison isn't a bad writer but he's never quite knocked me out like Alan Moore has. There are traces of this being a wanna-be Watchmen, and I think this story could have done with more soul.

However, I still would like to go on the record and say that this is not Grant Morrison's best work. The Invisibles: Say You Want a Revolution is just way too hip for it's own good (I feel the same way about Warren Ellis'Transmetropolitan: Back on the Street). A much better work along the same lines (and also by Grant Morrison) is Doom Patrol: Crawling from the Wreckage. In the Doom Patrol it works for the characters to be strange and weird, that's who they are. However, in the Invisibles, the characters' oddities just seem forced. Stay away from the Invisibles and get the Doom Patrol, because the Doom Patrol is what the Invisibles should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alan Moore for dumb people","review":"Grant Morrison wants desperately to be Alan Moore, only hipper. The only problem is he doesn't have one tenth the talent or intelligence Moore has. So he writes boring, sophomoric drivel meant to show off his encyclopedic knowledge of counter-cultural esoterica but which in fact only demonstrates that he either didn't really pay attention to any of his source material, or he was just too thick to 'get it.' The art is ugly and the writing is crap. Sprawling in its scope yet conceptually shallow. Radical-chic of the highest (lowest?) order. And let's not forget the nauseatingly blatant 'Mary Sue' character of King Mob. What kind of narcissistic phony-anarchist poseur makes themselves the charismatic superhero leader of their own fictional revolutionary cell? Puke-o-rama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile, boring, and pretentious","review":"There's no point in giving this series a bad review. Much like the \\"Saw\\" or \\"Hostel\\" movies, you're either in to this kind of vile, hate-filled garbage, or you're not. But if you're the kind of person who LIKES the glorification of murder, theft, child rape, arson, book-burning and so forth, then this is definitely the series for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Series In Comics History","review":"This is a piece of fiction which characterizes the Marqui de Sade as a hero and advocates disobedience to authority (with all authority figures in the series given corrupt personalities by Morrison)as the pathway to \\"salvation\\" for mankind. The book earns 5 stars for offensiveness and 1 star for the artwork, which is lackluster. The writing, from the provenly talented Grant Morrison, rates a surprizing -5. It's that bad. Avoid this series like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Bland","review":"I'm not really a big of Grant Morrison's work. I find a lot of his work to be the kind of stuff I thought up and then decided does have enough depth to carry it in a story. With that said, Invisibles takes the cake when it comes to that. While it may be different, that doesn't mean it has any depth. If you're a fan of Morrison's, go do yourself a favor and read the Seven Soldiers trades or his Arkham Asylum stuff but stay away from the Invisibles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid British Comic","review":"Terrible Comic. The description is nothing like the Comic. I can barely finish this terrible piece of work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but where is the rest of the story?","review":"I love this book. When I finished reading it, it seemed incomplete though. Then I learned through the diehard fanbase that it is actually part of a larger piece that has not been released in collected form. My question is, why not? This is a great start, why not release the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, but little purpose","review":"While this book is a good beginning resource for ideas to help children be generous, I was disappointed by how short the book is (I read the whole thing in 30 minutes) and it's lack of significantly new thoughts on the topic. It is written from a purely philanthropic perspective, so don't expect to find any religious traditions/reasons for promoting generosity in the next generation. In fact, it is this lack of an overall reason for why we need to raise our children to be charitable that left me feeling unfulfilled by this book's message. Without a framework (or dare I say \\"moral code\\") at the base, the examples cited feel isolated and empty ... a message of \\"do anything\\" rather than \\"do what's important\\".That said, it has some good ideas to get kids started and I certainly don't disagree with the methods for encouraging generous acts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST","review":"THIS BOOK HELPED ME AND MY COLLECTOR FRIENDS SO MUCH , THAT I HAD TO GIVE IT TO ONE OF THEM WHO DOES NOT LIVE IN THE USA, AND THAT IS WHY I AM NOW BUYING MY SECI=OND COPY.

A must-have on any serious cook's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Songs Too Generous","review":"La Oreja de Van Gogh treats us to too much of a good thing. Fifteen cuts, including the hidden track, result in a certain sameness setting in for, say, songs 11-13 or so. I may hold this view because, while my Spanish is good it's by no means native, and after awhile -- lulled by the very similar pop melodies -- I don't try to distinguish between the songs by listening closely to the lyrics. The pop sound, however, is usually deceiving for the lyrics -- and their tales of loss and death banished by dreams -- are anything but lightweight. Puedes Contar Conmigo, 20 de enero, Rosas, Geografia, and La esperanza debida are the best cuts. But there isn't a bad song in the bunch; the group should have just saved a couple for another CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute, good music.","review":"I love this CD just because the lead singer's voice is amazingly beautiful and unique. =] Aside from that, the CD is unique itself and generally gets everybody in a good mood while listening to it.

La verdad, pienso que muchas de sus canciones se parecen y que algunas otras no tienen sentido. Este CD esta demasiado largo, te aburre depues de las primeras 5 canciones. Nada mas hay dos canciones que valen la pena, Rosas y 20 de enero. El CD, y me duele decirlo, es poco menos que mediocre. Pero como grupo, LODVG tiene varias canciones muy buenas, y me parecen muy creativos. Este CD no es de sus mejores cosas. Recomiendo cualquiera de los dos anteriores para los que no quieran malgastar su dinero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poesía","review":"Como muchos interpretes españoles, la Oreja de Van Gogh basa sus canciones más en la lírica que en un simple ritmo pegajoso, no cayendo en la monotonía en la que otros grupos incurren con la sola consecuencia de pasar como estrellas fugases en el recuerdo de los que oímos música."},{"rating":"1","title":"Una radioformula mas","review":"Creo que no hay mucho que decir de este album (y de este grupo) mas que son una radioformula mas. Canciones claramente hechas bajo los patrones del comercialismo, de letras senciallas y estribillos pegajosos para que las radioestaciones las pongan al aire hasta rayar el disco. Creo que no aportan nada nuevo al panorama musical espanol. Si quieren escuchar algo innovador y relamente con sustancia, recomiendo a Amaral, sus discos Amaral y Estrella de Mar son realmente buenos musicalmente y tambien en cuanto a letras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless fun","review":"Like Duran Duran and the Go Go's, this group's music is fun to listen to without having to think too much. It's perfect road trip music.(...) This album has as much to do with salsa and merengue as rock has to do with chamber music. They're entirely different genres (...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empalagooooooso","review":"LODVG hace un pop fácil y dulzón, que para mi gusto pierde la frescura que podría tener a causa de la mega-hiper-exagerada producción que aplican a sus canciones. Esto hace que su sonido sea excesivamente comercial y oculta a menudo el mérito de algunas de sus canciones. Se les va la mano (a ellos o a su productor) y es una lástima; pero a ellos parece que lo único que les importa es vender como rosquillas.Por ciero, que las canciones en sí tampoco me enamoran. Son correctas, pero falta chispa en las melodías, y las letras son irregulares: alguna interesante y varias horriblemente ñoñas y estúpidas.

This group is obviously a wannabe Mecano. They are trying to free ride off of the success that Mecano had in the 80's and 90's with their very unique style of music, metaphorical and deep lyrics, and Ana's very angelic voice. In fact, I on couple of occasions mistakened Amaia, or whatever her name is', voice for la increible Ana. No compren esta cd!!!!

The silver is so shiny and beautifully etched with detailed designs. The case is a wonderful cherry with glass sliding closure. The silk interior adds more sophistication to the product.

I was disappointed by its lacklustre approach towards the otherwise interesting peer-to-peer platform. (It is not as comprehensive as I had expected).

There's nothing wrong with any of these things in a story if they serve a purpose, but here they seem to be the purpose and only content of a very long book.It's not surprising that books like this are written - in fact, they're written every day.

The universe built by Hamilton is amazing and thought provoking. The gadgets are to die for.Then the plot is revealed: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING! One of the best Sci-Fi universes ever put to print sharing ink with a plot stolen from a 1950's zombie movie.Let me also say that the descriptions of violence in this book are truly disturbing. Animals and human beings alike are subject to all forms of ritual torture, rape, and murder (all meticulously described on page after page after page).Eventually my interest in this book suffered the same fate as many of the characters in this book: a slow and painful death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.

Boy, am I glad I didn't! The first shall be the last (I read).I was fine until the Convict conscripts (Ivets) shipped to Lalonde (a planet in the pioneer stages of colonization) became possessed by demons and started offing the other colonists in gruesome ways.The demons will at some point be explained to be malevolent, non-corporeal aliens that just seem like demons or vampires (Salems' Lot anyone?) in the next book, but come on....!

Although the concepts were quite unique, the narrative flow was so disorganized that I actually lost interest in the story. I think the author needs to review basic literary style 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should call it \\"The Editor Dysfunction\\"","review":"First, let me admit, I only made it through the first book in this series and then about half of the second. At that point it became unbearably ridiculous and I put it down, never to pick it up again. There were parts that I liked (Syrinx and her ship) but the author went and focused on other less interesting plotlines. The violence in this book is cartoony and fails to shock. And the sex? It's like a teenage boy wrote it.I wanted to like this. It came recommended by my brother. The world building passages genuinely interested me. But the main plotline bombs on the narm test.That said, I feel like an imagination nullspace for failing to enjoy Al Capone as an intergalactic supervillain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done, disappointing","review":"This is a complex, multi-layered, big, BIG (did I say \\"big\\"?) space opera in the mold of Doc Smith, but reading like a pastiche of Jack Chalker. After the first couple of chapters, it's clear that the author is in way over his head, that he just can't handle it.Cardboard characters and a contrived plotline do not an epic make.If you want to see how it should be done, read _A Fire Upon the Deep_ by Vernor Vinge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The kind of garbage that gives science fiction a bad name...","review":"This truly is junk. I am always on the lookout for good hard science fiction in the vein of Gregory Benford or Allen Steele, and I hoped I had found something like that when I picked up this first volume in a series. What a disappointment!It's not that Hamilton doesn't have interesting ideas. In his universe, Edenists are telepathically linked to their \\"bitek\\" starships and habitats (and to each other); Adamists regard such \\"geneering\\" as scandalous at best and heretical at worst. But these ideas unfortunately only serve as backdrop to gratuitous and graphic descriptions of sex, and to ever more stomach-churning violence. And then it just gets silly, with the souls of dead bad guys inhabiting the bodies of devil-worshipers (I'm not kidding).If you want a good example of how coarse popular fiction has become, this is your book. If you want to be entertained or maybe even intellectually engaged, stay a few light years away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst excuse for science fiction I've read in years","review":"This book is awful. I forced myself to get through it, constantly thinking it couldn't get any worse - but it did. Very thin premise, poorly veiled pseudo-religious undertones, horrible plotting, truly astounding excessive length. This book constantly fractured my suspension of disbelief. It starts pretending to be a hard science fiction novel and ends up with unexplained zombies and a trumped-up apocalypse. It simply doesn't hold together and relies on graphic action scenes and \\"adult\\" interludes to sustain reader interest in lieu of a coherent story line.Terrible plotting. Mumbo-jumbo terminology. Substitutes religious dogma for science. Way too long. A bad, bad, bad book. 1094 pages of bad writing. I'd give it NO stars if I could. Unfortunately I purchased the entire trilogy at the Border's Bankruptcy sale so I'm stuck with over 3,000 pages of waste paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't take the violence","review":"I have really enjoyed some of Peter Hamilton's other books (Pandora's StarandJudas Unchainedwere particularly fun romps of space opera), but I've thrown this book across the room twice (because I couldn't take the horrific violence) and I'm only on page 300... The final straw was the torture and murder of a young boy--as a mother of a 13-year-old boy, there are some things I absolutely cannot read about, even in the guise of fiction. I get that the antogonists are supposed to be evil, but frankly I knew that before and didn't need the point driven home (so to speak). I'm going to get rid of my copy of the book so I don't forget how much I hated it and try to pick it up at some point in the future when I've run out of things to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reality Dysfunction","review":"This book is written for the author...there are too many subplots and too many characters for it to all come together. The book ends in the middle or third of the story...no wonder the trilogy is over 4000 pages. Who can write that much and keep it all straight?There is entirely too much wanton sex and depravity...it does not contribute to the books theme. Most of it could be left out and the book theme would not change. Although it is not stated specifically, the souls are the lost ones. And how come they have power and the real characters only have guns? So the book does not have an uplifting theme for a science fiction opera and it should...I think"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shocking Disappointment","review":"I was shocked and disgusted when about halfway through this book, I started coming across fairly graphic references to sexual abuse, child abuse, and pedophilia, which were integrated into the story line.

It's like the author had no real use for them anymore.I think the author was in need of a good editor - the writing is good but something went wrong with the ideas! The story ends in the most abrupt manner... I mean, three and a half thousand pages of nothing particularly new and the massive problem endangering humankind solved in one hundred pages!I'd really like to see this work rewritten and abridged...so you end up with one (big) book that is great, rather than a jumble sale of worthless threads.

Hamilton does have a good imagination and has come up with a very engaging universe. However, I would not put his books in the same league as Dune or Neuromancer or Fire on the Deep. There is not much that is really new, and the plot is so rambling and convoluted that you feel a bit lost after the first 1000 pages or so... Also, I found that he used sex and violence a bit more liberally than was really necessary, and tended to paint rather 1-dimensional characters. And, although I hate to be picky, he could really have used a proofreader -- on every page was at least one run-on sentence. Still, given all that, I am eagerly awaiting the final 2 volumes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gret sci--fi","review":"Absolutely great science fiction. Tremendously believable technology is combined with a very complex and well thought out plot. Of course, as with all great books, it is the characters that count. In this set of books, the characters are complex and understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic carpet ride (all due respect to the haters)","review":"If you're thinking of spending your hard-earned money on this series, and are put off by the negative reviews, know this - in a work of such complexity, scope and vision, the criticisms are minor quibbles. Granted, maybe you're not used to sex and Satanism with your lasers and FTL drives. (I'll admit I was horrified in places.) Comma splices abound. Maybe the POV isn't terribly consistent. Exposition can be exhaustive (and exhausting). But...if you're looking for gripping escapism, bleeding-edge speculative science, fantastically detailed world-building, and ferocious action - this book will send you down the rabbit hole, bend your brain, and make you rethink everything you ever thought about science fiction.It's worth every penny. Enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space Opera turns Zombie Flick","review":"This book which starts out well with a deep characters and a complex society of future earth reminiscent of Dune, quickly turns into a bad B-movie which is more reminiscent of Evil Dead Part 2. While Mr. HAmilton has a gift for writing and character development, he seems to feel that all science fiction gernes can be intermixed without concern. I recommend this book only to true sci fi readers who can enjoy a book in spite of itself, or college guys looking for something to rival that last Night of the Living Dead remake you just saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and Dark. Worthy beggining of a series.","review":"If the rest of the books are as good as this one, I would doubt that this saga can be anything less that a classic.The universe is detailed and portrayed with a rich characters.

This read seamless with reality with out spend boring paging explaining how the technology that doesn't exist works.

The setting is well-thought-out and the characters are well presented, but there are too many of them, the plot(s) swirl(s) around too much, and there is just too much going on without the proper development at the appropriate time.I really wanted to enjoy these books (referring to both volumes) but couldn't. I think that Hamilton has great potential as a writer but needs to focus his creative energies a bit. In my opinion, these books wanted to be a \\"Dune\\" or a \\"Foundation\\" but rambled too much to hang together cohesively.This doesn't mean I will abandon Amazon.com's recommendations any time soon, but I may be a bit more selective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intensely Disappointing","review":"A for effort, E for execution. The come on of the novel is the grand cosmic scope, yet it takes more than 200 pages to get past the scene-setting, which is far overdone. Perhaps if the characters were anything other than cardboard, and if there was a sense of forward movement or even the slightest intimations of suspense . . . The imaginative detail quickly changes from rich to atrociously overwritten. Don't believe the hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOLD","review":"Quite possibly the best sci/fi trilogy of all time, Peter brings this book together so well, you find yourself not wanting to put it down.

It started well but then - attention spoiler coming, don't read further- it wen't literally to hell: yes , hell as weird as it sounds. The premise looks like the one from that awful movie \\"event horizon\\". When I got there in the book I started to question a lot of the cool science and technology that was laid out before and found that the entire building came crashing down on me, the suspension of disbelief entirely broken.If you like hard SF or cyberpunk this book is not for you. If you like Fantasy it may be a good choice although I still like a book that can stand by itself ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"The world Mr. Hamilton creates is fascinating. The first 100 to 150 pages or so are very interesting, with a lot of action. And then, from that point to the end of the book (which is about 400 or so more pages) NOTHING HAPPENS. From that point, where he's done setting up his universe, the action just stops. Buy Dune or Hyperion or Foundation if you haven't read them...but don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written, but lack of likable characters","review":"I read the first 900 pages of this book and stopped. I stopped because there were no characters that I really cared about. Most were sex addicted and there weren't many who had any real morals or standards. It is a chilling thought to think that this could be our future. The books redeeming quality is that it creates a very well thought out and complex universe that is both believable and real to me. Its just too bad that with all this potential he decided to fill it with a bunch of losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"i started reading this book because it was high ranked in the SCI-FI top 100 books list. i also read other books bythe same author like the pandora saga, which i found entertaining and the first void book, which was half good.however i found reading this book to be very tedious and boring experience.i will not repeat what other reviwers wrote here before, because i find most of the negative reviews to be true.this saga is not very interesting, and where is the main plot line / where does the story starts ? the big problem ofcourse non of the characters are really interesting to bind you to keep on reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel sex demeans this work.","review":"Other reviewers have mentioned sex, but not how cruel it can be in this book. The young female colonists are constantly raped. On page 222 Quinn rapes a 17 year old boy as part of a Satanic ritual. It's a slow, disjointed, rambling work. It seems to be promising, but I refuse to read any more rape scenes. There is just way too much cruelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, juvenile rantings","review":"This book might interest some, but I prefer stories with an actual plot. Seventeen page descriptions, in excruciating detail, of how a fictional weapon turns its muzzle exactly 8.47 degrees and fires a superwonky anti-porkino pulse for 843 nanoseconds at a crystalline phizmo matrix, (and other techo-wanking) do not constitute a plot. This book is to writing what a schoolboy's drawing of a spaceship crashing into a volcano is to art."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big wind up but turned into a ground ball","review":"So far as writing style goes I found no real problems with character development or engagement, I found the suspension of disbelief a little strained at times with some of the techno babble becoming a little repetitive. As I say to my students \\"explain it once and then leave it alone\\". The seperate threads of the story were to far appart initially and I felt Mr Hamilton was straining to bring them together. Some of the characters were shallow and sterotyped, examples being a drunken & despondant missionary/priest and a lecherous river boat captain (shades of Mark Twain). But I found the climax of the book to be both tedious and dissapointing, shortchanging the preceeding chapters, characters and ultimately, Me, the reader. In a nutshell, \\"A pleasant trip, a pity about the destination\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring space opera","review":"This book is very looong and unfortunately very boring too. It has some interesting descriptions about combat, society and life 600 years into the future but this just doesn't justify the 1000+ pages of boring one-dimensional characters doing boring things through a lot of boring side stories that do nothing to advance the main plot. The main story starts all right with a mysterious entity taking over the newly colonized planet Lalonde. However, when the take-over is revealed as souls of dead people taking over the bodies of the living it just goes too far and becomes religious and uninteresting.I won't buy the other books in the series for sure. I was very happy when the last page in this one was turned and I could start forgetting it as just another childish SF book (just a bit more boring than the rest).I won't recommend it unless you're a religious person but then the sex might be too much for you :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Ordinarily I would recommend Hamilton wholeheartedly. Not this time. Labyrinthine character building and world development over hundreds of pages is ruined in the end by a pure Deus ex Machina denouement. What a total waste of a good story. Even first year writers should know to steer clear of such a terrible plot device and for one of Hamilton's stature to use it in such a transparent fashion is disgusting. Seriously, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappontment","review":"No matter how I tried I could not get into this book. I got to page 198 then put it into the recycle bin.The book goes on and on jumping from one character to another to another...more jumbled then anything. And all this introduction is incredibly boring since nothing exciting happens. Even the space battles are very drab.The conversations between characters are very cheesey, and wore on me quite quickly. I felt as though I was reading a book for a young teen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating. I mean it.","review":"I was in the mood for a grand space opera epic when I picked up this one. Consequently, as a trade-off, I was willing to accept some 2D characters, neato-keen pseudoscience and Star Trekkish mumbo jumbo, and I was not disappointed. There are people who will enjoy this, and I even grant that there is a certain charm to it on some level (hence two stars, rather than one). What I was not prepared for, and eventually overwhelmed me, was the excruciating detail in which Hamilton apparently feels compelled to describe every last particle of his story. If there was a method to this madness, I would not complain, but the last straw was when he took a paragraph to describe the action at the molecular level of a laser beam cutting through a spaceship hull. (No, I'm not joking!) Talk about senseless! No wonder his story is ballooning to 3600+ pages... I simply could not bear to finish this book, and I recommend you avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dysfunctional Reality - expand your horizon","review":"Great book, wierd stuff and wide horizons. Brings another dimension to the genre and worth reading. Good one Peter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a lover of SciFi in general and epic inter-planetary novels in particular, I really expected to like this book (especially after reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon). Instead, I found the plot to be disorienting and confusing, the characters to be flat, and the writing to be dull. Not sure what the other reviewers on this site were thinking (maybe they think people like them more when they write gushy reviews?), but I got so bored after halfway through the book that I stopped - which I almost never do. So maybe it gets really good in the second half ... but I doubt it. Overall, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but overlong","review":"The Reality Dysfunction is a real mixed bag. It's full of great concepts and it's set in an interesting universe. The plot is reasonably engaging, and some of the characters are well done. The writing is at times good, but at other times sloppy. (Hamilton seems to have real problems with point of view at times.)Overall, though, it's far too long for what it is. This volume is about the first sixth of the overall trilogy (it's half of the first book), and it's almost 600 pages long. There really isn't enough here to merit that length. It's dissapointing, because it really had the potential to be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from the best SF written.","review":"This book isn't in any way the best books written. It has some good parts and some bad parts, and the good parts makes it acceptable to read. You can often skip a some hundred pages forward now and then and still keep the story in line. (too many words for nothing else but a party of red clouds and slaughter.) The following book \\"The neutronium alchemist\\" is a little better, and I'm waiting for the third book. (I did read the complete \\"The reality dysfunction\\" in one book), My opinion is that the same story could have been told in half the number of pages without any loss to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Outstanding! You will not be able to put it down!","review":"I settled into the large Volume 1 on a transAtlantic flight and was thoroughly immersed in this story 9 hours later.

Ever.Why? The sheer number of translation/editing mistakes is staggering. In some sections, four out of fifteen words are spelled incorrectly. I'm not talking about simple positional errors like \\"teh\\", I'm talking about the word \\"them\\" being spelled \\"him\\" or \\"aon\\". At times, I've actually had to step out of the story and spend a minute or more puzzling out what the actual word was supposed to be.I've purchased many Kindle edition titles and while there are often a few mistakes here or there, this title is almost unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"This book is a strange case. Its the first one in years where I skip entire chapters and still continue reading.The world the author describes is often very cool, and even kind of believable. But his plots tend to take too long with nothing much happening in many parts of the story.Characters are another thing: some are very fascinating, like the satanist guy in the first volume. But then he gets taken over by these evil spirits, and you simply stop caring about him. He's become a boring plot puppet.I'll agree with another critic here on amazon: these would have needed some serious editing, even if that reduced the series by 20-40%. As it is, I hope the parts that fascinate me stay numerous enough to keep me going, for I hate to leave a series unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"Pulp, poorly written, poorly researched. It's a rare event I find a science fiction book I don't like, and this one tops a short list. The most irritating thing is the comparisons to the Dune and Foundation series on the book jacket. I'm surprised more than one book in the series was published. Perhaps the later books get better, it is unlikely I will find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a Break","review":"This series is more horror than science fiction. The basic concept is that the dead are coming back to possess the living. A bit over the top, in my humble opinion. And when Al Capone comes back . . . gimme a break.It's also way too long. I'm about to give up about a third of the way into the third book. I'm sick of all the gratuitous violence. Just freaking save the universe already and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much as Pandora's Star was good, this is bad","review":"I was not expecting a sci-fi story about satanists so that was already an unhappy suprise as that developed. So many separate stories, it was hard to keep track of who was who and nobody seemed that real. Whenever a problem did happen, people ran a program in their head... Oh, i'm hurt, theres an app in my head for that... Oh, i need an encyclopedia to look something up, there's a software app for that in my head, that girl is really sexy, there's software in my head to help me deal with that too. I just could not relate with any of these characters, even though I went through a little than half the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow! what an amazing universe!","review":"Hamilton creates an amazingly realistic universe in this series!I believe the 2 parts were originally published as one novel which makes this book feel like a total cliff hanger at the end and leaves a lot unresolved.

I didn't finish it. I didn't sell it. I, who am positively reverent about the printed word, threw it away.The reviewer who mentioned the dog's fate has it right. This book turned my stomach so badly that I couldn't go on. And I read everything.This book is dreadful. God awful. It makes me sick to think that someone, somewhere, is going to compare this book to Susan Matthew's books, and thereby send some poor soul, completely revolted by this trash, away from some seriously good books.Please, if you haven't attempted this book, or any of this person's others, don't. I started out bored and slightly revulsed. I finished so revolted and sickened that I cannot even contemplate buying anything else by this author.Enough said, and probably more than anyone wants to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This is one of the worst science fiction books I have ever read. For the first time in my life I threw a book away. This book deals with the rape and ritual murder of men, women and children. I am not a prude or a religious fanatic - but the content of this book made me sick. Although there were some interesting concepts in the book, they were overshadowed by the emphasis on Satanism, rape and murder. If they had a 0 I would have given it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found Hamilton's prose to be awkward and lacking in rhythm","review":"I should first admit that I did not read much of the book -- but this is because I simply found that many of the sentences Hamilton builds are awkward. I don't have the book in front of me, so I unfortunately can't quote anything. But even in space operas which do not purport to be 'Great Literature' I expect the prose to flow with a certain grace, and here it did not. I am simply putting this comment in here to see if anyone else had the same reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"promising ideas, too long and little payoff","review":"I liked the first part of this book, and part 2. It's too long, though. I'd say this book could be one third the size and be 10x more enjoyable. There are just too many very, very long descriptions of situations, people, places and items which are just plain boring. I found myself skipping over these long interludes.Also, I was disappointed in the end. Not because it didn't wrap everything up in a tidy little bundle, but because the thread he chose to resolve was the least interesting, in my opinion. There were lots of other threads that were completely unexplored. Perhaps the rest of them will be tied up or discussed more in future novels? I won't be reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping Epic","review":"Impossible to read only one of this series - you must read all 6 books and you will be hooked after this first one. Very complicated plot involving a huge range of characters which is a bit confusing at first but gradually all the threads draw together. The hard sci fi is very well done, some of the relationships are not as well done, but it does keep you interested. Other reviews have mentioned the graphic violence, which is at times hard to read, but Hamilton is attempting to get across the true nature of evil and the violence does indeed convey that. And lots of very creative characters such as the xenocs , as well as the sentient habitants and voidhawks. Overall, I think most sci fi fans will enjoy this immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average examination of human nature","review":"Although the science in the book is wonderfuly imaginative, if not a bit outlandish, the character development and philosophy is excellently presented. The author has keen insights into the darker realms of human nature and admirably does not try to guess at the underlying motives of alien cultures. The described worlds are beautifully described and the detail is quite vivid. An exciting yet often disturbing book, but that makes for good fiction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only half a novel","review":"It's been pointed out by other reviewers, but this is a VERY frustrating book. Or rather, half a book. I'm a big fan of space opera series, and I don't mind loose threads left hanging, but this book leaves ALL threads hanging. There is not a single plot element wrapped up, not a single character development phase completed. New characters are introduced in the last 50 pages for no apparent reason (no doubt they'll appear in the other books).All of this would be less frustrating if this book were good enough to make me want to read the rest of the series. It's not. The writing style is competent, but about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The characters are all tell and no show. The female characters are especially badly drawn. (Note to all sci-fi writers -- Heinlein was *terrible* at writing women. Please stop trying to imitate him.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous! Teriffic! Lots of other T-words!","review":"Some people are saying that the problem with this book is that it is too complex, or too many characters or plotlines or some other nonsense. Sure, there are lots of plotlines that the author switches between, and it may be too much for some people to handle, but that is what makes it great! I enjoy the complexity, the concurrent plotlines. It makes you use your brain while you read instead of sitting there like a vegetable. Others have complained that the author goes into excessive technical detail about various things. I only noticed this once, and even then it wasn't that bad, it was just that the rest of the story was so good I wanted to get back to it. :)I can't wait for the second book to arrive. In fact, I went out and bought A Second Chance at Eden so I could keep myself immersed in this fascinating universe. I hope that the end of this trilogy won't signal the end of this universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too blown up","review":"Why am I bothered to write this review? Because I feel offended by the comparison to geat works this series receives.I must say I liked the 1st book but it was a torture reading all 6. After using up most good ideas in the 1st volume the later ones are dominated by generic application of ridiculous superhuman powers instead of sophistication or a smart plot - and the ending is the crown of unimaginative conclusions.I gave the complete set to a friend and he didn't make it past 1 1/2 volumes. The whole saga should have been compressed into 2 books - this way it is just a money making pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy of Sci-Fi","review":"The Reality Dysfunction and The Neutronium Alchemist were 4 books I *COULD NOT PUT DOWN* I tore thru all of them as fast as I could....and there is still a third installment yet to be released. I was sucked in on a friend's recommendation to \\"read these, you'll like them.\\" I have since passed on the favor. Our support group meets weekly to try to get by until the 3rd installment comes out.Hamilton has crafted a sci-fi series a la Tom Clancy. I enjoy Clancy novels because they consist of many separate threads that you never think will come together, but actually do, and do well. Hamilton ups this one by building your interest in a story line to a fevered pitch, then dropping it to switch to another, leaving you crying for more...until you read the current thread, built to a fevered pitch, and so on.Best books I've read in a long while"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Paul Theroux's books, you'll like this book","review":"I like travel literature, and I've enjoyed Paul Theroux's books, so I thought I'd try this book. I read the 2000 version of Best American Travel literature, which really reflects Bill Bryson's writing style. And true to my expectations, this version reflects Paul Theroux's style. The articles are more political, more edgy, more depressing, just like Theroux. It's superb writing though, while not always light, so you should expect to take on some of the more 'heady' travel topics in this volume. Theroux really has stuck to his own style in choosing the stories that make up this book. A really good set of stories though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a review","review":"Simply wish to say item arrived in acceptable amount of time and was in good condition.

It lasts and works for 30 days, so you can add fish to the aquarium while the tank is being treated to ensure you are not bringing more problems into the tank. I also like it because it removes chlorine and the filters do not have to come out as long as the filters with carbon are older than 5 days. The larger size it the best value for me as I have many larger tanks and the special design in the bottle makes it easier to measure and keep track. Although it is blue in color, it does NOT change the color of the water in the tank. Copper safe gets rid of a lot of diseases for your fish especially the most common ICK or white spot disease.

The instructions say take out all your fish while you're treating it, and to check your copper levels before treatment. Your fish are really sensitive to this treatment, so expect dead fish if you put it in the water with the fish.I used this on my tank, following the directions, and I treated it for 4 days (the life of ich is 4 days, so I treated it 4 just to make sure. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I bought some different Ich treatment from a fish store and it worked right away with no problems to the health of the fish.I recommend using another treatment.

I do a ton of walking so a comfortable sock is of paramount importance to me. After regular use and repeated proper washing these socks bind your ankle. This is due to a design defect. Apparently the manufacturer folds over about 1.5 inches of the top of the sock inside the sock and then adds a stitch line. This stitch line is a source of irritation after a few hours of wearing. I called the company and basically they said tough, that's the way we make them and others haven't complained. I pointed out that 99.9% of the buyers probably just discard the sock packaging and don't remember who to contact. Anyway their customer service sux too. DON'T BUY THESE.

All it does is give you an overview of DirectShow without explaining the mechanisms inside or how to approach issues that are less common. All this book does is pack whatever is written in MSDN into a nice hardcopy. There is no added value what so ever. Its fine for beginners who want to learn how to work with graph edit and do basic things with it. But why bother to buy this book if you can read everything in MSDN. I think the writer did a very systematic work of just reading Microsoft?s material in MSDN and rewriting it. Even the sample code is the same as in MSDN. I expected to learn more from a book like this then what they show you in MSDN samples. These usually are very basic, and one can expect from a book to add more value to it. There are entire topics that are not covered. I believe it?s a total waist of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarized version of MSDN","review":"I agree with many other readers. This book merely lists all the interfaces and functions and a brief description of what they do.

Especially concepts like Audio capturing in conjunction with WDM architecture etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as good as the MS Docs, which isn't saying much.","review":"This book is rather obviously just a rewrite of the MS documentation, which (in general) is not a compliment. The example code in the book is probably it's only saving grace, but even then it is only sparsely commented. The comments generally only describe what is happening, and not why.While downloading the code from the internet is a valid way to distribute the sample code, it's just one more step I have to do, and a companion CD would have been a good bonus.In general, I'd say save your money and use the MSDN docs."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was another....","review":"Well, after searching far and wide I found that this is the only book on DirectShow. Sad. This is a very complex topic, and deserves just as many books as MPEG4 or other media type specific books. I am sorry to say that nearly all (90%) of this information is from MSDN. The 10% that is not is useful, but you can learn the same amount by going through the sample code for two weeks (if not more). The only part that is useful and not on MSDN is the RenderFilter in chapter 14. The source for this however is NOT on the books website, so you have to type in the 7 pages of code.So, if you are going to buy this book realize you are getting MSDN on paperback with an Index. Go through the Sample apps on the DXSDK and you get the same experience / knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than MSDN","review":"This book is simply a rehash of that which is contained in MSDN.The information is organized a little better than what is found in MSDN. However, there is little to no detail given on most of the material covered. Furthermore, the examples are nothing more than code snippets, most of which are very difficult to even compile and execute.I think that a good book should contain examples that can be compiled and executed without much difficulty.The author really needed to add a lot more detail about the directshow architecture and especially the APIs which he seems to references without explanation.In summary, this book makes light reading out of a subject which is not meant to be \\"glazed over\\". Because of that, I would STRONGLY recommend against buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to get started with DirectShow","review":"While it's true that most of the information can be found in MSDN, this book provides a structure that is sorely lacking from the DirectShow information (and most everything else) found in MSDN.I also found the \\"code snippets\\" to be far more useful than the usual sample code that is so full of the junk needed to make it compile that you can't see what is being demonstrated.

What the studio is doing, as they've done with their other animated shows, is unconscionable and unjustifiable, and I strongly recommend that you not give them your money until they release the full season.If I were to rate the content rather than the studio greed, I would give this release four stars. The team is starting to gel and it feels as though the writers are getting a bit more comfortable with the characters, the personalities, and the interactions.

Doss is an amateur writer who breaks all the conventions of good writing, not for effect but out of incompetence. He is melodramatic and has dialogue that is absolutely unnatural and unconvincing.

Dead Soul is no exception to his writing skill and his ability to spin a truly fascinating tale. BUT.. whichever department of Minotaur/Macmillan was responsible for scanning and proofing the scanned copy dropped the ball badly. There was no chapter --among the 40+--that was not without egregious typos. Sometimes there were multiple typos per page. It is obvious that this book was scanned and dumped on the market without even an attempt at proofreading. At first the typos were just there, then they were an irritant, finally they were a total distraction. This was a fine book totally ruined by a slavish belief that optical scanning of a manuscript gives a perfect copy. And it points up the laziness and carelessness of the publishing company who let it find its way to the Kindle market.

This is one of the most ludicrous and offensive films ever made. From the moronic main character (atrociously played by Patrick Swayze) to the condescending portraits of Indians to the trivialization of Calcutta's suffering to the utter, incomprehensible cop-out of an finale, this mush will depress and sicken you.There should be a special fine imposed on companies and individuals who turn human suffering and adversity into a vapid Hollywood joke. It was nice to catch (briefly) a few glimpses of Calcutta again, but the film makers seem to have missed the whole point of the book, and exploited its subject matter for cheap, predictable box-office slop. India's poor need respect and empowerment, not a grimace and a pat on the head.

I grew up in a city just out of Calcutta and found the movie to be very true to the culture and everyday life I experienced there. Poverty is difficult to portray from a developed country's point of view without becoming self-righteous, but nowhere in the movie do the foreigners propose to change the state of the city. The two characters(Patrick Swayze and Pauline Collins) are there because they want to be and to lend a hand when needed. The cast of Indian characters(Um Puri in particular)is especially good. All of the actors possess great human qualities that makes them easy to connect with and likable. Although these people live in squalor, they have a joie de vivre that keeps the tone from being one of despair. This film is simply a slice of life that doesn't try to prove anything. I highly recommend seeing the film AS WELL AS reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIty of Joy","review":"I first saw this film nearly fifteen years ago and it really made an impact then.

My major problem is that the body wash is always big and I have a big shampoo & conditioner that I use often too, so that Dispenser really was a problem solver for me.

Can NOT believe I had never bought this type of product before now! I HIGHLY recommend it in a small space like mine or ANY SPACE! VERY PLEASED!

We primed it, according to directions, but conditioners that are thick don't work for long. In order to get enough conditioner to use, one has to push the pump about 40 times. We've emptied the chambers, soaked them for a while, cleaned out the holes that the conditioner comes through, but it still does not work properly. The other products (thinner ones like shampoo and liquid shower soap) work fine. I would have returned the product, but it stopped working a while after I'd thrown out the receipt. I think that there is an area, still clogged with conditioner that is impossible to reach and clean.Edited 10/7/2007 - I followed the directions on the product's web site to clean the nozzles, but the one that held conditioner still does not work.

I absolutely love it, but I don't know how our landlord is going to feel about how I used silicone glue and double sided tape to get it to stick to the inside of the shower. It works great, holds more than enough shampoo,conditioner, and body wash for me and my husband (we buy in bulk from costco). It doesn't sporadically leak, and refilling it is very easy. There's even space to stack little things like razors or other little bottles on top of it if needed. If you don't want a permanent dispenser don't buy this one though because you literally glue it to the wall, but it holds like a rock! Maybe when Better Living gets a little smarter they will produce ones that can be hung over the shower head base like caddy dispensers so you don't have to glue it to the wall and piss off your landlord. But for being an overly compulsive organizer, it certainly makes my morning everyday taking a shower with my dispenser!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one!","review":"After reading the many helpful reviews for the various wall dispensers, I decided that this was the one to buy. It was the right choice. This product is well made and even the instructions are well thought out and clear.

It comes in three different finishes, so it will match anyones' decor.

I primed the 3 buttons all the same. Product worked fine for 2 weeks, then one of the buttons started acting funny and I had to push it 15 times to get enough shampoo (far left button). I checked and nothing was clogging it up, so now I have to wait until I use up the conditioner and shower gel before I can take it down to empty the shampoo and see what's wrong. Frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks!","review":"I've had three of these, and each one has developed a slow leak in one of the chambers.

I cut the cord open and saw that it was poorly soldered together; the connection was barely there in the first place because the wires were just touching the connector. Since this is the second cord this has happened with I have decided not to buy another one.

Sure I can get power from it but the insulation is already coming off the wires.

Sure at times it was a bit corny but what movie doesn't. Fred Savage does a great job at it, Luke Edwards did a great job too even though he only had a small part. But what drew me to this movie was Jenny Lewis, I'm her biggest fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Plus Adventure","review":"Absolutely one of the best movies ever produced pertaining to the NES generation - for those of us who caught the tail end of the Atari faze, but were there for the spawning of the new dimension in home entertainment systems... This movie was a thrill in the theater and remains so even now, closing in on 20 yrs. later! I can't ever see this one too many times, and anyone who truly loved the NES will enjoy it as well, no doubt. Fred Savage and Christian Slater put on the best performances of their younger careers and really add a lot to the entire atmosphere... The soundtrack is also great, incorporating excellent music right from the era that'll take you right back there to the time. Don't listen to the critics - buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the power glove -- It's so bad!","review":"I thought the movie was Hilarious, 1 star down for fred savage & the new kids though. Anyways, I actually own all that old nintendo stuff and its fun to see it still in action. All I gotta say is that kid is trully a master to be able to run that powerglove so smoothly, and where do I get a powerglove case like that anyhow????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy used!","review":"I purchased this movie used and it took about a month to get to me and when i got it it was the worst quality i had ever seen. The individual who sold it did not state that this \\"copy\\" was made at home with poor quality and on top of that it was not even a new tape it was recorded over a servalience tape. So once again DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT USED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is good, seller is not","review":"Note to J Patenaude-the seller you bought from may have been unscrupulous and dishonest, misrepresenting the video, but that doesn't mean it is a bad movie. So why dont you take it up with Amazon? Also why dont you list the sellers ID in your review, so no one else buys from him?I liked this movie when I saw it years ago. It was very moving and touching, and as good for adults as for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie ever written!!!!!!!","review":"This movie has to have been the worst movie ever written. There were so many mistakes in making it that I cant even list them all here. The Skateboard for one. It disappeared and reappeared so many times I lost count. Then when he played Mario 3 at the end I almost died, how did he know how to get the whistle and fly right away. VERY lame, try harder next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wizard nostalgia","review":"An old movie with sentimental value. The first movie I saw about video games. Written by people who didn't understand them completely, but still a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story is still good 20+ years later","review":"The Wizard did not dissapoint as some other revisited childhood movies have. I was surprised how much i enjoyed this movie; it was actually better than I remebered. Its fun to see the retro excitment of the original nintendo game consel, to see Universal Studios Hollywood, California with the now deceased King Kong exhibit (R.I.P), and to see the dinosaurs off of the 10 fwy before all of the surrounding buildings and casino was built. Not to mention I almost cried at the end. I have a soft spot for kids that become mute from a tragic event in films (also used in movies like The Patriot and Scrooged). I almost forgot to mention young Fred Savage(Wonder Years) and Jenny Lewis(from the great band Rilo Kiley). I wanted to rate 5 stars but there is a lack of special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good 80's comedy-drama!","review":"13 year old Corey (Fred Savage) has a young troubled brother named Jimmy (Luke Edwards) who is about to be sent to an insitute and both run away together. Jimmy's special talent is mastering video games and together they join up with a girl (Jenny Lewis) as they must go to California to enter the video game championship.Highly entertaining and funny comedy drama that has been considered as a 100 minute commercial for Nintendo, Universal Studios and Hostess is quite a blast to watch. The acting is good especially from Beau Bridges and Christian Slater with a cameo appearence by Tobey Mcguire, the film is notable for giving gamers a sneak preview to \\"Super Mario Bros. 3\\".The DVD is pratically bareboned with no trailer or extras at all but that's ok cause the picture is quite good and so is the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Well, I have to say I did read this book even after i realised it isn't a particularily good one, but it was more of a habit than of interest. There's only one thing to say: in this book's storyline there are events happening after one another, but there's no actual STORY. Honestly. It takes more than coming up with \\"funny\\" things your main character could do to make a good, or even a descent novel.Pardon my english, bit rusty at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This is a boring, stupid novel based on a promising premise. Should've been much better - don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the love?","review":"The only upside to this book is that it is a very unusual story.Other than that it is a story of utterly dislikeable characters discarding and being discarded by one another, with none of the sensuality and warmth (for people or food) of \`La Cucina'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly, truly awful - one big yawn fest","review":"Normally I come to [Amazon.com] to see what others have to say about books before I purchase them at discount houses. This one had two good reviews, so I went ahead and purchased it for a few dollars. I can't believe that anyone would find this book entertaining. Granted the author is poking fun at humans worst characteristics, but there was nothing at all enjoyable about reading this book. I forced myself to finish this, but there is no way I would pass this book on to anyone else, it's in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I have read two Lily Prior novels recently (it is my policy to read at least two novels by an author to judge whether or not I like them) and am frankly unimpressed. The story is ridiculous and the writing not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware This Book","review":"God Bless Ralph Sarchie and his work. Sarchie is clearly doing some admirable work in the name of the Lord. However, Sarchie is a lousy story-teller and this book is written at an 8th grade level (if not lower). This book is not in the same league as The Demonologist or The Devil in Connecticut. Those books scared me. This one did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that actually gives you a shiver","review":"Unlike many books on the subject of the supernatural this actually gives you the creeps at times. Too many accounts are far removed from the actual reader, but Ralph Sarchie describes events that are contemporary and close to home and could possibly affect anyone who was reading. From the very start he had me looking over my shoulder and I have never come across a book before that I have felt it best not to read at bedtime. Believe me, you do not want to go to sleep thinking about some of his accounts of demonic possession! A truly memorable read for anyone interested in the supernatural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Amnittyville horror story","review":"It's amazing how stories can get so blown out of proportion and what people write just to sell books. Other than the fact that the man claims to be a close follower of God. The book is outlandish and VERY HARD to believe. It sounds like a lot of hoowie to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT READ","review":"I have been fortunate enough to come to know Mr.Sarchie and i can tell you that everything in his book is 100% true. This is an Excellent book for those seeking the truth about what it's like to deal with evil on a daily basis and how to strengthen your relationship with God. The book can be downright chilling, but Mr.Sarchie's goal is to educate those on the true nature of the Devil and how we can protect ourselves and reach out to God in times of crisis. I give this book my absolute highest recommendation- i bought multiple copies to give them to my family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is great for those interested in demonology or for those who are just looking for a good scary book to read. It is so well written and it is a wealth of information. It made me realize that Satan is much more than a frightening devil living in hell. He is very active in our world today and most people are not even aware of this!! I hope Ralph Sarchie will be writing more books because I'll be reading them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, great book","review":"I loved this book. The author makes you really aware. A man like this is admirable for all of his duties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...","review":"I'm a huge fan of these types of books. This one just made me irritated though. Not only does the author come across as a clichéd Van Damme/Seagal-character. He also throws in some possibly life threatening advise on how to let your infants lie in bed to avoid Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. Very conceited, pretentious writer who writes very badly. And way too much self-righteous proselytizing, mumbo jumbo, and flinging of holy water. He believes that every ghost, friendly or otherwise, is a demon in disguise just waiting to possess you. Sorry I wasted my money on this garbage. Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spookiest book since The Exorcist","review":"This book is not to be put down, unless it gets dark. Chapter Fourteen alone could stand as a movie that would scare people from using a telephone.

The 3x optical zoom (true zoom) is also cool because it helps you takes close-ups without affecting the quality of the picture (which i've found digital zoom, or regular cropping to do).My only recommendations would be to get rechargable batteries (you'd only need 4 because the camera uses 2 at a time) and atleast a 128 mb xD card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than 1 1/2 years","review":"I bought this camera at walmart, not amazon. It worked pretty good for the first year or so. Now I have to buy a new camera less than 2 years after this one.

He also falls in love with a nice looking Linda Fiorentino (The Last Seduction, Dogma). Not much on the scale except theres a lot of bikers on hogs and some good action. Sheen is OK but doesnt cut it and Madsen is always good in evil roles (hence Kill Bill Vol. 2). Also starring Courtney B. Vance (tv's LAw and Order CSI, Eye See You), Leon Rippy (eight Legged Freaks, Kuffs) and Rip Torn (Men in Black 1 and 2, Dodgeball).

His pain stems from the confrontation he had with his cop-step-father who abused him as a child.Sheen, encountering an Apache, learns the tale of someone who 'lost their shadow.' Thus, as Sheen goes undercover, he must confront his fears in order to be restored whole.You can bear this in mind, otherwise this would just be another biker film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie on EDGE!!!!","review":"And before he completely lost it. But, this is by far the most realistic biker movie I've ever seen. Charlie plays a real life undercover cop with issues that infiltrates a top gang run very effectively by Michael Madsen, minus the obligatory hair and tatts.

It's not only a story - it's true and that's very sad. And it is fantastic that they have the power to go through it. I also like that there are people who have no problems with this relationship and that they help them in these hard times. It's a pitty that this friendly people have to die ... only because one person doesn't like a friendship between a Catholic and a Protestant.

I used this product for about a week once a day and immediately began noticing my face getting oiler throughout the day. I started to break out (outside of the usual) and my pores were actually getting larger. Since nothing else in my skin care routine has changed yet I determined it to be Thayers, probably because of the natural oils and tannins.

It works great for all skin types and because it contains witch hazel, it is an especially fantastic remedy for combination skin (commonly a combination of oily, greasy, dry, and normal) and Rosacea. Like all toners, it helps balance, calm and even out the skin tone. Thayers has been around since 1847 and is still in business, so they must be doing it right! If your man doesn't mind the rose scent, this witch hazel product will be a wonder for evening out his skin tone as well.*My favorite part: I love that it is all natural, alcohol-free, has natural moisturizers, and contains witch hazel.

She loves this CD and remembers Marco from his band Los Bukis. We play this CD alot now, and never get tired of it. I myself have to admit I love this music, it just seems to seduce you. I'm not into slow love songs, however even the slow songs on this CD are great. Just recently we had a large dinner party, and had this CD playing, and everyone loved it, and wanted to know who this amazing singer was. I would recomend this CD to everyone, and look forward to purchasing many more of Marco Antonio Solis's music.

I've seen the whole series through subtitles, and for fans of the game it's quite good. I think knowing what's going to happen really doesn't matter here, since the series was scrapped in Japan (though the second half was released on audio-only discs). Star Ocean EX on DVD covers the first disc of the game through a Claude/Rena/Celine/Ashton storyline, and you will notice many side-characters from the game as well as people from Private Actions performed in the game. All in all, if you're a fan of the game definetly check this out. If you're not, you may be disappointed with the low-quality animation and somewhat bouncy storyline. This anime also has a good amount of humor to go with the action-based plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Yorkie Items Please","review":"I received these socks in good time, excellent service by DogOnLine.

This best of includes a couple of b sides and an unusual selection of album tracks. The hits are here of course but so are the critical album tracks.Complaints, I have a few. A box set is long over due. There isn't as much from Heyday as I would have liked or Remote Luxury. Still, overall this is a fine collection.Despite Kilbey's recent bust for heroin, I still have considerable respect for him and the band. Hopefully he will find his way again. They've always gone their own way (even when that meant producing less than stellar albums) regardless of the hit making machinery that surrounds the music biz.Personal stand out track for me is Feel from the underrated Priest=Aura album and Metropolis from the terrific Gold Afternoon Fix album."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fans should start here...","review":"This is 2 albums: New England (1976) and Front Page News (1977) re-issued together on a double CD. New England shows W.A. at what was perhaps their creative peak, in retrospect. It alone is worth the price of the package. Creative, great playing, great harmonies. W.A. was one of the most influential 70's British bands, but for some reason never achieved massive stardom. They had a unique style, unique harmonies. Maybe W.A. musicical style was a bit too subtle for the mass public to fully appreciate. Still enjoyable after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great albums on one CD!","review":"New England by Wishbone Ash is one of the most underated albums of that time period. All of the tunes flow into each other making it a pleasure to listen to. Loreli has to be one of the their graetest tunes..

There is no tenderness or affection between the main characters. The male character is a faithless dog who treats the female character like property. It is impossible for any sensible person to understand what these two people see in each other and it's depressing to read about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards.","review":"I wish SJ would go back to the writing style she built her career on! This book had none of the sexual tension that she built her career on. The story was \\"blah\\" too. I skimmed my way through the last third of the book. Another gripe I have is that they (either SJ or the publisher) seemed to have stretched the book out - printing it trade-sized to make it look weightier and then charging more for it. This is becoming a pet peeve of mine. I'm sorry to say that SJ is no longer an auto-buy for me. I'm going to have to wait and see what others say about her upcoming novels before I shell out my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of sex but no plot","review":"I really liked Susan Johnson's earlier novels, but lately she's been writing only the soft-porn and leaving out the plots and characterizations.

After a while all this sex just gets old. There&#65533;s no anticipation just details of the act. I&#65533;m so tired of her characters snipping at each other. That&#65533;s not love. Not even close&#65533;Where&#65533;s the story, the longing, the love???? This book has nothing to recommend it.

It appeared that every time these two came together, there was slapping and verbal abuse toward the other. This kind of turned me off from what little romance Ms. Johnson was trying to accomplish between the two. I can understand Caro's reluctance to get involved with Simon after his indiscretion five years earlier but when she did decide to \\"bed\\" him again, she turned wishy washy and verbally abuse toward him. There was too much bitterness and mistrust between the lead characters to really believe in any kind of romance or happily ever after for them.

The hero and heroine was stuck in an inn during a snowstorm - carriage and horses could not get thru, right? Well, how did the heroine skip out the next morning on the stage?

It was vulgar, crude, and the 'hero' was the most repulsively selfish person I have ever met. He thought the worst of the woman he supposedly loved right the way to the end of the book and took pleasure in hurting her both physically through sex and emotionally. I have never seen the c and the f words used so freely in any book of any genre, and was appalled at what passed for a 'love' scene in this book.

It was my first Elizabeth Lowell book, but it definitely won't be my last. Hope is the strong heroine fighting for her dream, and Rio is the mysterious and sexy as hell hero who helps her achieve it. You can tell they're attracted to each other the first time they meet, but neither of them wants to accept it because Hope can never leave the Valley of the Sun and Rio can't stay there. My only problem with this book was all that \\"brother to the wind\\" crap with Rio. What sane person lets the freakin' WIND dictate their life? \\"I'm sorry, Hope...I love you, but I have to leave now because the WIND is blowing, and it sounds like it's saying my name...you should have known you'd never be able to replace the WIND in my life...see ya...\\" That part kind of had me wishing Hope would walk out on his sorry behind in the end, but of course, the romance got the best of me.

I went over the book very carefully and NOWHERE does it say that it was previously published as Valley of the Sun by Harlequin in 1985. Somehow that doesn't seem honest.

I got this book in a big collection of old books I bought. I tried this one, and at first I kind of liked Hope. But it got boring quickly. There wasn't enough to build the plot. I gave up at chapter four and just skimmed it until the end. Nothing exciting happens. When you have a plot as flat as this, you need to make up for it in other areas to make it more interesting. Lowell failed in that, which is why I stopped trying to like her books in the first place. She doesn't really write about emotion, or the questions inside someone's head...She doesn't do any of those pages where authors go deep into a character's mind and express their thoughts. Basically it's like just watching people doing things and speaking, but having no idea where their motivation is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Predictable","review":"Predictable and REDUNDANT. The constant comparison of the hero to the wind gets old quickly. The author compares him to the wind, the heroine compares him to the wind and the hero compares himself to the wind on practically every page and midway through the book it had me rolling my eyes and seriously detracted from my enjoyment of this book. My advice is for you to get it from the library if you insist on reading it. One thing the author does well is give you a feel for the Nevada ranchland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pours neatly but leaks","review":"I was excited to get this item, (the first one) but it wouldn't seal closed. No matter how tightly is was closed it still leaked. I returned it and ordered a second one. The second one is a little better but I wouldn't trust it in my backpack. When turned upside down it has a fairly recurring drip. Otherwise it pours very nicely and turns off when you put your finger over the hole on top. Too bad it has to leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the task.","review":"They fit MSR bottles OK, but are a VERY tight fit in SIGG bottles. When first installed, the caps leaked, it only got worse from there. The caps would not stop leaking not matter how tight they were screwed down. When opened and pouring, a pretty good trickle of fuel would run out around the outside of the nozzle opening and make a dangerous mess around your lantern. But, the worse part was that within a very few minutes of getting a little white gas on the two o ring seals, I noticed that the black o ring material was coming off on my hands. The rubber is NOT white gas compatible! I removed both of these and discarded them. Trangia makes a much better bottle valve, also available on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deoderant ever!","review":"I use the deodorant from this set, and will never use anything ever again. It does sting a little if you put it on RIGHT after shaving, but if you wait a few minutes, it is fine. I get asked all day what perfume I wear, and I answer, none it's my deodorant. The bottle seems pricey, but because it is so strong and each underarm only requires one spray, the bottle lasts much longer than any stick I've ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I obtained this book more than ten years ago when I took Ms. Hamilton's class at Tarrant County College. I still have it and refer to it from time to time. I also used the communication styles from this book for a team presentation in another class, at University of Phoenix, a few years ago. My teammate and I had both taken Ms. Hamilton's class at TCC (different years) and were very impressed with the book, had both held on to it and use it for reference in communication styles, resumes, interviews, and presentations. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"rotten","review":"I ordered this book in the beginning of February, have sent a few e mails, but have still not received the book, or a refund for it.

It even includes one spell (to make you famous one day).A light hearted book ideal for a reading age of around 8 years. The book contains some really good elements. A lesson on how to write in codes, and some word puzzles. Party games and hobbies that children love, such as how to make wands, wizard sticks, magician hats and animal masks.There is not a single mention of Harry Potter, which is refreshing, although Merlin and Gandalf, my own favorite wizards, do get a mention.The illustrations are excellent, highly detailed with lots of elements for children to hunt for on the page. This makes the book accessible to younger children, who can find spiders, bats, mice, cats, owls etc in the drawings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just good music.","review":"\\"Boy inside the man\\" did receive airplay on WMMR in Philadelphia. If you are a guy and want a woman to understand you, have her listen to the words in the song. It is something we understand, but often find hard to explain. The song takes you through the stages of a boy groing into a young man and approaching middle age. Tom's writing is poetic, meaningful, insightful - whenever I want some music to make me feel good, I play one of his records, tapes or CD's. American Radio stations just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful for teachers and preachers","review":"Well thought out and well organized commentary on the book of Amos. This book as been a helpful aid in my preparation of sermons in Amos. It also should be a good concise Bible study aid to the layman or Sunday school teacher who desires to teach from the prophet without getting bogged down in lengthy commentary. It is concise, pracitcal, to the point and clear. However, it does not contain any analysis of the original language or literary structure of the prophecy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Thrilling Days of Yesteryear","review":"While this book had its rough spots, it was very interesting and fair.Ashley looks at the history of science fiction magazines from the origin of magazines themselves to 1950. There is an awful lot of interesting information here on how magazines developed differently in Britain and the US.When Ashley gets to the 1926-50 era, he is marvellous when covering the major magazines. He avoids overt deification or demonization and seems quite even-handed when dealing with the \\"Shaver hoax.\\" Also, he does not take the route that when John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding all the other magazines ceased to be of interest.This is essential reading for those interested in the early development of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully moody thriller","review":"The Bottom Line:Willem Dafoe is great as a drug dealer reexamining his life amid a waste collector's strike in a hot New York summer (another of Taxi Driver writer Paul Schrader's disaffected protagonists in alien urban landscape) in Light Sleeper, an underlooked drama with an interesting character arc and a conclusion that some find incongruous but I find perfect; if you like character studies (and well-directed ones at that) you could hardly do better.3.5/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick, great acting from Willem Dafoe","review":"This is a pretty good movie about a drug dealer with a conscience. I enjoyed the look and feel of the film, but felt that the script and storyline struggled at points. In one instance, Dafoe's character relates \\"White drugs for white people\\". Also, Dana Delaney puts in a good performance but definitely second to Dafoe's - her performance is not quite complete, and I was left feeling as though the film just had that extra something missing. Still, Dafoe does enough subtle things with his character to make the movie worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work.","review":"This review is just for the digital download of this film that I attempted via Amazon.

Lifeless characters","review":"Phyllida and the brotherhood of Philander suffers by comparison with Georgette Heyer's historical romances, written between 1921 and 1972. Set in Regency England, Heyer \\"created a world of manners and morals where laughter is a great corrective and healer\\" (Jane Aiken Hodge, The private world of Georgette Heyer, 1984, profusely illustrated from Heyer's very extensive research files). Many have attempted to duplicate her work but few have succeeded, certainly Herendeen has failed. Her bisexual historical thriller plods along with many twists and turns. The characters seem lifeless. The language stilted. There is very little humor. Herendeen reveals a superficial awareness of Regency England's history, culture and fashion. I wondered about the names she gave her characters. They appear comically inappropriate or borrowed from Heyer. An inauspicious debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy","review":"I thought Phyllida was too stupid to be believable, especially when presented as an very intelligent female. Also, No virginal Regency maiden would enter a marriage like that, unless forced. Even if she was attracted to her gay husband, an inexperienced female of that era would be far from titalated when observing her husband fondling other men. I have read plenty of gay fiction and Regency novels to feel comfortable in my opinion of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 17 year old coming of age story for 12 year olds","review":"One of the dumbest movies I have seen in a long time.

What more do you need to get me to watch a movie?How more Shakespearean can a comedy get than the protagnist needing to disguise himself to be near the woman he wants to marry? Did I forget to mention he is already married to several wives and he must live in his enemy's household to win the woman he wants to marry?You must see the scene the protagnist and another person compete to be more pitiful so that they will be chosen to be a servant by Gong Li. While I have given some clues to the storyline you really must see to enjoy the comedy.The detractions are the subtitling to English and that in a couple of spots it slows down, luckily for not too long, but that even happened in the Bard's comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever","review":"Its great for kids.

But as far as brilliantly representing the NWOBHM, this is indeed on the real deal.Songs are well crafter, although I particularly don't enjoy thr drums sound. It is not cliched, lyrics are clever and different, song crafting go ways you did not imagine, but always in a metal frame.The lyrics some times are lacking or printed in a order different from what the singer is singing, it's weird sometimes.Anyway, an obligatory album in any classic metal collection, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stikky Stock Charts","review":"This is a well-written, easy to understand, beginning chart reading book.

Many people don't believe chart patterns work, but they do. Learn to recognize channel lines, double top, head and shoulders top and triangle patterns. It's especially fun to then use these to evaluate charts in real life to see how accurate you are.The one problem with this book is that it doesn't go through the most powerful stock chart patterns like cup with handle, saucer, short stroke, etc. For these charts you will need O'Neils How to make money in Stocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The pages have big pictures with graphs and the few words on the page do not convey much.

I was able to do in about (total) 3 hours.The drawbacks:1. I got so interested that I went to their webpage where they have a forum to ask more questions.

The \\"Further Learning\\" links they give in the back of the book, well, some do not work or exist.FOr example, the 1 free stock market game webpage they suggest to practice your new skills stinks. There is NO documentation on how to change a STOP order once you place one in the game, etc. I quit the game as I was losing my shirt because I could not change my stop orders.Not entirely their fault, but their links not reviewed well by them either.I kind of now have lost interest, as I have no way to really test these skills.

The book starts with establishing trend lines of support and resistance and moves on to show how charts tell the story of buyers and sellers establishing patterns. All major chart patterns are explained, head and shoulders, double bottom, ascending and descending triangle, rectangles, and channels. If you know little or nothing about charting this is the place to start, you will leave this interactive book with all the basics you need to begin serious study in analyzing chart patterns. This is the book to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"The book uses over 150 pages to explain how to draw a trend line on a bar chart. Then it gives Charles Dow credit for being the first person to publish a stock charting theory (the Chinese were charting rice trades long before Dow) and calls Leonardo Pisano Bogollo (who is renamed Leonardo Fibonacci) a crank. The book explains stop loss orders without explaining how to prevent being stopped out on every trade. The book ends with the usual head-and-shoulders and double-top formations.

It is an informative, quick read that will help one not familiar with Technical Analysis to become proficient enough to have a general idea of what to look for.If you are looking for detailed explanations of candlestick charting or detailed explanations to predict trends, this may not help but if you look at a chart and scratch your head, this will clear up lots of confusion and give you a sense of confidence in knowing what a chart is basically telling you.I would recommend it for a beginner without any reservations. The 12 bucks is well worth it for what you get out of this easy to read and understand book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Little Book","review":"This is a super little book to teach a novice and an experienced investor who has lost his or her way.

Sounds like Brian Eno!!","review":"\\"Little miss echo\\" sounds as if it could have come off of one of Brian Eno's ambient albums. The same sensibility of slowly shifting synth tones is here. The pieces in this series vary from incredibly ahead of their time to witty (toy typewriter) to merely annoying. The fact that they were made in the early 60's shows what an original thinker Scott was. A tip: I first listened to this series on a small boombox. That was a mistake. When I played it on my main stereo system with my amps spread throughout my house, the effect was surrealistic and mindbending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the three","review":"I found this to be the weakest by far of the three SSfB CDs.

This is precocious, silly music for people with an affinity for cuteness. \\"Little Miss Echo,\\" on the other hand, is a pretty, minimalist lullaby. Scott teases very relaxing, wave-like sounds from his machines for this one. The last track is a bit more of a mess...created with one of his contraptions that belts out sounds using a mathematical sequence...it comes off as very scattered and random. While I respect the concept, the result isn't so pleasing. Worth checking out, especially if you're a hardcore Raymond Scott fan, since there isn't a lot of his music available. Things are looking up, though, now that \\"Manhattan Research, Inc.\\" has been released, and the \\"soothing sounds for baby\\" series is available again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Temple DVD Movie","review":"Got it very quick in the mail.

It has such a variety of musical scale, that it has something for everyone. Of course there are the radio hits, \\"Oh Sherrie, Foolish Heart, & She's Mine, but some of the never released songs from \\"Against The Wall\\" are really great too. It's dissapointing that it wasn't released in it's conception, but...like Steve says...\\"Better Late Than Never\\"! I couldn't agree more. I also love \\"It Won't Be You\\". That is just a masterpiece all the way around. Overall, if you enjoy Steve Perry, you will love this CD. You won't be disappointed.It's a shame that such a golden gift was placed on the shelf prematurely, but I guess he chose to go out in style and sounding really great.

I purchased the record in the winter of 1984 during my freshman year in college just outside of Cleveland. Heard it on one of the true soul/R&B stations of the day, WZAK-93. The opening/title track, \\"The Sound of Music\\", is a really different fusion of mid 1970's mostly-instrumental disco hits (eg \\"Fly Robin Fly\\") and more contemporary 80's R&B-pop. But the entire album is exceptional with many songs strong enough to be singles in their own right. Polished, structured soul/pop songs with impeccable vocals and catchy but not cheesey hooks. I do NOT recommend paying $34.99 for this album as an import (ridiculous price!) though unless you really like this genre of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"Wow!

If you have ever used a good grill you will not think much of this one. It does heat up quickly, it also cools down quickly. It dropped from 375 to 150 in the time it takes to turn and season a steak. It would not heat back up unless you used all three burners at full heat. That is not something you want to do while your food is on the grill. The grates are very thin steel and there is nothing in there to hold the heat. Weber used to stand for quality.

However it needs to be better engineered when it comes to replacing the battery. The first time the battery went out I had to go to an auto parts store to purchase a phillips head screw driver small enough to get into the tiny holes and remove the tiny screws. I have a lot of very small screw drivers and none worked. No big deal, I now have a screw driver just to replace the battery. The next time the battery went dead, one of the tiny screws completey stripped and I am unable to remove it. I'll try to drill the head off and see if it will work with only two screws. However this is too much hassle to deal with each and every time I need to replace the battery. For this reason I will be looking to buy another brand of metronmone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little metronome","review":"I bought this to help keep an even rhythm at the walk, trot, canter, and while jumping horses. It's loud enough to easily hear over wind, hoof beats, and high-blowing (a snorting sound some horses make in time to their breathing), and is easy to change to a different beat. It can easily be clipped on the rider's helmet or shirt--I would have given it 5 stars if the clip was stronger--it CAN come off (although it's rare) while jumping, or if a horse 'plays up'. I would really like to see this same metronome on a watch band. All-in-all, a very handy tool for either dressage or jumping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, small, light, various options","review":"Pros--This is a great metronome. Selectable sounds and loudness, very easy to use. Very light and it clips nicely.Cons--I can't believe such a simple device is so expensive. It can't possibly cost more than 1 dollar to manufacture. Based on pictures, and price, I would imagine it would have a metal casing, but it is painted plasticOverall--compared to many out there this is just great! In funtionality I would have given it 5 stars, but I am just giving it 4 due to cost and the how cheaply made it is (I thought about giving it 3, however it does what I want it do do perfectly).By the way I use this one to run (helps me keep a fast cadence) so its small form factor and clip are priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying beep","review":"While a typical metronome is soothing and could almost lull one to sleep, this one is annoying and would wake everyone up with its beep.We bought this to help our daughter with piano practice.

Sorry, I couldn't tell you. Obviously, many others love it. But I wasn't about to subject myself to the noise just to write a review.

THPS3 has a horrible soundtrack too (THPS2's is the best). The game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X for Xbox is much better. The graphics of this Tony Hawk are incredible though. The levels are quite detailed too. THPS1 had its way of not telling you all the specials and moves like this one does. This game has moves where you go underground. Wait a second! How in the world do you skateboard underground?!?!?!? I have one question for Neversoft; Why do you still call it Tony Hawk's? Nobody even plays as Tony Hawk!

There are also more advanced create a skater and park editors with different ramps, hazards and schemes like a beach!

Brown at his peak, here's your chance.

A leader needs a moral compass to steer an organization; it is as necessary as a budget and a business plan. To evaluate your standing, see the appendix for useful questionnaires and forms. We recommend this book to those who are interested in applying their moral values to their work. If you are a person of integrity, honor and good character, you will find that this book is a practical affirmation that these sterling traits are essential in business.

In \\"To Play the Fool\\" Martinelli is investigating a series of murders involving homeless in San Francisco. The main suspect draws many parallels from her Mary Russel books in that he is shattered by a traumatic life event and has withdrawn from society much like many of the WWI vets in her other series. Obviously, the effects of PTSD are of great interest to her - coping mechanisms, etc. I enjoyed the book. It kept me guessing and interested. As usual the denouement is a little pat, but all in all it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"King writes another good read","review":"Laurie King steps away from her two serials to write a thought provoking mystery, as always King's research is thorough and provocative.

Tracks 2 and 3 are from the 1989 demo for the \\"By Inheritence\\" LP and these songs absolutely crank!! Much heavier sound than appeared on the final CD (which was ok). Heaps of energy and trademark insanely heavy and fast riffs with powerful vocals. Tracks 4 and 5 are from the 1985 demo for the \\"Fear of Tomorrow\\" LP. These pretty much sound the same as the LP.The next 8 songs are from demo's from 1984 with their first vocalist. As you'd expect they are pretty rough and immature. The vocals are just plain funny. The music however, shows how these guys were right up there with your Metallica's and Slayer's and way ahead of most other bands of the era.It was a disappointment that there were no demo's for 1987's classic \\"Terror Squad\\", which you should pickup without delay. Also, perhaps get their new CD \\"B.A.C.K\\". Riffs, Riffs, Riffs....insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the British Blues","review":"For my money, this is the last good CBB album (well, unless you count the live album of old tunes). It has all the elements that made CCBB, Plays On, A Lot of Bottle and Tightly Knit so great, with just a hint of the 'Hollywood' excesses which would soon swamp them. There are some great songs here (\\"You Make Me Sick,\\" \\"All The Time in the World\\") with no crappy filler in between. Colin's singing and Peter's playing are in peak form, for possibly the last time.Essential for any British blues fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just getting into world music","review":"I'm in the military and every time I walk into a \\"Green Beans\\" coffee shop anywhere in the world, they have Putumayo's music on.

As for me, I found it somewhat dull and without the enchanting and enticing melodies that I associate with North African music.

Speaking of grooves, I found Putumayo's \\"Arab Groove\\" much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Putumayo disc","review":"I've heard several Putumayo compilations, and most of the Lounge series, and this is by far the best. Ambient, exotic, and endlessly listenable.While living on a kibbutz I lost my iPod and had only this album for several weeks. I spent many hours in the apple packing factory listening to nothing else, and still am not tired of it.This is also an excellent introduction for those (like me) to whom 'authentic' Arab music like Umm Kulthum is still almost impenetrable.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"little known secret","review":"This album is unknown to most people. It took me a while to find an album by them after hearing their stunning song Quiet Light off the Third Barramundi Sampler. I'm not sure if there is an album before this one but if anyone knows where I can find the album with Quiet Light on it I would be in your debt. This album has an ambient sound similar to most of the albums on Waveform records (one of my favorite record outfits for ambient music).This album is worth the price of admission for a journey into another world.I hope they put out a new album soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun tribute album","review":"This is a fun tribute album, particularly for ABBA fans and fans of dance-pop.

I actually really enjoy most of the artists on this album...when they are not butchering Abba. None of these singers have anything similar to the real vocal depth that Agnetha and Frida had, and there are boring dance mixes of already originally strong dance tracks. There ARE some decent 'tributes' on the album, but you may as well just pop in the real Abba: more enjoyment, less wishing for better production value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"the cd has some cover excellent and different, but other songs are bad.

Another friend is unrecognizable as a stewardess pacing near the runway in Berlin. It premiered in a small town in Berlin at a British movie theatre in Gatow.This was a champagne/tuxedo premiere.

Fans of the book will be grossly disappointed. Anthony Hopkins was grossly mis-cast.

Frankly, I'd think McEwan would have enough money that he wouldn't need to sell out this way.The characters have no chemistry with one another.The ending is ambiguous.For all the \\"movie\\" magic weaved in, it lacks drama.A mere phantom of the book.

That is that an applied approach is just simply skimming. That's what this book does, it skims over the concepts of Algebra. This is definitely not a solid foundation and will not benefit you if you need to take Trig., College Algebra or higher math. For instance, graphing is something you do alot in algebra. This book does not introduce the TI-84 calculator which is essential in today's algebra. I took an intermed. algebra course at one school under this book. Well a few years later I had to retake intermed. algebra because I placed low on the math test and was put back into it at another school. I was surprisingly shocked that I had learned very little with the applied approach. It was as if I was totally new to algebra.

A rather dry slog, and yet it metes out more than its fair share of c/overt propaganda, including my particular favorite, which has the Enlightenment in scare quotes. Sorry, Misters Franklin, Hume, Jefferson, Locke, Newton, Kant, Rouseeau, Spinoza, but boy oh boy were you deluded.History told slant, with a decidedly Christian bias. The Bible is accepted as a factual historical source, and while divergent theories are allowed to exist, this beauty sides always with the Good Book, without acknowledging the scholarship suggesting that literality may not be the best (or even a possible) interpretation of its hallowed text.As an alumna of this choice bit of propaganda, I can say that in my case, it backfired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life","review":"In this captivating book really worth to read the author developed a highly interesting almost radical concept in cell biology that may clarify a lot of current inconsistencies.

Highly recommended reading for scientists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to cell biology","review":"I think that this is interesting book both for students and professionals getting a knowledge in cell biology. The book was written in a very narrative form and it does not require the strong background in biology. There is one thing which decreased my rating - sometimes it too simple.

Correlation between protein structure and function is another gem that this book brings out.Book can be viewed as an extension and application of Ling's association induction hypothesis to specific areas in cell biology (secretion, resting and action potentials (Tasaki theory), cellular transport, cell division).Book is self contained and doesn't request any prior knowledge of Ling's work, it actually explains some basic parts of Ling's hypothesis in very simple way, nor any collage level chemistry or physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete nonsense!","review":"This is an absurd rehash of Gilbert Ling's interesting (at the time, the 1960's) theories that have been fundamentally and completely tested and found wanting.

Kind of intrigued by the history of the creator (who also created the first Moog-type keyboard for his daughter who wanted to be able to play piano without lessons), I HAD to hear the tracks that would be played from this album. Well, this album isn't just for babies....the tracks repeat simple melodies arranged in a loop of sorts with little change throught the track. Now, this may seem monotonous, but it isn't much different than what a lot of Baroque music does....this isn't Baroque, by any means, but the effect is the same.....peace achieved through soothing simplicity....and you can't get enough.

They've put out 13 albums so far, and \\"Debil\\" was their first (issued in 1984). This record's nearly got everything you'd appreciate buying a punk-pop record - the lyrics are funny and intelligent, the music is a genial mixture of simple pop hooklines, crazy punk riffs and a little bit wave as well. The only bad thing about \\"Debil\\" is that it only runs for 38 minutes or so; but why bother, just press the 'play' button again once the record has ended, and be sure to have a great deal of fun while listening. One thing: If you want to get the maximum fun dose out of \\"Debil\\", you should already have had some encounter with the German language - otherwise you wouldn't be able to understand the excellent and saucy lyrics fully, and that would only be half the fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiefer gives s solid performance, but....","review":"Depsite his good performance, this is not enough to save the sloppy direction, weak production and the decpetion of the public through a cover art that is completely misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad popo","review":"I don't think people are being fair to this movie.

He spends some time being depressed and wanting to kill himself until his step brother introduces him to an idea to buy a horse, a shady one, but potentially lucrative. At first every one is on fire with happiness and expectations but then things start going down hill do to the jockey's gambling addiction. They have to do some quick thinking to stay on top but it forces Pally into situations that he wasn't prepared to handle and Kiefer does an excellent job portraying a guy thats just in over his head. Anthony LaPaglia is great as the mischievious but good natured thug step brother. All in all I was very pleased with this movie and enjoyed the drama and the comedy that this movie had to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiefer is Charming and Adorable","review":"Very rarely does Kiefer Sutherland show his comedic talent, which he has in abundance, and this is one of the finest examples of it that I've encountered. The scene of him slowly beating his forehead against the table and moaning in frustration as his step-brother blows away all his objections is worth its weight in gold. Yeah, it's a hokey and cheaply made film, but it's warm and funny, and it keeps your interest going. And better yet, he's a good guy, a regular joe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiefer Sutherland! Anthony LaPaglia! The Mafia! Horses!","review":"Thanks to network TV,Anthony LaPaglia and Kiefer Sutherland are well-known for their leading roles in \\"Without a Trace\\" and \\"24.\\" However, this movie wasn't a smashing success for the both of them...due to its plotlessness.Sutherland stars as a former Boston cop who doesn't get to do much other than drink&cry; a lot. LaPaglia stars as his scheming,not too bright half-brother,complete with a soul patch&bleached; hair.They're convincing as brothers,but the script hobbles them. There's a plot involving horses and the Mafia,as well as a jockey's annoying,creepy daughter,who seems to be one of the Children of the Corn,or Damien's lil' sis.Radha Mitchell stars as Sutherland's perpetually confused ex,and reason for a gratutious,un-erotic love scene (but the violinists do get to play passionately.The orchestra swells in anticipation for...an anti-climax)\\"Dead Heat\\" is a dead movie,despite two strong leading actors,the Mafia,and horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on Earth is this?!","review":"The swindle begins by the cover art.

The remaining plant finally grew fruit and they ripened red with tons of tape, etc. to support it (that's where all the extra work came in - trying to keep the plant upright).

With very little effort you can grow fresh herbs and produce right in your own kitchen, or anywhere else in your house for that matter. Overall Aerogarden offers a great line of seed pods however with that being said, most Aerogarden owners are at some point going to be tempted to plant something that isn't available and that is where the Master Gardener Kit come into play. It really opens up the world of indoor gardening by allowing you to plant your own seeds. We wanted to plant catnip as not only do we have multiple cats, so does everyone else in my family. I also am a big Bonsai tree aficionado and this kit allows me to use my Aerogarden to start my Bonsai seedlings. This kit gives you a year's worth of seed pods and nutrients.The bottom line - Aerogardens are great but they would be severely limited if it wasn't for the Master Gardener Kit. This kit really opens up the world of indoor gardening. A must have for every Aerogarden owner!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second try and the tomatoes still died","review":"My first batch died after a couple weeks of growing to about 1.5 inches; the company was very quick in replacing all three plants, however the next batch did the same thing.

Also have tried on another set to grow cilantro with no success even after trying to transplant from a very small potted plant, similar failure with trying strawberries.

Wrong! The herbs did fine again, but what they fail to tell you is that the tomatoes require 8 hours of absolute darkness. If you want to have the two gardens in the same room, or even in your living area, forget about the tomatoes. Lovely greenery, no blossoms = no tomatoes. I finally just threw them out. I'll grow herbs again, and maybe try another kit, but I can't recommend the cherry tomato kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS PURCHASE!!!","review":"I am SO NOT happy about purchsing this item. It is NOT as described. What the description says is \\"Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Dill, Mint, Parsley & Thyme,\\" what I got was Genovese Basil, Thyme, Mint, Lemon Basil, Oregano, Dill, Global Basil. I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT. This item has been listed with this description for MONTHS before I purchased it. If I had wanted 3 kinds of basil, I would have purchased the basil mix. I expressly wanted the chives and the parsley. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"5 out of the 7 grew fine, but the Cilantro and the Dill haven't sprouted the least. It's been a month and they look great, too. The Chives sprouted the quickest and it's huge now! We tried the herbs just to test the unit and the AeroGarden is doing all the work. This lil' booger is sweet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing I couldn't grow...","review":"I don't know if it was just me or what but I CANNOT get any tomatoes to grow.I've followed all of the instructions (of which there are many) and so far I've only had flowers bud but then never come to fruition.I've done the manual pollination, I've made sure they didn't fall over, I've even trimmed them but dang it if I can't get a tomato. And, these plants are a total water hog. I have to fully fill up my water every 4-5 days due to how immense these plants grow.So, if anyone else has had a good time growing the tomatoes please let me know. I think I'm going to have to go back to herbs and lettuce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing Tomatoes in my Aero Garden","review":"I thought what fun. Fresh tomatoes all year round. The tomatoes bushes grew and grew and went past my hood of my garden and drooped over the top. I am loaded with tons of green tomatoes. Unfortunately, the bottom of the stems are slowly dying and I will end up not harvesting any tomatoes.I have 3 aerogardens. I have tried the lettuces----GREAT. Herbs---GREAT. Petunia-----still blooming up a storm. The tomatoes.....I am hoping to salvage two plants by taking them OUT of the 'water' and planting them in real soil. The Aero Garden works great on the above except the tomatoes.I love my machines. I have given the Aero Garden as Christmas and birthday presents....(I should have stock) but, the tomatoes are a bust. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fruitless","review":"After having been reasonably successful with the initial herb seeds that came with the garden, I thought tomatoes would be a nice next step.The tomato plants grew quickly and required a lot of trimming and pruning. They also do require support to keep them from falling over.After 5 monthsI saw some yellow tomatoes (the kit comes with 2 red tomato pod and 1 yellow one). I have not harvested them yet, since they still show hues of green. So I cannot comment on the taste.The red tomatoes never came to fruition. One of them became sick or certainly looked sick so I pulled it. The idea is nice - unfortunately the execution lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I love my AeroGarden and was thrilled with the herbs and even happier with the cherry tomatoes. When I discovered the green bean kit, I couldn't wait to try it. My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him. When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits. However, the plants just grew and grew. They became overly bushy and never produced any beans. I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes. This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"43% grew","review":"We must have gotten old stock. It does have the sponge material instead of peat moss, it did not have the liquid nutrients and the tablets were falling apart, and now after 4-5 weeks, I have one very healthy basil and one very small thyme, and a small mint. So 3 out of 7 actually sprouted/grew. So now I get to call the company and ask for a replacement :(Update: 9/3/2010I called and they are sending a replacement. They are strongly recommending distilled water so there will be no trace minerals ... will update on success/failure when it arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with this seed kit. First, neither cilantro pod even sprouted. I went to the Aerogarden website and got replacement pods, but they don't offer a replacement for cilantro, so my garden is not likely to be very \\"South of the Border\\". In addition, the only two pods that are really growing are the globe basil and epozate. The thyme, parsley and oregano are a pathetic bunch of sprouts that are beginning to turn brown after four weeks. I'm following the directions and just finished a successful garden, so it's not like I'm doing anything wrong. These gardens are supposed to be idiot-proof, at any rate. I would not bother purchasing this seed kit in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The plants grew huge, flowered, but never produced tomatoes. We shook them like the instructions said, but zero tomatoes. On top of that, over the last few weeks, it has gotten very loud. Sounds like the pump is loosing a bearing or something. We have cleaned it, but still loud. Very disappointed. My wife wants to toss the whole thing in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment for the price","review":"I received the box, which contained--to my surprise--three spots with the rest spacers for the tomatoes. At a price of $19.95 (and I'm not that price sensitive), I thought this was seriously over priced. Worse, while two of the plants are well on their way, the third never sprouted. Did some investigation, and there were no seeds in the third. So, I basically paid $10 a tomato seed. As much as I love cherry tomatoes, and have loved other aero garden kits very much, I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Tomatoes","review":"I purchased the cherry tomato 3 pod seed kit about one year ago. I followed the booklet's guidelines exactly. There was much leaf growth and occasionally a few flowers, but no tomatoes ever appeared. $20 is way too much for zero production! I'll stay with herbs from now on. By the way, amazon's service and speed of delivery were excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy Salad Greens Seed Kit","review":"Despite what the package claims, namely that the seed kit contains a mix of Red Leaf, Green Leaf, Butterhead & Romaine, it, in fact, had seven pots of the same seeds, namely Butterhead lettuce. Had I known this was the case I'd not have bought it, and feel deceived by the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Small Crop Not Worth It","review":"The green beans were my third or fourth seed crop from the Aerogarden folks. Had great success with the herbs, and have been trying other crops to gauge my success and interest. Sadly, the green beans I considered a bust. I got one meager handful of beans from this; no more. I'm going back to the herbs after this.One thing that is a challenge with the beans - once they flower, you have to be your own \\"bee\\" to get them pollinated.Bottom Line: Would not recommend this seed kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase","review":"Only 1 plant grew and then it died. I have two gardens and greenbeans don't work.Everything else is a gardeners dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakishly fast.","review":"I'm not a gardener and would never pretend to know anything about growing anything. In fact, I'd say everything I've tried to keep alive or grow fails miserably.My wife wanted to have her own herb garden and she also didn't seem to have the knack or patience to grow herbs properly. I have to say as of this review we're two weeks in and the results are incredible. Certain pods are growing faster than others but it seems like they all sprout and grow freakishly fast. We'll see how they taste when it comes time to harvest. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"WELL I ORDERED THIS ITEM AND KINDLY ASKED A CS REP IF THEY COULD SHIP THIS ASAP FOR ME, REASON BEING IS THAT I HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE AERO GARDEN THROUGH CUSTOMS AND IT ARRIVED WITHOUT MY SEED KIT.

I JUST RECIEVED AN EMAIL SAYING THAT IT WILL ARRIVE TO ME JUNE25TH.wow I ASKED FOR HELP TO GET IT TO ME QUICKER AND ALL THIS REP DID WAS MAKE SURE I HAD TO WAIT A WHOLE MONTH FOR THIS PRODUCT TO GET TO ME, MY AERO GARDEN WAS HERE IN 2 WEEKS EXACLY WHY WOULD THE SEED KIT TAKE A WHOLE MONTH???

One Sprout in a Month???","review":"I started my first Aero Garden with great success; it gave me more herbs than I could keep up with. However, when I ordered this International Basil seed kit, despite following the re-plant instructions to the letter, after about a month, I have just one basil sprout, approximately 3 cm above the label. The package says they're \\"guaranteed to grow\\" but says nothing about how to redeem that guarantee if they don't grow. Now I've spent over $20 on something that didn't even work. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AeroGarden International Basil Seed Kit","review":"My only reservation is that I had no choice on the specific type of basil plants I receive.

This version has a maximum distance of about two feet from pods to lights. I had previously had a great experience growing the herbs. The tomatoes just needed a lot more headroom that my aerogarden provided. My harvest was a meager eight (if great-tasting) cherry tomatoes. I've noticed that since my experience, Aerogarden has introduced a new version with a four foot headroom. I think the tomato seed kit should be clearly labelled as requiring the four foot version!Also, make certain to read the directions--you'll need to pollinate the tomato flowers by hand, which is a straightforward process that is clearly described.I'm now planting another round of herbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right plants for the AeroGarden!","review":"Ok, I love the Aerogarden and it worked great with my last batch of herbs. But the tomatos grow very fast and even with tons of trimming, I can't seem to keep them away from the lights. But that is not the biggest problem. Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four \\"unused\\" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb. There could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salad Greens kit","review":"This is the kit I used first with my AeroGarden. It sprouted well and was ready to harvest in 3 weeks. My problem is that there is not enough lettuce for 2 dinner size salads. You are also supposed to only harvest 1/3 of the product, which is enough for a small side salad.It takes about a week from picking to be able to harvest again, and the plants do have long stems. I won't be getting this kit again. Hopefully the Herbs will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intl Basil Doesn't Work In All Aero Gardens","review":"The International Basil kit only works in the 7 pod gardens, which is not specified anywhere in the product description. After realizing that the basil was not sprouting, I discovered the reason why - this kit is not compatible with the 6 pod garden - the pods are shorter and do not reach the water! Very disappointed - my rating is due to the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon must have an old batch","review":"Be warned: Amazon must have an old or bad batch of herb seeds. Only 4 of the 7 seed pods grew (the parsley, chives and dill never sprouted), and this is our second batch that had some fungus or mold in the purple basil pod. They have changed from the tablet nutrients to some liquid nutrients in a bag, two of which leaked (one was nearly empty and leaked all over the instruction booklet).The seed pods that did grow are growing wonderfully (more basil, mint and thyme that we can use), but it seems to be a shot in the dark whether you'll get a good batch.Based on the quality of this product, I cannot recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry Tomato Seed Kit - only one plant grew","review":"I purchased two kits and only one plant grew from each kit.

Unfortunately, this new \\"special edition\\" released in spring 2010 is terrible:Silver Lode - Special Edition- far inferior to earlier edition from same company.

The realistic and positive outlook on living with it and showing people laying down on the bed and couch because their just so fatigued or in so much pain, it's all they can do.

The format is two women talking with each other. One of the women has her back to the camera. There is no action or visuals of any kind except for the two women talking. They do not use microphones. The camera is stationary and set up at a distance from the women so that the whole picture of the women can be included. The only microphone is the microphone attached to the camera. Because of the distance, the woman facing the camera is difficult to hear but the woman with her back to the camera/microphone cannot be heard at all. The higher the volume is turned up, the greater the background noise.This might have been much better as a CD where the women would each have a microphone and the listener would be able to have a clear understanding of their topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not play........","review":"Will not play in newer DVD/BlueRay player.

Well, I watched this movie on cable a couple of times when I was still a child, and I remember it being a good but forbidden movie. I decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic. But watching it as an adult has shown me one thing: it's bad in every way. From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with consentual desire already. I guess my changing view about Zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a 12 year old versus that of a 25 year old.Bottom Line: No wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinemax Reject","review":"It is astounding that so many people found this bit of erotic fluff so compelling. I am not sure what was worse: seeing Judge Reinhold's bare backside, or having to listen to his terrible attempt at a southern accent. The characters here are completely unlikable.

This was a terrible film.

Here we receive from Yourcenar, acting like a medium, not only the picture of a distant past, its vivid images of spectacular wars and cities that are no longer to be found on maps, but the understanding of a spirit that ran at its most perfect in Rome's brilliant 2nd century: the 'pinacle of civilisation', the time before the barbarians knock at the gate; a spirit to which we are the remote heirs, as Marguerite Yourcenar, pointed out, 'a mere line of 20 old men speaking to young children separates me from Adrian'. Books like this, the high culture they carry, the tradition of classical learning that is bestowed on them help that thin thread to go on running through our days and, hopefully for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Within You, Without You","review":"Yourcenar is interested in sensibility and so here you get the Roman world as experienced through the eyes of Hadrian. Historical fiction at its most personal.

I've never read anything else about Hadrian so I don't know how true to life this account is but however real or imagined this Hadrian is Yourcenar pulls this off unbelievably well.

The prose is liquid and evocative, and grows on one as one reads. The pagan morality of Hadrian offends, but as Roman emperors go he was a success. By the time I finished reading this, I was interested in doing more reading in Roman history.

It did; you had to do things by the book or you lost the game, period. These games weren't as fond of violence as the King's Quest series (why was that marketed to kids, anyway?), and usually achieved their primary goal.The writing, though, was atrocious; the plots were fairly dull and formulaic (save for PQ2, which was only formulaic) and the games had almost no replayability. The series as a whole hit its nadir with Police Quest 4, a project embarrassingly used by former LAPD chief Daryl Gates as a way of demeaning the press and defending his own scattershot record.Yech. For story, go for Space Quest or Quest for Glory; if you can find them, the Conquest titles (Camelot and Longbow, the latter featuring Robin Hood) are terrific, much better than this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first review","review":"They need to include a manual with swat two as it confused the ---- out of me. But over all the series was good. It made you face the situations realistically and was challenging while at the same time entertaining.

Eating Raoul is Paul Bartel's second greatest film. Loaded with humor and fast paced it should not be missed by anyone. Paul Bartel's Best movie is 1972s Private Parts but this one is a very close second.

A must for any fan of Crowded House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stuff","review":"A Crowded House fan from the beginning I was very anxious to hear this album. I was not disappointed and absolutely love it! These songs, for one reason or another (as outlined in the liner notes) didn't make the final cut on the original albums. Makes me wonder why! \\"My Telly's Gone Bung\\" is hilarious. \\"I Am In Love,\\" \\"Sacred Cow,\\" \\"You Can Touch,\\" \\"Help Is Coming,\\" \\"I Love You Dawn,\\" \\"Left Hand\\" and, actualy, every track on here is good. I read today an interview with Neil Finn and he said they had enough songs left over for a \\"volume 2\\" if they wanted to do it. This album may not be for everyone, but it made this CH/Neil Finn fan very very happy indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left overs taste better than the original meal","review":"I, for one, did not lament the end of Crowded House too much because I am a Neil Finn fan and there was no doubt he would go on making great music, with or without his Enz or Crowdies bandmates. \\"Together Alone\\" is their crowning glory, so it was best that they went out with that. Having said that, however, basking in the afterglow isn't too bad. I already own or have heard these songs on various singles or fanclub CDs . . . but to have them all in one place, they sound better than ever. The three TA outakes are great, as are \\"Recurring Dream\\" (version two), \\"I Love You Dawn,\\" and \\"Anyone Can Tell.\\" I've never cared for \\"Dr. Livingston,\\" but this improved version is better . . . If anything, it just makes me more eager for Mr. Finn's second solo CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odds and Sods Crowded House collection a keeper","review":"Although it doesn't hold together like their best albums this collection of b sides and unreleased tracks is a fairly consistent work. A number of the tracks here would have fit snugly on the CH albums and done credit to them.Is this collection worth it? It depends on how much of a fan you are of CH. This probably isn't the collection to buy as an introduction to the band. How are the songs? I'm in Love, Anyone Can Tell, Dr. Livingston and a handful of others are of top drawer songs. I Love You Dawn, although lyrically weak, has a solid melody. With the exception of Paul Hester's humorous but weak Telly tune, this is a solid collection and well worth adding to a CH collection. I'd suggest Together Alone and Woodface first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Together Alone At Last","review":"In typical Capitol fashion, it took the label awhile to decide whether they even wanted to bother with more Crowded House music. (Most of the rest of the world had this CD at the tail end of 99.) The b-sides here largely benefit from the mixing they have received.Perhaps you never suffered through the movie Tequila Sunrise to hear the new Crowdies song (Recurring Dream), or saw the band live (Left Hand), or bought a CD single (I Am In Love). Now you don't have to. I'm sure in some dark corner of the archives there are some bad Neil Finn songs lurking. But you're not going to find them here. The band passed for eight years almost without notice through the music scene in this country and the songs here, while not classics, really make you wonder why."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic Finns","review":"I managed to pick up this CD in the UK when it was released in February. Don't expect anything breakthrough, new-style, earth-shattering. This is classic Crowded House - crooning Finn brothers, interesting harmonies, curious lyrics. Well, that's no surprise as this isn't new material - it's just previously unreleased. So as an album, it's kind of...disjointed...Clearly the songs were not written in the same period or mindset. The bonus interview at the end is great - Neil Finn expresses himself well, and it's a fairly good interview. If you're a first-time Crowded House album buyer, or if you're looking for a cohesive album, I suggest Temple of Low Men instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality finn","review":"It's the songs that critics don't like that I love on this album. One of the main things about Crowded House was their sense of humour along with their melancoly thoughts. My telly's gone bung is a highlight. Too many people take music too seriously, your telly blowing up really is a serious issue. I love you Dawn is beautiful. Dr Livingstone is a bit weak and I don't believe an original recording of Private Universe was necessary but all in all, bloody good stuff. With Crowded House you know what you're getting. Classy cover as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Private Universe!","review":"With the inclusion of this c.d. into my Crowded House collection, I now boast of possessing three separate and greatly varying versions of Private Universe. All three are transcendant blissful recordings. The inclusion of this simple, sparsley arranged version (no small feat with Youth at the production controls!) is a wonderful compliment to the original release. The third version, incidentally is a Finsbury Park Italian manufactured bootleg where Maori musicians fill out the end percussion groove splendidly. Neil! Neil! Neil! This is far and away your masterpiece. Grace us with ten more versions of this gorgeous song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shallow. Then hello.","review":"Amazingly enough I agree with both the good and the bad reviews. At the time of this release CT were obviously starting their move towards an easier poppish sound almost bordering on - dare I say - \\"new age\\". This album pales - in my opinion - when compared with both \\"Treasure\\" and my beloved \\"Head over heels\\".Yet it's quite listenable, and as I'm aging (I am roughly the same age as the CT themselves) I find myself following a similar path as a listener, moving towards a more relaxed kind of sound and enjoying \\"pop\\" tunes more and more. And, despite the horrible time CT's were allegedly having back then, they sound as pure as ever and Liz's voice is - as always - fantastic.Anyway this album was well worth buying for \\"Carolyn's Fingers\\" alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aural representation of feminine beauty.","review":"Perhaps the single most beautiful (and easily accessible) work of art I have encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"high-quality CT","review":"I have all of the CT's CDs and this is one of my favorites, although it is not usually regarded by true fans and critics alike as their best work. It's maybe not as good as Treasure or Victorialand, but has an aural quality that sets is apart from the rest. It's pure easy listening, Cocteau Twins-way. Even if Guthrie was stoned at the time, the music conveys a sense of happiness without falling in the New Age clichet. Not surprisingly, many of these songs have been used as a musical background for commercials in Europe and the States. To be more precise, BBK is \\"ambient\\" music, i.e. a good musical comment to repeated actions and oft-visited places: an airplane take-off, or to a nap. Given the dismal quality of much of today's \\"altenative\\" music, this is quite an achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great albums of the late 80's !!!","review":"For those who enjoy a melodic, polished and nicely produced sound, look no further. Elizabeth Fraser's vocals are a perfect counterpoint to the swirling power guitars of Robin Guthrie and bassist Simon Raymonde. The album is full of the quiet storm of introspection and is like no other sound you've heard before (or after). You won't be disappointed with Blue Bell Knoll, which is the best sound the Cocteau Twins ever put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Bliss","review":"This is the third album I have bought of the group. I had the good fortune to find one copy of it at my local bookstore. I had not plan to buy all the album in chronological order so I cannot compare it to the others. However my instincts tell me this is a important album for the group. Elizabeth Fraser's vocals sounded as though they are just beginning to define the Twins sound. If your are collecting Twins albums I suggest this is a must to have. Winning tracks for me are \\"Athol-Brose\\",\\"Carolyn's Fingers\\",\\"For Phoebe Still a Baby\\". And it is the song \\"Cisco Buff\\" that makes me yearn for places I have never been before. A typical reaction to a lot of Cocteau Twins songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their First Lousy record","review":"This was the first REALLY LOUSY record by the Cocteau Twins, and a portent of what was to follow. The guitarist was messed up on heroin at the time, and the whole record has this fuzzy distant zombie feel to it.The compositions are dreary, the arrangements are mediocre, the mixing sounds like it's being done through cotton balls. The only redeeming quality is the title track. The rest of it is useless.After this fiasco, they had a few nice moments in Heaven to Las Vegas, and Kisses. Almost everything prior to this record is utterly amazing, with the possible exception of Garlands, which suffered from their style not being complete and having a different bass player.Avoid this one. Get Treasure or (if you can find it) Pink Opaque or if you insist on bliss- victorialand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugh disappointment","review":"As a long time and avid fan of this little known progressive band I inserted this DVD into the player with great anticipation. Within minutes after the start I was overwhelmed with even greater disappointment. The audio quality is equal to a poor bootleg. Although the video quality is very good, the audio track is does not match the video. The audio and visual are out of sync with each other and the results are very distracting. I was forced to turn it off before the first song ended. Maybe it gets better after a while but I guess I'll never know since I do not possess the patience to go any further.I refuse to believe that a band of such high standards (as evidenced by the quality of all their other CD's) willingly gave their approval for such junk to be issued under their name. What a shame . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prog rock","review":"I have been a fan of Pendragon for years, and I can highly recommend this dvd to any fan of progressive rock.

I would splurge and get this edition because you get a live concert cd recorded in Toronto in 1983. The negative of this is Iggy must have had a cold because his throat sounds messed up, the quality of the recording is rather bootleggish, but still after a few listens you get used to the negatives and get into it.

I especially like the fact that until the end we are unable to fully understand the plot and know who is bad or nice. The other side of Coruscant was also fascinating. If you have not read the preceeding books you can begin by this one, but of course you would missed the amazing 7 first books."},{"rating":"2","title":"jedi apprentice- great books!","review":"I am totaly adicted to this series.

An old friend of Qui-Gon's is being stalked by a vicious bounty hunter, and our Jedi heroes find themselves outmatched and outwitted at nearly every turn. After a climactic battle in the snow, The Deadly Hunter ends on a cliff-hanger to rival any that has come before.As usual, Watson is at her best in showing the dynamic between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Ironically, young Obi-Wan looks down his nose at the cafe dive Qui-Gon's friend owns. It's a pity Watson didn't know about Dexter's dive when writing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't include wireless adapter","review":"The title is misleading.

Plus, this game has all the pokemon, but you have to trade to get them all. I have played it in both english and Japenese ( people have translated it) and it is a quite decent game. Plus you can get National Dex so all 386 pokemon can be displayed once you have 60 pokemon and challenge the Elite Four twice with more powers and techniques the seond time.

They also have 7 pokemon islands which have pokemon not seen in the original blue, red, and green. The only reason that I dont give this game a full 5 stars is because many pokemon u see in johto are not in this game, so how do you beat the game.

It's very nicely played and although my Italian is pretty weak, the songs convey a lot of feeling. These guys are great musicians and I may have to investigate their back catalog.

The only thing that keeps this album from being perfect is Ian Andersons dominant vocal presense. His reniasance/rock style can be a little overbearing and intrusive for a modern day rock listener. Gentle Giant seems to pull off the madrigal/ rock fusion in a much more natural manner, and never seems out of place. Tull can't quite make it work, but you'll not be disapointed, there's still great music and Anderson shines more than he flops.

My personal favorite track is Black Magic Dancer, but there is not a dog on the entire album.This album has been difficult to locate in the form of a CD.

'Ark theme' starts this disc with a tremendous energetic theme with a big ending. The rest of the score is emotionally driven by pianomelodies and outbursts of bombast.

It is a nice case. Quality material, appearance, and construction, and it will probably out last the camera.My only downside to the case is that it fits the camera perfectly. Why is that a downside? Well, there isn't room for much else. The strap has to dangle from the outside because there is so little room in the case area. Also, if you use the little pockets to store your extra SD cards and such, the only way you will get something out of the pocket is if you take out the camera and dig with your finger.Admittedly, my fingers are not the dainty fingers of a lady, but I'm no linebacker either.All that being said, I do still like the case and will be using it often. The overly-snug fit is a minor annoyance compared to the quality protection the case gives my camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a style for everyone","review":"I admit that I am rather reliant on tablature (for better or for worse), so this style of learning by observation and hearing has proved to be challenging, which is not a bad thing!

I didn't even bother to rent it, I watched it on Scifi. It looked exciting, but I was wrong. The Octopus itself hardly moved at all. Its tentacles were the ones that did the moving. Even if the theory of the movie was right, the octopus being swept from the sea, that would've been wrong if it killed people because Octopuses aregentle creatures and do not grow to enormous sizes. Even the first Octopus made more sense and was a lot more exciting. The only reason why I give it two stars is for the acting. Otherwise this below sea level bugdet film is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring and more Boring!!!","review":"What were they thinking, after the not so bad original they create this crap. I usually love giant animals on the attack movies, even fake looking ones but this is at the bottom of the barrel. When I got this I figured the Octopus is smaller than its giant counterpart so I was hoping for some really gruesome kills but instead I got ridiculously long attacks where the characters survive and all it is, is the rubber tentacles wrapping around them. I don't sense any pain or fear. This octopus just pops up from nowhere and attacks and usually fails. What made this even more stupid is the crappy acting and the focus on the Police characters, it hardly has anything to do with the less threatening Octopus. Boring and crappy, avoid it at all cost. Trust me I'm a person who likes Cemetery Gates so believe me, this is horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty silly....","review":"I watched this movie because I felt obligated as a fan of the 1950's killer octopus movies. This movie should only be watched on a system that has a working fast-forward button. It has a few good moments, like where the octopus attacks the Statue of Liberty, but not much else. What actually sold me on watching it was the fact that monster is supposed to attack NYC. Be warned-no one in this film was ever near NY. The whole thing looks like it was filmed at a theme park using customers as actors. No violence, gore, or nudity. There may have been swearing but I was fast-forwarding past the human scenes. The monster looks about as good {or bad} as the monster of the week on Baywatch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes bad is just bad","review":"I see a lot of movies of this type. I can't stop myself.

I didn't think so much of the first one, but what little did I know? The first one was a masterpiece compared to this film. The enormous octopus is basically a stalker in some strange places. You'll wonder aloud, \\"How did it get there?\\"Also, the supposed New york location is indeed laughable. I didn't notice if this is another Canadian production, but it is obviously not New York. Okay, they throw in the obligatory stock footage, including one shot of the World Trade Center.The biggest fault has to be that it runs long. You think it's dead (The explosion seems of the thermonuclear variety) but wait! Then there is the exciting sequence of people you don't care about escaping the collapsed Lincoln tunnel, I think I almost suffocated.Oh well, when is Octopus 3 coming out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they even waste the film?","review":"Either the people that put this movie out, think that we are all mindless morons, or they think we really like stupid movies. Either way you lose if you buy this movie. This movie has very little in the way of a plot. The so called actors don't know how to act.

The press reviews favorably reviewed the clear high end sound I like, with some mumblings about inadequate sound depth.The system is nicely designed, and its quality is in line with its price. With the new sound card, the highs were nice and clear, the bass adequate, if a bit muddy, and the midrange sound was thin and raspy.

I actually considered walking out in the middle. There are basically no special effects in the second half, and also, the dialouge is so auful it actually is funny. To top it off, the second half is more farfeched than the rest of the movie. Dennis Quaid walks from Washington D.C. to New York in a few days, which would be rediculous anyway but it's in the worst storm in history.

The plot is trite, the script is arbitrary in manner and quite poorly written. The acting was very bad with not one A list actor to support this farce of a movie. Worst of all everything in this movie is scientifically unsound, a cartoon of sorts with perhaps better than average special effects. You see this movie has an agenda, a political agenda that accuses a certain political group of over consumption and willfull disregard of homeless people and humanity! WOW, what a burden to carry.

All I'll say is that it's a fun movie if you don't take it too seriously.The video quality of the Blu-Ray edition is really good, good enough that you don't notice it, you just feel like you're in the action. It's as good as being at the theater. The sound quality is also good, but not perfect; in places it's muddy, particularly when there's a lot of weather howling sounds. Dialogue is crisp and easy to follow, but this doesn't drive your subwoofer as much as you'd expect given the subject matter, and some of the sound just doesn't pop like you'd figure. It's not bad, it's just not as good as you'd hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review: The day after tomorrow...","review":"Action, adventure, quick thinking are all inclusive of this film starring Dennis Quaid, Because of the constant Burning of fossil fuels can only lead to one conclusion - weather gone ravenous.The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Special Effects","review":"A movie with good special effects, although the plot was corny.

The dynamic of father and son provided an excellent chance for the writers and directors to have a truly dynamic story, but alas it failed to deliver.The special effects were awesome. If that's all you want from a movie (Giant tornadoes, snow-covered landslides and mountains of water filling the streets of coastal America) you'll be pleased with this movie.If, however, you want a plot, storyline and viable conclusion, you will be (as I was) greatly disappointed.For a movie of this type to work, you have to care about the characters.

It managed to start some public conversations about the greenhouse-effect at least somewhere in the globe but the enviromental message in \\"The Day After Tommorrow\\" got finally buried under its stupidness. No wonder, unfortunately. This is exactly something that could have been expected from the same director who has made such rubbish as \\"universal soldier\\" and \\"the Indepencence day\\". Unlike many other foreign directors Emmerich has found his way to stay in the big budget business by adding each time some korny and sentimental patriotism in his films, often directly out from the mouth of the president himself. There\`s lots of holes in the script which can\`t be filled not even by the massive special effects. Maybe I\`m just too old( yet still a teenager) but I just can\`t get excited by stuff like some crappy animated CGI-wolfs anymore. In this context, the first pictures of the gigantic wave where quite entertaining though."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Could Be Worse!","review":"Sure, the scenario isn't completely convincing, but the idea of a catastrophe happening overnight can't really be expected to be.

But about 30 minutes into the movie, I became bored and after about an hour, I was fast forwarding the DVD trying to get to something good.The special effects were sophomoric, the characters flat, and the ending was a welcome relief. With stars like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, and Jake Gyllenhaal, I had hopes that the acting would be good. I was wrong. Their performances were one-dimensional and predictable.They wasted a lot of money and talent on this dud.

Unfortunately, the way it unfolded was too dark and depressing. And not in a thought provoking way.No sharp insights. No real ecological/enviromental revelations.

Life is simply too short. I can, however, envision how the picture's script was written: The writers sat around watching bad disaster movies, a la MST3K, while drinking vast quantities of beer. They copied every bit of corny dialog from every low-brow hollywood disaster opera, and then ground out their own script in this fermentatious atmosphere. The only line missing is \\"We'll attack at noon, Earth Time.\\" Wait, I think that one's in there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"How anyone can spend 125 million dollars on this load of rubbish is amazing. Apart from the special effects (which are only so-so) the whole movie is just one long string of boring cliches plundered from penny dreadfuls and your everyday soaps. Global warming (whether or not it is caused by us) is a horrifying threat and deserves a much more intelligent treatment than this. Then the movie might have done some good. Now it is just one more excuse for the ignorant to shrug off our impending doom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"This movie is utterly unremarkable. I reccomend it to no one. I enjoyed films such as Independance Day and even parts of Godzilla. But this movie has virtually no redeeming qualities. We have seen special effects by now. Recent films (War of the Worlds, Lord of the Rings, The Island) have shown us that special effects can be used to augment good storytelling to make compelling films.In this case however, the effects stand alone, and there aren't nearly enough of them. There are probably a grand total of 10 minutes of \\"shock and awe\\" time in this movie, worth catching on HD HBO, but certainly not worth the price of a DVD or movie ticket.The actors are not to blame here, Quaid, Holm,and Gyllenhall clearly did what they were asked. However the story and dialogue are so flat I never particularly cared what happened to any of the characters.I was expecting a fun sci-fi effects romp, which I got for about 10-15 minutes of this film. The rest was just ghastly, ghastly filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swoosh - cyclone in the toilet","review":"I usually avoid \\"catastrophy\\" movies and thankfully I saw this as a rental on a discount. The characters are uninteresting at best and mostly irritatingly stupid.I'd say that this movie combines two elements; catastrophy movie and a teen movie - you know those movies you didn't go near even when you actually were a teenager.Stay clear of this turkey, it's one of the worst waste and major money thrown at making a movie with an idiotic theme and a majorly irritating look and feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please...","review":"This is the end of the world as told through the lense of the most liberal production team in Hollywood.

I ended up watching it late at night on pay-per-view.While watching this film, I was impressed with the images of Manhattan being flooded and everyone rushing to the public library. I thought the concept for the movie was cool, but Dennis Quaid was very unbelievable.Dialogically, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. The script was plain awful. The lines were very plain and bland.Even worse than that, these wolves that were added to the film did not fit and were completely unneccessary.I am only giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because I thought the imagery was very enjoyable.My advice: put it on mute, and look at the awesome images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for an \\"end of the world\\" movie","review":"Overall a good movie.

I actually like it more than Independence Day which I felt was way over acted in some scenes. But anyway, the special effects were awesome! All that water comming into New York all at once. And the ship that floats down flooded city streets. Some of the plot is based on fact. There are bouies in the ocean that measure currents, ocean temps. & a lot of other stuff. Scientists do drill for those I cores they show at the beginning of the movie. But I doubt whether a person with an arm load of ice core containers could make the jump Queid does. I'm currently reading a book about the little ice age that ended in the 1800's & that book nrings out a warming trend that caused the NAO to go haywire & cause the little ice age. So..... That's what movies often do, they excite us & cause us to take note of things around us. Maybe enough interest will develop to do something."},{"rating":"2","title":"well.....actually....I liked this one (shrug)","review":"Maybe I'm just a sucker for Dennis Quaid's smile (shrug)....but I actually liked this DVD. I'd heard over and over what a dud it was from my co-workers, but, since I'm not apt to make my choices based on movie reviewers, I gave it a go.

I figured, \\"What could possibly go wrong with Dennis Quaid, Ian Holme and Jake Gyllenhal as stars in this picture?\\" What started out as a great white hope ended up as a snow white mess! The dialogue had me wishing I hadn't bought the supersize popcorn and soda. The movie had no convincing drama and the characterization was tired and worn. I was hoping for the next big special fx sequence to freeze everyone to death just to end the movie. This lame horse of digital wizadry was not thoughtful or provocative. In fact, it left me as cold and blank as.....New York in an ice age."},{"rating":"1","title":"We couldn't destroy the environment if we tried!","review":"I'll just say a couple of things about this movie...I enjoyed the special effects. The story was silly and the acting wasn't all that interesting. And as to the idea that humans are going to cause this disaster, it's nonsense. God made this entire universe, and to think that we even COULD destroy the environment if we were actively trying to is the height of humanistic arrogance. We couldn't destroy the environment if we tried. Sure, the environment may change. But it won't be because of us.Don't believe me? Then lets put our heads together and try to destroy the ozone layer...can't be done. The sun creates ozone when its rays hit the earth's atmosphere. More sun = more ozone. Less sun = less ozone. So to destroy our ozone layer, we'd have to shut off the sun. Anyone up for that?Same with global warming.

Seeing this movie I seriously began to believe the world might come to an end, not from global warming but from an economy crashing because of millions of dollars being spent on horrible movies (ed wood must be rolling over in his grave for not recieving an oscar for plan 9). But please, I beg you, if you are to purchase this movie you will be contributing to the decline of western civilization, and could very well assist in the crash of global economies and who knows, maybe it would cause wolves to chew their way through metal fences to escape from zoos.

What was the Dennis Quaid character going to do when he got to the library?2. The Dennis Quaid character walked 40 miles in -400 degree weather.3. The Oil Tanker can navigate through a city under water?4. There is NO WAY a storm that big can form in three days. Everything we saw in the movie would happen over millions of years, no days.5. When the ice storm chased the Dennis Quaid character into the building, he started a small fire. Wouln't the fire suck up all the air?6. The fire wasn't big enough to survive the ice storm in the first place.7.

The downside to that is that when people try to make a point about something most people do not believe in nor care about, it is the formula for a bad movie and this movie is no exception.This movie did so little to draw you in and keep your attention. Yes it is based off of science fiction, but I did not feel the realness in anything they did. When the Alien Ship was advancing on NYC in the movie ID4, you felt it.Anyway, this movie is horrible. I do think it was a great concept as many of us like to see things destroyed.

We're bad, bad, BAD overconsumers, and now we must pay the price. Best of all, at the end of the movie the U.S. Vice President (formerly depicted as a meany) is humbled & grovels for forgiveness to 3rd world countries who \\"graciously\\" took in ice age refugees, in exchange for the U.S. forgiving billions of dollars in 3rd world debt.Made me want to run out, buy a Hummer, start smoking, and shellac my hair with Aquanet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"¿Have you seen that all the action is in LA and NY?

We had leftist political statements pounding us in the face before we could move! Americans crossing the Mexican border was a good example. I guess I might add, I'm not American (I'm Australian. Apparently our country did well in the climate shift) but I felt that the scriptwriter was only interested in engaging in political point scoring. More power to him, I suppose, but this bugged me.

Global warming triggers the onset of a new ice age. It was a real thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly appaling B-movie about a global apocalypse. Why?","review":"Lacking the emotional intensity of a goldfish, The Day After Tomorrow pushes itself into the category of crowd pleasing blockbuster except that the crowd in my cinema were abhorred by the atrocious film.Yes, the effects were amazing, but the CGI wolves looked so utterly stupid I lost interest with the rest of the film. The acting was hammy and the dialogue both chichéd and dull. Any film containing the line 'You have to tell her how you feel' really doesn't deserve to exist.Save yourself a few bucks and don't see this convoluted mess of a film. It's $100,000,000 that could have been better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great special effects and that's about it","review":"What else can you say? The plot is simply bad science fiction. The ending as the vice president apologizes for whatever it is that he is apologizing for, is simply stupid. Despite the fact that ice ages have happened before with no input from humankind, this iceage was allegedly caused solely by human beings.This movie is not in any way politically incorrect. It is the epitome of political correctness. The message?? The VP, who is a clone of Cheney, is a stupid evil and ignorant man. He represents all of the stupid evil and ignorant humans who are causing global warming. What is politically incorrect about that? You can read that opinion in any newspaper on any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"The FX in this movie are excellent (except the CG wolves). The storyline was cliche' but stll pretty good overall (I seen much worse recently) and the science was very Hollywood but loosely accurate. The global warimng issue is very real as well as other topics (money is god). Overall I enjoyed this film and I will be getting it on DVD when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When I first saw the commercials, I thought the movie would be great. It was an OK movie, but it didn't at all reach my expectations of what I thought it would be.The part that really ruined it for me was the wolves. I mean, come on. Wolves won't suddenly become savage beasts roaming through the cities, attempting to eat people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning picture and sound quality!","review":"Fox has really done a good job encoding The Day After Tomorrow. The AVC encoded video really shines and is much better than the VC-1 codec that WB uses. The sound is off the charts as well for this title. If you are looking to get into Blu-ray, this is definitely the demo disc you need to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Score, but over-the-top story","review":"Okay, we've all heard about global warming by now, but this movie seriously blows it way out of proportion. Realistically, ice ages take place over the course of several thousand years of gradual climate shifts, not in what? 9 days? Please... This film will likely be seen as a great heralding warning to humanity by the enviromental kooks, a warning of a threat that is not at all even existant. But if you check REAL science at the door and put on your pseudo-scientific eyeglasses, the movie is good fun, and what a resemblance that vice president has to VP Cheney--gee golly whiz-I wonder what THAT was implying? These evil Bambi-killing conservatives--we're all out to get you! Anyhow, the real save for this movie is the majestic score. Herald Kloser never fails to blow me away with his compositions. My advice is to buy the soundtrack, rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"This film is nearly entertaining. Dennis Quaid is almost likable. You almost don't root for the deaths of all the characters. The film is a good work of propaganda, the special effects are dizzying, and they were one of the few things that kept me in the theatre. I still drove my gas guzzler home after the film, and I'm not worried about giant landbased hurricanes freeze-drying me.I would say see this movie in the theatre, since its only attributes are the special effects, and a home entertainment system sytem cannot deliver that part of the movie properly. Or better yet, skip this flick entirelyIf you are interested in the real global warming debate, do so in the academic field, not in the movie theatre. Hollywood needs to stop producing films that are based just on special effects, while avoiding plot, character development, or other elements of cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolves?","review":"This movie has a plot, but it is greatly rushed. Plus (note that I study wolves) the wolves in it are digital and incorrectly portraid. For in the movie they are villians while in reality, they would much rather run away from a human if possible. Anyway, the movie has good effects, but acting is not at its prime. Two stars really sums up the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew I'd give Ronald Emmerich this many stars?","review":"This is not the best acted, and it's certainly not the best scripted film I've ever seen. But for the first time, one of Mr. Emmerich's offerings was so involving visually, that I was able to overlook the giant size plot holes, and the characters that seemingly came out of a box somewhere. This isn't any less ludicrous that Independence Day, or certainly Godzilla, but for once, the images were powerful enough to let me power my brain down for the afternoon and just sit back and watch the pretty colors.Do not go into this movie expecting high art. But, in Gene Siskel's old maxim, it is more interesting than a documentary of the actors having lunch, and it's from that perspective that my inner film geek finds peace with his enthusiam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Effects","review":"The Day After Tomorrow has some of the most amazing special effects I've ever seen. The cast does an amazing job with what they have to work with,(Quaid and Gyllenhaal do a wonderful job as well as new comer Emmy Rossum). It does have some pretty funny moments as well,( Americans crossing into Mexico illegaly.) The script could be better as well as some parts of the story line. Altogether though it is a wonderful movie that I would recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun, But Some Bits Just Have to Be Made Fun Of!!!","review":"Ok, so this is a fun, good movie to see and even to own, with great special effects, and good acting, but i mean oh my goodness, thier are some very, funny things here.

I like sentimental movies. And I even like Dennis Quaid in sentimental movies, witness my love affair with The Rookie (2002). So when I say I could have lived without seeing The Day After Tomorrow, it's not just Quaid-bashing or too-hip-to-watch-a-tear-jerker posing.Yes, the special effects were something in this film's corner, but the preachiness about global warming, the far-fetched plot, and the over-the-top acting by virtually every character left me cold (sorry about that one).Seriously, though, had I paid full price to see this one in the theatre I'd have been peeved."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAH!","review":"Yeah, i went to go watch this movie today. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Dennis Quaid warns the Vice president that global warming is a problem and could disrupt the atlantic current, which would ultimately cause a \\"cooling\\" effect in a couple thousand years. It turns out, it happens in a couple of days or something and the north part of usa becomes alaska. he saves his kid, blah blah blah. funny part of the movie is when southern america evacuates to mexico, then mexico decides to close their borders to the usa... very ironic isn't it-- funny too! the entire audience started clapping and cheering when that happened. too predictable and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be Viewed In High Schools.","review":"If I did not know all that I do about Global Warming I would have never believed what I was watching but I do and it was very realistic.Sadly, future generations must be aware of what is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalyptic!","review":"I always have it in my mind that the end of our world will be from extreme weather events, and this movie brings that to life!

It tries to make astatement about the environment and how we need to change our ways.That's true, but it's still not a great movie. Good special effects but by the time all is said and done, it's rather dull. I guess the director or writer felt there's only much you can do withstorms they decided to throw some hungry attack wolves for excitement.The two stars is for special effects.Side Point: Doesn't the actor who plays Denis Quaid's son look like Woody from Toy Story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny Movie that was on the verge of being Boring!","review":"I didn't expect much going in (Emmerich Film!), but I at least expected to be entertained and entranced by the special effects. In truth, all the SFX you see on the previews are what you see when watching the movie. The only difference being you have to sit through a long....two hours of horrendously written mumbo-jumbo talk and bad acting (people in the theater were actually laughing at the actors everytime they said something stupid, which was practically in every scene). The only reason for two stars is that the effects are pretty good and look epic on the big screen. If I were you I would wait to rent this on Dvd. I'm not usually harsh on movies and rarely give them lower than three stars, but this no-brain stinker deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, it stinks! And I agree with it's political agenda!","review":"First let me say that I like the fact that the filmmakers are bringing evironmental concerns to the masses. Secondly, let me say that this is a sorry excuse for a movie. This movie is nothing more than a young love story spiked with some multi-million dollar computer graphics. It's so predictable and full of cliche's you could almost lip sync the movie without ever having seen it before. All the characters are these unbelievable benevolent hollywood hero sterotypes that could make a person ill.To sum it up, the effects are kinda cool, but everything else is complete trash. So why even pretend to have a plot? Why not just have special effects scenes with subliminal evironmental messages?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is really, really bad","review":"This movie is really bad, I mean \\"Showgirls\\" bad. Don't believe me? The premise is a fast-forward ice age that basically occurs overnight. So, it's certainly high on the believability factor. And the culprit? Of course, it's global warming and all the selfish human beings who brought it about. And, oh yeah, Mexico becomes a safe-haven for Americans and we have to beg THEM to come into THEIR country. And if you think that's bad, just wait until you see the acting.The only part worth watching was when a reporter gets dusted by a flying billboard flung through the air by an LA twister. It was great - almost as good as the T-Rex eating the lawyer in Jurassic Park. My advice, watch that part then turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love disaster movies this is the one...","review":"I really enjoy watching movies of natural disaster and what people do to get through it. I think it is great movie and is one that I would watch numerous times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with Caution","review":"The 2 stars are for the f/x which were, for the most part, great. However the rest of the film is just one big, sloppy mess. Dumb story, horible dialogue, overwraught direction. This flick has some good folks in it too - it's a shame they are terribly wasted. Maybe if you watch it drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kyoto?","review":"The special effects were great and the movie was ejoyable to watch. The story left a lot to be desired. I couldn't even count the number of times I was thinking \\"you couldn't do that!\\" This was obviously a politically motivated film with the emphasis on signing the Kyoto Treaty."},{"rating":"2","title":"not to bad","review":"ok seeing the previews of this I was expecting massive destructive movie with lots of action and chaos. Amazingly enough, theres only a few scenes of that in this movie. no joke, 80% of this movie is about a father trying to reach his son in frozen NY and his son trying to win a girlfriend over. Actually, I just realized, this movie resembles Titanic so much. The only problem with that is that it should of shown more destruction and not have most of the focus in the United States. We see Los Angeles destroyed (yet everyone runs south towards the tornados) and NY covered in water then frozen. Was Canada completely lost? What about Europe or any place else? Yeah I know in Independance Day they didn't show too much other nations getting destroyed but lets see the Effiel Tower summerged or something. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't exactly what I expected, it is worth a watch though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in Science","review":"This movie has a real chance of becoming a cult classic -- yes, it's just that different. The Day After is probably best seen hung-over. Here's the plot: global warming affects the Atlantic currents (possible) and that affects the temperature (possible) which causes the world to delve into an ice age in a matter of days, sending us all the citizens of the Northern Hemisphere begging for shelter in the Third World (possible if you drink enough). Every home should have a copy. And, they say our math and science status continually slips! Just wait till the world sees this baby......."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word...Lame","review":"The Day After Tomorrow isn't a bad film; it is an incredibly weak film. There are some nice special effects but those are too few and far between to carry the movie. The only saving grace of the movie is Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhall. Both are good actors but have given better performances. The movie could have easily been written by pulling formula pieces out of a hat and I wouldn't be surprised if that is how it was written. If you think a movie like The Core is great, then you will love The Day After Tomorrow. If you must see it, save your money and rent it. Then you won't suffer the embarrassment of friends seeing it in your collection and asking \\"You bought that?!?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD EFFECTS BUT DISSAPOINTING.","review":"I have beendying to see this film since it came out in the cinema, i never actually sawit in the pictures just in case i couldn't stand it therefore would have to sit through it all. Anyway, i enjoy watching disaster films as they are made brilliantly and it makes you see what happens in real life, and of course there's a lot going on in them like dante's peak. I expected the same in this, it is nothing like i thought it was going to be though now i have had it. I suppose i will get a little bit used to it. Some of the actions in the film are great but others by looking at them you can tell they are computer imaged. Basically it's about tornadoes, a massive tsunmi sort of thing and there's a lot goin on but i didn't particuarlly like the acting in it or anything. Buy i would highly recommend it for the aduts."},{"rating":"1","title":"great special effects... not much else","review":"This movie has some terrific special effects, but it lacks real characters and an accurate plot.

I think it will take a little more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucky","review":"when i rented this on DVD i was expecting long action sequences with people fighting, punching and mayhem everywhere. No such thing. 90% of the movie was these scientists just studying the weather. the 5 minutes of violence in the whole movie wasn't even that cool. And those long boring library sequences, what's up w/ that? and the nerve of them trying to stick a teenage love story in with everything. I cant believe this grossed $185 million at the box office. Simply put, this movie kinda sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.Govindarajoo,Singapore","review":"This movie kept you on the edge of your seat! It really gives the viewer something to think about!

One of our future generations is going to have to pay for it eventually.As far as the rest of the movie goes there's just not much to say, it's pretty bad all the way around.

Not in my book. If you wanna present danger than get real wolves. Don't toy with my emotions. Also, it's kind of hard to believe that the scientist would plead to death about dealing with the situation and no one listens. Believe me, after all the things that the earth goes through you'd think that someone would listen. Anyway, That's what I have to grip about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy, but little else","review":"The visual effects in the movie are entertaining, but has little else to offer.The idea behind the movie is a bit perposterous, but it is an action movie. There are a few liberal political messages the movie sends, but at least it doesn't beat you over the head with them...much.The climax of the movie is a bit anti-climactic. When millions of people die, it seems a bit difficult getting involved in the struggles of a few individuals.If you're in the mood for some high action, give this a try...providing you've exhausted some of the other higher rated action films."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype - No Story","review":"\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is one of those movies that can be rated as worth seeing, as long as nothing else of importance is going on. This movie takes a big-budget, special-effects-filled look at what the world would look like if the greenhouse effect and global warming continued at such levels that they resulted in worldwide catastrophe and disaster, including multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age. The acting was sub-par, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I couln't stop laughing","review":"I have to say the CGI are great but the storyline is baaaaaaad. This movie includes all the stereotypes and clichés of a disaster movie and that makes it so previsible: The teens who, of course, will fall for one another at the end of the movie. The separated couple who, of course, will make things up. The father and son who barely know each other who, of course by the end, will have the strongest bond ever. The guy who will sacrifice his live for his friend... Hopefully, I'm not going to list them all here. Bad. Bad. Bad.

And I don't think it had to do with the actors personally, but the dialogue from the script and the story/plot line. It was hard to like or feel connected with any of the characters- and half the time you're thinking- what are they doing? I just wanted the movie to end and it felt like it never was going to. Some advice-Don't waste your time or money on this one-unless you're really desperate for a movie to rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick, awesome audio.","review":"The movie is nothing special as far as movies go. It does an ok job of showing the epic wrath of the storm it depicts while keeping a personal touch with the main characters. The acts of heroism seem quite insignificant considering the scope of the desctruction and severity of the situation and could probably been edited out as they didn't really seem to fit the movie for some reason.Where this movie really shines is it's superb DTS 5.1 audio track. If you're watching the movie without it you will be severely distanced from it and probably bored to death. If you're watching in 5.1 you'll be looking outside to see if the world is still there when it's over.If you have a DTS capable system I would recommend you at least rent this film just to hear it as it probably has the best audio of any film ever. Films like the new Star Wars films have exceptional audio clarity but their stories lacked the opportunity to do what Day After Tommorow has done with surround sound perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAY AFTER THIS GREAT MOVIE!!!","review":"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT,WHEN THE TORNADOS HITS L.A THE FILM GETS REALLY EXCITING.THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NEY YORK GETS A VERY HUGE RAIN STORM FILLING UP THE STREETS OF NEY YORK.THE RAIN IS SO HIGH THAT THE RAIN GOES UP TO PEOPLES KNEES.THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE OCEAN FLOODS NEW YORK .WITH GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND GREAT SUSPENSE THIS FILM IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfrozen Caveman Movie","review":"This is about as bad as it gets.

So, when he does a movie about a serious subject, where the action is a lot more slow paced, he fails again...Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is the worst of them all, it will take some months (or years) to producers around the world give him another chance in something so \\"big-budgeted\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Special Effects","review":"Although the message of the film is unrealistic as it is based on the fictitious global warming hype which is a weird theory by a number of scientists and greenpeace fanatics to get government grants and so forth, the special effects in this flick are very well done. The plot is the age-old, but usually always interesting father saves son story. And the dad (Dennis Quaid) who is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, does a great job in making this film more interesting despite a soso script. But the humanistic message in this movie is good and encouraging. This flick makes for a nice popcorn crunching evening at the fireplace with warm blankets all around. And once you see this movie you probably won't look forward to the winter anymore. But as mentioned before, the special effects are great as these show us unrealistic scenarios in this well-done disaster flick and it's fun to stimulate our imagination once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special effects are good but that's it","review":"I give this movie 2 stars only for the special effects. I think the story was a good idea-but not fully developed and ready to be a movie. I think they should have worked on it a little more. First the idea of how the ice age starts is a little bizzar-second the amount of time it took for the \\"ice age\\" to happen is completely impossible.

In the past, we have seen the White House blow up, the Emplre State Building incinerate & the Statue of Liberty beached. In real life we all saw The WTC disiintegrate before our very eyes on 9/11. This time the Statue of Lberty is up to her neck in ice. It's a new ice age. The vice president is the viilian, evil, wrong & as scary as he is in real life, along with his side-kick George the Dim. Actually, the president in the movie is more of a wimp than our real president. But he is just as stupid. This ice age will cover most of the northern hemisphere. So we all pack up & head south for Mexico. They greet us with open arms... just like we welcome their citizens traveling north today in real life. Right. 21/2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn off your brain and go for it!!!","review":"That's the only way to enjoy this mess. Thw worst thing in this kind of disaster flick is that the producers try to give reasonable scientific background to explain all the absurds that happens in the film! That's annoying!

Never saw something like that, it was so stupid that I must give credit to the producers. I laughed a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond belief","review":"This is the biggest piece of balderdash I've seen in a while. Environmentalists and climatologists everywhere must be having severe cases of mental diarrhea due to embarrassment from this remarkably absurd rip-off of scientific theories. It makes Night of the Living Dead look like science fact. I suppose if I had seen it on a huge screen the visuals might have been impressive but on a TV screen - forget it. The only thing that saves this loony tune waste is the always exceptional performance of Jake Gyllenhaal. In fact, I suspect the only people who should buy this DVD are die-hard Gyllenhaal fans and folks who think it might someday become one of those \\"its so bad its good\\" cult films. Otherwise, don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big surprise...","review":"All I can say to this movie is 'WOW!!!\\" I must admit I'm not usually into mainstream Hollywood movies but I love a good disaster flick, and this one doesn't disappoint.So okay, there is the predictable plot, carbon-copy characters and dialogue to make you squirm, but the special effects are amazingly brilliant. To see New York flooding and freezing over is an awe-inspiring site.This movie is made all the more poignant by the current destructive weather occur in the US and in other parts of the world. After viewing this you would have to ask yourself \\"Have we brought it on ourselves???\\"If you love a good disaster flick, you will enjoy Day After Tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path of the Human Race","review":"Day After Tomorrow should Not be considered a Science Fiction movie, rather a Drama of one possible future created by, probably the Animal with the shortest history on Earth, Man. Action sequences were well done. Dennis Quaid & Tobey Maguire do a great job. However there are a few badly written scenes, it's not perfect, hence 4 stars.I find the scenario quite believable. Definitely worth a rental, and if you are a fan of Science Fiction movies, probably worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars for special effects/graphics.","review":"The idea of this movie is called for. The effects of twisters in Los Angeles, CA, and tidal wave then freeze in New York, NY are worth the views. However the plot left me flat. Wish it would have showed more cities than it did. It did add a political, (if you will) statement of US citizens making tracks for the Mexican Border for normal warmth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with a Serious Message","review":"This is a very fun film to watch. Although at times you do need to suspend reality, who cares? That's what makes movies fun. The story line is gripping and you find yourself getting very involved in the characters.

I have watched it over and over and I always catch something I missed in the other viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Day It Opened ...","review":"... a truly remarkable film, on a visual scale, but, yes, the characters presented were rather one-dimensional. This, however, did not detract from my enjoyment of the film. Despite the political message of the piece, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is principally an event film -- a disaster flick in high-gloss packaging. Go expecting little more, and you should be easily entertained. Go expecting an Academy Award caliber film, and you'll probably be disappointed. Kudos to Dennis Quaid on another effortless performance, but the real star here are the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Unwatchable because of constant buffering.

There's no point of going into the story since there isn't much of one to describe, just that Denis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are wasted in their roles as a father and son who are caught in the middle of an end of the world-esque weather phenomina that catapaults the planet into chaos. Make no mistake that the CGI effects are a sight to behold, and the Day After Tomorrow can be taken as a guilty pleasure, but other than that it's as lame as it looks. Those who want a mindless escape may want to check it out, but even then you are better off with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Day After Tomorrow","review":"Excellent movie with a fantastic plot and out of this world special effects. The cast was just right for this movie they all shined together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressively Awful","review":"Wow. This movie was really, really awful. The story line is of course ludicrous, but even if you are able to completely suspend reality, it still is just a terribly put-together movie. The effects are hideous (what's with all the weird 'freezing' that happened to already solid objects as they..um..froze more, I guess?) and the entire direction was comical. The actors do a reasonable job, but the movie is so over-the-top bad that nothing can salvage it from the B-Movie status that it should have. It made independence day look like art.

Can't you have ONE movie without that claptrap thrown in?

Wacker refutes the title early on, explaining how he is going to reveal much more then posing techniques. He goes on to do little of this as well.

The actual track \\"The Snow\\" is a nice one, but basically this is all just sounds typical ambient-dance music with relatively uninteresting sounds and generic beats.

Lara devises a plot to flush out the would-be killer that is worthy of a Mary Higgins Clark novel.

I think not, just listen to Master's song 'Rabbit One' and take a wild guess as to which Collective Soul was born. Listen for guitar tone, variance, riffs, even vocal patterns throughout the Master's album. The only thing missing from Collective Soul right now is some inventiveness and Ginger Baker."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I have seen CS live four times and each time they were incredible. Unfortunately the raw energy and looseness that's on stage does not carry over on to their CDs. Dosage rocked pretty hard but Blender is a bunch of formula pop rock. Sounds like CS is playing it safe or listening to the wrong A&R folks. CS are loaded with talent, they just need to hook up with the right producer who can strip away all the studio effects and let them rip. How about Rick Rubin, or Billy Corgan who is probably searching for a new gig about now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dosage of poison!","review":"This is unfortunately the worst Collective Soul album to date. Extremely pop-ish; most of the sounds sound like Prince's b-side tracks. Lyrically the band has really took a turn for the worse; incorporating junior highschool name calling in their songs. Each song is only about 3 minutes long in length, which is a good thing, because a minute into each song you'll be wishing it had never started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold-Out","review":"In the music business, the term \\"Sold Out\\" can mean a good and bad thing. The first definition is in the context of a sold out concert. The second is when a band changes their music and style to sell. It is with this latter definition that I describe \\"Blender.\\" With Blender, Collective Soul has lost its cool hippy roots (singing about love and such), which have tapered away since \\"Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid,\\" and become a more Hanson or Blink 182 like band. I was extremely dissappointed in the album and call for a boycott to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"blender?","review":"collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers!

This time around, it seems as if the band is taking a step back in time to be more of an old-fashion rock-n-roll group, and this somehow doesn't seem to suit their instrumental or singing style. None of the songs I found were melodic or moving enough than their previous album \\"Dosage\\" (\\"Needs\\" was an amazing tune). Truly a dissapointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull them in with riffs and then some.","review":"Collective soul's guitar playing is still amazing. But it sounds like with this album somebody told them how big a hit their previous song Heavy from Dosage was and maybe their producer decided to mold some of their songs after it. It sounds like while they were playing around and creating new songs, they found a few riffs and decided to base their entire song all around a riff with uninspired sound in between the catchy riffs. I don't sense as much of an urgency in any of the songs as previously. Maybe it was too early for a new album, they could have taken some more time on their new songs. Their experimentation with new sounds comes out fine, but thats about it. Still, a piece of music is meant to communicate something, and with the right mood and the right track at the same time, each of these songs can be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Collective Soul album that should be avoided","review":"I own all 5 Collective Soul albums and would recommend all of them except Blender. Blender was a disappointment in that it did not bring anything new to the table. At the same time, the music is too \\"pop\\" sounding and the lyrics are silly.\\"shut your mouth, my mother said\\" - Vent\\"they scratch their heads they go what's he trying to say\\" - You Speak My Language\\"I think she tripped on reality\\" - Perfect DayThe lyrics of other albums are much more profound. The music too is more of a mixture of rock, jazz and blues while blender is more like New Kids on the Block."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collective Soul blends again","review":"Since Collective Soul has so many talents, why not use them? The groove laden \\"Skin\\" and \\"Vent\\" start the album. Other standout songs include the classic-rock influenced songs \\"Tokyo,\\" \\"Perfect Day,\\" and \\"Why Part 2,\\" which adds punch with a stinging riff. \\"You Speak My Language\\" is bordering on metal, and is packed with energy from the vocals too. It doesn't really fit with the other songs, but it shows that Collective Soul can rock hard with the best of them. \\"Turn Around\\" is a pretty, folk influenced song like their song \\"Run\\" from Dosage. The album doesn't show a lot of range with the running times, and that is a drawback. The album's also a bit samey in the lyrics. But overall, it's another very solid album for Collective Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collective Soul Delivers","review":"Where can I begin,,,, The album is amazing..... This album being the fifth release from these southern rockers comes through as powerful yet melodic... Singer/Songwriter Ed Roland has once again put together another record full of hit after hit. With Elton John singing on \\"Perfect Day\\", along with a host of other musician, this album offers something for everyone, with heavy guitar riffs in Boast , and Why Pt.2, and soft melodic songs such as Turn Around, and 10 Yrs Later. I highly recommend this to old CS fans and to the army of new ones soon to be joining."},{"rating":"1","title":"CSoul sells out","review":"if you liked the first 3 csoul albums but you were a little disappointed by dosage. don't buy this. collective soul seems to no longer care about making good music but only about getting hits on TRL for MTV. they might as well be put in the same category as the backstreet boys or other trash that is driven by a bands image; not the music. whatever happened to songs like \\"the world i know,\\" \\"december,\\" and \\"blame.\\" they are now a band for young teenage girls who can post the album cover with the band members pictures on their walls. two decent songs are \\"why pt 2\\" and \\"perfect day\\" but don't come close to comparing with songs from the second or third album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender?

My two favorite albums would be their self-titled sophomore release, followed by Dosage... good writing, excellent music - all around great efforts.Every time I've ever listened to Blender, I wonder, \\"what happened?\\"This album disgusts me more and more every time I've heard it. I finally reached a point where I refused to listen to it, and have finally opted to disregard it all together.The mixing/studio-work was good... but the lyrics are pretty lame, in my opinion... and the music does nothing but annoy me. I never thought I'd say that about a band I consider one of my top five favs of all time, but this album has done nothing but left a sour impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no stopping Collective Soul!!","review":"This is a great album!! I am the biggest Collective Soul fan around, and they did not let me down on this one. I would of liked more tracks on the CD, but I like the way they only throw out 11 or 12 songs at a time, so you are anxious to here the next CD they release. There is a little more pop to this album, but they still hit me the right way with all of there guitar chords. Tracks 1-11 are easily listnable. No joke, I had this CD playing in my car and it went from 1-11 100 times over, I just could not skip one note of this CD. Being a huge Collective Soul fan, I may be predjudice, but suggest you at least try this CD, I am positive you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progression in awe of itself!","review":"Although this cd is more techno edged and more hard-core than even Dosage, its yet another great notch on Collective Souls belt to date.

The instrumentals trend towards some kind of techno sound.In my opinion, their records kept getting better until this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic C.S. Cd","review":"Do you need some music to pick you up at work? Collective Soul is the first thing I turn to when the stress reaches the upper levels. Blender is another in a list of solid CS Cd's. I can replay \\"Perfect Day\\" and enjoy it more each time. Boast is a simple yet strong single, and \\"Why pt.2\\" will remind you of earlier CS songs like \\"Where the River Flows\\". Overall, an excellent CD from one of the top rock bands of my generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blend of Iconoclastic Music","review":"I never bought a Collective Soul album before this one. To put it mildly, I love it. At first listen, the songs on the CD seem so different that it may surprise your ears to find they are from the same band. But once you listen to the songs, you will quickly appreciate Collective Soul's talent for creating catchy, original music on a consistant basis.The songs range from mellow ballads (\\"Over Tokyo\\") to modern rock (\\"You Speak My Language\\") and everything in between. Destined to be hits are \\"Why Pt. 2\\" which appeals to all those who love crunchy guitar riffs, and \\"Vent\\", a great song you can't stop singing in your head.My only complaint is the fact that the CD is so short. At under forty minutes, it has got to be the shortest album I own. This detracts little from the overall quality of the music, however.After listening to this CD for the last week, I'm well on my way to buying every Collective Soul album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insert title here","review":"I had heard many Collective Soul songs on the radio, and when Blender came out, I decided to buy it. I wasn't disappointed at all, it has a great mix of harder and softer rock on it. The CD starts off with a lot of energy, then slows down a little bit after 6 songs only to pick up again at the end. All of the songs on the CD are good, I don't skip over any of them; although Boast, Vent, 10 Years Later, and You Speak my Language stand out as my favorites. If you like Collective Soul, then definitely buy this CD, and if you haven't heard them yet, this would be a great CD to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't believe a boycot is in order.","review":"Though I agree that Collective Soul isn't the same band as they were in 1995, but hey, who says that's a bad thing? I loved Collective Soul then and I love them now! Five years does a lot to band as it would a sports team or anything for that matter. That's musical evolution, not selling out. Not writing what will sell, but writing what will be listened to. If it sells that means that it is what the majority of the people want to hear. Isn't that the point of being a musical icon? Blender is a good example of Collective Soul's evolution over the past five years.

Smoke and Mirrors is an eclectic collection of stories and poetry about everything from the holy grail to trolls. I think there's a little something for just about anyone that likes fiction. If you like short stories, Neil Gaiman, fantasy, or just want something a little different, you should take a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"I bought this book because I am an avid Neil Gaiman fan. The short stories are nice, because I'm in college right now, and I only have time for about 3 or 4 pages at a time. Each story is a gem in itself, I've even read a few more than once. I would recommend this book for anyone who has little time, but still wants to read beautiful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite short story.","review":"This contains my favorite short story, 'The Prince'. I first read it about 6 years ago and whenever I see a black cat I think of this story. I also love the whimsical 'Chivalry'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This item was passable, but not nearly as advertised. It was heavily worn and looked as if someone spilled a drink on the back side. To claim that it is in good condition is laughable. I will keep it because it is still readable, but don't appreciate deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaiman at his worst... terribly disappointing.","review":"I once thought that Neil Gaiman, the master of story-telling, could do no wrong. I have been corrected. This collection of short stories leaves the reader unfullfilled. Gaiman is known for creating fantastic characters and places. Gaiman does not seem to be able to build these characters and places within the few pages of a short story. The stories in this book range from a werewolf/Baywatch story to poems about vampires to murder mysteries in the heavens. There were a few rare gems in this book, but overall, I recommend reading 'Good Omens' or 'Neverwhere' to get a good taste of Gaiman's talents. These stories were consistently disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very entertaining","review":"I could not find any story that made me think or remember why i should read this book. I think i laughed once . Maybe it was the \\"Three Billy Goats Gruff\\" rewrite that left my boredom temporarily. Do not read this book if your expecting extreme or fascinating stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A retread of things I've enjoyed before","review":"Ordinarily, almost everything of Neil's gets 5 stars. I love the stories in this book. I love \\"Troll Bridge\\" and \\"Chivalry\\" and \\"Looking For The Girl.\\" The thing is, I read Angels And Visitations ages ago, and before that I read a Datlow/Windling anthology or five, so I've read \\"Troll Bridge\\" half a dozen times. And \\"Babycakes.\\" And \\"Virus.\\" And even though this collection has more stuff in it, and more comments, and I liked \\"When We Went To See The End Of The World by Dawnie Morningside, age 11 1/4\\" very much, it doesn't make up for it. I want to see the new stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.........","review":"I was very enthusiastic about this short story collection, the first I was reading by Gaiman. My first book by him was Neverwhere and I just loved it, then I read American Gods and just didn't get it.......at least given the whole success it had...it just wasn't for me it seems. But S&M really didn't get my attention as I thought it would, not one short story really got me going or really made me enjoy it.( Except the one with the black cat and the very short poem about Christmas.) I hope no one gets disappointed like me on it, I just think these stories are from a very early era by Gaiman and have not much to do with his more recent style or his novels. If you're starting with Gaiman I recommend Neverwhere, I don't think you're getting anything much better than that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"9��10��","review":"I give it a nine out of ten.What I liked about it:Neil Gaiman is a terrific author. The stories were mostly crisp and kept me interested.I enjoyed the change of pace between the tales.The different ideas and possible universes presented were great.In order to get a ten:A couple of the stories should have been left out. They were not the same caliber as the others in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than Neverwhere","review":"In \\"Neverwhere\\" Gaiman seriously bit off more than he could chew. But in this book of short stories, Gaiman's intensely creative ideas and fantastic imagination are perfect for the art that is the short story. I like how he puts two entirely unrelated ideas together. Like his opening tale of an old woman who finds the Holy Grail at her local thrift shop and is pursued by a handsome Knight of the Table Round (Yes, somehow he is from the past) who desperately wants the cup so he can complete his quest. You won't believe what he offers her in the way of exchange! These stories are so cool, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a couple of gems, but most stories read like stephen king","review":"I like Gaiman's work, but the works in this book were too slight for my liking. Many of the short stories/poems come off sounding like well-written Stephen King stories. They are either too slight, or exist merely to shock the reader with the twist ending.But there are a couple of gems (both of them the longer stories)- like \\"the goldfish pool and other stories\\" (a lovely and tender story mocking the LA movie business) and \\"murder mysteries\\" (a story about the angel Lucifer's fall), both of which are vintage gaiman.Seems to me someone was trying to capitalise on Gaiman's popularity, but some of these stories were better off left uncollected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as his novels","review":"I read American Gods and Anansi Boys before I read this book. I looooved the novels, but I didn't care much for the short stories. I thought they were Stephen King-ish, although with less supernatural effects (and that's a good thing), but they just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astoundingly, earth shatteringly good","review":"Very rarely do I read something that proves emphatically the author is smarter than me. I know this sounds conceited but its true, I'm rarely challenged but \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" was just that a challenge. From the first word I was reading with my whole mind, soaking up the brilliance of the prose and complex simplicity of the ideas. Thank you Mr Gaiman please keep creating."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm.","review":"i don't know about this one. admittedly, i am fairly new to gaiman's work. but stardust and neverwhere enchanted me duely, whereas smoke & mirrors has left me unimpressed. a few of the stories had me enthralled until they were through, but most i found myself quite bored with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Writer to Watch","review":"Having read many of Neil Gaiman's short stories over the last six months or so I find his work to be intelligent and well written. He has a truly creative mind. Smoke and Mirrors is a very good introduction to this talented writer's imagination. Be sure and read the foreword, as this is where he has hidden one of the book's best stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"just read it","review":"This is the first book that I have read from this author and I am highly impressed. Finally, a book where you can get a glimpse of how an author comes up with his stories and what they may mean. The best story has to be the \\"Murder Mysteries.\\" You will want to read it more than once to locate the clues hidden in the story. I am looking forward to reading more of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit shallow","review":"Compared with the real stuff, performed by Phil Collins, it misses the sparkle and life that Collin's music is famous for.It is orchestral music, with a nice beat, modern but not exciting. Nice background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I wanted quick and easy recipes for jams and jellies to give as gifts, without a a large investment in equipment. The book was very disappointing because all of the quantities are listed in pounds, not cups, and I do not want to go to the expense of purchasing a scale.. Also, nearly all of the recipes do not use prepared pectin; instead, it is required that the jam be cooked for a long length of time to reach the \\"jell\\" stage. Time is of the essence, for me. Therefore, I probably will not use one single recipe from this book! On the plus side, the photography is breathtaking, and the recipes are clearly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for amateurs","review":"I have owned this book for several years, but never used it until today when my wife and I made peach preserves. The finished product seems to be excellent so far, but this was mostly thanks to my wife's expertise. This recipe (and for that matter, all of them) does not call for pectin, leaving us to guess the amount. The recipe (and we made it twice) makes half the amount that it claims. As preparing preserves is labor-intensive, I would not try others in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than a standard audiobook","review":"This is great entertainment in the car. Shakespeare is a nice break from the standard audiobook. If it has been a while since you last saw some of these plays performed, these scenes will bring it all back to you. The introductions are very nice in setting up the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry level Lionel set!","review":"This is a good entry level lionel set. It does comes with Lionel's cheapest 40 watt transformer which does not even have an accessory output however, so if you want to expand your set with lighted buildings, you will need to buy a new transformer. Overall a great product and good value for the money and the kids love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less quality than I expected","review":"Compared to other entry level lionel sets, this is not a good buy -- and that is too bad since Thomas is so popular. Face plate was busted and had to order another from Lionel. Shipped with two of the same passenger cars, so had to send back a car before they would send another. The couplers are flimsy and the cars seperate often. My kido has more fun with real cheap plastic Lionel passenger cars which come with internal lights and passenger profiles in the windows. No bell on the engine, not even a light!..... Not sure why Lionel doesn't up the quality to their normal starter set level, I would certainly pay the extra cost. Lionel cut too many corners on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lionel Thomas","review":"My son loves it, actually used the train on his current track, but now have backup track and an extra power supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BELL","review":"Box Says there is a Bell Lionel says its a misprint!

Otherwise this would be a 5 star, but he can do better. But still I buy his albums unheard, the surprise is always pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Words","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, it's clear that this cd is amazing. The beauty of it is, this wasn't some preplanned set. John Digweed just took some of the songs from a night at Bedrock and made a cd out of them.This is how good he is.I know that the first time I listened to this I didn't like it as much as I do know but I think the more dance music you listen too, the more you can appreciate this CD. I've heard every single Global Underground, all the Northern Exposure CD's and a whole lot more, and this is definately at the top of the list. The entire thing is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated dance beats","review":"I notice most of the 5-star reviewers posted in 2000. I don't think these sets have aged very well, unlike, say GU Sydney or Expeditions done with Sasha. This is a bit too dancey and not enough trancey for my taste, if that makes any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, not really great at all","review":"I bought this album thinking it was a trance album, before I knew the distinction between trance, and house, etc. Except for the last song on the first disc \\"Bedrock\\", these songs are mostly House, ie: beat music with no real melody.I tried to like it but it just isn't very fun to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"As for this cd, i had really high expectations for it. I have to admit though, it is extremely boring, even for trance music. Trance music naturally is repetitive, but digweed has been able to find a whole new meaning for repetitiveness. He doesn't build you up into a peak at all. even the song selections were poor. when my friends heard it, they also did not like it. in buying a cd i think one can do better with any other cd out there other than this one. i don't recommend this cd to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genre-bender","review":"As a DJ, I usually stay away from mixed CDs, preferring instead to blow all my money on Vinyl. But after hearing this at a friends house, I decided it was a must have. After listening to it a few times, I came to the conclusion that Bedrock is one of those rare electronic music CDs that is a genre unto itself, meaning that no one else has done anything like it. I mean, I'm one of the most devoted fans of 4-4 beat dance music I know, and Im the first to admit that alot of the stuff sounds exactly alike. But what John has done here is create an easy-listening form of trancey house that is even more mellow than the already toned-down Northern Exposure series, without it becoming a beatless, ambient New-Age meditation type thing. This is an album that I listen to at work, and that I also play out at clubs with deep house. That kind of versatility is rare. Also, big thumbs-up to the vocal tracks. Ive never heard trance vocals that didnt totally ruin the song before this."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is definitely heaven scent","review":"this is amanda from texas and i can't get enough of this cd. for almost 8 years i've been a fan of trance, house, techno, etc., but nothing compares to the quality of this cd! number 10 on disc 2 is absolutely awesome. it's one of those songs that literally takes your breathe away and makes you want to get up and dance. have you ever been at a party/rave, and a song comes on that causes you to just get lost in the music and all you can feel is the song pulsing through your body? well, heaven scent is one of those songs that will blow your mind and will never tire of. everyone who is into this scene should definitely purchase this cd. john digweed is the god of trance."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"It's a great album, but that's not why I'm writing. \\"the onewhoknows\\" said that this is not a mixed album.

Spoiler alert, He dies in this one.

Evidently I was unable to get the copy of the Beau Bridges Jane Seymour version that I was purchasing from this seller(I have since ordered it elsewhere), though I was refunded my money and allowed to keep the other copy. Unfortunatlely the seller was still advertising their copy of \\"Four Feathers\\" as the Beau Bridges, Jane Seymour version when they do not have that movie in stock so other's may also be disappointed with what they receive in the mail as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the glimmer of hope??","review":"Suzanne White's guide to love, all other books on astrology that I have read have never been so harsh to certain signs matching together.

After three weeks the ribbon came off and we found it in the crib lying next to the bear. We were just happy our son hadn't put it in his mouth and choked on it.I went to Toys 'R' Us to have the bear replaced but they had nothing but patronizing comments on how the Velveteen Rabbit also had become worn over time and wouldn't honor their 90 day exchange policy without a receipt, even though the bear was only weeks old and is clearly labeled Toys 'R' Us.If Toys 'R' Us can't guarantee their hazardous Chinese imports, they shouldn't sell them in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bear, little price","review":"My 2-1/2 year old loves this bear.

However, Beckett Publications always produce good books.This book is extremely well written, and there are tons of super pictures, many of which, I had never seen. Instead of having one storyline from start to finish, this book uses several authors, many of whom are well-recognizable to the sportsworld, to depict Marino's story throughout time.Nobody in the game of football was a better pure passer, and nobody ever graced the game with more passion and competitiveness. This book sheds light on Dan Marino's overwhelming deisire to compete and win.

On reading Borges, I often cursed my ignorance and more often loved the brilliance of the prose. Because of the vast width of subjects, some stories would appeal more to certain people - so if you have read one or two stories - and could not get to like them don't give up.Though a totally different genre, I would like to recommend G.V.Desani's 'All about H.

His minimalism is deceptively simple-looking, but hard to do for me as a writer; his preoccupation with time and existence fascinates and disturbs; and his often-overlooked attention to epistomology is a continuing source of his pawky humor.

The di Giovanni translations are vastly better - reading them after reading Hurley's version is like seeing an ancient painting restored to its original glowing life. Hurley's translation is not awful - if it were the first form in which I had encountered Borges, I would no doubt have been delighted - but, by comparison with di Giovanni's, its clunky and rather wretched.I gather there was some sort of ugly conflict with the Borges literary estate that led to the di G translations going out of print, but used copies are readily available - the wise reader will go and find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collected!","review":"The best one of Borges' fiction collections i'd ever had. the paper margins are not straight, kept the jagged hand-cutting feeling.

I found myself re-writing in my head alternative sentences. But that is exactly what Borges would have wanted his readers to do. A dream master, JLB guides us into worlds that guess at other worlds and leads us to our own discoveries. I can't count the times I had to put the book down to allow myself to ponder on what I was reading.

Well he loves it and I love it too! It does get your child to think and use geometry in a fun way. A great tool to learn basic geometry. Another advantage is that it does not have an overwhelming large number of pieces. Its simplicity makes it so great. I highly recommend it.The only recommendation to the manufacturer is to also offer a magnetic version. The pieces move a lot while little hands are working on the puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for problem solving!","review":"Our 3yr old son loves puzzles and shapes, and though these are a little difficult for his age, I sit with him and make suggestions when he gets stuck. Eventually he will be old enough to make the choices and figure all the supermind sheets out on his own.

But then this isnt Moxy, this is a band that was left with the Moxy name and was forced by the record company to put out some radio play material.

A low timer will have you searching frantically for a match only to have you scream in agony when the game shows you the obvious match right in front of you after time runs out. Zoo Keeper makes you want to keep playing over and over again.Zo o Keeper is one of those games that you buy to keep you entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches kids negative self worth","review":"The game is a a fun game to play overall, but for anyone playing the game, when they do not achieve the goal in the level they are in, they are told that they are \\"dummies\\", \\"useless\\", \\"worth nothing\\", \\"miserable\\", \\"I don't have money to pay you\\", \\"what you are missing is everything\\", \\"go and wash your face\\" by the Head Zookeeper. Considering the target audience (children), why did anyone allow such degrading language in a game? A game is to be fun, and not make you feel bad. I personally feel horrible about giving the game to someone else (not just my daughter). I never would have bought it if I knew it contained such messages. Buyer beware! Not for young children, or any child/person who will be affected by negative messages being thrown at them when they mess up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it!","review":"I cant stop playing this game!

Not only is it badly translated to english, but the game is pretty repetative and boring. The producers could have spent more time on this game or included it into an arcade style game with multiple other games. The graphics on it could have been more expirimental than just a bunch of 2-D animals and people. I have to admit that there was hardly any distortion, but what else would you expect from a new handheld? This game is definately not worth your money and if you have to have it buy it used or wait for the price to drop.

Easy enough to keep your game flowing but challenging at some points. It's extremely cute. Just as fun as Bejeweled, or any other match-3 game.A lot of people say not to bother, but it's...not a bad game. It's cute, it's funny.

I the book is really for black people that want to know some truth about back then. And how she thought African-Americans were being treated. She had so much feeling built up and you can tell in her writing style. So I think my book was good for my high school book report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Comedy","review":"This book was so entertaining I could not put it down. I laughed so hard I cried. This information is extremely outdated and rediculous. There are weight loss diets that actually recommend drinking coffee twice a day every day! Thank goodness aspiring and professional dancers have access to proper information. The Dancer's Body Book is a really good joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book cuts to the chase","review":"This book is quick and easy to read with a very relaxed and immediate style. Kent seems to have included her interviews with a wide range of American dancers almost word for word, so they read with an immediacy and directness that is refreshing. It is all in there - what works with weight loss, what doesn't and how hard it can be. A wonderful change from all the diet books that promise fabulous pain free results in 10 days! Some of the receipes are more useful than others, and yes, some dancers do seem to eat just lettuce and then dance for 5 hours! Ne're the less, one of the most inspiring but practical books on health and diet and exercise I have read. I really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Promotes Unhealthy Attitudes & Behaviors","review":"Anyone suffering from an eating disorder should not read this book, nor should adolescents! I am not convinced that this promotes healthy attitutes toward food, body image, and weight, and could be dangerous. For those professional ballerinas who have chosen to malnurish their bodies for the sake of their professional requirements, it may have some helpful tips. As a(non-professional)dancer, and someone who struggles with anorexia, I have discovered the world of classical ballet can be cruel to the body, and constant dieting leads to a mess of medical problems, and eating disordered behaviors associated with them. I don't need a book telling me what is a dietary, \\"sin,\\" nor urging people to weigh snd examine their bodies each day. Healthy people are refered to as \\"heavy\\" in this book, as the dancer's world promotes one to be at an unhealthy weight. I returned this book, as it is toxic to me, as someone struggling with health issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"The manual to become anorexic or bulimic","review":"This book, Dancers' Body Book, is a manual to become anorexic or bulimic. I do not recommend reading it. While I'm not in favor of banning books, if I had to go 1984 on a book this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DO NOT read this book!!!","review":"When I looked at this book at first, I thought it was the answer to my prayers. I'm a dancer, and I was looking for a way to get down to a better weight for dancing. This book looked like it would be really helpful. When I first read it, I thought it was helping me. Now I understand that it was doing the opposite. The book will make your body image fall to pieces, especially when you compare your weight to that of dancers that are your height (and underweight). Personally, when I read it, I felt fat and lazy and awful about myself. After reading the book my developing eating disorder became full-fledged, because of the importance this book places on being dangerously thin, and the starvation diet it recommends. I would advise everyone to NOT read this book, or if you must read it, realize that the diet within the book is unhealthy and dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book to help you develop anorexia","review":"This book should be avoided by young people. My sister was given this book by her teacher and still has problems with anorexia...."},{"rating":"1","title":"read this book with caution","review":"I have read this book several times, and as a dancer, it actually encourages me NOT to follow the outrageous diet plans of the dancers featured in the book. Admittedly, i can relate to the desperate measures that these people will take to lose weight perhaps temporarily, for a certain ballet or an important audition. However, these are not measures that I am proud of, and frankly I find it disturbing that Ms. Kent feels free to encourage extreme behavior, especially in young people (and ESPECIALLY young dancers!) The active lifestyle of a dancer needs to be supplemented by proper nutrition; the mere mention of Susan Jaffe's summer of drinking \\"a lot of iced tea\\" to help acquire her job with American Ballet Theatre is dangerous information for aspiring, developing young girls to have their hands on. We can only hope that anyone reading this book for the first time will take it with a grain of salt, considering it was written nearly twenty years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dancer","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the \\"suggestions\\" this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3\\" should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: \\"why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights\\" and \\"the chain around the refrigerator.\\" it shows a dancer ready to \\"feast\\" on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!!!","review":"I am a dancer and all I have to say for this book is NO!!! This book is basically telling people that you have to starve yourself to be a dancer or to look like one. And also it's giving the message that all dancers starve themselves as well!!! This is not going to accomplish anything except making yourself sick! Dancers *at least those who I know* stay in such great shape by devoting countless hours to dancing and practicing, and to eating healthy *not starving ourselves*...All in all I thought this was awful...it's promoting eating disorders and disgracing healthy dancers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring movie","review":"Pleasant movie but not as funny as I'd hoped for. Seems that all the movies bearing the National Lampoon stamp are not very funny. It's a shame that NatLamp has fallen on such hard times but its heydey was the '70's through the early '80's so this level of mediocrity is no surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS JUST A GIRL NEXT DOOR REMAKE....","review":"I saw this movie a few times, it had some funny moments. Really it was just one of thoses try to remake of another movie just like The Girl Next Door. But I would not say this was the best one made, but the Girl next door was better and had a better plot that involves high buddies making a porn movie but the one guy actually gets to know the porn star and more funny stuff happens along the way in the girl next door. I thought this movie was really another stupid take on it. So What I am saying this one was ok, but there are better NL movies out there, and no one can replace the Vacation favorites...."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't play","review":"The description says it will play on vista.

But this one does not run on Windows XP, and most nowadays computers use Windows XP. What's the point with a new release of these classic games if you are not able to play them unless you have a computer from the middle nineties? For me it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"This game is a waste of money, sure you get a lot of stuff but thats not the point. I bought this game thinking the graphics were good and there not, everything is small and not very detailed. The game runs slow and some times it freezes. I gave it 2 stars because it did come with a lot of stuff and if you are an true blue C&C fan then you can look past everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different coping mechanism set in an interesting mystery.","review":"This story takes an aspect of the supernatural that hasn't been \\"done to death\\" and sets it in a mystery. The characters are well thought out and the author presents them in a way that the reader becomes interested in their lives quickly. It's one of those books that you hate to put down because you want to see what happens next. If you're looking for some heavy thinking in your reading material, this isn't it. But if you want an exciting story that'll give you a few chills, you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinated by unique storyline","review":"I was fascinated by the psychic gift storyline. I read the book very quickly because it was enjoyable to read and the pace was lively. The astral element was entertaining and made for a creative mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique mystery.","review":"The touch of supernatural adds a new dimension to this mystery. If you have ever experienced that \\"almost asleep\\" period where your body jerks and you wake up, this is what some people claim is the prelude to \\"out of body\\" travel. A subject that Art Bell could spend three hours on! Even the murder takes a back seat to Elaine's OBE as the finely crafted description puts you right alongside the main character during her journeys. If you like a little goosebump served with your mystery, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!","review":"This book is not an interlinear!!! It is a reprint of an English translation of Horace. If you are looking for an English translation of Horace it might be fine for you.

The gods sorta dumped this one in my path last week and I haven't been able to put it down. The opening track alone is enough to just make you trash everything after 1969 and become a retro-nik bobbing up and down in a Joshua Light Show. It's all oddly current, somehow. I suppose good things just don't die. Imagine your favorite Pink Floyd/Iron Butterfly passages fed through some herky-jerky speed metal but infused with the spirit of Italian lounge film composer Piero Piccioni and then you have an idea of what lies herein. Track 1 is worth the purchase price alone: it sounds like Fellini on psychedelics.Permanent rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality cable","review":"Good quality cable at reasonable price.

Here was a man who learned to compromise and build a consensus when acting for his people. This should be required readng for all children, and for any adult who has aspirations as a leader of children, of a community, or a nation. If physical prowess and aggressive territoriality are really to be the hallmarks of our society's heroes, then let us have a role model that adds to those qualities expert diplomacy and a deep caring for the nation's children. That this book is in his own words makes it more powerful and persuasive. While this edition does not have the illustrations of the 1935 school text edition, it does have photographs, a map, and background information about Plenty-Coups' life and importance in our nation's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, very time consuming.

First, I had trouble installing the game. I went online and did everything that they told me to do, and I still could not install the game. Then I called EA, and their customer service leaves something to be desired. In desperation, I called one of my friends who is a video game geek. He walked me through changing the registry of my computer, and then it installed.This game is not for small children, because it is very difficult to move Harry around. The camera in the game seems to always be in the wrong position. Getting 100% Discovery points in all the locations without some hints off of EA's website is almost impossible. The last couple of Harry Potter PC games were much more exciting than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"EA has really done it this time. BEWARE!! If you have an Intel processor for graphics this game will not work. I have XP with the latest graphics updates, Xtreme graphics, and drivers and the system keeps shutting the game down as a threat to computer. I also have well above the specs necessary that are stated. System says a line in the program is creating the problem, EA says the program will only run with certain graphics programs. Bottom line read the small print and check your computer specs. The ad for the product does not tell you all, check EA to find out which graphic programs will run the game properly. Even a vista program with a intel graphics program will not work properly. I tried. Kids extremely disappointed. We have all the other games and had no problem,however with this one I guess you need to buy a certain kind of computer to play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad character movement","review":"I have played every Harry Potter game that has come out. This is by far the worst. The characters are very hard to control. Sometimes when you want Harry to walk one way, you may have to press different directions to get him to go that way. In addition, it is very hard to point him in the right direction to do any spells. I gave up about 20 minutes in to the game. The cut scenes are also way too long and way too frequent. I'm not sure who tests these games but I can't imagine anyone being really comfortable with the controls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm....","review":"Probably the worst gameI've ever purchased, all you do is run around hogwarts trying to find your way lighting tourches. There's no action of any kind and all the puzzles are ridicliously simple, the game gets repetitve real fast. The few duels in the game that you have are totally ridiclious since you don't even have health points, so you don't die. It's simply a horrible piece of junk, don't buy it, its not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure again","review":"Once again EA creates a visually beautiful game that is unplayable. You spend most of your time running around trying to make the characters use spells with controls that are horrible. The first three games didn't have great graphics but did have ease of control and movement and were fun to play. Since then, with the release of Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix,the games are very pretty but the ease of control and movement are terrible and the game play is frustrating. EA reached it's highest point in HP series of games with Prisoner of Azkaban, its all been downhill from there. Don't by this game it completely sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I probably will never know if the game is enjoyable or not because it simply will not load, and my Win XP system exceeds the specs that EA said are needed. EA tel support is nonexistent - after going through their automated call screener, you get a message announcing office hours, and that those offices are now closed for the day (even though it's 1 1/2 hours prior to the stated closing time.)

I finally found out from EA's telephone support line (I couldn't find anything about this problem on their website) that it is unplayable on my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unbelievably bad","review":"I had high hopes for this game because of the first three. I thought it would be mostly the same except hopefully better graphics. I was horrified. It is extremely difficult to walk or move in any direction. I found the wand almost impossible. I couldnt direct it, let alone cast a spell. It was not engaging despite the high quality graphics. I am sticking to the first three. They had horrible graphics, but the game sucked you in and it was fun to play. Do not buy this its a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOTP","review":"I think this is, by far, the best of the Harry Potter computer games. You get to cast your own spells by various mouse movements and there is very much exploring to be done. There are set tasks, but at the same time, you get to roam around and see all of Hogwarts, which was highly limited in the extremely frustrating Goblet of Fire game. I love it, my brother loves it, and it makes for great fun. I would say the only frustrating part is when Moaning Myrtle randomly keeps popping up, but it's easy to skip over those parts and fully enjoy the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster","review":"I have been a fan of the Harry Potter game series since the beginning. While I quite enjoyed the first three games, the last two have been a let down. Firstly the biggest complaint I see is that the controls are awkward. I agree with this but when you are involved in the game it is easily looked over. The thing that really bothers me is the fact that if you are a person who has not read the book or seen the movie you will have no idea at all what is going on. Most times when an event happens it is assumed you already know the story. Nothing at all is explained and most things are left open-ended. There was no effort put into making the game understandable to those who have not read the book. Also in this version there are no classes to go to or mini-courses to complete, you just have a few O.W.L. challanges. If you are a fan, by all means buy this game, but if you have not followed the series, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Harry Potter Fan","review":"I have always been a real fan of Harry Potter and the books and movies.

My husband and I tried everything we could do to get it to run and were ready to return it. I read lots of info on the internet and saw that we were not the only ones having difficulty. Eventually, a computer friend came over and spent about an hour getting it to work and my daughter loves it. However, I am very disappointed in EA for releasing a game that has such a big flaw in it. I'm sure consumers would rather wait than get a product they can't use. We'll wait longer and do more research before we buy another of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!","review":"We have have had so many problems with this game that it hasn't been worth the handful of times it has worked right.

But I sure did! I did not buy this game this time, but saw it from someone who did. I did not pre-order it and wait in anticipation like I did the previous times. Boy, an I glad! It has the same problems as with the 4th game. Where was the joy and - yes, magic - from the first three games? It doesn't matter if your game has cool graphics if no one can play it comfortably on a PC with a mouse.Go away, EA!

I am very disappointed because I have to go to the post office now and return the thing and wait for another duvet cover.

It easily bests the original while keeping its spirit intact. It doesn't merely ape Spectre; it becomes its own work. There's no denying the Spector influence on the Beach Boys, particularly Brian, but \\"I Can Hear Music\\" is an example of how Brian and the group assimilated, then surpassed, Spectre's technique. \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" is a slight piece of filler from the group's early days that doesn't display the group's prowess in the studio at its best and is a pretty weak tribute to Spector as well (likewise the group's cover of \\"Then I Kissed Her\\", thankfully overlooked for this collection.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex-pat Scot dicovers his history","review":"I moved to USA 3 years ago, having always considered myself a realitically patriotic Scot. Scottish Nationalism, however, was not my preferred political outlook and I remain unconvinced of its longterm benefit to either Scotland or Britain as a whole. However, that in no way hindered me from becoming completely absorbed in this tale of modern political intrigue mixed with raw historical drama. Mr Phillips is indeed a storyteller of rare quality who can, with little persuasion, encourage a reader to readily set aside his/her own preconceptions and political preferences and wholeheartedly swing behind his hero. I was completely invested in the outcome of this tale. Hats off to you, Mr Phillips. You may make a nationalist of me yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite by far!!","review":"This is my absolute favorite Michael Phillips series. Though only two books, the other is Lengend of the Celtic Stone, this series is a must read for those who have Scottish blood or wish they did.

The actual song in this single is an edited version of the orginal song of 6.26 minutes down to about four. The song has very good grinding guitars, and great vocals from Bruce Dickinson. There is also the ubiquitous Iron Maiden gallop which is perpetuated by Harris' bass and Nicko's drums. The live version of Wasted Years is from the Ed Hunter tour and is performed very well. The song has been a crowd favourite ever since it appeared on the 'Somewhere in Time' album. Overall a great single, albeit a bit pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story Told Straight","review":"A very interesting and different book. It reads very much as a man telling a story about a chapter in his life. Very straight forward and readable. No long descriptions of scenery, or extensive dialog. This is a tale of two men. One is in love with airplanes and starts his own service, after WWII, in the Middle East. He is the primary character and the story teller. The other, a boyhood acquaintaince and later an employee, increasing becomes involved with religion and philosophy. It is a captivating tale but not one of action or suspense.

I have an unusually wide spectrum of musical interest. I LOVE \\"Quality\\" wherever it may be found. My collection also includes, Tapping The Vein, Die Happy & Lacuna Coil. I even like The Lords Of Acid once in awhile. As of late, Whenever I feel the need for un-leashed raw female power & expression, I reach for \\"Planet Of The Apes\\", it Frosts My Cake.

Maybe if you expected something that might would sound like the last album, you could be dissapointed, but on the other side, if you are more open, you would simply love this more quiet album, songs like \\"Living in a lie\\", \\"Anne Claire\\" and \\"money & milk\\" is the most lovely songs on the album, but also \\"No Speech\\", \\"Big in Japan\\", and \\"Innocent greed\\" still says that the Guano Apes we know from \\"Proud like a god\\" is back, still going strong, this album is a certain number 1, for the Guano Apes fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad computer infomercial!","review":"I bought this game because I thought Guns & Ammo magazine would put out a fun & realistic game on firearms and target shooting.

The performances were all solid and it is amazing to see where many of our musical roots came from. Most of the songs helped define that \\"Summer of Love\\" and for guitar players it is a must see. It is fascinating hearing the performers describe what it was like during this period. I saw Jimi Hendrix in 1968 at Swing Auditorium in Riverside California. Eric Johnson's performance of \\"All Along the Watch Tower\\" was so masterful and dead on, that if I closed my eyes I thought I was in the presence of Hendrix again. No other performer has ever covered Jimi so flawlessly. His guitar tone was amazing. A real treat in surround sound.K.

The single 'I'm your pusher' is probably the best song on the cd but not any good compared to scooter's earlier work. I myself am a big scooter fan and i own all of their albums, but this is just bad. If you wanna listen to good german dance music i recommend scooters earlier albums like: 'No time to chill', 'Wicked!', 'Our happy hardcore', '..And the beat goes on', 'The age of love' and their singles album; 'Rough and tough and dangerous'.

The way in which it organizes and chronicles the war in segments makes it easy on the reader and enjoyable to read through. Also the great amount of pictures to assist the reader with the text is very helpful. Not only was the book a pleasure to read but it contained lots of information that I hadn't known before.

The opening scene (which is a rip off of an old \\"Cheech and Chong\\" routine) showed a lot of promise, but the rest of the movie couldn't keep up.

Not greatly directed or even the best actors in the world, this group of guys makes an extremely funny movie. They take a great inside look at the more layed back side of the police officer's life. While the representation of the men working isn't a completely accurate one for police officers today, it is still an awesomely hilarious film. The charaters were perfect for roles they were playing. Each character has their own little quark to themself that adds to the humor. The way these men can mess with the innocent civilians is second to none. The fact that they mess with eachother more than they mess with civilians is surprising in itself, but they way the mess with eachother is equally funny. From the drugs to the sex, it is an all around good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Funny Movie","review":"Super Troopers is a really funny movie. The beginning sequence of this movie is one of the funniest scenes that I have seen in a movie in a long time, \\"The Snozberries taste like Snozberries.\\" Much of this movie is a mockery of law enforcement. The characters are all funny in the own ways, but in my opinion, the best is Farva, the misguided and misunderstood buffoon that does all of the grunt work for the guys.

Pure, pointless garbage. This movie starts out funny, but it starts steadily declining until it's rapidly going downhill. It goes from hilarious to being just short of something you would burn as a fuel source. It probably wouldn't burn well either if it can't stay funny for more than the first half hour. I almost did not enjoy this movie at all. I only found the first 30 minutes entertaining. The rest of it is TOO senseless and TOO pointless. Some of the scenes make NO sense at all(like the naked doll on top of the police car near the end, and part where those two people are jumping on the bed doing SOMETHING and the guy keeps fussing at them). This is senseless trash.

These were very amusing to various degrees but 'Super Troopers' was a total stinker from the get go. If you want stoner comedies then get some Cheech & Chong or Firesign Theater's \\"J-Men Forever\\"... even \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" (if you must) but stay away from THIS turkey.

The opening scene might be the best when they pull over three kids smoking pot. I have a feeling the movie is also better when you do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, so was Club Dread","review":"This movie is awesome. The previews for both this movie and Club Dread sucked.

It was poorly written and poorly acted. It could have at least been camp, but it wasn't even that.It's just a total waste of film.Stay away from this one!I don't recommend it at all.

I am a big fan of \\"stupid\\" movies such as Dumb and Dumber-Dude, Wheres My Car? and so on. This movie doesn't even compare. I think I laughed two to three times. The jokes aren't funny, the acting is forced and lame and the script is awful. I heard from some co-workers that this movie was hilarious so I borrowed it from one of them. Thank god I didn't spend any money. The majority of people that I have heard that think this movie is funny are the same people who don't get why people love Office Space which I think is a comedy classic.

As for me, I wish I would not have boughten it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Everyone thinks Super Troopers is such a great movie. The beginning of the movie when the three stoners get pulled over is funny, but it's all downhill from there. After the stoner scene, the movie gets really tedious. Maybe Super Troopers is amusing when you're stoned off your ass, but I watched it sober, and it sucked. A great comedy should be funny even when you're sober. We now have a bunch of morons repeating the lines from this crappy movie. People, it's not funny when YOU say the lines from Super Troopers, hell they're not really funny in the first place. Anyway, this is just my personal opinion.

And these characters are cops!I think the screenwriter must have intended this behavior to be amusing. But instead it was just embarrassing.Super Troopers just went too far. The only funny bits, seemed to have made in the trailers.

Super Troopers has done this, and so it will go down (for me) in history. Those who compare this movie to Police Academy do it a terrible injustice, and only demonstrate their own level of cultural identification...This movie reminds us of just how funny violence, and the degrading of our fellow human beings can be. How refreshing after a decade of touchy feely nonsense. I had very few expectations when I went into this, and the first three minutes assured me I had not made a mistake. Supper troopers paid of huge, and it's too bad that it's external message was so terribly unappealing to so many of us. Kudos to the makers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Side-Splitting Hilarious","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out and let me tell you, it was hilarious. This movie is sweet. The characters in the movie are well developed with their own unique personalities which makes you cheer them on as the movie goes on.

Trout, co-host of the Focus on the Family broadcasts, takes a cross-country journey by bicycle along with his son-in-law. It could have been a great cycling book, a great travelouge, or a great inspirational classic, but it is none of these. The description of cycling is weak, the thoughts aren't all that insightful, and scripture is thrown in as an afterthought. You can almost hear the editors saying \\"Hey, Mike's a Christian guy, and we've gone ten pages without a bible verse -- anybody know a verse about 'persevering'?\\"If you just insist on reading this book, either borrow it or check it out of the library, because you'll kick yourself if you spend your hard-earned dollars on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"If your looking for a inspirational book about christian faith, then this might be the book for your or if you enjoy a radio show called focus on the family.If your looking for a book about pure bicycling touring this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion, not enough cycling","review":"Don't bother with this one if you want to read about his experiences cycling.

Most of the reviews I read were decent, so I took a chance. We started off with it packed with a combination of ice, frozen foods, and previously chilled foods and beverages. By the time we reached out destination (an 8 hour drive), we had mostly water and partially thawed foods. It was a warm day, but it was in an air conditioned car with the exception of a short ferry ride. At our vacation place, we used it as a second fridge, with similar results. How anyone gets more than a day or so out of it is beyond me...and it certainly didn't perform as advertised! The trade of in cooler space for additional \\"Xtreme\\" insulation is a bad deal, in our book. Given the givens, we'd have just used our old cooler and added a few groceries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ice retention","review":"Ice lasted an average of 3-4 days (after initial cool-down process) out of direct sunlight using only two bags of cubed ice. Block ice lasts a little longer, but prefer cubed as it is easier to pack drinks and other perishables in.Keep in mind, the interior is much smaller than you might think due to the thick insulated walls, so be sure that the capacity meets your requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not do as it says","review":"My family was going on a camping trip and figured this would be perfect as the ice would last five days and we would not have to worry. So we spent the extra money only to be disappointed. Not only did this product not live up to its word, the ice melted after only five or six hours. We hardly opened the cooler. Don't waste you money. We tried refilling the cooler again only to have the same thing happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman 36-Ot Chest","review":"I bought the ice chest as a gift for Christmas 2012. The chest looks great and the order came in quickly. I am long toothed and remember having the Coleman ice-chest when it had some metal built into it, which lasted many years. I bought it for the brand name and hope it will be superior to its competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme? No.","review":"I bought this cooler. The claim is up to five days. However, no minimum is given, so the claim means nothing. It has more insulation than a regular cooler; however, the drain area in the bottom has less insulation, and the four cupholders, with no insulation, are a weakness. With ice in the cooler, they are cold to the touch, a definite engineering error. As another reviewer said, it will keep ice for five days, but only if you keep it full, and in my opinion, do not open the cooler. The reality is that it is good for two to three days, but even less if you start with non-cooled sodas or other items or it is opened often, such as at a picnic or at the beach. It is better than a regular cooler, which in my opinion are just containers. You best bet is to put more money into more ice. Nowadays, marketing people call their entry-level products new and improved, kingsize, or supreme as a rule. This is an example of that type of marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cooler, just be smart","review":"I've had great luck with this cooler for both camping and backyard parties. With any cooler you are going to have problems if you keep opening and closing the lid all the time. It doesn't matter how much insulation it has. It has kept beer cold in my garage (at about 75-80) for 5 days, at the end of five days the ice that had been in there was mostly water, but very cold water and its kept Boca Burgers frozen while camping for a 3 day weekend. I wouldn't depend on it to keep milk good while camping for a week, but that isn't going to be possible with any cooler I know of. Much better at keeping things cold than the cheapie coolers, but you just have to be realistic about what a cooler can do and plan accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Xtreme 36qt Cooler","review":"This cooler works very well.

It seemed to belong to another time then, cutting across the prevalent banality of New Romanticism with surreal lyrics and music from a parallel world, as in masterpieces such as Party Fears Two and Club Country; and so it does equally today.This contains the full original UK album on CD for the first time, plus unreleased tracks and the double-A side hit 18 Carat Love Affair and Love Hangover, their unlikely cover of the Fifth Dimension hit that was later disco-fied by Diana Ross"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile","review":"Brittle sound, hysterical vocals, the worst Motown cover ever (\\"Love Hangover,\\" in case you were wondering): this is one release to avoid. \\"The Affectionate Punch\\" presented a (surprise, surprise) Bowie-influenced duo, and while even then Billy MacKenzie's vocals were hard to take, the lyrics were at times funny and Alan Rankine's settings (mostly minimal guitar) were worth a listen or three. Here, however, the duo descends into unlistenable synth-pop bad enough to make one appreciate Spandau Ballet.

'Sulk' was recommended to me by a internet friend that turned me on to Modern Eon (FANTASTIC) - I took a chance thinking I had missed another fantastic 80's band - well....in this case, I didn't..... This is typical and easy to forget (thank heaven) sickly sweet and drippy 80's synth pop. This isn't synth pop like later New Order, Ultravox, Ministry's first album or even the Naked Eyes or Tears for Fears....this is Synth pop like something in the background of a low budget 80's teen sex comedy 'new wave' bar scene.... - I will say it's a hair better then anything Wang Chung ever did but only because the singing is so over the top that I actually was cracking up a couple of times with the vocal embellishments and pretention....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melting","review":"Natalie Cole - How can you ever go wrong with listening to her music.

My son would ask for this during the day when he's done playing. We read different sets of books at night and at day time, but this book gets a consistent request from him.

Her stuff is clever, which is important when your toddler wants it read to her for the 10,000th time...I say this as both a parent and an author: some children's books are so painfully inane that you'd rather jump out the window than read them, much less read them the many, many times your kid may demand. Mercifully, Ms. Boynton's books never meet that description.It may look easy to rhyme a few words and fill up a board book, but there's something of an art to it.

I thought this was going to be the first rap group in a long time to mix rock with their music and not be terrible. And I wasn't right or wrong. Because the truth is, there is no rock sound in this album. It's actually just weak crunk and snap beats just like every other rap album nowadays. I heard Party Like A Rockstar a long time before this album came out and that song is good as a single but I figured it wouldn't be the best on the album which it was. So I expected the rest of the album to be completely different. But no, most of the songs sound exactly the same kind of like D4L's album only worse. A few songs were good, but the album as a whole fails. The lyrics are especially terrible. So overall, Rockstar Mentality falls short of all expectations.

The story is watchable; I can't say it's a very good movie, and Jeremy Brett was rather miscast: such a charming man is not very credible as a sexual intruder.And he was too young in body and mind to be abble to be frightening. Nevertheless, I'm not disapointed; if my DVD were broken, I would buy another immediatly. A large part of Jeremy Brett's work has still not been released; a part of it has been lost, perhaps destroyed, it's a pity. If we can have a movie where he play's, let's catch it!

The rightfully rejected score to Timeline is Goldsmith at his most generic. He simply got this score completely wrong, and his sounds just never come across as natural or indigenous to the story. There is one bright spot, track 2 'Cornflakes' is a wonderfully bittersweet tangent, and it's almost worth buying the CD for, but the rest is pure drudgery. It was Goldsmith's second last scoring assignment, and his last for his old friend Richard Donner, but for a better epitaph for a great composer check-outLooney Tunes: Back In Action."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves it!","review":"We bought this for our 2nd grader.

Leon's eccentric and offbeat vocals eventually grow on you until you become subconciously addicted. There isn't one great song on the album, but somehow it works. SMASHED is a sour sounding jazz tune that sounds great when it quickly breaks from the pop ditty \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\". Drift away with \\"Spanish Harlem\\", fast forward through \\"Streaker's Ball\\" into upbeat \\"Working Girl\\". Side two starts out slow with \\"Time for Love\\" and sets up for a Dylan (I think) tune \\"Hollis Brown\\". GOOD Choice for Leon fans. Who else listens to Leon Russell anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Duplicate Songs? What's Going On?","review":"I absolutely love the first 2 installments from this Now collection.

Would they include duplicate songs on the regular Now Hits CD's??? I think not. If you don't have Now Christmas 1 or 2, I highly suggest getting those versus the lame 3 installment.

It isn't even amusing aside from Toast. BTW I cannot find any information at all about the actor Jeff D'Agustino (Toast) anywhere! It is agrivating. Its just all about the twins.

They travel with some friends of theirs and this is when it gets unrealistic. They get lost about nine times by taking the wrong Greyhound bus, leaving their topless car in the parking lot with the keys in the car, and a lot of other stuff.

I never really LOVED any of their movies, but I have to say that I really liked \\"It Takes Two.\\" Recently their movies have been kind of repetitive- they go to a foreign country and meet two boys. I thought this movie was going to be better, but it wasn't. The whole movie really is about \\"getting there\\" and it was the most boring movie I think they've ever made. The boys were surfers, and were portrayed as these mindless idiots. There was a very weak plot, and very little action. It was really stupid how every attempt they made to get to Utah failed. The other thing I didn't like was how once again, mary-Kate and Ashley were living in a fantasy world. They had money to go on planes, buses, cars and other various ways of transportation to get to Utah. Oh, and no chaperones either.

Yet, they are already sixteen and they're repetitive idiocy keeps oblivious kids, hopeful teens, and perverted old guys happy. Getting There is probably the worst of their movies. We already know that the twins can't act for crap, but that doesn't mean they have to act retarded. Bask in MK&A and friends' corny lives with no sense of depth and real life. If I were one of their parents, I would check under the teens' bed for a supply of drugs and alcohol. Just watch this movie and you'll see. They seriously act like their on something.

The movie was also unrealisitic. What parents let their twin daughters, their 2 friends, and 3 members of the opposite sex go to a ritzy ski lodge in Utah to watch, of all things, the Olympics? And what parents give their kid a fire engine red convertible for their birthday? And what kids just keep buying zillions of plane tickets, throwing away about 200 bucks per ticket? And who thought a movie about trying to get somewhere would be entertaining? The only reason this movie got 2 stars was because there were a few remotely funny parts, and the Olsen twins were what held the whole movie together.

It possesses a haunting emotional power that grabs on and refuses to let go. It is in my opinion the strongest role of one of the strongest actors in cinema history. When Jimmy Stewart falls in love with Kim Novak, we too fall in love. When he is driven mad, we go a little mad with him. Hitchcock's tendencies toward manipulation and artifice have never served a plot better. But, this DVD release does not quite give Vertigo the treatment it deserves. The documentaries feel weak, the commentary is longwinded and transparent in spite of the genius that provides it and the accompanying episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents is not the best. There's a lot to like about this release, but while Vertigo is a five star film, this DVD is a four star release.

Just for that short scene this film is worthy of artistic greatness, a masterpiece, something that is rare in this days.Absolute recommendation for any film buff, some few naysayers claim the movie is slow and the vertigo effect is dated ...yeah sure it is, but does it really matter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling!","review":"This timeless thriller is one I love to watch often on a Sunday afternoon.

James Stewart plays the police detective Scottie Ferguson who suffers from vertigo when in high places after the accidental death of a police friend during a roof chase. The accidental death is partly Scottie's fault and he bears the mental scars. Before he can recover from one blow, he's given another when duped by a beautiful woman and an old friend who have a sinister plot and a part for Scottie to unwittingly play.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The restoration is excellent; I've never seen such vivid colors or a crystalline soundtrack on a Hitchcock film. The only description I can give is mesmerizing. It's at its hypnotic best when the audio-visuals replace the dialogue. I can't express how much this film moved me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Craftsmanship at its best","review":"James Stewart can do no wrong in my eyes, and probably in the eyes of the vast majority of the movie-going public. It is obvious why he was a favourite of Alfred Hitchcock's. Here he shows not only his usual charm, but also a slightly sinister side, evidence of his great talents as an actor and not just a star. The plot is interesting, and best enjoyed if you don't try to guess ahead. The restored version shows the beautiful colour of the original and particularly the fine costume design. The sound restoration is also worthy of mention. It is handled sensitively by re-creating the sound effects in stereo and adding a clean copy of the Bernard Hermann score to the best versions of the dialogue the restorers could find. It might lack authenticity but it does make the film more enjoyable than some of the worn-out prints we had been used to, which really did not do the film justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but I cannot call it Hitch's \\"masterpiece\\"","review":"There is no doubt about it: Vertigo IS one of Hitchcock's best movies, but is it his \\"masterpiece\\"? In my opinion, no it is not. It could be a matter of personal taste, but I thought Psycho, Rear Window, & North by Northwest were all better movies. I would even say that Strangers on a Train is a better movie than Vertigo. Don't misunderstand me, this is a great movie and if you're any kind of a movie fan, I suggest that you get it as soon as you possibly can. It's just my opinion that there are better, more entertaining Hitchcock movies out there.As far as the film's presentation on DVD is concerned, I was extremely impressed. It was hard for me to believe that the movie is as old as it is when watching it. If you have a DVD player and opt for the VHS version, you are really doing yourself (and the movie) a great injustice. Of course, this applies to almost any movie that is available on both DVD & VHS"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest thriller ever made","review":"The Master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, presents his most discussed, controversial, personal, but also best work with Vertigo, a perfectly timed and perfectly crafted film filled with Hitch's usual great cliche's and characters of fear and dispair.Jimmy Stewart, in one of his finest roles, plays a retired detective, hired to follow an old school mates wife. Unfortunately, he falls in love with her, and that's just the beginning of this spinning, twisting and spectaculary awesome suspenser with falling from heights being used to great use and Bernard Hermann's score being equally memorable. Must, must, must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing Look Into the Human Mind","review":"This is one of my most favorite of film's from Hitchcock's great legacy. I still remember how surprised I was by the way the movie ended. Of course you expect a happy ending for the movie.However, one should learn to never underestimate Hitchcock. I love how artistic this movie is. And how it takes a life on it's own.There is so much wonderful suspense in it. I also love the background music.

Jimmy Stewart plays his part even better than in Rear Window, and this was the first time I had seen Kim Novak in a movie - she was wonderful! At first I expected her to be a pretty face and an enticing voice, but she was so much more than that, proving to be a versatile actress, in a demanding role!The movie kept me hooked throughout - I forgot where I was; nothing mattered but the film. In typical Hitchcock style, the film is thrilling and mysterious, and leaves you changing your mind about the plot every few minutes. He knew exactly how to keep you guessing and keep you enthralled.See this if you haven't already - they don't make 'em like this anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an old movie","review":"This is just an old movie that has been remade in different ways over and over and over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were we watching the same movie?","review":"This film was on my \\"must-see\\" list for years because of its great reputation. I finally watched after a co-worker raved about it, and I must say that I have never encountered a more overrated film. It started very well and I had high hopes for it. Many scenes were indeed hypnotic and beautiful, but they just went on too long. I was still intrigued, though, and a great ending would have banished my doubts. The finale, though, was so abrupt and ludicrous that I laughed out loud...and then my jaw dropped in disbelief that this was actually the end of the film.At the time of its release, this film was not warmly received; now it makes lists of the top ten films of all time. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinkaroo!","review":"Do not buy this movie or waste two hours of your precious time watching it.

Trite, hackneyed, banal - I could go on and on. I hardly blame Ms. Hedren, and I could cry for Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock is the major culprit here, my friends, to his everlasting shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated. Don't expect much from it.","review":"This movie must be one of the most highly overrated movie. I liked Hitchcock's Psycho very much but was totally dissapointed with this one.To begin with, the movie is very slow. It is unnecessarily lengthy and the story is unbelievable.

They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerized the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated (Roger Ebert).<<<Anybody who cares for the above will be happy with Vertigo, whoever doesn't will find her- or himself in a minority.

I will probably never play this game again. If you want a good platformer Mario's 2-D games are AWESOME and Super MArio 64 DS. I have yet to try Mega Man.

Sure the controlling is a little odd once in awhile and the sound leaves a lot to be desired but, COME ONE, Sonic rocks! To me, Mario was great, but Sonic was much, much better. Not only did he go wicked fast but he was cool, had attitude and a sense of humor. The worlds were challenging and fun and filled with inventive ideas.

Vincent D'Onofrio is the diehard military man out to destroy him. Madeleine Stowe is Sinise's physician wife who wants to stand by her man regardless. Tony Shalhoub has a very brief role as Sinise's best friend, and Mekhi Pifer is an underground rebel who helps Sinise out.The visual effects are stunning and beautifully filmed.

Originally intended as one-third of a short story anthology, the studio called an audible midway through production and stretched it to a feature length by itself. The lack of preparation is crippling, as bad effects, terrible scenery, atrocious dialog and a heavily padded plot are exposed and emphasized by the longer running time. Sinise's character, the intended heart and soul of the picture, is incendiary and unlikeable, a standoffish prick who makes an already-bad position worse for himself in almost every situation. The awful lines he spits (seriously, the worst-written dialog this side of The Room) aren't helped by a hyperactive editor, switching angles several times in a single sentence.

First of all, I have no idea when they released it in the movies but it must have been on a day when I was sick at home. Why didn't this get a bigger release? Very nice depiction of the Philip K dick world of the future. Bleak, with suspiciousness and with questions about what is real at every step of the way. Great build up and great ending. All actors did a very nice job and the scenes and sets were extremely believeable. The idea of identity (always a Dick favorite), and who we REALLY are is present throughout. For Dick fans everywhere. This is a must. The best interpretation since Blade Runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Volume","review":"Terrific work is being done by David Gordon; as a fellow author in the SOLDAT/GI/TOMMY/CANUCK series, I must say Gordon's work is much superior to my own, including much more primary research and hands on with the actual uniforms and equipment. Some minor errors of fact are present, but readers must understand that the purpose of works like this is to get the community talking and discussing. Many items that were commonplace in 1944 are a mystery to us today; thanks to the efforts of authors like Gordon, the mysteries are slowly being unravelled. Good photography and clear descriptions overcome any weaknesses in research, which are minor. Recommended to airborne collectors in particular, and priced right for the general interest reader as well.Some notes on the book can be found at my site at http://www.canadiansoldiers.com under BACKGROUND ON BOOKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously disappointed","review":"This book lacks focus -- excuse the pun. There is commentary regarding 35mm, medium format and large format cameras, as well as digital. Yet, I believe, the major audience probably does not use all three. It would be more useful to concentrate on one format, perhaps the most popular.There is no correlation between the text and the images. The images are awful when it comes to truly supporting the concepts that are in the text. The text is equally poorly written.Don't get me wrong, there is some valuable information in this book, but it's hard to find and it's not easily extracted."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEAD","review":"I THOUGHT THIS BASSINET WAS PERFECT FOR MY BABY GIRL. UNFORUNTALY WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS BROKEN IN SEVERAL PLACES. I DID SEND IT BACK AND RECIEVED A NEW ONE. THE BEDDING LOOKS VERY ELEGENT ONLINE BUT IT IS VERY MISLEADING. MINE HAS A LITTLE GIRL CHRILDREN FISHING AND CLIMBING TREES. NOT WHAT I PICTURED FOR MY DAUGHTER. I AM GOING TO BUY DIFFERET FABRIC AND MAKE A DIFFERNT LOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as cute as pictured","review":"I thought this was the cutest bassinet ever, but I read the bad reviews & decided I must see one in person before I buy it. I have to say I am not buying it. It just is not real sturdy and the matress is the really cheap one that comes with your changing table but no one uses. My husband said he could fix all of the problems but for this amount of money I think it should come ready to use. The screw holes are a major eyesore and the wood is flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's beautiful","review":"I got this as a gift at my shower.. Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one. I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it. Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on.Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling all Third Day fans!","review":"If you like Third Day, you will love this album. Lots of traditional Christmas songs we all know and love sung by the one and only Mac Powell! Has an amazing depth of feeling praising our Lord Jesus at Christmastime! I had this cd playing in my house everyday before Christmas this past year. Relaxing, uplifting, inspiring....The album is one of my faves and is so enjoyable that I didn't pack it up after Christmas this year. I will listen to it all year long. A must have to add to your Christmas music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Day - Christmas Offering","review":"Fantastic collection of both original and traditional christmas music. It would be hard to believe that you will not enjoy this music."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unbiased review","review":"I like some of Third Day's music, especially their latest CD, but I would not consider myself a fan. You will only like this CD if you are a Third Day fan; but it really isn't a very good Christmas CD. It sounds like a Christmas CD they made just because, but there is no life to these classic songs besides stylistic differences. I have heard all of these carols redone millions of times over with more life in them then here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL OFFERING FROM THIRD DAY!","review":"Third Day's \\"Christmas Offerings\\" album is an excellent addition to the holiday music genre. The band gives some charged up arrangements of great traditional songs, while offering three new ones to the mix. \\"Born in Bethlehem\\" is the best of the new ones: a rockin' new song that reminds us what this holiday is all about. These new songs and fresh, new renditions of Christmas favorites are sure to please. As a fan of the band, and of great Christmas favorites, I recommend this album to everyone!Grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Christmas CD","review":"This CD is a very nice Christmas CD in the Southern Rock vein. If you're looking for a really traditional Christmas CD, this isn't the one for you, but if you're tired of the standard renditions of the standard Christmas songs, you may wish to grab this one and try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine Mac Powell Singing Silent Night","review":"This is an album that almost every big name christian artist is bound to release. That fact could have really hurt this album, except Third Day does it the best. Any fan of Third Day (and Christmas Music) will love this album. One thing keeps it for being perfect.... the origianl content isn't all that great. The songs that Mac or other members of the band, wrote are just generic or boring. With that said the track O Holy Night is the best version of that song and is worth the price of admission alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Day Christmas album","review":"I bought this album after hearing one of Third Days songs on youtube, I really have enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Kitten Harness with Mini Connectors Instead","review":"I bought the Feather Tether Bird harness for my Cockatoo. This device works but is unnecessarily difficult to use. The metal clasps require you to use your fingernail to actuate, blindly under a feathered wing. The clasps swivel too, so it takes 5x as long to put this on your bird than a simple kitten harness with tough plastic connector mechanisms. My bird didn't mind the harness once it was on. And actually he liked the whole fiddling process because of all the extra attention. However, my patience was wearing out. I bought a similar styled kitten harness for less that uses the clip connectors you see on luggage except these are size appropriate. With 2 clips the kitten harness was on (3 swivel metal clips for the Feather Tether) and was equally suitable. The kitten harness came with a little bell which my Cockatoo removed after a few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Classic","review":"The whole time I read this book I imagined hearing it from a master story teller in a quiet tavern surrounded by other entranced listeners. I am an avid reader and this will forever be a story I remember. I want my children to read this book and enjoy the cultural tapestries that are spun throughout this book as much as I have. It's story much like The Princess Bride in that the Characters are loveable and adventure waits around every turn. It even teaches a few well learned lessons about cultural differences. Brilliant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Costain's best work.","review":"This book was a bit of a let down after reading some of Mr. Costain's other works. Somehow I never connected with many of the characters and the story line didn't hold my attention. That being said, I am a fan of Mr. Costain - but he has written other books far more deserving of your time than The Black Rose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Version","review":"Make sure you check out the sample of this version of Sandburg's poetry. The formatting makes the poems totally unreadable. I would suggest you avoid buying this version unless you just want to waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I sing of Chicago glad and big The people 'Yes'","review":"Sandburg is direct and strong and clear. This collection of poems first published in 1916 has as its signature poem \\"Chicago''. Chicago, the toolmaker, meat butcher, stacker of wheat the great brawler of the cities is at once Sandburg's home and posture to the world. Sandburg can also write tenderly as of the famous \\"Fog\\" that comes in on 'little cats feet' and with moving power of love ( Tell me in the grave, if the lovers are the losers) and war( Shovel them high at Ypres... I am the dust I cover them all) .He is a poet of the American experience, the American street and its people . And he is like the beloved Lincoln he would write a long biography of, a man of the people whose poetry is truly for the people.The People Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sauce","review":"I thought it was be good and it surprised me: It is VERY GOOD sauce.

There are a few songs on this album that are worth a listen (e.g. Iron Curtain), but overall it lacks originality, a sound of its own.If you like this kind of 80's, very US/macho thrash metal, I would advise you to check out Nasty Savage, Exodus (Bonded by Blood), Savage Grace or Hallow's Eve who were all far better bands than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"As I am always on the lookout for historically-set novels, I stumbled across this book. The concept, setting and descriptions in this book are 5-star. The plot carries through much of the book but loses a little steam at the end. This is not Tom Clancy, but who wants to read that garbage anyway? I look forward to reading the remaining books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a childs classic","review":"My siblings and I recall pretending to be Peter or one of the other characters as we played the original record until well scratched beyond endurance for our mother.
