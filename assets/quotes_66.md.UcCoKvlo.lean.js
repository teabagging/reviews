Does everything I want it to. Using it to bring some AA nimh batteries back up to par or at least pretty close. Do need to have one other charger as some batteries that are still usable will initially register null on this charger as others have noted.

It will also tell you how much charge is in the battery; so one knows how long it likely last. Only has two minor problems; 1 if a battery is over discharged (like left in flashlight with switch on for days), charger won't read battery and so won't charge it (easy workaround-charge with regular charger for hour or so) 2. would be nice if was redesigned to charge C, D and 9 V. batteries, it has the power. Overall the best there is for what it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine as long as you don't need support","review":"The actual charger seems to be working fine, but one of the batteries supplied with it was dud. I tried to contact La Crosse support about it, and had to try twice to even get a response 2 weeks later. From the reply it was obvious no-one read my email. I have yet to hear back again.So, as my title suggests - if you don't anticipate any problems with your purchase, then go ahead and buy, but woe betide you if you need any help from La Crosse, because it's just not there.UPDATE - turns out the battery wasn't dud, just completely discharged, and this charger can't handle that. La Crosse recommended I buy another of their products to fix it! Instead I put the battery in a different charger for a few minutes, then this one was able to handle it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't charge some batteries","review":"The batteries that come with this charger are phenomenal--they last for an almighty amount of time.

The charger reduced the memory effect on the batteries and improved the capacity by more than 60% (my 2.5 A/h batteries were only holding about 1.5 A/h). I used the charger to first tell me the existing capacity. Then I used the REFRESH mode to discharge/charge to full. Very cool. I tried the TEST mode once and gave up. It seemed to be taking a long time, but that was probably user error or impatience.I also love the C and D battery adapters. I've used these in some of my children's older toys and they work great.

Out of two chargers and 16 batteries between them, I had only one battery that goes too low to charge with this charger. I have to stick that battery in an old charger for a minute to bring the voltage up enough for this charger to start sometimes. If this charger is made to revive old batteries, it should start charging even if the voltage is low. Thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome thing to have around","review":"I bought this due to the very scientific reviews already posted. This review is not one of those. I will say, it is not the fastest charger in the world, but I love it. It has repaired batteries I was ready to throw away. The trick is not needing the batteries charged 15 minutes ago. It can take over 10 hours to charge them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"Got a unit that often went into an endless reboot loop at the end of a charge cycle.

I am disappointed as I now need to buy batteries that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great, then it didn't","review":"Purchased the La Crosse battery charger a little more than a year and a half ago. Honestly it was probably overkill for what I wanted - recharging NiMH batteries. The inability to charge batteries at very long voltages was an annoyance, but I lived with it. Unfortunately, about two weeks ago the charger lost the ability to charge any batteries - just shows \\"NULL\\" even if a fully charged battery is inserted. The cost to get the unit evaluated for repair is one cent more than the cost of a new charger from Amazon. Instead I've chosen to go with a basic charger from Sanyo. If that breaks I won't be out a lot of cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of changing prices and long shipping delays","review":"The item is great based on all the review, I just haven't gotten it yet. I ordered it from Amazon on January 13th, 2009. Initially they said I would have it in 9 business days at most. Now they say I won't have it until February 13th, 2009. They also jacked up the price. It used to be 35.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory, but faulty","review":"I received my first unit without some components so Amazon shipped another. The second unit appeared to work fine, except the charging cycle was measured in days, and not hours! In addition, I found that some used batteries would not register as inserted until I charged them in a standard charger first, a very odd requirement.I contacted Amazon to get a replacement. They wrote - \\"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.\\"So it appears that Amazon is getting too many back. I'd avoid this product for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recalled product","review":"I have been wanting one of these for years.Recently the price was the lowest all year so I orders.When I got the item I checked the power adapter and it was the recalled unit IV.It is too bad La Crosse cares little for it's customers.I am sending it back. Amazon is great for making the return easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Crosse BC-9009 Charger","review":"Ordered this charger from Amazon on sale. It was out of stock and took a while to receive it, also One of the AAA batteries was defective when it arrived. Got a null reading when i placed it in the charger. I read online where you could charge it in another charger for a few minutes and then charge it in the La Crosse. Tried this and it worked but in a couple days it was discharged(without being used) and gave a null reading again.So if this charger says its bad, probably need to throw it away.As for the charger itself,it works great. Takes a little getting use to because it has a lot of features.Once you learn it though its quite easy. If you have a lot of rechargeable batteries you probably need this charger.It will weed out the defective batteries and give you the charge capacity of your other batteries.With other chargers you have no ideal if your batteries are good or bad or their charge capacity.I am satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"Just received my charger and was immediate impressed with how useful and intelligent it is. I can verify all the good that has been said about it above and so far I have not seen a single flaw. Just in case I have placed the charger on a piece of granite and it is not below the drapes. Right? I am a photographer so my life revolves around having reliable AA batteries. So i love this charger, if it does not explode in the next few months i will get another. If it does I will get another anyway and ship it to my friend that shoot Cannon. Go Nikon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only charger worth buying","review":"If you don't own this charger expect UNDER charged batteries. This charger charges each battery seperately. Not the case with most, leaving you with undercharged batteries.

Apparently, they shipped a whole batch with power supplies that burst into flames, and they had to be recalled.But after about 4 months of very light usage, it got itself into a mode in which the display flashes and the unit reboots on about a 5 second cycle. It no longer charges batteries at all.Totally useless paperweight POS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good investment","review":"I own about 6 sets of AA batteries for my Pentax K100d. This charger works well to determine which batteries are ready to retire for other uses. I like to be able to monitor the battery voltages and set the charging current. If I send a set thru the refresh recharge cycle and they don't improve on performance then I know their done. I can perform a quick charge by setting current output or let them charge with less when time is not a factor. I also like the trickle charge the batteries get so they are ready to go. Read the manual, it covers everything this charger has to offer. Happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe and easy","review":"Great charger. Lots of advanced features, easy to use for just charging. Default set to very slow charge which is very easy on the battery to preserve longevity. Not designed to be a fast charger, but if you need one get the MAHA 8 cell 2A, kicks butt without overheating.The BC-900 needs a green LED to easily see from a distance when each battery is FULL (completely charged) or I would give it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I really love the individual-battery charging feature - most chargers work in pairs. Since using the new charger I've been getting much better battery life - no more half-filled batteries. The charger also identified a completely dead battery - I've probably been using it in pairs for a while and this explains some of the short lifetimes I've seen. I like the 10% charge maintenance feature - I keep a set in the charger at all times so that I know I have good batteries ready.Has lots of bells and whistles (I love the testing features). However, I can tell the family to just look for the word \\"full\\" and to simply plug in their dead batteries - really easy to use - you don't need to change the defaults most of the time.It is a good buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for two weeks, then melted","review":"Yes, another melted BC-9009. It worked great when I first received it. Probably charged or refreshed six or eight sets of batteries. Then when I was running a refresh cycle (discharge 500 mA, charge 1000 mA) on the included AA batteries it self destructed. Smell of burning plastic, the LCD for the third slot turned completely black and three of the buttons sank into the charger (probably melted inside).Just glad I was at home and could unplug the unit before something caught fire. Obviously there is a quality issue, as many others have reported the same problems. For a time Amazon had pulled availability of the BC-9009, but I see it is for sale from Amazon once again.I sent mine back for a refund. My advice would be to stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Awesome","review":"I had some Radio Shack batteries with a Radio Shack charger that were pretty much dead. Refreshed them in the BC-9009 (which took a couple of days) and they were able to hold a charge again. If you're going to invest in rechargeable batteries, you must have this charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Charger simple to use","review":"Once I read the review about how it took 48 button combinations to get the Maha charger to do the more advanced smart charging, I was sold on this unit. The whole reason to spend the extra money is for the smart charging ability. I have already used this unit to break in batteries, recondition an old one, and just plain charge. I cannot imagine that everytime I put batteries in I could have to enter 48+ button combinations to charge them. I really appreciate the default of changing the settings on all 4 batteries at the same time, but still having the flexibility to change per battery should I need to.On a side note I found out that my six month old Energizer 2300 mAh batteries that I have been using in my Speedlights charge up just past 2300 according to this charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great charger","review":"I use this charger for my Kyosho Mini-Z AAA batteries. It works GREAT. I can adjust the charging time by adjusting the amperage into the batteries. It is fast and efficient.I can also see the condition of the batteries by scrolling through the display and looking at the voltage, charging amps, time charging, and the amount of amps put into each individual battery. It even can discharge the batteries individualy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best charger I've found yet, but not perfect","review":"I've used this charger for the past few months and like it a lot. It has been able to re-juvinate some cells that could hardly hold a charge. Having 4 independent charging circuits for each battery is definately a must. One thing that is a little odd is that the wall power adapter outputs 3 volts into the charger, it is a great switching power adapter (although a little large), but you can't plug the charger into a 12v source like a car lighter. Also, it comes with some plastic adapters that allow you to put AA rechargable batteries in a D or C sized shell, this can be handy, but the charger doesn't charge C or D size batteries. The desciption of the plastic shells had made me think it might have been possible. Its a good charger. I just wish it could work in the car, maybe I'll make my own power adapter for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"Although very technically, it is easy to use once you figure it out. It's not as hard as everyone says. Great product. It brought some of my batteries back to full strength (they wouldn't even charge the flash in my camera using my old charger) and my other cheapo batteries back to more than 75%. As far as a fire hazard goes, I did notice the charger heated up during the full power quick charges, but not enough to cause damage. Besides, it works better with a slow, low charge anyway. I would recoomend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Product","review":"I have 11 or 12 sets of AA cells (4 cells each set). I was getting frustrated that I'd put a fresh set of 4 into my digital camera to have it indicate Low Battery. It always seemed that one of the four batteries was low. I have not had this problem since getting this charger ... it treats each cell individually even telling you how much energy is put into each battery. I really like the variable charge rate and I'm sure I be using the TEST Battery mode too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have.","review":"Before buying this charger I didnt knew much about rechargeable batteries.

No good! Well, except I saw that on the first cycle they only held about 300mAh. Whoa.After about 3 days they finally said \\"full\\", and they were charged right up to the 2700mAh capacity. Now my flash units are ready instantly, and they can shoot for days with no sign of slowing down.The fact that each battery can be charged independently is nice too.I'm a big man... I can admit when I was wrong. In fact, I think I'll buy a second one.Leonardo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charger great, batteries not so much...","review":"The title says it all. The charger is great and worth the money. But the batteries that come with it are a different story. The AA batteries don't fit in any of my devices, remotes, etc. They're too big! The AAA are fine.

Overall, this is a good purchase, just don't count on using the AA rechargeable batteries that come with the charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool charger","review":"I'm having way too much fun with this charger. I've tested many of my old batteries with it. I had bought some inexpensive batteries on ebay, which did not seem to be holding much of a charge. This charger confirmed it. I was able to e-mail the company who sold it to me with details of how bad their batteries were and they gave me a full refund, including shipping. My only regret is that I don't have more devices which need rechargeable batteries so I can play with it some more!Update (5/12/08)- The charger is still great, but the batteries that came with it no longer charge in the unit.

Initially, it worked very well, and the host of features that receives almost universal praise are very nice indeed. I used the unit only intermittently, maybe once a week.About a couple of months ago, the trouble started. Whenever I tried to charge 4 AA batteries at the same time, the charger would continuously reset every 10 seconds or so. This problem has been reported by at least one other reviewer. This problem renders the product virtually useless. If I wait long enough, say overnight, the display would say Full. But since the charge is always shown as 0 mAh, there's no quick and simple way to tell whether the batteries are actually fully charged or not.I discovered that a workaround is to charge only 2 batteries at a time. Nevertheless, because this is a serious problem that occurred after only a short time and infrequent usage, I'd give this product only 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says on the tin.","review":"It works as advertised and has per-battery displays to let you know what's charging, how long it's been charging, and other useful information.

I would not buy again.When I first plugged in the unit, screen was partially blank. Disassembled (4 exterior screws, 4 internal) to find rough plastic molding edges and loose screws, resulting in the lead to LCD not making contact. Cleaned things up, reassembled, worked OK for about twenty charge cycles. Then it melted down, literally -- the casing is distorted, and when I opened it up I found melted plastic under the push buttons.

The only improvement would be if it could work as a stand-alone unit. Then all of a sudden this month, it won't power on anymore. Creative won't do anything for me or the countless other customers who are having the same problem. Go to their forums and search for \\"audigy 2 nx power\\" and you'll see what I'm talking about.Overall I'd say its a risky investment.

You cannot find a digital decoder for under $125 on the internet right now.

It does the conversions in software.This product is missing drivers for Mac OS X and Creative does not plan to provide them. The usb-audio site does not support it either. So it is usable only with Windows. It does start play music in initialization phase for Mac, but then it finds out it is Mac it is talking to and stops. Strange.I gave it 4 stars because it does not advertise working with Mac, but I didn't give it 5, because it just should not actively try not to work with it. Just complying with USB audio standards would be enough to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I was disappointed with this book almost immediately. Having paid $ for this text, I was expecting to see some high quality work. the first thing I noticed was that instead of being a well considered text that takes the reader logically from one topic to the next (as you might expect from a \\"Handbook\\"), its really just a collection of scientific papers written by various authors in the aerospace community over time and then bound together by the \\"author\\".

I ended up buying this one and after using it *twice* the motor just shut off. I returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement. I decided to try juicing carrots and celery, and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again. I might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it. If you are juicing small things, like berries, with larger vegetables/fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade. I know I read these bad reviews and said, \\"oh that won't happen to me\\"... but it did. I hope you choose a different juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few tips for effortless use!","review":"After reading the other reviews, I almost reconsidered my purchase. However, the juicer works great - as long as you follow a few tips.1) Make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on TIGHT! Check once, then check again.2) Don't use the paper filters, particularly if you are juicing in quantity. Once I threw mine in the trash, the balancing issues went away immediately. It makes clean up a little harder, but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use, it's not a big deal.3) If the item being juiced won't go through, be patient, and pulse-push it in. Don't cram it with the pusher.My only concern is that when you juice quantities, so much pulp sticks to the side it's hard for all of the juice out to strain out. It's best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice.Using the above tips - I expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Juicer, but hold on to the lid!","review":"I purchased this juicer about a year ago, and it's been great. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that when it gets unbalanced, you have to make sure to hold the lid on, because it shakes and vibrates a whole lot. The juice is great, the cleanup is easy, if a bit time-consuming, and the motor is very powerful. I'd definitely recommend this juicer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto Shut Off?","review":"I did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation, motor power and style. I exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange/return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds, even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs! It is not the electricity as I have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: this juicer is a weapon","review":"I loved this juicer the first couple of times i used it, it was much much better than my juiceman junior in every possible way (easy to clean, decent noise level, dry pulp, etc) until i had a very unpleasant surprise. As some other people said, the juicer started vibrating and the lid became loose, the noise it made almost gave me an heart attack. Even after turning the juicer off, it took a few minutes for the motor to stop so it kept making that scary noise. I even left the room, i was afraid that the blade could somehow detach itself and hit me.Had it not been for this design flaw, i'd have given it 4 or 5 star. If you wanna buy it for yourself, go ahead, you've been warned but please, do not ever let anyone else use it or worse, don't give it to someone as a gift. I think it should be taken off the market, it's too dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa","review":"The Waring was 300 dollars and was very poor at extracting maximum juice.

One reviewer had problems with seeds so I'm careful to remove the seeds from everything that I juice. Other than that, the product works great and is easy to clean. About a dozen optional paper filters are included with the product and they do a great job and are pretty cheap (less than $10 for 200. 5 cents per filter. They are available by mail order and are probably available in large cities). Once you plug the unit in and turn this baby in, the motor quickly revs up to a hum and you simply put the fruit/vegetable in the hole and push down with the plunger. If you've never juiced before, buy more fruit/vegetable than you would think that you'd need. Engine takes a while to slow to a stop is my biggest gripe, but I just use the time to let the unit squeeze every last drop out.I've joined the juicer owner cult!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well on carrots ... but not much else.","review":"This was the first juicer I purchased and I'm hoping that they're not all like this one. They enclose an advisory telling you to \\"use a forceful motion for hard, firm vegetables\\" and a \\"slow light motion\\" when juicing \\"soft vegetables and fruits\\". I followed this advice and tried the unit four times before giving up. And on the last attempt I only juiced carrots. It would invariably begin to vibrate soon after I began juicing. The most I managed was six carrots before it began to vibrate, which is caused when the basket no longer spins level due to uneven pulp distribution. When this happens the blade begins to grind at the base of the feeder chute.

At times, entire display is off, radio doesn't work at all, or it won't change channels. Then other times it worked. Seems like might be affected by heat outside.

I decided to use the Sheldon Brown method, which requires you to lock your back wheel to a rack or parking meter, making sure you pass through the rear triangle of the frame. A mini u-lock is recommended as it is harder for thieves to work with. However, the lock is so small that, depending where I can find to lock up, I can't get it to close using the Sheldon Brown technique and have to lock up somewhat more insecurely. The cable, while not capable of doing battle with a bolt cutter, is great for locking down my seat post - especially comforting given the rash of bike seat thefts in my area. The 5 included keys are handy so I can leave one at work, home, carry one, etc. Overall, a good value and exactly as described. I just wish I had bought a slightly larger lock given the dimensions of my bike/wheel and what I have to lock to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protection","review":"This u-lock/cable fits my needs to a \\"T\\". The u-lock is just big enough to fit mtn bikes rear wheel and frame and the cable just works to secure my front wheel and seat/rack. It is definitely very solid. Extra sets of keys is a bonus. The mount doesn't secure the u-lock very well though. Comes off too easily but I added a velcro strap sold as a pump strap to secure it completely. The perfect combo for the quick errand or any other short-mid term security. Great price as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Key","review":"I was satisfied with the lock until the key broke within a week of using it. The locking mechanism was jammed and when I gave the key the slightest bit of pressure, a 1cm piece of the key broke inside the lock.

Now its locked outside a shop luckily a block away from my house. I'm afraid of breaking the key. I've walked to my bike on three different occasions to try to jiggle it free. I'm going to try to use motor oil to maybe loosen the pins but in short, unless you want your bike stuck somewhere, where you can't free it without looking like a thief, don't buy this lock"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible lock enclosure","review":"After using this lock for only two days i accidentally dropped the lock from a foot or less off the ground only to have the whole casing for the lock come off. After trying to put it on for 15 minutes i finally gave up figuring out that the plastic holding (yes it is plastic, not rubber as you would think) the enclosure together was broken.Now i have a naked lock that is probably going to rust and have my key break off in it anytime soon. If you take off the plastic enclosure you see that all that technology that onguard claims to have is basically a cheap mastercraft lock with a plastic enclosure to conceal its true identity.Bottom line if you want a durable lock which doesn't have cheap components and might last you more than a day. For those of you who think you won't drop it, think again. You will try to lock it but the locking mechanism doesn't hold the lock and you let go (at least this is what happened to me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lock","review":"I just got this Pitbull mini. I must say it is hefty. Seems pretty bullet proof. I did not have any problems with the key as others' had stated in the reviews. It did come with like 5 keys so I'm hoping not to really need them all. The one drawback and really it's just because I don't have the allen wrenches is that it doesn't come with the ones you need to mount the lock so I have to go to the store to get the tools needed to mount it but overall very happy with the quality. One thing is be careful, once it's locked there is only about 5.5 inches and that has to wrap around some part of your bike and the bicycle rack so you have to be a little creative.

I ride my bicycle 5 days a week and move it about 6 times a day (so the lock gets used 12 times a day), and I always bring my bike inside if it's going to rain. After about two weeks, I inserted the key and the lock simply would not turn. I tried using WD-40 on it with still no luck.

The metal of the keys are \\"soft\\", easy to be bent when rotating inside the lock for the purpose of locking and unlocking. Once they are bent, it becomes a \\"tricky\\" task for locking and unlocking. Typically I paid more than one minute for this process every time, and I am surprised to find every key (they give us four) has same problem. Even worse, I just got my key broken into two halves when trying to unlock it, and one half got firmly stuck inside the tiny little hole of the lock. I had to use a saw to cut the lock off to get my bike back. I feel depressed and angry.

UNFORTUNATELY, the key does snap off and or jam irreversibly with literally almost zero effort on behalf of the user.Thank God I was able to unlock the thing with my key still jammed into the hole after trying to lock up to a tree near my apartment. I now have the option of using both pieces as paperweights for separate, lightweight, easily blown materials, or I can stick the two pieces together to hold down heavy duty things like tagboard, or perhaps a single cardboard box.

I know the small size makes it stronger, but that half inch would help soooo much. I need the cable to lock my front wheel, and to lock to anything that is not a bike rack.It's begun to rust everywhere. I ride my bike in the light rain, and the inside of the lock is fully rusted.

Tape mechanism has not completely stopped working (yet), but within 30 days tapes began playing in supper slow motion. More so near the midway point of my 90min cassettes than at beginning or end. It takes around 1 1/2 hours to listen to a 40min audiobook (ie the tape motor doesn't have enough strength to play a brand new tape even with new batteries in the unit).Moral of the story: You can't always trust a name brand.

To sum up I just want to say that Velvet is my favorite human character she's the smart one and Silk deserved what he got!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...Boring...boring...","review":"The characters (Characters?) are Boring, Pace of the book is Boring, Ending is Boring, Action (Action?) is Boring, Whole series is boring. Eddings is not a writer, he just misuses people who are into fantasy. Who published this? Who is the editor? Can't I give Minus stars on Eddings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst culmination of a series","review":"The Seeress of Kell ends a fairly unnecessary series with the lamest climax of any fantasy series I have ever read. After meandering through the previous four books, this series ends with a decided thud. I enjoyed the Belgariad but the Malloreon lacked adventure, excitement and intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Real Adventure","review":"The real adventure was reading this book without reading any of the previous 4 books, and enjoying every word of it.Nearly every angle of epic-fantastic-magic novel is present here, offering a very interesting and surprising plot. Powerfulwizards, a raising god, love & hate and ... oops, the future of the universe.You have had no life at all if you have not read this book. So go and buy it here at Amazon Books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"David Eddings may be the most lazy author in print. All the \\"good natured bantering\\" in this book is lifted verbatim from the first book and endlessly repeated through the next nine. His characters are never in any real danger and calmly take on 2,3, or even 10 times their number with only a scratch or two. I wonder how the Angaraks could ever be considered a threat when the heroes dispose of them in such an offhand manner. The second five books have virtually the same plot as the first five. This series is like a bad song for me; I can't get it out of my head. And how about the companion who dies?! He chickened out and killed off the least interesting and important character. If you are looking for a good fantasy series, don't read this one. Try Tad Williams' \\"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn\\" or George R.R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\", which is looking like it will be a great series (people actually get hurt and die)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Over the course of these books, Eddings has gotten more and more anti-feminist and more and more racist. One direct quote from the protagonist, was, \\"You have to be firm. [The Orb]'s like a dog or a horse, sometimes--or even a woman.\\"I've become more and more agitated by Eddings' ability to bring up these strong, powerful female characters, then absolutely demolish them with a simple phrase. Polgara, an amazingly strong sorceress, becomes \\"one of the ladies\\" during fights and cannot bear to watch the fighting. Vella, a feisty little competent dagger-wielding slave girl is slowly turned into a \\"fine lady\\" and then has to be protected by her owner from men in a bar by putting on a collar and leash. It's like the reverse of normal books--he takes strong-willed woman and mercilessly subdues them.Two stars because the main villain is female. I haven't finished quite yet, so I'm sure she'll eventually fall due to her \\"frail femininity.\\"Bleh."},{"rating":"1","title":"No surprises here","review":"They finally reach the final battle. Even the characters in this book admit the battle and the series is just like the Belgarion series. That's pathetic. You should already know who wins and what happens.They finally get to the Place Which is No More, and in an utterly anti-climactic scene, good defeats evil, and a new God is made.The ending is boring, surreal, unsatisfying, and actually occurs in the middle of the book. The reader must endure an extra hundred pages of fluff about weddings and ships in order to finish this series.After reading this whole series, I felt like I wasted a good 40 hours of my life. Like me, you'll probably never touch a David Eddings' book again.If you are curious, just ask someone about the series. They should be able to explain it all in about two minutes. No joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that about?","review":"For readers who aren't already wondering what the point to the previous four books was, this final volume will bring the question leaping dazzlingly to mind as the climax comes to revolve around a 50/50 jackpot that nothing which came before will influence. Follow that with the longest anti-climax ever written for a fantasy series (the story is essentially over halfway through), then ponder how this unnecessary 2nd series, so blatantly obviously written for the money, won over so many fans.(Note in the interest of fairness: I did not read the earlier Belgariad series.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put it down - Great story","review":"Because of the topic, I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did.

It's a very touching, personal, well written diary, really. Updike is very open about having been self-conscious his whole life due to a skin condition he had that isolated him quite frequently as he tried to fight it by lying in the sun. The book is a revelation about the famous writer and how his life revolved around this condition and the self-consciousness it engendered.

I liked it so much I didn't even begrudge the money I spent having a handiman install it (no way could I have done this myself). So I was really crushed when one evening, the CD simply stopped working. I tried all the remedies described in the operating instructions, but eventually was forced to take it down (no small feat in itself). Though the machine is still under warranty, Sony's online repair service told me that it will be replaced with a factory refurbished model--not a new replacement.

That is a nice plus for a very sweet book. I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand and speak Thai and Lao (though not as well as I used to) and that gives me a connection to Southeast Asia and the Hmong. The Hmong themselves are a wonderful people and they are very assertive of their heritage. They will speak Lao with me but remind me very firmly that they are Hmong, not Lao! I respect that.

The four tracks recorded here rise from the \\"ambient zen meditation\\" to the \\"dadaist paroxism\\". Here there are no chordal structure, it's just free improvisational music with some of the greats moments in the history of \\"kraut rock\\" history.

(After Christmas sale.) I got it home and after ten minutes of attempting to thread the cheap, malleable base (the part that fits down onto the motor) onto the glass container, I gave up, stuffed it back in the box and returned it. I thought I'd see if it was just a lemon, but I could not remove the base on the display model. Either it was glued on, or once on, it's difficult to remove. I didn't bother to read the reviews here, but I've given the stainless base and glass container, I was not expecting such a cheap base. Truly, what's wrong with appliance makers? Do they really think that designed obsolesce means we're going to buy a new product of theirs when the old one fails after six months to a year?

We sent the blender to a factory-authorized repair shop (we paid the shipping), and it broke down 3-months later. We bought a cheap-chinese made blender for $..., and it's still working a year later.

I have only used it for smoothies (frozen banana cut into thirds, frozen strawberries, frozen blueberries, frozen spinach, milk, peanut butter--no ice) a couple times per week. This morning, mid-blend, the motor sounded strained, emitted a smoky odor, and I saw light reflecting from the motor onto my kitchen counter. Then, it stopped working completely!! It will not turn on any more.I am very disappointed in the life-span of a blender that I paid a reasonable price for expecting it to last for years. The carafe is a nice, heavy glass, solid and easy-to-use parts, easy to clean. But...The motor should last for at least the warranty period of 5 years, not 1 month.

I read the reviews on Amazon.com and thought that paying extra for such a highly-regarded piece of kitchen equipment would be a no-brainer. I was sorely mistaken.One look at the Waring Kitchen Classic or Professional blender and you'll know that the Waring brand name doesn't mean quality. Everything was flimsy plastic and rubber, except for the blade and the blade bent after I made a few smoothies. The glass container was fine, but my \\"cheap\\" Oster had a glass container aswell. My \\"cheap\\" Oster also had all metal (stainless steel and brass) drive with a rigid/hard plastic retainer ring.Your expectations for a blender may be completely different than others' expectations so take the reviews on Amazon.com with a grain of salt. My (non) advice is to find a store that carries Waring, like Macy's, and take a look at how the Waring is constructed and then make your own decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to Target","review":"Not impressed for the money.

The second thing I noticed was that it doesn't make a good smoothie. (I use frozen bananas and it takes forever to blend them if at all.) The third thing is it doesn't have a pour spout.

Why did I quit using it in the first place. $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie. $79 for this Waring and it crashed and burned on me.

I decided to make a daquiri using the simple recipe of a Bacardi mixer, rum and ice. I've done this in an el cheapo Osterizer by pre-crushing the ice with an ice crusher. The selling point for this was that I could just put in the ice cubes and skip the extra step.I heard the same loud noise, and the same funky smells, as other reviewers. Further, looking at the rubber-covered wheel on the base which is supposed to drive the blades, the rubber was peeled and disintegrated, and moreover, there were small chips of metal all over the place. After one use.I have difficulty believing that this is just a fluke, especially with these other reviews.I wouldn't call this product \\"Professional\\" at all, and I'm surprised that Waring is still trying to sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks great but it won't last!","review":"My husband and I received this blender as a wedding gift.

The manager at the local Chef's Catalogue store wouldn't recommend any other blender, even though she was out of stock at the time and I was there with money to burn.

I plugged the unit in and flipped on the switch-- PRESTO-- there was a loud hum, the motor was smoking, and the blade sat frozen in the blender. I try to find the humor in this, but cannot. I'm returning this defective piece of garbage for a full refund. Frankly, I've never purchased an appliance that wasn't carefully tested in the factory before being shipped out to the consumer.

But it leaked after the first use (granted, I probably should have checked it first to make sure the parts were screwed on tightly). The most irritating part is that I like to drop almonds and pecans into my smoothies. My old blender (not the same brand) blended them so smoothly I couldn't notice them in the smoothie. This thing left big chunks of almonds and pecans. And, for the price, it's not as sturdy as I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"Straight out of the box, I immediately noticed that the removable plastic seal/rotor assembly was rather flimsy for such an otherwise robust unit. My first blending task was a rather modest smoothy: 5 ice cubes, 1/2 cup milk, 1 banana. After roughly five seconds, it was obvious that the blender was not going to be adequate for even this minute job; five seconds later there followed smoke and the crackling of an electrical burnout.A brief perusal of the other reviews will indicate that my experience has been, to some degree, shared by others as well. Presumably, when the unit works, it works quite well, but with such blatantly poor quality control, should you even bother to take the chance?

It awakens something universal, and is as modern as can be. It belongs to the paradigm shift that is now taking place at all levels of science and religion, because the deeper meaning in it is all about creating reality, of the infinite magic of our thoughts, of the quantum, unified field of expanded consciousness ( yes I have read What the Bleep Do We Know).It's all about possibilities. It's all about the imagination; about the power of passion, about the folly of religion, about our desires created by our emotions, and how they make us prisoners. It's about progress too, about the future, and our lack to believe in it. It's also about god, and false gods, and the folly of man, the things that we know, which the gods do not, about the meaning of paradise, and where it can be found on earth.

For #2 --a 9/10 so far. NO sticking and burning, #3. Food seems to be cooking evenly and I can neglect it during cooking for a few mins and nothing bad happens so 8/10 here too.

It certainly had the makings of an interesting read but Dan Brown never really rolled them into a coherent whole. Indeed, Dan Brown gave little indication tht he even tried to do so.It begins with a fairly promising subject matter and the basics of interesting character development. Regrettably, beginning is as far as it goes. The ostensibly intelligent characters prove to be dull and addicted to doing stupid things. Those stupid things compel clumsy manipulations of the increasingly disjointed plot.The childish disorder was vexing, almost a threat to serenity. It was a relief to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reeker","review":"This is a piece of absolute trash.

It was more than disappointing. Anyone who has any kind of knowledge about the history of cryptography or mathematics will know from the start that the premise is bogus. The writing reminds me of a TV show. You can practically hear the music swell at a tense or touching moment. I found the characters to be thin and unbelievable ... charactures rather than characters.If you're looking for escapism and don't want to think too hard about what you're reading, then you'll enjoy this.

I realize it's supposed to be *fiction* and the research was conducted prior to 1998, but come on, Mr Brown, with all due respect, get a clue.

The plot is predictable and the characters are stupid (even though they hold degrees I can only dream of).

I felt as though Brown was trying to fill up space in several scenes especially at the end. He goes at length to describe the simplest things creating a lot of overkill. With The Davinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point I never wanted to skip chapters just to avoid reading something I had already read.

I was disappointed, however, because of the lack of character development. The main characters seemed remarkably similar to those in da Vinci Code without the same depth. The plot is good, but not a page turner. Lastly, the \\"villians\\" were \\"lack luster.\\" It seems that Brown used more foul language and seediness to make up for real content and excitement. I was so disappointed I didn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"for a \\"smart\\" book, it's pretty dumb","review":"What I mean is, the book talks on and on about how brilliant the protagonists are - a head professor of linguistics, a brilliant cryptographer -- but these are the dumbest smart people ever.

The narrator is decent, though.This book review is of the unabridged audiobook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typing, and bad typing at that","review":"I made my bones by reading all of Brown's novels: da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Deception Point, and Digital Fortress, so listen up:1. Awkward phrasing? Check.2. Cardboard characters copied from previous DB book? Check.3. Totally bogus technology or theology? Check.4. Implausible motivations? Check.I actually enjoyed da Vinci Code, at least the first time through, but Brown's novels get progressively worse. I donated my copies of A&D; and DP to my gym's library, but with Digital Fortress I did something I've only done once before: I burned it.In Mark Twain's essay \\"The Literary Crimes of James Fenimore Cooper\\" he lists the 19 (some say 21) rules of composition, and states that Cooper achieved a record 15 violations in the space of 2/3 of a page. Brown beats that record every time.Try \\"Eye of the Needle\\" or \\"Day of the Jackal\\" if you want a good page-turner thriller.

I, like many, became introduced to Dan Brown with the DaVinci Code... and having read that I decided to work backwards through his novels. While I do feel that Brown essentially writes the same book over and over (same outline, same character construction) he usually manages to make it interesting.This book could have been, but it is so utterly predicable that I could have stopped half way through (and mentally did) and finish it. I only kept reading it with the hope that he would fool me - he didn't. I knew the password for the elevator long before it was divulged, knew who the \\"bad guy\\" was from about chapter three, knew the \\"unlock code\\" as soon as the first hint was given - something that took the NSA characters another five or six tedious pages to figure out.Brown turns his intelligent characters into drooling idiots in this novel.

There were a lot of technical holes in the plot that just didn't make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written","review":"Plot is a mindless string of cliches. From the technical standpoint, the book is filled with nonsensical mumbo jumbo that will immiediately annoy anybody who's ever used a computer.

What a disappointment this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, bad writing","review":"After reading DA VINCI CODE, I figured any other book Dan Brown wrote would be great. Wrong. DIGITAL FORTRESS has a great and exciting premise but the writing was horrible. Many, if not all, the paragraphs start out the same way with the same sentence structure. A lot of the sentences are actually the same thing with different words in place.Read it for the story but don't expect a decent writing style. Don't waste your money. Borrow it from the library or a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A parody, I hope","review":"This book combines a mediocre thriller, an average mystery, a delusional romance and a terrible computer security assessment all in one barely readable, bloated package. I'm glad Dan Brown is now fat and wealthy from \\"the Da Vinci code,\\" because clearly he needs a different job than \\"writer.\\" There are numerous technical errors in the book, poor descriptions of computer security and coding, and other illusions that I might expect from a TV afterschool special but not from a bestselling author. Brown should pay attention to Crichton and Gibson before doing this again. I would not recommend this book to anyone (unless they had a paperless outhouse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this were the real NSA, the world would be in trouble","review":"I have spent many years working for the government with people who possess high clearances (top secret and higher) and this is what I have to say about the book:1. Haven't finished it yet. I'm around page 300 and something and I may finish it out of morbid curiosity.2. I'm still trying to figure out what the physical attractiveness of the protagonists has to do with anything.3. The dialogue is full of sexual innuendo and there's a high degree of overt sexual harassment that seems to be going on which, in the real world, would almost never happen.4. Susan Fletcher is an idiot. There is no indication in the portrayal of her character why she is considered brilliant.5. The character Hale would never be allowed within 10 miles of the NSA in reality.If all the people in the story were portrayed as realistic people in this industry, I would find the story of their inner struggles riveting as the story unfolds.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless attempt at articulating the science of Cryptography","review":"This book has so many holes in the plot line, it will make you cringe if you know anything about Cryptography, software programming, or network security. The perceived hacker attacks that Dan Brown orchestrates are plain dumb.Setting aside all that, his characters are also hard to relate to. The cheif of the NSA Cryptography who spent all his life working hard to get to where he is now, is willing to give up everything in an instant for a woman by murdering her fiance?. Even more unbelievalbe is that this character choses for a password that girl's name. Common! Head of NSA Crypto, uses the name of someone he knows as his password? They teach a secretary at a paper factory not to do that.After reading both Angels & Demons and Digital Fortress, I find a pattern that attributes the catastrophic failure of a great man to a crush on the hot, smart girl who is in love with someone else. I wonder if this stems from personal experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown lite by Dan Brown","review":"2.5 stars. This author's non-Robert Langdon narrated books such as Digital Fortress and Deception Point definitely lack the sizzle of his mega-hit The DaVinci Code and the almost as entertaining Angels and Demons.

The story line is like a serial comic book..incredible coincidences, one narrow escape after another, fantastic turns of events. Many characters are billed as super geniuses and yet make moronic mistakes that would be considered stupid for even the average Joe.The \\"science\\" is a little bit of real technology mixed with a lot of half truths and outright garbage.

The writing is riddled with cliches, I expect the phrase \\"he turned on his heel\\" in high school essays but not a best seller.Predictable:The plot was almost totally predictable. I think I figured it out after a couple of dozen pages. Usually with a Dan Brown novel it's the guy you least suspect that has a hand in it. So save yourself the trouble and just look for that character early on.Unrealistic:The idea of a graphical display of the hackers penetration is laughable. If you can identify them you can stop them.Tedious:The hunt for the **** was tiresome in the extreme.

Good Read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast paced thriller poops out..........","review":"The first 75% of this book is fast-paced with lots of action and numerous plot twists. Then, it sort of dies. The lame \\"riddle\\" that must be solved by the government computer nerds at the end of the story regarding the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs is just plain dumb and the characters, who were somewhat intelligent up until that point, take stupid pills. Also, as was mentioned by some of the other reviewers, the revisionist history/political correctness in condemning America's \\"despicable\\" act using the bombs on Japan gets tiresome. The bombs ended the war; a war that was killing 35,000 US servicemen each week. Too bad the author flubbed at the end.

This book got carried away at the hype after he became a best seller, but trust a fan...This is not a good book from Dan Brown..You would definatelly enjoy Da Vinci Code, Angel's & Demons, Deception Point and others...Oh, I do love computers and not even that helped me like the book more, with the story evolving among this subject..:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmitigated drivel","review":"Where to start ? I started with the Da Vinci code. As a friend expressed it \\"Indiana Jones in book form\\". The book was exciting but TOO far-fetched for my liking. Waiting for a train, I bought Digital Fortress - BIG mistake. The book is ridiculously predictable, from the \\"rugged handsome\\" looks of the hero (yes, even that tired old cliché got included), to the usual professional assassin who never fails, but still manages to do so half a dozen times when up against a language teacher, to the heroine who knows the answer to it all, wants to tell her boss, but is told \\"Not now, Susan \\", whereupon this strong, brilliant cryptographer shuts up !!!!!And I LOVE the ending. I never knew it was possible to look at a screen showing hackers trying to break into a system, and KNOW that, yes, they's managed to get some information, but only partially.

A rather chaotic screenplay I may add. It is fast-paced, yes (there are 128 chapters, i.e. approximately that number of scene changes), but it is hardly a thriller. The parts of the plot that are not predictable are simply because they are too incredulous and unbelievable to be predicted. The worst is the ending. After more than a hundred chapters you find out you've just been led on a wild-goose chase, the \\"code\\" the characters have been seeking stares at you in print but the characters only realize it 10 pages later, and the epilogue, the epilogue...

Don't get me wrong, it is a good book and a fast read but there were several things that decreased the overall enjoyment of this book. For one the action seemed forced and the book was fairly predictable, also the book describes the NSA as being a mega powerful, top secret agency with far reaching powers but during the course of the book it seems as though this agency wasn't powerful nor even intelligent. In fact we only see three agents for most of the book. If you need to pass time on a flight or read a book while waiting for your doctors appointment, get this.

A good closure is the heart of any good novle. This book, while writen pritty well fails on most fronts. Were I nsa, I'd never have hired most of these people. Susan reminds me of a chick from <fill in the blank> horor flick. She's frightened and acts like a blond bimbo. Greg just goes nuts and doesn't act like I'd immagin he would. Dave, the perfect companion to sexy Susan should have been killed! The killer, like in so many books keeps f...ing it up. One can't miss that many times if one is good. The ending, the closure is stereotipical. Down to the write and the day is saves. There is no sence of the events really hitting this cast of characters, no real aftermath. The only thing that's of some interest is the reader's digest historical lesson on cryptography. Though things are simplified, and the nsa isn't as secret as he would lead us to believe.

I have begun MUCH more skeptical about his other books as a results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violates Laws of Physics, Mathematics and Common Sense","review":"In Digital Fortress, Dan Brown violates laws of physics, mathematics and common sense page after page. The author displays a blatant lack of knowledge in both cryptography and computer science in his creation of a plot more reminiscent of a cheap action movie.

When the adventures of the college professor (incredibly sent by the NSA to Spain to retrieve a critical decryption key) reveal him to be more capable and spy-savvy than James Bond and able to not only avoid but kill a trained assassin, credibility goes out the window.The author apparently thought that an abundance of exclamation marks would satisfy the criteria for a thriller, but the net effect reminded me of a juvenile Hardy Boys tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid book. Waste of time","review":"Dan Brown's Digital Fortress is an unfortunate attempt at throwing together a quick and dirty thriller novel. It seems as if throughout the novel he uses tidbits of information gathered off a single website regarding internet and computer security systems. Given the amount of research that went into THE DA VINCI CODE (which borrowed in part from ANGELS AND DEMONS), the \\"research\\" in this book is embarrassing. Grabbing snippets of geekspeak and hacker terms and molding it to a weak plot did not make the book a techo-thriller. It made it look rather confused and disjointed. The technical inaccuracies (confabulations) aside (the book was full of them), the lack of proper character development as well as the choppy flow of the action in the book made me think this was Dan Brown's first attempt at writing. What went wrong, Dan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have...","review":"I don't read often, in fact I think this was only the second or third book I've read cover to cover. Why 5 stars?

This book fell FAR short. The plot twists are very clumsy and obvious. The plot revolves around cryptography and the internet. Brown made two flaws (well, the same flaw with two facets) he included too much detail in the methods that the technology in his plot used. For people who are technical, and understand how cryptography actually works, the book is painful to read, because he has major fundamental flaws with the way that crypto works. Suspension of disbelief is totally trashed. For people who aren't technical, the details he includes add no value, and are too confusing to understand. If he had been more vague, both groups would have been better off.For a book that deals with the subject of crypto intelligently, go with Cryptonomicon, by Niel Stephenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Dan Brown (which isn't necessarily a bad thing)","review":"I made it my mission this summer to read all of Brown's novels, and having accomplished that goal, I can say without reservation that Digital Fortress is at the very back of the pack. It was certainly suspenseful, as all of his books are, but the topic of this book was lacking the intrigue, depth, and meaning of his other books' subject matter. Of course, the debate over balancing national security and personal privacy is an important one, but Digital Fortress falls flat as a social commentary.This book is best described as an old-fashioned whodunnit thriller/murder mystery that happens to take place in an ultra-modern setting (the NSA complex). Meanwhile, as kind of a side-story, you've got a college professor on a wild goose chase through the streets of Spain. The whole thing just doesn't quite work, but the cliffhangers at the end of each chapter still keep you turning the pages right to the lackluster finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK to read if you have nothing else better to do.","review":"Da Vinci Code was fascinating and I was expecting another good read, but was sorely disappointed.

Just for one: talks about the dangerous staircases up the Giralda tower. Well, Mr. Brown, had you been in Seville at least for a day visit, you'd know the Giralda has no staircases but ramps.

It's like nothing I've ever read. Dan Brown has proven to be a very promising writer. What a great way to start off a career. Everyone is a suspect, yet no one seems to be guilty. You read enough books and you realize that the guy with the blood on his left hand and the knife in his right is not the murderer. But what a refreshening way to craft up a conspiracy theory. You gotta be a little crazy to think up stuff like this, but look at Stephen King, Dean Koontz, John Saul, and Mary Higgins Clark! They're laughing hysterically all the way to the bank. Add it to your library, this ones a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best I have ever read!","review":"Okay so the characters are a little too perfect, but WHAT a story! More twists and turns than I've ever read in a novel. The chase through Spain is as skillfully rendered as scenes by any of the action masters (and I've read a few!) I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mainstream nail-biters. There's plenty of espionage and spy gadgetry. The Clancy fans might find it a bit light on technical description, but I appreciated Brown sparing me some of the electronics for a faster pace. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"I read his other works first, I figured out this mystery early on. not so thrilling after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional Fiction","review":"Digital Fortress has the feel and packaging of well researched fiction. Set in contemporary times (at the time of writing, 1998) Dan creates appealing plot and pace. Unfortunately he sets the stage in a strangely depicted set. For example, I am not sure if the book is trying to suggest a fantasy country, but what's on the book is not 1998 Spain. Try somewhere else, or perhaps Spain in the 1950s or 1960s? After reading about the deadly steps on the Giralda and the urine smell in the hospital I couldn't help but look at the writting feeling it didn't have a good fit and finish. It left a taste of very weak fit and finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"i read this book after reading the Da Vinci code and i was surprised.

The pace is *intense*, but character development and expository on the digital encryption do not seem to have taken a back seat -- a real feat of writing there. It reads really fast, too, I wish there was just a bit more book! I wish there actually was more editorializing on the moral issue of whether or not we need to have something like the NSA around. Hmmmm, maybe not! The only books I recall with this kind of *urgency* are Jurassic Park and Hunt for Red October -- good company. If someone doesn't make this into a movie, it'd be a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally flawed","review":"I had recently read The DaVinci Code and it was mildly entertaining but not as great as my friends had led me to believe. This book is totally flawed from a technological point of view. Nearly every detail, not just of cryptography but of software and hardware in general is wrong. The total misrepresentation of public key encryption should have been a tipoff early on, but I doggedly read on. But getting the technology wrong was the less egregious offense in this book. The biggest problem I found here was the attitude that government should have the legimate power to invade citizens' privacy in order to protect them. Further, the denigration of the Electronic Freedom Foundation was in pretty poor taste.

I was extremely annoyed with Brown's lack of research in Japanese. His character names do not even exist in Japanese. It is like naming an American character, \\"xyllsjdfd\\" Futhermore, the little Japanese phrases he used in Japanese were completely non-sensical. I think he just made up the words. The one word that does exist, he used COMPLETELY the wrong way. He said that the 7 Gods \\"shichigosan\\" were on his side. \\"Shichigosan\\" means 7, 5, 3. It is a day where children ages 7, 5, and 3 dress up in kimono!!!I couldn't even finish reading the book. He lacks credibility.

The difference is that Clancy appears to do his homework, whereas Brown manages to have errors on almost every page and appears to have put no effort at all into learning how either computers or encryption work. Anyone who has a reasonably technical background in computing will wince on reading this claptrap.

So many, in fact, that I can't recommend you spend time reading the book. Here is my list:* The technical facts are just plain wrong in many places. They are so wrong, in fact, that if you are a software engineer by trade, you may be insulted. The details about cryptography, security, etc., read like they were written by someone who is a technical illiterate.* The plot is embarrassingly thin and predicable. Sure, there are a few twists and surprises, as youw would expect in a DB book, but overall, I guessed every major plot move before it happened. Very different from past books.* The characters aren't developed to any extent. They are two-dimensional with ridiculous sounding names and cardboard personalities. They make the book read like a made-for-TV movie.DB can and has done better work than this. Here's hoping that he returns to his prior form. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull the plug!","review":"If you make it to the end, you'll understand my title. During the \\"crisis\\" at the end, this was all I could think of yet, for some reason, the characters wouldn't do it. Brown evidently forgot that to write a good book, some research into your subject is necessary and that the plot lines have to be some what plausible.NSA computers connected to the internet. Lame computer-ese. Shallow characters. Ridiculous plot twists. A puzzle at the end a 7 year old could solve. This book has 'em all. If this book were made into a movie, the'd show the actors typing on computer keyboards that make teletype noises and monitors that show the characters they type so large, there are only a few lines of text on the screen.Avoid this book like a virus.

I think that his research material consisted of a bunch of D-rating sci-fi of the 80's and Roadrunner cartoons.So, the only thing left is the thriller story: and old mix of kills, sex, car pursues in an European country (very fashion)... just clichès, clichès and more clichés... boring, boreng, boring.Let me give you a piece of advice: don't waste yout time with this book, buy an other one, spend quality time with your family... whatever you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Brown gets better in time....","review":"If this is the first Dan Brown book that you've ever picked up then I urge you to quickly put it back down. It cannot compare to his later works - most notably The DaVinci Code. I won't go into detail on the plot synopsis - it's in loads of other reviews. The plot was very unbelievable. Stupid cryptographers and horrible character dialogue made me want to throw the book out the window. This was Brown's first attempt at a novel so I can't fault him too much because he really has come a long way. The book is definitely NOT worth purchasing unless you are at a garage sale and see it for a quarter or less. I read it on vacation and regretted I wasted my time with it. I regret more that I spent 6.99 in the airport for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring trash","review":"As much as I don't like to leave things unfinished, honestly - I had to put it down after 100 \\"chapters.\\" I just couldn't bring myself to waste any more of my evening time.

So, if you are over 10 years old - go read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"Dan Brown is not a good writer. He can build suspense, but his prose displays his knowledge of cliches more than any facility with language or character development. That said, I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and--up to a point--Angels and Demons.Digital Fortress, however, was incredibly disappointing. The plot and the actions of the characters make no sense. And once again, Brown hammers home the message that organizations always mean well, but evil deeds belong to individuals. (The heroine's protestations are almost laughable, they're so naive.) This novel highlighted the fact that Brown writes with a formula, and not one that's very successful. Basically, if you've read one Dan Brown book, you've read them all. And I don't recommend reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, was this bad.","review":"I read Angels and Demons first. Then I read The Da Vinci Code. Both were good. Not because they were well written, but because they had interesting story lines. But, both of those books were predictable. But the WORST book he has written so far is Digital Fortress. I knew the \\"who-dunnit\\" in the first quarter of the book and read the rest in case I was wrong. I wasn't. Unfortunatly, Mr. Brown only gave you one character that knew all the details. And that character was, of course, the guilty party. I was actually mad by the time I finished the book.Another little issue I don't like are the clumsy suspense attempts. I hate knowing I am not given information to make me read more pages. If it's seamless, it's great. When it's not (and it's not), it stinks.Beware. Da Vinci Code is good, but this book is not even worth the six dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and your money","review":"This book is really an insult to those who has a brain. What can I say? I definitely would not buy into the author's the other hype: the \\"D.V. Code\\".The plot in this story is so dull and plain, you almost predict it from the beginning: when Susan Fletcher (the main character) over and over agin mentioned at the beginning that there are no \\"unbreakable code\\", you almost immediately suspect whatever is running in that TRANSLTR machine is just a decoy for \\"unbreakable code\\", and the true purpose was to implant virus. GUESS WHAT? THAT WAS THE WHOLE PLOT of the book! How disappointed it is!Also, the love story and David Becker's journey in Spain to successfully retrieve the ring was so irrelevant to the plot and so dull, you have to be a real idiot to believe it is remotely possible.Needless to say, as other reviewers pointed out, the mistakes author made regarding computer technology are too many.Save your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous - Another forgetfable throwaway \\"thriller\\" b","review":"Sometimes I pick up an obscure book and try to give the author a try.

I find if hard to believe that an obscure first novelist - where I just happened to find his last book in the store (and not because it has been selling like hotcakes, they only had two) - has so many \\"rave reviews\\" online. More, in fact, than the new John Grisham book (which was equally as horrible). So please, friends of Dan Brown (or the author himself).

Part of the plot involves an untrained professor being sent on a secret mission by the NSA, and some of the mistakes made by NSA staff seem ridiculous.The book is full of paranoia about the government tapping into our email and other communications.

No.","review":"Because I had been fovorably impressed, but not swept over, by Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code', and because I am an amateur, very amateurish cryptography buff, I bought 'Digital Fortress'. One of the positive traits I had found in DVC was, in a general way, the considerable efforts invested by D. Brown in research. Whereas in Digital Fortress, the inaccuracy that borders on flippancy, of most of the cryptographic information displayed in the book cannot be the result of serious research. Of course, this is first and foremost a work of fiction. I do not expect it to be a treatise on cryptography. But an acceptable compromise could have been attained. In my modest opinion, it wasn't.

The book is about a beautiful cryptographer name Susan Fletcher. She works for the NSA, creating the ultimate computer, TRANSLTR. TRANSLTR can read people's email without them knowing and decode encrypted messages in no more than three hours. Ensei Tankado, a Japanese computer genious, did not like the idea of the U.S.A government invading people's privacy.

And every book amplifies more and more the characteristics of Dan Brown' writing, which is interesting subject, interesting plot, lack of any characters development and wooden writing. I would say that this book has all this with the two latter qualities taken to the extreme. It's so badly written that I fought very hard with myself not to drop it in the middle. In the end it got a little bit more interesting (if you will succeed in not paying attention to all kinds of gaps in the plot). The subject of the novel is computer security and the book has quite a few wrong statements and descriptions, which is disappointing.

Either he did one of those \\"Europe in 5 days tours\\" that the the Americans seem to love or he looked in an out of date book for information.Frankly I was appalled by this unprofessional approach of a bestselling author.I hope he did a better job of Rome in the other book of his..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money... with there were 0 stars!!!!","review":"First of all sorry for my English.I have read Dan Brown's other 3 books and things are getting worse from book to book.This last one was a fairy tale for children... the scenario was so childish and full of holes...

Couldn't get it to work, so then I had my fiancee (who went to MIT and is MUCH better at math then I am) look at it.

Plus, the story was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but Still Good","review":"Other reviewers have pointed out that the computer facts in Dan's book are mostly wrong. And there are other things, like the idea that all the country's secret files would be in one single database, and not otherwise backed up anywhere. That, in itself, is a preposterous idea!But I ignored the fact that Dan had some major flaws in his computer research (Dan's research is usually excellent), and that there were a few too many fallacies, and read the rest of the story, and it was good. Like all the Dan Brown books I've read, he gives you some plot twists you probably won't guess, he keeps you guessing about a lot of other stuff, and he has a complete ending. He's better than a lot of authors just for that!I was disappointed that Dan didn't get a cryptographer to help with the computer stuff, but I still liked the book, and I think you will too, if you can cut Dan a little slack on the inadequate research and suspend your disbelief a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not something to remember","review":"It has its moments but if you have read Da Vinci COde, this is big letdown.Its very predictable too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Mistakes","review":"There are just too many mistakes in this book, that the author even made things up against historical facts.Computer technology stuff aside, I have to point out another major mistake the author made:In the novel, at the end, it took the scientists way too long time to figure out that the unlock key is the element mass difference between Urinum 235 and Urinum 238, because the author claimed that both atomic bomb dropped in Japan in 1945 were Urinium bombs.However, the fact is, only the bomb dropped in Hiroshima was Urinium Bomb (on August 6, 1945); The other bomb dropped on August 9, 1945 in Nagasaki, was instead a more advanced Plutunium bomb! Not Urinium bomb at all.

The story telling is so bad and the characters so wooden, I have no desire to read his other books, including \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" I only got halfway through before the poor characterization, even poorer plot (with its coincidences too big for even really bad fiction), and just plain bad story telling forced me to put it aside. Sorry.

For people who are supposedly so bright, I wanted to slap the heck out of the main characters for their stupidity.The \\"science\\" is completely made up, and a lot of things just simply do not make any sense. I know Dan Brown is not a scientist, and he was writing a popular novel, but it would have made the book MUCH better if he had bothered to do any kind of research beyond simply a high-level skim and then make it up as he went along.I got 7/8ths of the way through this, and then gave up. I just could not make myself continue with it, and I really didn't care enough about the characters to see what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital dreck","review":"Criminy, how I loathed this book. It was painfully predictable, cliched and soulless. Another Dan Brown book with a brilliant, handsome academic and his brilliant, beautiful partner solving problems no one on the planet could hope to crack. Sheesh. Although the basic plot is reasonably clever, the one-dimensional characters, banal dialogue and foregone conclusion of the book make it an irritating read. Halfway through it I was rooting for the professor to die and the end of civilization as we know it. Wasn't gonna happen, of course, but at least it might've been interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Fortress: the quest for an unbreakable encryption algorithm","review":"I read this novel back in 2003 and found the plot plausible enough to be disturbing. In many ways, I still like this novel better than some of Mr Brown's later novels.The story moves at a fast pace which to some extent masks some quite shallow character development. Some elements of the story are uneven as well but that (to me) was all part of the thrill of it. The pursuit of unbreakable encrytion algorithms and what this might really mean to the world in the hands on an unscrupulous individual was far more intriguing to me than the believability (or otherwise) of the characters involved.This novel was published in 1998 and is, I think, Dan Brown's first published novel.I recommend this novel as an action-filled page turner. I'd probably rate it as 3.5 stars if Amazon provided such an option.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Brown's another masterpiece","review":"This is the third book of Dan Brown I read. I was very impressed by \\"Angels & Demons\\" and totally deceived by \\"Deception Point,\\" and what will be the next? What unfolded before my eyes was \\"unbreakable code!\\" I was really dumbfounded. The story never stopped at that level, and went further to the hyper-super code-breaking computer of the unimaginable scale with the virus!With these setting, the secret of unbreakable code was lost somewhere in Spain. The secret which was embedded in a ring was hard to find because it was soon lost among many people's fingers.Another amusing thing was Dan Brown's research result(?) of human stereotypes that were a little bit sarcastic but fun. Please enjoy the world of Dan Brown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another good ride!","review":"I have all 4 of Dan Browns books having read three of them thus far.

The information he cites about the NSA and cryptography contain so many flaws as to be laughable. It's *FULL* of *MAJOR* errors that any editor or reviewer with even moderate technical savvy should have flagged before it went to print.And that's too bad, because the basic plotline would scarcely have suffered if he had been more correct in his description.The basic thriller plotline isn't badly done, it's what kept me reading this far, but I stopped because of the idiocies mentioned above and the fact that the characters aren't \\"real\\" enough to keep me engaged more.I *might* finish it later, but I just have too many books in my queue from authors that write \\"smarter\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Fluff","review":"I did get hooked into reading this book, so I give it two stars, for its \\"thriller\\" nature.The content reads like it is science fiction written by an English major who didn't do enough research into the science part of his fiction (which, of course, it is). The mumbo-jumbo about \\"replication strings\\" and viruses just wasn't at all convincing. Yes, in sci-fi you need to suspend disbelief but in good sci-fi, that's just for one leap. Every time Brown described the encryption stuff, I just wanted to scream.Then, the characters were one-dimentional, particularly, a couple of the fanatical villains.If you're bored, you might want to read this book. Otherwise, find something more productive to do with your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of research ruined an intriguing plot","review":"Having worked in software, physical security, and with cryptography, I was intrigued by the topic. Unfortunately, Dan Brown failed to do much research before writing this book. It reminds me of an essay that I wrote at the last minute in English 101. The grammer was correct, but none of the facts were accurate.Virtaully all of the elements in the book were wrong; from the types of physical security that would be used by the NSA, to the computer security methods, to the isotopes and seperation methods used in the Hirosima and Nagasaki bombs. It was like watching \\"The Land Of The Giants\\" ... improbable and incredible.Don't waste your money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Paced but with technical Inaccuracies","review":"This book is exciting to read and fast paced, although I found the dialog between the characters to be a little flat. That is not a criticism however as this is meant to be a thriller.Problem with this book is that anyone with a background in cryptography or having studied computer sciencde will notice plenty of technical errors for example saying that a 64 bit key has 64 characters (ok yes binary characters).Other improbabilities are a 2BN machine that is cooled by a freon system that does not have an interlock to shut the machine down if the cooling should fail. You get those kind of interlocks on your $40 microwave door switch.Anyway, overall still a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"The Minerva Virus\\" Instead","review":"If you are looking for a GOOD sotry about computer technologies that doesn't fall off a cliff, then \\"Digital Fortress\\" is not what you want to read.This book is a major let-down.

I found the whole cryptography/art history/chatolic church them quite fascinating. But at the same time I felt my qualms about the the lack of development of characters and the unimaginative plot where overrun by the sheer volume of interesting data that was being used in the story.I decided to check out the author's previous works, Angels&Demons;, Deception Point and now Digital Fortress.I have to say this - my initial qualms about this author came right out into the forefront. He is a BAD, BAAAD writer. Terrible characterization, plots from writer's workshop 101,wild-eyed misstatements of facts and hackneyed writing.I am done with Dan Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of errors. A waste of time and money","review":"The author shows such ignorance in math, computing, the NSA, geography and history that makes you think about how unreliable are his books. Didn't he learn that an author must document himself?His description of Spain is ridiculous, an insult to anybody's intelligence, and of course to the Spaniards. Not only he has never been to Spain, he has never read anything about Spain or Europe. He confuses Spain in the 1990s with Mexico in the 1860s.I wonder if he cannot afford some Cable TV (Discovery Channel will do) and learn a little more about the World, Europe and Spain.I'm not asking him to read, too tough for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Fortress","review":"Dan Brown takes really good subject matter and draws it out a little too long.

However, this might be an unfair comparison, and I would highly recommend it.As a little twist, I recommend reading Simon Singh's \\"The Code Book\\" first.

His books after this one were fun, fast, and the example of a \\"page tuner\\".Like many people when I find a discover author that I like I devour the books they have written. In this Case I wish I'd missed this one. Mr. Brown must have thought the public was stupid as he gives the bad guy up in the first 50 pages.While writing about the best code breakers in the world and telling us what they look for, he gives his bad guy with the most simple \\"code\\" for the reader to discover.I do look forward to his new book but I am done with his early stuff.Digital fortress is a great example why publishers avoid first books.

And those two were better by far. Once again, Brown writes about a woman who is both a genius and graced with a supermodel's body. Her other half is a very attractive, intelligent professor (they're always professors).The language is a thin butter of overused clichés scraped over too many details of what the characters look like and how they function on a daily basis. The reader isn't allowed to use their imaginations because Brown is too busy nailing down every person, place and thing with exact and dreary verbiage.I'm not a Brown-basher. I enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" for their entertainment value. But, perhaps I can only stomach two Brown books before the novelty wears off, and this was the third that pushed me to the brink. Had I read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" third, I may be complaining about it instead. But I'm not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like it was written by a high school kid","review":"I enjoyed Dan Brown's previous books, but Digital Fortress was a complete waste of time. The basic story could have been good, but the majority of the plot twists and turns were sophomoric, at best. It read like a love-struck high school kid was writing a novel for a composition class. Don't waste your time. Enjoy Angels and Demons, along with The DaVinci Code, and let it go at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Interesting and boring at the same time","review":"The book started out interesting enough. The author started going quickly. After I got further into the book and realized that these characters were very flat and making errors along the way that made no logical sense in the real world, the one question that kept going through my mind was \\"Is this book over yet?\\". I found myself skipping ahead pages at a time knowing that I am not missing much of anything.I recommend skipping this book. It is a disappointment and does not keep the reader engaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am surprised that Dan Brown wrote this","review":"It is unbelievable that the author od Da Vinci Code can write such a weak novel. It is based on a super computer at NSA which is challenged by an ex employee. There are too many coincidences. Who can believe that deputy director of NSA would dispatch a language professor for a super secret mission. There are technical inaccuracies about computer. It shows how a computer operations manager ignores warnings repeateadly.If I had read this before reading Da Vinci Code, and if I hadn't heard about or seen that movie, I would not have read Da Vinci Code.Like someone said in his comment that he read this novel only because it was by Dan Brown.

This book had an intriguing premise and some great action. Maybe an expert on codebreaking wouldn't be impressed with the technical info, but to somebody like me with a casual interest in codes, it was fascinating. I was more interested in the sociological implications of what was going on, anyway. As for that humongous red herring, well, if Eric Ambler could get away with that sort of thing in A Coffin for Dimitrios, I don't see why Dan Brown or anybody else should be barred from it. My only real complaint comes from that oversimplistic final puzzle stumping NSA's supergeniuses.

All readers should bear in mind that Dan Browns books are fiction, readers have to decide what's real and what's not unless they are experts in that field.I found the story highly plausible and imaginitive, and with continuing clever twists. As usual the decriptions of the settings were very entertaining.Character depth can be notoriously difficult to create in thrillers without making the characters sound so corny.It's probably one of the hardest genres due to the authors effort to create a fast paced novel that matches the topic.A thoroughly enjoyable read for mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dan Brown thinker/thriller","review":"Not as good as \\"Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Angels & Demons\\", but still excellent and almost impossible to put down.

I mean lets face it, if stuff that happens on the book did actually happen nobody would be skeptical about the problems. Even a false alarm in an org. like NSA, they check it. I wanted to stop reading, but like the habit I have to finish what I started I had to read to end. Then the end was something to make you wanna throw the book in the fireplace (hey at least is useful for this winter) or sell it back.Anyways, don't take my review into account. Make your own judgement, but before go to your store and flip to the pages b4 buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a techno-thriller","review":"Don't bother with this book if you know anything about encryption or computer security (or the NSA). The author apparently did no background research in the subject. Aside from the lack of technical realism, the story line is simplistic and the alleged thrills overblown, unless exclamation points count for excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentional Sexism Ruins An Otherwise Weak Plot","review":"An cyber-action thriller set within the confines of the NSA, this tale focuses on a beautiful and talented young woman whose rise in the intelligence community is seen with envy and suspicion by her colleagues. When she discovers an unlikely plot, however, she must unravel the complex series of conspiracies in order to save the day... or rather in order for her boyfriend to save the day.Beyond the complete lack of technological understanding shown in this novel, this story suffers from a very sad form of sexism that is latent in Brown's works. The author tries to make for a strong female protagonist, but instead creates a character who is sexy but weak and plays into a stereo-type heroine who needs a man to do the physical stuff.If you would care to read a more indepth review of this and other books, visit: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing......","review":"If you are expecting something more engaging such as The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons from the same author, you are in for a disappointment with Digital Fortress.

This wasn't nearly as good as the other books by Dan Brown I've read. In particular, try Deception Point.In Digital Fortress, you can see it coming from a mile away. There are very few real twists or suprises, the action is pretty slow, and the \\"science\\" is hardly new or exciting.

Well worth the time and money to buy it. Ban Brown has written a book that will take an important place on my bookshelf, right in front, in the middle. A must read for anyone who is even slightly interested in computer security, word/computer puzzles, murder, intrigue, good guys versus bad guys, surprise endings, staying awake at night trying to finish the book in one sitting or maybe your just somebody who really likes to read a good book now and then.

I read Deception Point (a classic airport novel - good pace, interesting twists, passable science) and I'm half way through the Da Vinci Code. But Digital Fortress is completely off the mark. I've managed to guess each and every plot turn, the \\"riddles\\" are simply bad, and even when remembering that the book was published in 1998, the encryption and web technology covered in the book is laughable and lacks the minimum amount of vision you would expect from a techno writer.In short - don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable nonsense","review":"The book is a total nonsense.

But in fact, it is an older (1998) attempt at writing about technology that is just dreadful, and should never have made it out of manuscript form without a rigorous edit and rewrite (or two or three). While it is nice to realize how much Dan Brown has grown as a writer, I simply felt ripped off by the publisher. Absurd dialog, absurd plot replete with not-believable characters with about as much appeal as old carpet remnants.

The plot was engaging if you are willing to overlook some errors in facts and logic. One has to remember that this book is a suspense mystery, that is, a fiction, so nobody expects the facts in the book to be true. The book is designed to be read fast, with little effort and without close scrutiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the most egregious error","review":"I wonder if anyone else felt as I did. The main charachter, Langdon, a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, had never heard of the NSA. There isn't a human being over the age of 12 living in the washington metro area who has not heard of the National Security Administration, but a learned professor from Georgetown has not!. I couldn't read beyond that ridiculous lapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read","review":"There were clues scattered throughout this novel and the NSA folks just didn't get them! I just wanted to shake them and say \\"look dummy!\\" I sure hope the NSA does not employ people like the ones in the novel. We'd be doomed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tofu tastes better...","review":"This is my first Dan Brown book, and it made me wonder what the hype is all about. The story is only mildly engaging, with plenty of mistakes and blunders along the way. The astonishing number of cliffhangers paraded through this book made the story seem poorly thought out. I knew by the median page who the real villain was and his motivations. I knew by page fifty that Dan Brown didn't really know what he was talking about. Still, because it was recommended to me by family, I persisted with the book. I would recommend it to high schoolers; it exists at about that level of complexity. Any one else, read if you have plenty of leisure time and don't want to have to think beyond your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usual Dan Brown","review":"I read \\"Da Vinci Code\\" loaned from a friend and was totally mesmerized by the new facts and startling secrets revelead therein. It lead me to buy Angels & Demons which I couldn't keep down till I read the last page (Yes in one sitting !!). I read Deception Point and which sounded to me quite predictable by that time. I hunted for the 4th novel and finally got my hands on Digital Fortress.Digital Fortress is based on very good facts, however that's the end. It lacks the usual Dan Brown style. It turns out that the unbreakable cypto code developed by the ex NSA employee is nothing but a computer virus. And it turns out the super intelligent female crypto expert is infact not very intelligent after all.Disappoints me. I would still rate \\"Angels & Demons\\" as best book so far by Dan Brown.Harish Garg"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intricate weave","review":"Susan Fletcher and her boyfriend David Becker are unknowingly linked together in a life or death struggle that they may not win. She is working in the NSA cryptography division and he has been asked to fly to Spain and pick up the key to a 64 bit cipher. He doesn't know what he's looking for and she doesn't realise what danger he has been put in. The NSA must recover the key or face the consequences of an unbreakable code being released to the world resulting in an end to their days of decoding missives.With more twists and turns than my broken washing machine this book makes up in action what it lacks in knowledge. At times, Brown's lack of computer knowledge comes through but overall it is more than passable. He does a good job of creating an intricately woven plot that doesn't fail to deliver although the ending is more deserving of a movie than a novel. Perhaps a film version is on the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book warrants somewhere between 0 and -5 stars !","review":"This book brings back bad memories of the movie \\"Twister\\" - when a motorized vehicle crashes in the front door and then out the back door of a house as it tumbles across the road. I have never read a book that was more ridiculous and yet, at the same time -- more entertaining. My husband and I laughed hysterically for hours reminiscing about one absurd episode after another. From the boyfriend who hangs by his fingertips from a window sill in a cathedral tower before climbing back inside to escape the mercenary killer that he trips down the stairs and over his head with a candlestick to a taxi and a Vespa that spin in circles in a pool of oil, crash through the wall of an airplane hanger and just keep-on-going. Oh gawd - my sides are aching. Someone really ought to make a fortune on an \\"Airplane\\"-like movie version of this ludicrous novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"I don't think it's fair to give it a total trash review as some have written because the topic is provocative and it is technically well-written. But it lacks plausibility and good character development which are two must-haves for my taste. DB's books \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" had an effect of taking a person's entire paradigm of thought on a topic and putting it into a whirlwind of intriguing \\"what ifs?\\". This book did not come close to achieving that effect. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, but much better than \\"Deception Point.\\"","review":"In \\"Digital Fortress\\" Dan Brown abandons his usually formula for novel writing (conspiracy, cover-up, bait and switch antagonists), and tries to be Robert Ludlum (\\"Bourne Identity\\") or Tom Clancy (\\"Hunt for Red October\\"). The result is a way to kill time if the person you are house sitting for has no TV and poor taste in 'literature'.I was particularly turned off by the remarks Brown makes about Spain and Spanish people, as if they live in the dark ages and are a million years behind the United States. I have been to the Spanish city of Seville, which Brown uses in his book, and I have to tell you the twisting alley ways which Brown describes are there, but Spain as a whole is nothing like Brown describes it. If this is the way Brown views other countries, maybe he should give up writing novels and get a job writing speeches for Bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"An imperfect waste of time","review":"It's possible Dan Brown knows something about cryptography and computing. If so, he should have used that knowledge instead of cramming this book with endless errors and disinformation. A catalog of the book's technical blunders would be nearly as long as the book itself.It's possible Dan Brown knows how to write original prose. If so, he should have done that instead of hacking together this pastiche of techno-thriller and romance novel.And yet I kept turning the pages. Maybe I'm a sucker for wanting to know how plots turn out or maybe -- but not very likely -- there's a little something here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after a few pages...","review":"I have some experience with the NSA and cryptography. As soon as Brown's characters enter the NSA, it is apparent that Brown has no clue, has never been there, doesn't know the atmosphere or the people, that this book is pure schlock. You have to admire the guy for getting rich writing novels with stereotyped characters and grossly manipulated historical thesis. To think his stuff is being 'seriously' debated is amazing. The DaVinci Code is nonsense. This book is too. Too bad there isn't a rating for less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine 'til the end...","review":"A well-written thriller with a clever and original premise, it captured me and I read it through in a single day. Imagine my disappointment, indeed anger, at the incredibly stupid ending.I suppose etiqutte prohibits my revealing it but it both denies history and denies science. It was equivalent to a premise that, contrary to popular belief, FDR wasn't actually the president during the Second World War. I just couldn't beleive that Brown actually used this mindless device to end an otherwise enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont read this book - Waste of time","review":"After DaVinci Code I had become great fan of Dan Brown and was on a reading marathon to complete all of his publications. The expectations were high and were met decently enough for Angles and Demons but this book did not. Beleive me, half way through the book you can easily realize how the plot was to end. NOT WORTH IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the Da Vinci Code","review":"If you know anything at all about computer systems, or even worse cryptography, you'll find this book somewhere between moronic and offensive. I'm startled that David Pogue, who knows a great deal here, liked it ... guess he's better than I at suspending his disbelief!If you can't understand why this book gets panned by those who know even a smattering about this topic, yet think you liked Brown's others ... maybe that's because you don't know much about those other topics, either?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO PAR","review":"I have read 3 of Dan Brown;s bookd, and thi is by far the worst. The plot is very straightforward and majority of the readers will figure out most of the ending by the halfway point.In addition there is virtually no suspense or the suspense is phony and forced.Skip this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Researched & Cheap thrills","review":"If you know anything about computing, you see he just threw in lots of technical words to make the average person think it is all mysterious. THERE IS NO SUCH THING as a 12 gauage printer cable you idiot!! And no human being types in MILLIONS of characters on their keyboard that are picked up by a chip. (keyboards that record keys typed do exist though). The rest of the story had some REALLY CHEAP lines like, \\"And just like a cheap movie, the lights went out just as she heard the scream\\". NO, IT IS YOUR CHEAP BOOK. I only finished it because I wanted to know how the hero saved the day. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRASH. But DaVinci code is being raved about, how could Dan Brown write this.-Fellow New Englander"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've ever used a computer read something else","review":"Let me first say that I like the techno thriller genre, unfortunatly this is among the worst techno thrillers I've ever read. It is fairly obvious that mr. Brown knows little if anything of computers and most likely writes his books using pen and paper. Nothing he writes rings true, especially regarding computer security, and he also impresses with his ability to get most of his computer-jargon wrong. If you are even a little computer literate you will unfortunatly laugh in all the wrong places reading this book. The book is also rather impressive in that it advertises all its major plot points in mile-high neon signs. The so called plot twists will suprise noone.Most of all I find myself wondering if mr Brown was trying to write the book as a bad movie script, a movie staring Jean-Claude van Damme and shown only on late-night TV when noone is watching. The movie would probably have charachters that werent as one-dimensional though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably, Cringe-Inducingly Bad","review":"Dan Brown would be ashamed to have his name as author of this book, if he weren't so busy raking in the cash from 'Da Vinci Code'. The only reason DF is published is because of the current popularity of 'Da Vinci Code'. I could not believe how bad this book was, not only in concept and characterization, but in technical accuracy and sheer implausibility. 'Deception Point' was a much better effort by Brown, and 'Angels and Demons' is also great. If you want to read a great cyber thriller, read 'Snow Crash' by Stephenson or 'Neuromancer' by Gibson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I don't generally write reviews, but this book was so bad I felt I had too. The characters are cliché, the plot laughable, the dialogue patronizing and from a technology standpoint, he completely misses the boat. Both the main characters are people so talented and gifted it's impossible to identify with them. They're the perfect people just waiting to be a hero. The dialogue is under researched, reads like buzzword bingo and appeals to external authorities to make his tech analysis without actual understanding of the concepts. If you want to read a good Crypto novel try Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson. I am seriously sorry I picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Dan Brown","review":"Having read first \\"Angels and Deamons\\" and \\"The Davinci Code\\", I found \\"Digital Fotress\\" somewhat boring. The plot is very predictable, especially when it comes to the major characters. Just like the other two books, the main characters are a college professor and a beautiful and dynamic woman who is an expert in what she does (in this case being a cryptographer).Possibly, the author tries to live his unfulfilled dreams and expectations through his writings. However it is not a bad read by the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Fortress","review":"I'll give Dan a break on this book by giving him two stars. The book is very fast paced, but while it is fast to read it lacks technical accuracy. Much of the encryption technology discussed in the book is just plain wrong. In addition, the book compares some encryption technology with compression technology, which didn't make any sense to me at all. Over all, the initial concept of this book which states there is an unbreakable encryption technology is true and in use today."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's getting harder and harder for me to finish a Dan Brown book","review":"I started off with the Da Vinci Code, then Angels & Demons, then Deception Point, and now I'm finally at Digital Fortress. Each book seemed to be more ridiculous and unpolished than the last.Honestly, I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, even if they are filled with inaccuracies and artistic liberties. Digital Fortress though, seems so corny and contrived that I'm having a hard time reading it.The main character is a beautiful, intelligent, perfect woman who works as a top code breaker for the NSA. She reminds me of those characters in Bollywood films who work for high-profile fashion design firms. She's in a perfect relationship that has some troubles when they each get caught up in their perfect jobs. Of course, I assume that these troubles will be perfectly resolved by the end of the book, if I ever finish it, that is. Maybe I'll just move on to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Fortress","review":"Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown, was one of the best books I have ever read. Although a little slow at first, the action picks up almost immediately. Dan Brown draws you in using tantalizing characters and an ingenious plot. You're drawn into right up to the point where you are racing the clock right along with Susan and David to find the key, the murderer, and each other.I would recommend Digital Fortress to anyone who enjoys a good action-packed mystery novel. Anyone who enjoys trying to beat the characters to the answer of the novel's mystery. Overall, this is an awesome book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Wrong","review":"This book is almost completely factually inaccurate. The math is wrong, the technology is made up, and the author confuses a lot of his terms. It's obvious that some -- perhaps even enough -- research was performed, and it's also obvious that the author understood none of it. Don't. Read. This. Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for real? Avoid at all costs; not even mildly entertaining","review":"This is potentially the worst book I have ever read. No matter how you look at it, it is hard to imagine how such pile of nonsense was put together.At times the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and situations make you smile in wonder. (The book's only entertaining value).One of the novel's action scenes is located in the cramped, deadly steep, badly kept staircase of Seville's Giralda. Needless to say, the best well-known fact about the Giralda is that it does not have an staircase (the moorish king that ordered its construction decided instead on ramps, allegedly so that he could ride his horse to the top). All in all, this is possibly one of the best researched and credible passages in the book. At least he seems to know something about stairs, which is not the case for most other subjects he touches.You can imagine the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"I thought this book was terrible. Not because of the supposedly incorrect information, but because of the terrible plot and storyline. The book was terrible! Constant pointless killings helped the plot continue, and a very stupid ending puzzle at the end totally killed the book! Anyone who graduated grom middle school saw this one coming a mile away. Angels and Demons was great, Deception point equally great, and I have not yet read Da Vinci Code. I think Dan Brown should be ashamed for publishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it, hate it, hate it.","review":"The problem with this book is not so much the technical absurdities, but rather with the strong implication of technical accuracy the author claims in the pages before the book starts.Personal ignorance of computers, encryption, security and normal engineering are all prerequisite for enjoying this book.Again, to all those who think those complaining about technical \\"inaccuracies\\" are nit-picking; Brown makes the strong implicit claim that he knows what he's talking about. The selling point of the book is that it's a PLAUSIBLE, well researched work of fiction. It is not plausible, it is not well researched; it is a work of fiction.As such it is a very poor 'techno-thriller' with no qualities to appeal to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of what the book is about. IE National security, computer security, code breaking and writing, etc.The only enjoyment I received from this book was in discussing it's many absurdities with my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on reality","review":"I've read three of Dan Brown's books (Digital Fortress, Angels and Demons, and The DaVinci Code). All three have technological flaws that make the stories hard to swallow. In the Digital Fortress at the end of the book, the big problem is preventing all of the Internet hackers from getting into the NSA's massive database with all of the world's secrets. As the security is slowly breached, nobody can figure out how to prevent the hackers from getting in. Anybody think about disconnecting from the Internet? This is a \\"national crisis\\" so keeping out the good guys is not as important as keeping out the bad guys.The other problem I have with Dan Brown's characters is that they are brilliant in the beginning of the books and then half way through they can't figure out the simpliest problem. This is especially true in Digital Fortress and the DaVinci Code.The stories are fast moving and engrossing as long as you're willing to accept Brown's flawed premises."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst fiction book I have ever read.","review":"I know it's a bold statement, but it's true. This is the worst fiction book I have ever read. I really liked The DaVinci Code and Deception Point so I thought I would give some of Dan Brown's earlier books a try. Digital Fortress was the first book he published (I think) and it shows. The writing and conversations in the book are so cheesy it becomes humorous. The plot has huge holes in it and is completely unbelievable. Many of the \\"surprise\\" twists I saw coming ten miles away. It was so bad that I almost stopped reading it about halfway through. Instead I decided to \\"gut it out\\" and see how it ended. There is also probably way too much \\"love story\\" embedded in the plot to satisfy those looking for a good sci-fi thriller.I highly recommend avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian writing; Plot holds attention; Characters paper thin;","review":"I Reiterate:Pedestrian writing; Plot holds attention; Characters paper thin;I finished it out of curiosity, but not interest or appreciation.

I found myself holding my breath at times. Wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, just because he wrote a best seller...","review":"I know that you want to discover that Dan Brown wrote novels as great as his Da Vinci Code before he wrote the Da Vinci Code, but it just isn't so. Digital Fortress is a mess, and it makes me upset to see how the author's success with DVC is used to sell it. OK, there's a super computer, and OK, everyone's motives are questionable, but it takes forever to get to the end and at that point I didn't care whether she lived or whether the computer did a China Syndrome. Angels and Demons, while better, is not THAT much bette with hyper planes and non-fatal falls from helicopters.Look, all of us get better with time, and Dan Brown is no different. But don't get sucked into the feeling that you have to like all of his books: this is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sill Little Computer Story","review":"This book was full of plot twists and turns and was also a fast read. But upon finishing it, it seemed more to me like a silly, little computer story. I knew I was reading a fictional story, but it was a little far-fetched. I also agree with another reviewer that it read more like a screenplay than a book. But the story was entertaining and made my travels go by quicker. So if you are looking for some light, entertaining reading that goes by quick, this would be a great book. It is also a good book to start with before reading any of Dan Brown's other books as he definitely has his own writing style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer nerds heaven","review":"Reading this story I realise that I know absolutely nothing about computers beyond the kindergarten stage. If you are deeply into the world and language of computers, you will probably enjoy it more than I did. A top secret US intelligence agency has perfected a super duper, fail-safe code breaking machine which has nevertheless been infiltrated by spies. For most of the book, I had only the barest comprehension of the computer speak and what it was supposed to be doing. If you're not well into the computer business, give this book a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sodhappal","review":"The beginning of the story was good. As it went onwards it picked p momentum. Later on, it dropped behind.I was able to predict even before I reached one quarter, that The Commander was the crook.Similarities.....similarities....similarities.Decoding - common to Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Digital Fortress.Same type of second villains - Assassin in DVC; Hutolot in Digital Fortress.Arch Villains - The Commander in DF; Sir something something in DVC; the Popes personal secretary in A&D.;Digital Fortress - after half-way, it is 'sodhappal'.Know what a 'sodhappal' is?Maybe Dan Brown will have to try his hand at decding this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"What was he smoking?

It is a waste of paper and ink and I resent the time I wasted on it - though by the end annoyance and incredulity had given way to wry amusement at the author's incompetence.The plot is ridiculous and completely implausible, with holes an eight year old could spot. To say that the characterisation is cardboard is an insult cardboard. The technical details are so inaccurate as to be laughable.Utter, unmitigated rubbish. One star only because no stars is not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Warm-Up for Brown's Better Books","review":"My wife was reading Da Vinci Code and I didn't want to infringe on her parade, so I read Digital Fortress. I like Brown's writing style, simple, great description, keeps you involved. It's been awhile since I read a novel, but this was a easy read for a non-reader. Took me 4 days on-and-off. It is a good story - a little hokey in some spots - you ask yourself \\"what?\\" not in suspense, but scratching your head on the far fetched ideas that seem to pile up. - a little 'Hollywood' flavor. However, Brown's writing style warms you up for better reads. Reading Da Vinci now and Angels/Demons is easier to understand knowing how he writes. For a few bucks and a few days at the beach, Fortress is worth the read...before Da Vinci. After, well...you decide. It will be interesting to see his next code-breaking fiasco in words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it claims to be and nothing more","review":"Sometimes you've got to give a book credit for saying it like it is. This is a thriller through and through; not a great book, but exceptionally easy to read and gripping from the get go.The central character is a soap-opera hottie without a flaw in personality, appearance, or education. The same could be said of her strapping young academic fiance, who anchors the European leg of the story. You don't get a ton of back story on these people, but you don't really need it, Brown's editing is totally crisp and the story doesn't drop below top speed from start to finish.Despite the occassional bits of researched technical trivia and passing mention of privacy rights, this book is cotton candy to its core. Doesn't leave you any less hungry when you're done, but its sure fun to eat in the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth either the time or money","review":"If I had read this before the DaVinci Code I wouldn't have read that good thriller. A formula rag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"While I'm a huge fan of Angels and Demons as well as the Da Vinci Code, I found Digital Fortress to be Dan Brown's worst book. Not only is it hard to believe, but his description of Spain and Seville were horribly inaccurate. Having lived there, I know firsthand that Spain is a very modern and well-off country, definitly not a 3rd world nation and not at all like it is described in this book. Also, the computer descriptions are pretty tedious to read and outdated. Skip this one, but his other books are fantastic"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the effort","review":"This book irritated me. I was sorry I had started it. It is written in a simplistic way and is soooooooo predictable. The characters are cliches and I really don't know why the writer bothers with setting his books in Europe as he obviously hasn't much knowledge of the places he writes about or like them very much. There is no depth to the characters and so the book is very shallow. It is a quick read because there is not much to the story but even still I didn't find it was worth the effort. Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, don't waste your time.","review":"About halfway through this book, I realized why I hated it so much. It reminded me of those stories my junior high school friends and I would write and pass around our circle. The stories were terrible: little plot to speak of, poorly developed characters, but lots of angst/drama set in romantic or fanciful settings. This novel has all the elements of our stories, but thankfully Brown differed slightly in that he didn't include a single unicorn.If you are a diehard Brown fan (I've actually enjoyed his other work), you may like this book. If, however, you're looking for a tight mystery plot with well written characters, you'll be disappointed. The value of this book, in large part, is that it demonstrates that Brown's writing has improved over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gack!!! Did the author do ANY research?","review":"After enjoying Da Vinci Code I was excited to see this one on the shelf. The excitement didn't last 10 pages. If you know nothing about software this might be a good read. However if you know even a tiny amount the errors are so glaring that the most strenuous attempt to \\"suspend disbelief\\" fails. I expected better from Dan Brown. Add that to the weak and silly plot contrivances and flat characterizations I finally put the book down half read, something I never do. This is an adventure/thriller and my standards are not high there but this book fails to meet even that minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Brown's better titles...","review":"After having read the Da Vinci Code, my first Dan Brown novel, I expected great things from Digital Fortress. Being a techno-geek, I was attracted to the digital-encryption theme that is the hook of this story. Unfortunately, the characterization is sub-standard. You just don't care what happens to any of these people. The plot is interesting, but unbelievable.Angels and Demons is much better, although Da Vinci Code is probably the best of Brown's lot so far.If you're into techno-thrillers, I would recommend Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, an 1100-page journey through World War II code-breaking, hidden gold, and brilliant characters. It's a marathon read, but highly interesting, and much more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing. Lots of technical inaccuracies.","review":"I read this after reading Da Vinci Code. The writing of Digital Fortress does not have any depth. He is trying to be funny and sometimes \\"playful\\" (e.g. conversions with sexual innuendos involving Midge), but they slowed the pace of the story with unnecessary details. May be Dan Brown is writing this book with a screenplay in mind.The \\"technical\\" details cannot even fool a high school kid with minimal computer and internet knowledge. For example, A 64-bit pass code does not need to be represented as 64 characters. You need only 8 characters for that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries hard - falls flat","review":"What an absolute crap - totally technically drab, and tries hard to create a calamity when there is none. You keep hanging with a faint glimmer of hope that it will pick up the pace - you secretly hope David will get out of Spain and do something interesting, and pray boss Stathmore doesnt turn out to be the villian, you would think that it is too cliched for Dan Brown to work on plot twists so dumb - but yes, he did, he went over the top. His climax is dumb squid, characters unidimensional, and greatest crime of all - made up crisis - you almost feel sorry for him when he tries again and again to whip up the tempo - he throws insane roadblocks, predictable twists, and you can hear him plead \\"Please be afraid - this is the end of the world\\" - Sorry Dan, maybe yours, not ours.[from my blog: http://www.ofview.com/?p=42]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been","review":"This is technically very interesting,but I feel it has too much of the \\"gee whizz\\" factor about it.

There is an common phenomenon in American publishing, where a writer who polishes his craft by writing commercially unsuccessful pieces finally hits it big, as did Brown with The Da Vinci Code, and his publishers gleefully exploit their rights to his early books and plaster the market with them. That appears to be the case with this book. In addition to being just too dated to tell us much about the Internet, the plot is so muddled and the characters so one-dimensional that I find it difficult even to summarize the work... Throughout, I learned little except that the NSA has a lot of computers and apparently doesn't do a very good job of assessing the honesty or even sanity of its employees, both major and minor...For a full review see Interface, Volume 4, Issue 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"cardboard characters in a video game","review":"Too bad, there might have been a book here, but wooden characters and stodgy plot creaking along certainly doesn't make it worth the reading time.. actually you can read it really quickly by reading every other page.

Did the author really refer to X11 as \\"X-eleven\\"? Well, yes, several times. It made me wonder if the extent of his research was done verbally in a bar. His \\"X-eleven\\" veneer of knowledge seemed to apply to every technical aspect of this book.The only good thing I can say about my experience reading this book was that it was better than reading the in-flight magazine between SF and NY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showed potential of things to come","review":"This book is probably one of the most disappointing that I've ever read. After The Da Vinci Code, I was expecting a lot from this book. Even after reading the synopsis and the first couple of chapters I was still expecting a great read. Instead, what I received was mindless and ridiculous.Note, I know very little about computers and encryption, but I found the underlying story to be decently believable. However, some of the issues about which these characters struggle are so obvious that it makes these seemingly intelligent characters seem stupid (especially during the ending).Overall, an semi-entertaining read but one that was more frustrating then satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Read, Too Formula, Little Tech","review":"Although the book is an amazingly fast read, it just helps finish the book quicker.

The book is not believable in so many areas it makes the story very difficult to get excited about. I kept thinking that the author was trying to write a Tom Clancy style book (the NSA doesn't send language professors to do field work any more than the CIA would send Jack Ryan into the field) but just did not do his homework to make it at all believable. Tom Clancy makes it believable becuase he does his homework so well; this author does not.

This book is an insult to anyone who ever took a class in PowerPoint. If you are a complete computer neophyte however, I still wouldn't recommend this book.

It is easy to see why some are comparing his Da Vinci Code to the novel Conquest of Paradise. Both books deal masterfully with the more mysterious features of religion, politics, and science. And both bring to light amazing bits of information, which are weaved into the intricate patterns of an overall compelling story. While Brown compresses labyrinthine plots into brief time periods to provide page-turning suspense, Conquest of Paradise is of epic proportion, covering the entire world.

Dan Brown truly has a talent for creating interesting, suspenseful prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown's Romance Novel","review":"If you enjoy reading romance novels, think it might be fun to read a thriller with a very current-sounding plot, and don't intend to try to understand the science, you will probably thoroughly enjoy Digital Fortress.If you are reading this book because you are interested in the subject matter, and especially if you already have some knowledge of the subject matter, you are likely to be disappointed by the character and plot issues mentioned in other reviews of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"readable but deeply flawed","review":"As far as action books go, this book works but only on a superficial level. The setting is great and the topic is fascinating but his characters are more than wooden they are also \\"all\\" unlikeable. Just about every character in his book lacks the ability to carry on a persuasive discussion. At just about every turn in the book when a character has to explain a critical event, that character is usually at a loss for words, thinking about something else or hushed up by a superior. With the character unable to explain the critcal event something bad happens or something good doesnt happen. The author uses this tension building formula so much thru out his book it turns just about all his characters into idiots that we end up not even caring about. And believe me, I am not talking two or three times in the book, I am talking two or three times for \\"EACH CHARACTER\\" in the book.

This phenomenal book contains sharp plot twists that keep you guessing. The plot takes an entire reversal from the start to the end. The thrills that main characters, Susan Fletcher and her boyfriend, David Becker, go through are not ordinary. With David running through Spain searching for a ring and Susan trying to protect her life in Crypto the excitement in this book is never ending.I recommend this book to anyone who had enjoyed his other books, Angels and Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Deception Point. Also if you have read and liked the Pendragon Series by D.J. MacHale or Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card you will adore reading this book.

I could guess the \\"surprise\\" twists at least one or two pages in advance at times. This is a sure sign that the author is very limited in terms of his talent as a suspense writer.The only aspect of this novel that is remotely appealing is David Becker's adventure in Spain, and even that isn't all that entertaining.Ussually Brown's stongpoint is the inclusion of interesting tidbits and this book has very few of those, if any at all. You can tell this is Brown's first novel without looking up of the year of the copyright.

The star crossed lovers are described as being perfect and brave and so on, but I just thought they were plain dumb. The heroine gets into all kinds of trouble just because she is ridiculously careless. I cringed when Scarlet was sneaking into the underground city all by herself instead of going to get her sheriff father to help, and the dumb stunts just go on and on. The dialogue was the worst I've come across in years and that's saying something because I usually read at least four books a week from different genres. The plot devices were just too convenient, the characters did not ring \\"true\\", and even the love scenes were a bore.I picked this book up hoping to enjoy a mildly steamy historical romance, but was sorely disappointed. The only redeeming characteristic was that there was no half-naked woman on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Thin","review":"I thought the picture was cute online.

This is the first golf book I have ever encountered with Bible verses. A little strange, but the overall golf teaching concepts appear sound.

It seems on the surface you are in for hours and hours of entertainment. However, once you discover the \\"dirty little secret\\" you realize you've been had. That \\"secret\\" is that throughout the DVDs in this set you will view the exact same footage of the same stunts/gags over and over again. Some stunts are repeated four, even five times over the course of viewing.

His son Peter is easier to take but if you've got good footage, why do you need a host at all? You'll find yourself fast-forwarding past all the tiresome chatter (Pam Dawber expounding on why she likes Candid Camera, for instance) for only a handful of clips.

I recommend the newer generation Candid Camera called Just Kidding (no hosts, no long set-ups, more gags per minute)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the people on Candid Camera, DON'T be fooled!!!","review":"There are a lot of repeating segments in this set.

We had a different style under cabinet jar opener in our last house and it worked super great. I looked forward to receiving this one to replace it. It is very hard to get the jar covers lined up for opening. There is no gripe for the lid to grab onto, therefore when I turn the jar it just slides around and around and never opens.

You may not believe that statement since, after all, the history of the development of soda is such an exciting topic. Basically, each soda started out the same. Some pharmacy worker developed it and then eventually sold it off to a major corportation. After reading that same story from Dr. Pepper to Fanta you want the book to move on....but it doesn't! Instead you read basically the same boring story for each soda that we know. Another major drawback to the book is that it is so outdated that is not even funny. It seems that 1/3 of the sodas mentioned in the book are not even manufactured any more. The only part that is a little interesting is the \\"cola war\\" years and that fizzes out quite quickly as well. If you absolutely must read about how carbonated drinks evolved then give the book a shot (I am at a loss for another one to recommend).

(You might also want to check out the \\"Lost Provinces\\" and \\"Folks, He Sure Do Pull Some Bow\\" CDs...) This disc highlights a rare style of African-American fiddle music, featuring rare recordings by the bands that dotted the southern landscape 'way back when. These groups mixed stringband styles and jazzy jug-band blues and, not incidentally, made some of the catchiest music ever. In addition to great sound quality and great material, the CD is handsomely packaged; the insert booklets include some really cool archival photos, as well as extensive liner notes of the sort that have been woefully absent on similar recent reissue efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"It is not a \\"how to\\" book.

There are only four vocals here--tracks 1, 3, 10 and 13--and only \\"On a Winter's Day\\" is sung in English.

I would never stomach the shame of having a bodice ripper cover at the check out counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed Lindsey's earlier Malory books years ago, and have been waiting for Jeremy's installment. I think my tastes have matured because the book was incredibly disappointing.Perhaps it could have overcome Jeremy's lack of personality if Lindsey had even a basic knowledge of Regency England. As it is, she displays little knowledge of the peerage, language, social customs, etc. that it's hard to concentrate on the story. Really, it's not THAT hard to understand rank and her story would work just as well if she could get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining, Easy Read...Wonderful!","review":"The book takes you to a really fun experience. Some readers found it a little disappointing, but the novel was a standard Ms. Lindsey rendition, that quite satisfies the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Jeremy Mallory gets his story","review":"A Loving Scoundrel is Jeremy Mallory's story. Finally and well done are all I can say. I read it in one night, couldn't put it down. Jeremy's immediate recognition of Danny as a girl is funny and reminecent of James' discovery of George's deception in Gentle Rogue. I loved Jeremy's wit and Danny's confusion at her reactions to Jeremy. Having been disguised as a male for the last 15 years, she now thinks like one and it definitely takes some getting used to...being a female and all those female feelings. It was great fun to see some of my favorite charaters, James and Anthony Mallory, Regan Eden. This Mallory story is wonderful and fits perfectly with Jeremy. Now the next one we need is Drew Anderson. Yum!~! Johanna, I hope that's the next one you write. Congratulations on a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid Lindsey Reader","review":"Johanna Lindsey is a wonderful author and I love the Malory series. Jeremy is a 25 year old bachelor not looking to settle down when he plots to catch a thief to help his friend Percy retrieve family heirlooms. He catches Danny, who has been a \\"boy\\" for the last 15 years in a gang of thieves. When Danny is ousted from the gang for breaking the rules she makes Jeremy hire her feeling he owes her a job. The chemistry between Jeremy and Danny makes it difficult to put the book down. This book is a great addition to the Malory series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh!","review":"What in the world was this? Totally not romantic. JL's books are turning into hit or misses now. I wanted to read Jeremy's story so badly too, like a lot of reviewers. But he was awful in this! He was uncaring, shallow, and, well, dumb! I couldn't for the life of me bring myself to like Danny either. She was annoying. Although she certainly didn't deserve the way he took her virginity. JL seems to fail in that in almost every book. The loss of a woman's virginity is an important, emotional, intense scene, not an oh-my-God-you-just-took-my-virginity-why-did-you-do-that-I-didn't-say-you-could-take-my-virtue scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment for Jeremy's story ....","review":"I can't believe I'm saying this about a Lindsey book, and most especially about a Malory one ... .but I was totally, 100%disappointed in Jeremy's story. I have been waiting so long for him to have his own story (and incidently, I was so sure it was going to focus on his \\"bet\\" with Amy from The Magic of You, but I guess I don't write the books!)I read a Shirlee Busbee story exactly like this a few years ago (think it was called Whisper to Me of Love) ... missing heiress, raised on the streets, meets rich guy, becomes mistrees, finds long lost family, marries rich guy, etc, etc.I bought this book to complete my collection, but I know I won't re-re-re-re-read this one like some of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"loving a scoundrel","review":"this book was a continuation of a collection of mallory novels i already had. great read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying","review":"I could not believe this book. First Jeremy had absolutely no charm whatsoever. He relied solely on his looks and he was just as bad as Emily in this book by doing whatever he deemed nevessary to get what he wanted. The heroine even though she wanted him had morals and since she wouldn't give into him he deliberately waited unti she was drunk to sleep with her which in my book is the same thing as date rape. I expected so much more from Lindsey but after reading this and A Man to Call My Own too I'm taking her off my list. I just could not believe that the 'hero' would resort to date rape to get Danny to sleep with him. This book was flat and nothing up the Lindsey's usally caliber. The only good parts in the book are when James and Anthony are sparing which unfortunately isn't very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those Malory's!","review":"I love the Malory clan! I was very excited to hear that Jeremy would be getting his own story and was very pleased with the book. I was worried because some of the reviews say that Jeremy takes advantage of Danny when she's drunk (even comparing it to date rape?), but I just didn't see it that way. Jeremy didn't give Danny the champagne or even encourage her to drink it. I didn't get the impression that Danny was drunk - just tipsy.I do wish Jeremy's character had been more fleshed out (more indepth description). In the other Malory novels I really had a visual of the character - especially Anthony and James =), but despite that the Malory novels/family are still my favorites and reading Jeremy's story has just made me want to re-read all of the Malory novels yet again!A good read and can be found pretty inexpensive online. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"just finished great book!","review":"I really enjoyed it. i thought it was quite comical how even some of jeremy's relatives thought she was a guy at first.

The way they portray the people and the different races in this movie is the way G. Gygax would have you play his races in the DnD game(my opinion). It has its somewhat corny but funny interactions with the characters. As well as the ever present good vs. evil. The actors play there characters well. And Jack Palance's voice in his character fits it perfectly. Could not have gotten a better person for the part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy!

Even still, we frequently had to stir, stopping and starting the blender over and over again, hoping for the best. Recently, the blender began to smoke and smell every time we made a smoothie.The Waring makes every smoothie, every time, no matter how thick, and without supervision. I throw a bunch of frozen fruit in there, strawberries as hard as ice cubes, fill it even just half-full of juice, throw the switch and walk away.

What a hassle that could have been avoided if they had simply built a reliable product in the first place. Waring customer service had no one available to take my call and asked me to leave a message. No one called me back; I finally had to call their Sales Dept to talk to someone (it's funny how they always have someone to answer phones in the Sales Dept but Service is always out \\"helping other callers\\").I also noticed the glass chipping that was mentioned in an earlier review. I thought maybe I had chipped it accidentally, although I couldn't remember doing so. If this problem is endemic to this model, it certainly makes sense.If you want a reliable blender, I advise you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the power expected","review":"I purchased this blender expecting outstanding power from a simple design. It is simple, for example the container is a sealed unit; you cannot separate the blade unit from the glass. I prefer this design since it prevents leaks, there's no gasket to baby, and it cleans easily. However, I was disappointed with the lack of power. Smoothies and blended drinks require more time and effort than expected. If I had it to do over, I'd purchase a different unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"I purchased this item 14 months ago and it stopped working suddenly today. This blender was not used on a regular basis and was purchased for making crushed ice drinks and other general use. It worked ok for general use but not so good for crushed ice drinks and it has proven to be not very durable having broken so quickly. When I checked the Warring website for an authorized repair center to attempt to have it repaired under warranty, only one location within 100 mile radius was found and their telephone number was no longer in service. After doing more research on-line about this item I found that I am not alone in my opinion of its performance. At this point I have decided not to invest anymore time or money in having this blender repaired because it did not work that great in the first place. In my opinion this product was no better than an inexpensive blender found in any department store. I think its time to move on to another brand with a better consumer rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waring Pro - under powered","review":"I bought this six years ago mainly because my father used Waring blenders at the restaurant he owned for 36 years. I was disappointed in its lack of power. It does cut up ice cubes well enough but was not powerful enough for ice cream drinks so you have to baby it a little bit or you will notice the motor starting to smell. I add extra liquid and or ice to help the blender along when doing ice cream drinks though this does make for a soupier drink. I also bought one of these for my son and he burned the motor out within a year. If you are going to use it for ice based drinks like Margarita's it is okay but otherwise find a blender that cranks out at least 750 watts as opposed to the 390 watts this one does. A misnomer to call this a \\"Pro\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same old blender","review":"I read the reviews, should have listened.We had an older model with less watts that made us smoothies every morning for over 5 years. The motor burned out on day, figured it had performed well for the price paid. Wanting to stick with the same brand and type we bought this model. When it came I saw the base was larger and that it had a higher watt motor. Initially I thought this was a good thing. Nope. Didn't even last 6 months and its dead. Just another example of what our manufacturing industry is doing to cut costs. Please someone start making appliances and tools like they used too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn-out Waring Blender","review":"I purchased the Waring Pro Blender for my daily protein smoothie. However, the blender broke down after only 8 months (bearins squeeling and motor smells). From what I have read, the frozen fruit that I added almost daily should have been softened. However, Waring's promotion of this product does not mention that the blender will not stand-up to this. In fact, you would reach quite the opposite conclusion from their advertising.It works fine otherwise...but is now junk after 8 months use."},{"rating":"2","title":"so so smooth!!!","review":"Over the years I've owned many cheap to moderately priced blenders.

Would highly recommend to anyone!! AND Amazon had the best price around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 month of light use - not good for fruit smoothies.","review":"My wife purchased this blender specifically for blending fruit shakes and smoothies. It worked quite well for that purpose until... it broke after 1 month of light use - the threaded shaft which the blade is attached to just snapped clean off. The metal on the inside of the snapped shaft looks like a cheap, weak, alloy. It's sad that Waring has decided to cut corners in this way. They don't make them like they used to. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment - it leaks!","review":"I bought this blender after careful reserach; it was recommended by Consumer Reports and others. From the beginning liquid escaped around the lid and I learned to live with that. Soon, it began leaking from the base of the jar and nothing I did alleviated the leaking. I tried everything. I finally threw it away, went to a discount store and bought one for $20. It's working great. Don't waste your money on this appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"We owned this blender for a year and a couple months. Used it mainly on the weekends in the summer, to make smoothies with frozen fruit, so I wouldn't say we were heavy users. I burned the motor out today--the unit was visibly smoking after running for about a minute or so. This particular blender was a replacement for a previous Waring that lasted us over 10 years before it died (also from a burned out motor). Not sure if this blender was a dud or whether the quality of the Waring motors is getting worse. I'm going to send this one in for a fix or replacement since the motor is covered under a 5 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"You would think after making blenders for over 50 years this company would be able to do it right by now. Bought this to make frozen smoothies to replace a $29 Black and Decker that died after 5 years.Packed the glass container with frozen berries, yogurt, and soy milk. Hit the start button with high expectations anticipating the power of the old Black and Decker. Boy was I disappointed at this weaklings inability to cut through the wimpiest of fruits. It took over 10 minutes to blend what took the B and D just 3 minutes, plus I had to continually water down the blend. The motor started to smell and I could tell it was overheating.I am returning this piece of junk tomorrow! This thing is a poor excuse for a blender.Do not waste your time with this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waring Pro Blender with new blade design","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S8F8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleLooks nice but who cares about looks when blender fails to blend. Specific claims refer to Waring Pro completely handles frozen fruit and ice, but the blade and shaft design causes the blade to loosen on the shaft. So far maintenance requires the retaining nut to be tightened to keep the shaft from turning while the blade does not. Found out after the purchase that it's common for the shafts to snap (replacement cost $25.00.) Also the motor is very loud on high speed, and not so quiet on the low speed.Blender, waring pro"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoothie Blender","review":"First off the blender came missing the plastic cap. I went ahead and tried to make a smoothie using frozen fruit, some orange juice and ice. This blender does not have the power to chop up frozen fruit. It would continuously clog up and I would have to get a spoon out to mix. I would not recommend this for anything that requires frozen fruit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment!","review":"I read the other reviews, and thought I had finally found a blender that would crush ice, make daiquiris, and blend soups, and this blender did none of those things! Even after adding 2 cups of water to the ice, the blade just spun around and never mixed the cubes into the blend. Only the bottom inch or so ever got blended. The same thing even happened with some cooked tomatoes in juice. Only the very bottom food got blended; then I had to stop and stir up the contents. After several stops, I decided this was just not a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"With all the other 5 star ratings, I thought well, ok, if itdoes work great than I don't mind spending (the money) But, this machine works like something you would buy for (much less).I was hoping to make frozen drinks quickly, and without the machine sounding like it's working too hard . Amazon advertises it to be a Professional Bar Blender and to have 390 watts of power, that sounds great! But, I would never use this machine for Professional use when it barely blends for home use.I am majorly dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few uses","review":"We don't use our blender every day. So, when we do get it out we expect it to work. We got this one as a gift two years ago. We've used it maybe 2-3 times and it has already broken. The blade just fell off in the process of blending a soup that was not very hot and consisted of very soft squash. I will never purchase this brand again. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"We used this blender probably a total of 5 times before the metal base FUSED to the motor!!!! It literally became FUSED!! Now, we thought all we had to do was order the base part from the Waring company. No, they don't sell that part. I was told by the Waring customer service people that I would have to take the blender to be serviced. Ha! Like I'm going to spend $45 to repair a BLENDER! We are buying a new one....needless to say it won't be a Waring blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive, but not very functional","review":"This blender is attractive, but just doesn't work very well. It only has two speeds, high and very high. It seemed to have difficulty even on simple tasks like smoothies, perhaps because an air bubble often appears down by the blades due to the high speed. It is also extremely noisy, even for a blender.I ended up buying a much cheaper blender (a Braun) instead and put this one away on a top shelf to use only for parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't make em like they used to","review":"I purchased this blender on the basis of my Waring blender that I purchased in 1968 and is still going strong. I broke the jar and decided it was time for another one. So I bought this one, professional quality not withstanding. When I tried to make my daily smoothie (milk, Yogurt, and frozen fruit), this blender needed some stirring assistance to get things blended up. I don't call that professional quality. If it won't make a smoothie, I figure there are a lot of other things it won't do. So I returned it. I think the way this blender is advertised is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product broke in 1 month","review":"We received this product just over a month ago, and it has already broken.

After a few months the shaft holding the blade sheared off. You could see it was made of cheap alloy. (Other reviewers have reported the same experience.) We returned it and got a replacement. It worked alright for more than a year, but now after a few seconds of blending frozen fruit for smoothies, it smells like something is burning, and it makes ominous noises. The warranty has expired, so we'll use it until it dies and then buy something else.

From the start it was never a great blender. Even when making smoothies, I have to stop it and use a large spoon to move around the ingredients. After about two years of use (and it wasn't used too often, maybe once a month for soup, milkshakes, or smoothies) the engine just stopped. Very disaapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Product","review":"Read the negative comments about this blender carefully, because they are all true, to some degree. This blender mixes thick liquids and soft foods readily and quite quickly, but fails miserably at blending almost anything frozen. And the motor does smell as if it is about to burn out when it has the least trouble blending ingredients, which occurs frequently. I have the Oster 4096 blender also, and at almost 40% less in price, the Oster outshines this Waring by a mile. Waring should be ashamed of this product, and the engineers who designed it should be ashamed as well, and I will not purchase another Waring product, for fear they are still working for the company. Use of the word \\"Professional\\" in the product description is laughable; this blender wouldn't last a day in a professional setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is the worst blender I've ever owned. I set it up, put in some plain water to clean it, turned it on, and it did just fine with water. So I proceeded to blend soaked chile peppers and water to make Mexican mole sauce, per the recipe in Diana Kennedy's \\"The Cuisines of Mexico\\". It sounded very sluggish on either low or high, like it was really straining and under-powered. It was blending, so I know the blade was not stuck, but very feebly. Then the unit started smoking. I just hope I can get my money back. This is nothing like the Waring blender may parents owned when I was growing up, which lasted for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk, bad customer service","review":"I had this blender for about 2 weeks, when it decided to jam up and my last smoothie had a torn rubber washer and broken glass in it.

The chanson features false relations (not helped by a momentary tenor unsteadiness) which the booklet should have explained as, to the uninitiated, they sound like wrong notes. The Mass is beautifully complex, based on a motet by Josquin. If this is of any significance, it should have been included.Van Nevel's group is called The Huelgas Ensemble, but, on record at least, it is never the same line up. However, they generally achieve the same lucid choir sound for him (here including distant doves between the Credo and the Et incarnatus, and a sparrow in the Agnus dei. That's a rural venue for you!). There is something for choral conductors to learn from this. The voices are not all ideal, but they blend and respond superbly in some wonderful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"plain ridiculous","review":"Books like this are just ridiculous and, as stated by another reader, have the only utility of being used to prove how many nonsenses the author has written. Just to be clear: special relativity theory has been successfully tested in hundreds of experiments and is completely sound. Not a single professional scientist is questioning its validity. General relativity has been tested in many experiments but there are still crucial points to be checked, for instance gravitational waves have never been DIRECTLY detected. On the other hand there are indirect proves of their existence (Taylor's binary stars for the interested reader).

Just one example is his statment that the Michelson-Morley experment should have shown an interference patern due to length contraction. Length contraction only occures if two objects have a relative motion. Since the A - B arm had no relative motion with respect to the observer, no length contraction is predicted by relativity. The book only has value to the extent that a student of Relativity might be chalenged a bit, and thus increase their knowledge, if they are able to explain why Mr Kamenov is wrong.

The admitted lack of knowledge of the many standard paradoxes is evident with instances of rookie frame jumping. The doppler shift conclusion and simultaneity proof are both wrong. The only possible way to assault relativity, given its mathematical self-consistency, is externally by empirically invalidating a postulate. The model still remains error-free, however it also remains open to a demonstration of not capturing reality. Meanwhile the orbital precession of Mercury, relativistic correction of the GPS satellite system and Fermi Lab's particle beams are all in compliance.Those more knowledgeable of Physics look for a more inclusive theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music but lacks written lyrics and translations!","review":"I love the music but I purchased the CD because I needed the music and lyrics for a particular song.

Definitely felt like I was watching a Tom Cruise/Mel Gibson wanna be in regards to Bale. I found him irritating and obnoxious whether he was trying to be or not. Perhaps I would have liked it better w/someone else playing that role.It's quite the story and perhaps I would like the documentary better. At times the movie was cheesy, especially all the scenes w/his fellow pilots. UGH! Really wished I could have liked this movie.

But this actually works in its favor, giving it a gritty and real feel. Christian Bale continues to amaze, not only is this role wildly different from Batman, but he inhabits it so well, that you pretty much forget it is Bale or you think this must be the \\"real\\" Bale.The story itself is incredibly compelling. Brutal, real, sad, inspiring. All of that. The more so because it is apparently mostly true (I gather that there are some descendants of some of the secondary characters who dispute some of the movie's accuracy).The movie isn't long, but you feel like you have been through the ringer. Never boring, the movie paces itself remarkably well, alternately showing the painful slow passage of time and then with the anxious desperation of events that quicken the pace.I am very glad I sought this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Classic!","review":"I do love this movie... I mean, Werner Herzog directed it, Christian Bale and Steve Zahn totally represented in awesome performances... But after watching the movie, I couldn't help asking myself, \\"Why'd you feel the need to buy this on Blu-Ray?\\"I guess Blu-Ray just adds a little bit of awesomeness to a movie like this, but not in the same way that it adds to a movie like The Dark Knight, or The Matrix.

I've purchased at least 20 rolls of this paper, and it's always the same. There are plastic end caps that get hit in the box during shipping and handling, and as a result the end caps make indentations on the edges of the paper. You need to unroll at least a third of the roll to get past the damaged edges, so you lose a ton of paper, and money, of course. Now, if you don't need to use the full 42-inch width, you'll be fine because you can just trim the dings off the edges of the paper.

I don't care how Justice Breyer feels about an issue. A judge should not impose a moral viewpoint when the text of a law is silent. The Constitution can be amended as it has been 27 times before. But amendments are difficult to pass, as they should be, and those of Justice Breyer's political philosophy do not trust the people to get it right so they create terms like active liberty to confuse the uninformed. For those who agree with Justice Breyer I would like to play them in poker, with \\"active rules\\" which \\"grow\\" and \\"evolve\\" during the course of the game so that I can win every hand.

Author Charles Byrd will lull you into a sense of simple status quo, then pull the chair out from under where you sit as he paints incredible descriptions of the people and places of the bigoted south in the mid 20th century. It was a time when interracial dating was not frowned upon, but forbidden by unwritten laws. Set in Maple Shade, Virginia, Byrd tells a story about Marsella and Larry - sixteen year old teenagers who fall in love, even though she is black, and he is white. Cry for Marsella will make you think, and wonder, about a time forgotten. His incredible plot and strong characters turns this book into a real page-turner. When you least expect it, another twist, and the author delivers a powerful punch of intrigue and passion.

I have \\"waded\\" and actually completed one volume of the history by Fine (cover-to-cover) and part of the second volume. Believe me it gets painful in places.

Though not as detailed as other books, it nonetheless conveys with great clarity the past of that region. It greatest value, however, is not the masterly summary of a complicated history, but the theme which the authors see in Bosnia's past -- a theme of tolerance and cooperation among diverse people. The popular notion that Bosnians, Serbs, and Croats have always hated each other is misleading and, more importantly, dehumanizing. The authors have done a wonderful job of countering that notion by cogently arguing for a more sympathetic approach to Bosnia's people and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, now, if I only could get it in it's proper form.","review":"I am hereby advising any potential buyers to steer clear of this product, unless you 100% know what you're getting yourself into.I was surprised to find out that there were so many copies of this floating around now (not to mention that it seems you can order it straight from Amazon,) but upon receiving the package in mail, I now realize why is that.This new repress of this album is quite simply a pressed cd-r with crappy printed one-sided covers.

There is much more to Hackman's character than the cut version shows, which makes him, and the movie, exceedingly more interesting. This US release, unfortunately, is the cut down version, which has, of course cut out some of the most important aspects of the story.I would like to see the uncut version, which I believe is the European release, made and re-released for American audiences.

I think the thing that bothered me was the author's attempt to convince the reader that reincarnation is true--he cites various religious books from around the world.In my opinion, a fiction writer should lead the reader toward a suspension of disbelief, not beat him over the head with facts and arguments. Little clues should add up that allow the reader to get lost in the story.I loved the \\"Exorcist\\" and \\"RoseMary's Baby,\\" but Audrey Rose just did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another forgotten gem!","review":"First, this book fails somewhat as a horror novel, because the author didn't explore/exploit the horror elements as much as a horror fans like me would have liked to see. Yet, a horror fan will find the novel satisfying, nonetheless. Mostly, the novel succeeds at the metaphysical level, challenging the reader's core beliefs about who we are as a race, and what becomes of us after death. Therefore, the book has a broader appeal. The one problem with the book, however, is that it bogs down into a courtroom drama, thus ruining the pace, although the content here is engaging. Also, the ending is somewhat disappointing. I'm not sure if three stars is more suitable, but the book is a good read, regardless. Also, be sure to check out the film, staring Anthony Hopkins.

Anakin thinks Padme is going to die OF childbirth because he is seeing visions, then he finds a way to save her but it's through the dark side, he joins and padme finds out, it breaks her heart. When she has Luke and Leia, she doesn't die of childbirth, she dies of a broken heart, because of Anakin. Amazing movie! It's a have to see movie!

It is everything you could ask from a Star Wars film. i wish some \\"Star Wars\\" fans would bash this film because it didn't live up to their expections. Some people you can't please!!

Although the fights are cool, way Anakin goes from 'Oh No! I just killed a Jedi Master' to \\"Okay, now I'll go kill children!\\" is well...rediculous. Basically most everything about this movie is nothing like it should be. We should see some really powerful movement to the dark side here. All we get is...well I'm not really sure.

The final scenes of Vader being encased in the black shell we know and love are absolutely horrible and unforgiveable.

It still did not live up to #'s 4-6. And at this point, probably no one expected it to. The casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin/Vader was a very bad choice. To me, Christensen and Lucas turned Anakin into a whining, pouting character, rather than the truly over-confident, suddenly angry and fierce dark force he eventually became (whom we in the 1970's grew to love). It was very difficult for me to view the movies in order (1-6) and see the jump from a sniffling, pouty-lipped Anakin to an amazingly scary Dark Sith Lord. It just didn't work for me.

The plot is lame, Lucas had THREE movies to detail the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker and Anakin turns to the Dark Side like in 15 seconds with the all time lamest motivation. \\"I had a dream that my wife was going to die, if I learn the ways of the Dark Side I can learn how to bring her back to life!!\\" Sounds like a plan moron, too bad you couldn't have a dream about the thousands of soldiers that were going to betray the Jedi, pretty nifty bit of deception that.The list goes on and on but now I'm wondering why I took the time to review this waste of film so I'll stop here.Lucas is insane. This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the three prequels","review":"I just said it, this is the best of the star wars prequels. Please do add this to your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting end","review":"Episode three is finally here and the ending was well done. Sure there are numerous ways Lucas could have gone, but he chose this way. Other story lines continue in the books which are also well written.For close observers, there are a couple discrepancies between the first and second trilogies. For example in Empire, Obi Wan had to be reminded about Leia's existence when he was there when the twins were born. No big deal. E3 was definitely better than 1 and 2 but still don't stand up to the original trilogy.The one thing that was annoying was skinny Christensen in the Vader suit at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY BRAINS WERE POURING OUT MY EARS","review":"Influenced by all the hype, I looked forward to watching STAR WARS EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITHS. Boy, was I disappointed. I know this DVD is an Amazon Editor's Choice and has sold gazillions of copies, but inside of ten minutes of viewing REVENGE, my brains were starting to pour out through my ears. This film is for prepubescent teenage boys; I can't see how anyone else could take this childish drivel seriously. Disgusted, I turned the movie off rather than waste my time. For good (adult) sci-fi flicks, try BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN and maybe FIFTH ELEMENT or DUNE. I couldn't help but feel sorry for fine actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman who must have been paid sacks of the King's gold coin to get them to agree to do THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. They sold themselves to the dark side. Don't you."},{"rating":"1","title":"diabolically bad","review":"This is a complete waste of money. Its even worse than the three preceding Star Wars, without any of the wonderment of the first lot. If the Devil decided to come to earth and manifest himself in the form of bad computer-made sci-fi films this would be what we would see. The only reason I give it a one-star is that Euan McGregor does a plausible younger version of Alec Guiness. But he's the only one who can act amongst the cast anyway. I can't say how much I hate this film, its completely unconvincing. Its failure is on a galactic scale. This film is as bad as Jupiter is a big planet. It radiates talentlessness the way the sun radiates light. Considering the budget and celebrities they had available to make this movie it really deserves to be called, along with the other star wars', amongst the worst films in the history of universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"just clearing up a point","review":"A whole bunch of you guys are talking about Leia and how she remembers her mother.

And Return of The Sith is the best of the six movies due to character development and overall drama -even though everyone knew how the movie would end. Sith actually had me feeeling sympathetic to one of the greatest villains in cinema history. And that is no easy feat!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closes the loose ends nicely","review":"If you like star wars movies at all, you have to see this one. It does an excellent job of bridging from 1 and 2 to 4/5/6. All the loose ends I could think of are closed nicely, and you walk away with a nice feeling of closure for how the whole story holds together over all 6 episodes.If you haven't seen the others, I'd start at star wars and empire strikes back though, instead of this. They were better movies. This one has several drawbacks as a stand alone movie, namely moderate acting and poor dialog in many cases. Also for kids its a bit dark.But if you've already done the other 5, this is a must see, and an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Full Screen Edition)","review":"Quick ship, CD in excellent condition & just what I would expect to buy new"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment.","review":"George, after this trilogy of fiascos I am NOT looking forward to Indy 4.I'm sure you're concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the three","review":"Hayden Christensen still needs some acting lessons, and the romance scenes are as ham-fisted as ever, but this is still a dark, entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help","review":"Hello amazon.com readers.

Ok, the special effects were great...but man, the dialogue and the story progression just didn't do it for me. I was BORED stiff, shakin' my head at times to the dialogue - wow, couldn't believe how bad the film was. I totally agree with the person who posted earlier that ANAKINS progression of going over to the dark side was just too quick and not believable. Bottom line, special effects were great....the story/dialogue was a big disappointment. I wonder if seeing BATMAN BEGINS the night before increased my expections - now that was a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Disappointments, but still Magical","review":"Whatever happened to the bold and beautiful Padmé? She's reduced to a caricature of her former self, and doesn't do much more than wring her hands helplessly and sigh ceaselessly over her beloved's antics throughout the movie. The dialogs are incredulously corny and I missed the witty C-3PO - R2-D2 banter a lot.Despite the aforementioned disappointments, it retains enough of the the \\"Star Wars\\" magic to enchant audiences; and I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous visuals, the exotic landscapes, the fun sequences, and all of the endearing characters now indelibly etched into our minds and hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Star Bores\\"","review":"Enough already! The thrill has been gone for a long time now. Episode III is a complete waste of time, but it shouldn't erase fond memories of the earlier, far superior films. George Lucas needs to retire from filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This isn't the payoff the fans deserved. George Lucas has somehow, again, brought out the worst performances in otherwise good actors, and unless you're super excited about watching two hours of pointless CGI battle scenes before the story gets halfway interesting, don't get your hopes up. It is better than the prior two episodes, but that's not really a compliment. After all this time, the (presumed) final Star Wars film should have given us a real sense of closure, not dissapointment and wishing for more. Thanks for taking our money again, George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue screen of death !!","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers here about the severe lack of actual sets and props used by mr lucas thesedays, whatever happened to giving the actors something to work with .While I am sure the fight in ROTS will be bigger than anything before , the fact that the actors have no set at all kind of negates them even being there , why not just cg them as well ??The scene in Episode 2 where obi-wan goes to check out his droid army can be clearly seen as all cg, he rarely gets one eye line correct in 15 minutes , then Jango fett appears and its like wooooooo a real person !!! not a good file mak'eth .Peter Jackson got it right , use plenty of real sets where possible and do the crazy stuff in post.Bring back the reality and give the actors something more tangible to work with than someone waving a stick about trying to get the idea across that you are in a volcano or something when you can see pizza hut out the window !!

After they kill him Anikan has to have revenge of Count Dooku because in Attack Of the Clones his arm got cut off.Soon Count Dooku defets Obi wan - Konbie.And Anikan defets Count Dooku.STOP.This is just the begging.1.Is Obi really dead?2.Where is Padm'e?

Be prepared, though, for some seriously bad performances. The writing and acting are so bad, it's almost funny. Almost. More often, it just kind of turns your stomach.Special effects are good, but actually not as good as you might be expecting. Palpatine's transformation to the deformed Emperor is especially disappointing. A few times the old magic seems to be there--but then one of the actors opens his or her mouth, and it's all ruined.Bottom line: go to see how it all fits together, but don't go with high or even moderate expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it had to be.","review":"This film was simply what it had to be. It was the final piece of the puzzle and as such, is worth adding to your collection. Far superior to episodes I & II, this movie provides a type of closure. We now know the origin of Vader's illness, and relationship to the Sith master. We also are given the circumstances of his turn from good to evil as well as a background to why the force is so strong in Skywalker.The movie has a nice pace and feel, and keeps your attention with better than average acting and as always, superior effects. The one major positive of this movie is the ill-concieved immaturity of Annakin has dissipated. This allows one to actually enjoy the film without being distracted by the man child's crying over perpetually spilled milk. The story could have been made a bit clearer, and the dialouge a bit crisper, but in all this is a worthy addition to the Star Wars family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know it will be better than Attack Of The Clones","review":"Even though I haven't seen this movie yet, I still know that it will be even better than the 2 previous marvels. This is it, this is where we learn everything about how Anakin becomes \\"The Dark Lord Of The Sith\\" Darth Vader. These are very exciting times for Star Wars fans, I know I'm excited.

No, Mr. Lucas, that was not a good ending for Star Wars, just as i said \\"a lost chance\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"kingk","review":"George Lucas has had plenty of time to think about how to plan the prequals to the Star Wars gendre. He should have set his ego aside and hired writers to bring that to life. Dialogue is choppy and corny, you can see where he wants to go in the story, but just doesn't deliver. He uses CGI to distract heavily and cover-up that fact. Amazing as the effects are, he didn't have that option on the originals(IV-VI), and turned out iconic sci-fi movies.Point blank, his own ego has ruined the prequals into childish, effects-laden engines to drive merchandizing and a sure sign George has taken to believing his own press to folly.Great movie if you're 10, but as an adult, hard to get through if you've seen and liked the un-remade originals. I'm glad it's over, I couldn't stand more disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars- III Revenge of the Sith.","review":"This episode is the darkest and possibly the weakest of the three.

Well, yeah. but that isn't saying much.Sure, it takes place in the Star Wars Universe but shows little of the creativity, liveliness or spirit of the first three films. The dialogue is horrible, the performances are wooden and again the effects are so busy that you have a headache about 30 minutes in. Lucas somewhere along the way forgot that made the first three so much fun and that is characters you care about.The only thing that would have saved this yawn-fest is if he had let Lawrence Kasdan write the scripts as he did the original.Skip it and watch Episodes 4, 5 and 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahem!","review":"How to review a film that hasn't been showed yet?

Some Star Wars purists had a problem with the special editions of A New Hope et consortes, but I must say the were even better than the originals, given that mr Lucas could \\"fix\\" a few problems thanks to the new technology that wasn't available the first time around. Lucasfilm has also been instrumental in developing film technology over the years. I just hope the don't make the Revenge Of The Sith look \\"antiseptic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it, Lucas, drama isn't your strength","review":"While the graphics and creatures are fun to watch, the acting and script were, if this is possible, worse than the previous two. Lucas did a great job with the old three because he was making them as action adventure movies. In these new three, he attempts to portray drama and it comes across cheesy, fake, and often laughable. The dialogue is cliched and poorly delivered. There have only been three good actors in these new three movies, and two of them let us down in this finale. Christopher Lee by dying in the first scene and Ewan McGregor by having zero zeal in his delivery. Lord Sidious was excellent on the other hand, outshining anyone else in the poorly casted entourage. The one redeeming part of the flick? No Jar Jar Binks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor audio quality","review":"The picture was excellent.But the Audio was weak.Muddled center channel the voices were sometimes hard to hear and understand.DVD states that audio was Dolby EX encoded but the EX tag only lit up during the THX presentation then went away for the remainder of the movie.Subwoofer was used heavily at the beginning of the movie but was seldom used after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ending","review":"Revenge of the Sith is a great movie.

Did it have cheesy parts? Well, I don't know...is it a Star Wars film? If you're like me, you don't rate these movies on the same scale as others. There is a sentimentality to it like no other.

There is practically nothing of C3-P0, little of R2D2, and Yoda doesn't have anything to do until the last quarter of the picture. The Friday matinee I attended was packed with small children, who had absolutely no interest in following the moral degeneration of Anakin Skywalker. They were too busy crawling over the seats and yelling \\"Shoo! Shoo!\\" with their imaginary lightsabers, or dragging their parents (I should say mommies) to the snack bar and the restroom.

Being the turning point in the whole saga, Episode III provided me with the significance I've been waiting for so patiently. Of course I'm talking about the death of the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and the birth of the evil Sith Lord Darth Vader. The events of Episode III were so intense for me, it was like watching The Empire Strikes Back again for the first time (I seriously almost cried at the moment when Anakin was being burned near the lava with no legs screaming at Obi-Wan \\"I hate you!!\\" Whoa intense) . And not only the rise of Darth Vader, but also seeing the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, and the birth and separation of Luke and Leia were all great things to see.

The worse part is when Vader speaks for the first time and says, \\"Where is Padme?\\". I don't think anyone ever pictured that being the first words uttered by the dark lord of the Sith!

Matrix Revolutions), ppl come out confused and dissapointed and ask themselves \\"WHY!?\\". i just know it, and i have to say, the only movie Mythology/Trilogy that has never dissapointed me was the Lord Of The Rings, Best movie trilogy EVER.

No. Do I plan on seeing it? Well given the festering pile of garbage in the corner that was the first two I am highly less likely to see this one.Where do I begin in detailing how horrible the prequels in general were? From total screwing up canon ( New Hope: Obi Wan\\" I don't recall ever owning any droids) to the text book definition of crappy acting.

I hate you George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What we have waited for...","review":"This Star Wars movie outdoes the other prequels in a way that lets you look over some of the more negative aspects of the movie. I do recomend that anyone watching this movie has seen the other Star Wars movies, as well.The acting in this movie has improved significantly, although in a few parts the actors seem to slip. The special effects work very well with this movie. The score is excellent, as is expected of John Williams. General Grievous proves to be an interesting villain. There are some very powerful moments in this movie, but I think that they will be appreciated greater by fans of the series.Lucas has done a good job redeeming himself here, and has made sure not to disappoint the series' fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am an ORIGINAL Star Wars Fan","review":"This movies have no mystic, no magic, no passion, they were just made to collect money. There is no chemistry between the characters, the humor is lame, the acting of the main character... worth laughing, in fact you do laugh when it's supposed to be a serious scene. This last prequel episode was the last chance to redeem the lame storyline beneath this beginning, and, as expected after seeing Episodes I and II, it did not stand on it's own and it's years light behind the chemistry, the passion, the plots and characters from the ORIGINAL STAR WARS SAGA, the Star Wars we all want to remember; Darth Vader as a menacing man with a dark past, not a wining kid that cries all day and moans about Padme... for God's sake, I am a Star Wars Fan, but an original one, this new prequels I prefer to forget, all of the three. Nice fights and nothing more; even the effects of the old ones are more believable than all this computer generated exagerated stuff. Move along, move along..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge of the Sith","review":"Perhaps the best of the Star Wars movies. Ewan McGregor rises to a strong Obi-Wan while Hayden Christensen sinks into a sinister Darth Vader. Episode 3 links the trilogies. Anakin goes to the dark side by signing a pact with the devil in hell, a planet of volcanoes. He marries Padme (Natalie Portman). Luke and Leia are their kids, making the younger Portman the mother of older Carrie Fisher. Lucas said this was the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes You Think...","review":"Wow, what a movie! I think the series was released in the right order. This one being the last one, grabs your attention by answering the original Star Wars fan's burning question of what made Anikin go over to the Dark Side.Episode III really makes you think about everything that's important. Disguised in this movie is a brilliant political statement about the world we live in. The leader you think is good has a way of blinding the young and uninformed to believe his way is the right way and you are fighting a good and just battle when in fact, the rest of the galaxy sees you as a rising Evil Empire.Then with the massacre of the Jedi and their younglings because of their religion; it reminded me of world history. Despite the fact that it got a PG-13 rating probably because of the final battle on the volcano planet which is graphic, young people should watch, learn and think about the message this movie offers. Mr. Lucas, this was simply brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This has to be the WORST of the Star Wars saga and I grew up with the originals. The characters could have been played with cardboard cut outs; they were so stiff and robotic. The reason Anakin turned to the dark side was also pretty lame and the film failed to show any torment on his part. Oh, well, I'm on the dark side now! Even my kids thought this was a horrible film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Bad...","review":"This will be the last! Maybe George Lucas has made enough money on his filmmaking to last his lifetime, but it sure would be good for us viewers if he could continue with 'Star Wars' until he runs out of books. I won't get into an argument about which films were best in the series...I liked them all. Obviously there are opinions abounding, but compared to most of the competition 'Star Wars' makes a very good showing. C'mon, George, don't stop now. Hollywood needs a lot of help. Outside of L.O.T.R. what is there to watch? Maybe a re-release of \\"The Corpse Grinders\\" or \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\"??? (Yeah, right!) Seriously, 'Star Wars' is good family entertainment and that is something that is in short supply. Perfect? No. Entertaining? I would say yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The light has completely gone out for me","review":"As compelling as a plank of wood, which all of the actors seem to be characterizing, ROTS lives up to its acronym with applomb--stumbling like a doped up bull in a china closet through 2 plus hours of something that I had dreamed, as a child of 10, would have been much better than this. The first three were not great films, but they were good movies... the latest three were simply heartless toy, fruit roll-up, and dvd sales vehicles.If you want to transcend the science fiction genre (and the hokiness and lack of humanity that the new Star Wars movies have in spades) and see some real character development, good story telling, and better special effects on a much lower budget, sit down in front of the TV on Fridays at 10 and watch Battlestar Galactica. It puts ROTS to shame.Hmmmmmm... Seems all the fanboys are quite diluded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome, overblown rubbish","review":"I liken this film to the story of The Emperor's New Clothes.To say I was disappointed with the Star Wars prequels is an understatement. Granted. The effects are, as so many have said, \\"jaw dropping,\\" but that is this film's only redeeming element. Remove the CGI and what do you have? Ridiculous dialogue, characters you could care less about, and a plot that is as uninspired as the acting.You want to see good Sci-fi? Wait for this one to hit the bargain bin and buy the Serenity DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on people...","review":"I admit that I am a purist. I love episodes 4,5, and 6 with a loyal passion. There were so many other directions that Lucas could (and should) have gone with the pre-quels and in this writers oppinion, he missed the mark.I'll grant you, Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are delicious eye candy, but it doesn't make up for the lack of tangible plot and the poor writing.George, I'm sorry. But you lost the force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"One \\"top\\" reviewer here quotes \\"the Jedi code,\\" which begins \\"There is no emotion...\\" Truer words were never spoken. It's as if the actors just wanted everything to be over with as quickly as possible. Many reviewers (and many respected) gave this film positive marks I suspect only in acknowledgement of George completing such an epic saga. This film however, on it's own merits, is hollow. Ewoks could have done it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Star Wars","review":"I read the book prior to seeing the movie. I found the movie too rushed and scenes left me wanting more. It was like half the conversations were completely left out. Not just conversations but entire scenes. Padame's role was pretty usless in the movie. She had no spark. My husband and I were confused at first thinking they substituted Natalie Portman with another actress. She looked a little different and her voice seemed odd at first. Not sure why. As for the turning of Anakin to the Dark Side, it was only slightly hit upon what his internal war was. It wasn't just Padame and if I hadn't read the book I would have been like, \\"This is it? This is the only reason he turned?\\" The movie basically fell flat for me. I doubt I will watch it a second time. If you want the full story, read the book. Regardless though, you have to watch it once just for the closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"So great. It tied everything together like it was hyped too.

As will with all Star Wars related items I give this DVD my patented 7 thumbs up. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but the exta feature with Yoda and the clones...classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't belive you if you don't LOVE this movie!","review":"I LOVE this movie more than any other movie I have ever seen. The backgrounds are great, the actors, and the plot. I know alot of other people think that this movie is horrible, but it is certainly not. I am an extremely emotion person ,so after the movie was over I couldn't even get out of my seat, I was trying so hard not to explode into tears. And when I got to the car, I had to sit there for 15 minutes to cry untill I could barely breathe. You grow so close to all the characters that they feel like they are apart of you. The writter of this movie was very good. The plot was wonderfull. My only regret is that I couldn't belive that someone almost laughed out loud when Anakin cried,\\"No!\\" (like Frankenstein acourding to them). Just to tell you, I was crying very hard at this point. The second this movie comes out, I will be FIRST in line to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story and tech that has holes in it","review":"I was very disapointed in this movie. The story was poor (no suprise). The movie was long with no flow. I keep wondering wondering when they were going to get on with it. The time line made no sense. Yoda was the only good thing about the movie and it was over down as well. I would not bother with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caro, A Movie LOVER!","review":"If you only buy one movie this year, let it be this one. I wasn't a Star Wars fan until I saw this movie. Not only did I love it because Anakin is a total Hottie, but because you wud think that Star Wars(before seeing it) would be all \\"oo let me get my lightsaber and chop your head off\\", but george lucas out does himself and makes it an action-adventure-sci-fi-and ROMANCE flick, oh yeah.

After all, where do they keep coming from? Thousands upon thousands of clientel for the Nubian manufacturers and ONE SENATOR keeps getting a new one. Where do they go?Anyway, very good. General Grievous is an unexpected, yet cynically delightful touch for ROTS. The first time I ever see the discharge of ENDLESS ionic and atomic weapons fire is on Gen. Grievous' ship. The rise of the Super Star Destroyers from the Republic, the odd ever-prevalent fluorescent lighting on board Gen. Grievous' ship: really explains a lot more than you think it does. Utupay is really a great work of engineering. It would have been hard for anybody to think of that. Palpatine does his utmost to seem creepy. And (if you have actually bought the DVD) the chapter title \\"Immolation\\" is so very appropriate. Please watch it. And look for the little things as well as the big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I loved this movie. It is nicely connected to the 4th episode.I wish they shoot another episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Year's best film!","review":"Not the bested acted film, mind you. But a wonderful, emotionalfinale to the greatest saga in film history. John Williams' score is the most powerful he's written in years-heartbreaking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT HAD TO BE DONE THAT WAY...","review":"I just saw the movie last night, and I was impressed with the special effects, costumes, and the story line. But I felt that although Hayden Christensen is great eye candy, his acting was weak and didn't seem natural. Natalie Portman looked great, loved her costumes, loved her acting. Everyone elses acting I felt was \\"okay\\". It didn't blow me away. The story was predictable, but of course it would be, since we all knew how it was all going to go down in the end. I felt the love story between Anakin and Padme was bitter sweet and sad, and the twin babies were so beautiful when she gave birth. A very tragic story and ending, but that is what gives way to \\"star Wars, The New Hope\\". Episode III is worth seeing and owning, though it is a bit long and the fight scenes do drag on slightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in Mrs. Jones","review":"I disagree because I really liked the way Lucas made us feel all the evil involved when Anakin chooses to use his great wisdom for evil and selfish purposes. It didn't make me cry. It made me think Lucas was no so bad a director. I mean it's hard to show evil like that on the screen. I think the duel vs. his friend and former master Obi Wan Kenobi was a lot of fun too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars III","review":"I didn't like that much, i saw it because of so much hype. It did explain a lot about previous episodes and the graphics were great. But the conversation was dull and boring, it didn't have any depth to it (read between the lines meaning). I hoped for it to be a deeper movie than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im only writing this review because of the trailer","review":"I saw the trailer on my computer the other day and I must say that this movie could ACTUALLY be something that is QUALITY. Of coarse I said the same thing with Attack of the Clones. Man was I wrong with that crapper."},{"rating":"2","title":"STARWARS 3","review":"Just take it for what it is I guess. I remember waiting, dying actually to see Clones. And half way through putting my hands over my eyes in shame. \\" I can't breathe without you Pademe\\". See what I mean. That was so uncomfortable to listen too I almost died laughing, and that was the last thing I wanted going in. But fear not GL claims this one is diffrent and at least he acknowledged that Clones was corny and that he did that on purpose. Thank god because I thought he didn't know.But this is the deal... If this was a football game, after the minuses of Clones, GL is looking at under 4 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and he is now down by two touchdowns. He is going to have to pull out all the stops and start scoring to have any shot at redemption. The clock is ticking"},{"rating":"2","title":"One last time...","review":"You might disagree with me but this was the best star wars movie ever. George did an exelent job with this final instalment. I liked how John Williams music gives emotion to the movie and how at the first half of the movie, you can hear sudden dull echoes of sound like if the climax was coming. It was pretty sad how all the jedi died, i almost cried. I loved those duels, specially palpatine against mace windu and yoda... At the end a tear almost came out of my eyes with that music and luke and everything.By the way one of the DELETED SCENES of this movie is when grievus stabs poor Ki-Adi-Mundi in front of obi wan and anakin on the cruiser and when yoda arrives in a small transport at dagobah, thi was the only thing i thought George shouldnt have deleted.If you havent seen it, buy it and watch it, if you have already seen it, then buy it and watch it again. Anyway this is the last piece of the most succesful saga in history of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I too old ?","review":"The special effects are great, however that's the only positiv thing I could find to say about this movie. Maybe I'm too old (28), but it just didn't work for me. I didn't feel suspense at the fight scenes, the romance was not romantic, the jokes were just not funny. By the end of the movie, I was bored and annoyed, and so on. Anyway, this was the last time Lucas saw any of my money that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shame it had to end!","review":"Lucas does a phenomenal job of tying up all the loose ends and showing how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is as gorgeous as ever (she didn't look too good in Garden State) and the light saber fights are awesome. There is one scene in particular where Obi Wan fights a robot that has several light sabres in his multiple arms.The only problem I had was that the Jedi seemed to be defeated too easily after all when they have the force working for them they should be able to know when they will be ambushed. Only Yoda seemed to have this power but I guess he is the most powerful Jedi.There was a surprise appearance of Chewbacca and some funny parts with R2D2. Should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite..","review":"I'm not a Star Wars diehard and own none of the DVDs and have no plans to. With, 'ROTS' Lucas hits the bullseye, in my opinion. I've seen it three times now. I truly feel it's the best Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see it I'm warning you!","review":"This movie did have a great set but the whole movie was just boring. I couldn't stand the dialogue in this it was just making me fall asleep. Ignore the reviewers they are just trying to give the movie critics credit and make everyone go see it. I really hated it and I also hate the first two also. The new Star Wars suck bad and I think the original is quite the best than the new ones. It was just dumb like the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOO! I Don't get it, how bad were the other 2?","review":"I loved the original Starwars, it had humor. This one doesn't. I swear I saw the actors checking their watches to see if they were done yet. When Yoda has the least stilted dialogue, the Wookie emote more than any one. And Ewan Mc Gregor's best chemistry is with is with a lizard. The fights scenes looked fake. OK and may its true that a Jedi knight doesn't sweat over a river of molten lava. I did not buy Anakin's motivation for going to the dark side. Well, I did laugh, just at the ridiculous of it. If you are collector, buy it. If not rent, watch it Mystery theater 2000 style, or take a shot everytime there is bad dialogue. No don't the last 5 minutes aren't bad. What a waste of wonderful actors and a story that might have shined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"How is Anakin the chosen one? Lets review his accompolishments: 1. Kills his wife 2. Blows up a planet (Alderan) 3. Slaughters childeren 4. Kills all the Jedi 5. Kills Palpatine (so that makes him the chosen one?) in ROTJ.The Dialogue was crap. Movie seemed like one big video game. Wouldnt the movie has been better had they completely cut out General Grievous character and shown Anakins turn to the darkside with more details. Also, Why didnt Anakin kill Palapatine after immediatly realizing he lied and didnt help him Save Padme. Im 12, and I can think of this. Why cant Mr Lucas? What the &*%#?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's just hope Williams' score doesn't get hacked apart","review":"Attack of the Clones featured an AWFUL cut and paste and reusage of music - some music from Phantom, some music from Clones repeated over and over again.

This movie comprises of boring scenes and laughable performances. Plotholes pervade an otherwise mediocre script. The dialogue was hilarious. The special effects is nothing special. I've seen better. Jar Jar Binks was the coolest movie character ever. He didn't appear in this movie as much. The best Star Wars movie or special was the Christmas special from 1978. May the farce be with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Big man Lucas really hit it this time. I know that most people consider the acting to be stiff, but I don't believe in bad or good acting, and I think you people need to be more optimistic. The fight scenes were wonderful, and the graphics were just outstanding. I love how the storyline flows so well into the original trilogy. I don't know how it came to be this way, since Attack of the Clones was pretty criticized by viewers, but it was released in such a spectacular way, and was so much better than even four through six. In short, I love the scenes, the story, the action, everything about this movie. It is a truly amazing way to end the six-part series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is like a playstation game","review":"After seeing the first 2 fag star wars i didn\`t expect this to be any better and i was right.The acting in this movie is terrible especially Anakin skywalker he is so stupid his dialogue is suitable for a reatard trying to speak english properly.Don\`t see this movie unless you enjoy wasting your hard earned money.The star wars movies from 1977 to 1983 were excellent but no big fat duck man had to puke out this vomit and completly DESTRU the star wars series.We had tomlive with the facts star wars has been DEMOLISHED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did George Lucas kill Padme off?","review":"I used to be a Star Wars fan until this.The fact that George Lucas killed Padme offis the opposite of what was said in Return Of The Jedi.Luke asked Leia if she remembered her REAL mother,and she told him that her mother died when she was young,not when she was born.That's why I thought that Padme was going tothe planet Alderaan with baby Leia.I have a guide to the star wars universe and itsays the same thing in the section about Darth Vader.Is it just me or did George forget what hewrote in Return Of The Jedi.This does not make sense and it makes thewhole durn story inconsistant.Just watch Return Of The Jedi and you willknow what I'm talking about.Scott"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas couldn't direct his way out of a wet paper bag!","review":"I've seen Saturday morning cartoon charaters with more depth, than the depth to the charaters in this movie!

But with no explaination in the movie, it's like he just dropped out of the sky or something!!! And as old and wise as Yoda is supposed to be, don't you think he'd be able to comprehend the English language by now?!? The other aliens don't seem to have that problem! Maybe this movie's pre-billing as \\"the darkest Star Wars movie ever\\", was more of reference to it's overall quality?!? Looking back, I think Lucas just got lucky with the original picture! With talent like Harrison Ford, even HE couldn't screw that one up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are not a fan of the star wars movies then this is a warning","review":"My friend forced me to see this becasue she is a fan of star wars and all. Luckily i did not have to pay for it. The worst thing about this is the crappy dialog. Ed Wood has written better stuff, i found myself laughing out loud at some of it the people look at me like i was weird or something. The actors in this movie are good actors but not in this movie they are'nt. The person to blame for this is Lucas he only has directed like 5 moives in his long carrer. He basically has lived of his production companys and these movies ever since. Another thing why did he do the screenplay to this has'nt he learned his lesson when the critics trashed the screenplay to the previous 2 before this.

He designed it as a whine filter to shut the kid up. Did anyone else find Skywalker to be a whiney tantruming spoiled child? I just wanted to send him to his room. I can't figure how he would become the most feared man in the galaxy.That said, and given an even lower quality dialog with repetitions and reminders and repetitions ... did I say repetitions. The movie failed to delve into his change to the dark side instead focusing on his love affair and fear of loss. One morning he woke up with dark circles under his eyes ... and poof ... he became the dark lord. Well I have to say, I feared loss when I walked up to the box office.

The last of the Star Wars films just confirms how bad the acting and dialogue was in all of the first three episodes.For example, consider how fast all the \\"loose strings\\" were tied up at the end to make way for \\"A New Hope\\".George Lucas should have hired better writers, and put forth a better effort into writing a better story, even stretching it out over, say, five movies, instead of being constrained to the three-episode format.On the brighter side, the dogfight scenes were visually very stunning, showing how far the franchise has come in the special effects department since 1977."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Lucas","review":"This movie was like a bad play with graphics. Even the graphics were wasted because most of the movie played out two inches from the actors' faces. The acting was horrible. They must have filmed this pile of garbage in one weekend because it seems as if they did one take per scene and said \\"that'll sell.\\" George Lucas should be hung up by his toenails and have his pockets emptied for putting out this joke of movie. The new trilogy was his chance to take enough time and care to create a masterpiece that we could all share, and he chose to disgrace himself and the Star Wars legacy. Shame on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"First the gunga-din, now this...","review":"What a terrible disppointment. The script is just awful, the acting pretty bad, the special effects we've seen before (nothing new)...We knew the movie had a tricky ending (we've known for twenty years that the bad guys win), but other than this it had a great set-up: a republic transofrms itself into an autocratic empire without anyone noticing until it is too late, the hero becomes the villain... When I think of what any decent director could have accomplished with this raw material, I wan to cry - or puke, I cannot make up my mind.If you need a permit to direct a movie, someone please take away George Lucas' - he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a camera, ever!

I agree with one of the posters when he said about Yoda, Enough already. Silly robot banter. Horrible acting. Pathetic editing. Worst lightsaber battles ever. A man riding a lizard chasing a coughing robot driving a wheel with legs. What? Yoda turned literally into E.T. Chewbacca, miss you I will. What? The overacting pure giddy evil of Palpatine was the best Snidly Whiplash impression I have ever seen. Grand Moff Tarkin was important in Ep.4. He was in the closing scene for no reason at all in this film. Isn't he Vader's boss in Ep.4? You'd think he'd be more important in this film then say, one unnessasary pathetic in the movie, buttkickingly cool in the Clone Wars Cartoon, chicken walking cyborg. Well, It's over.

It's everything you wanted to know after watching episodes 4-6, but didn't know because this movie wasn't out yet. oh yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece!","review":"I am not a starwars fanatic however, I do like the movies and episode 3 was superb! It was by far the best of them all. I was blown away when I saw this film, and I don't even see hardly anymovies in the theatre. It was like the final chapter, the movie that brings everything together and it couldn't have been more exciting! I plan on going back to see this movie maybe even more than once. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"I just wrote this post to show the other end of the spectrum of these overly glowing reviews for a movie that these people have not even seen yet. I used this title to get you to read my post here. I'm a big Star Wars fan, and do plan on seeing this movie more than once, and yes, while it sounds great on paper thus far, that doesn't automatically mean that it's going to a good movie. That remains to be seen. It's just as ridiculous for me to say it's the worst movie ever as it is for others to say it's great. So, again, I wrote this to try to bring some balance to these grand proclamations saying this is the BEST MOVIE EVER!! I would like to know what movie theater you guys saw it at. If this movie is as good as the book, well, then, it could be a 3 1/2 star, or perhaps a 4. But I reserve judgment for after I've seen, heard or read something, not before. That's usually how honest, true reviews are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted, awkward and pandering","review":"I really wish Lucas would have left the Star Wars mythos alone and not have created the prequels. They were convuluted with zero to little empathy or caring for any of the characters, the acting incredibly BAD and you couldn't tell who the bad guuys were from the good--meaning in the original you had the rebellion--the good guys--and the Imperials--the bad guys. Here you're supposed to like the clonetroopers even though they're protostormtroopers?Lucas took what was once a cherished and revered saga and made it into a pandering, overblown overhyped specialeffects mishmash of dumb dialogue, confusing subplots, contrived mythology and one giant commercial for product spinoffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As The Original Trilogy","review":"My jaw was on the floor during the second half of this movie, seeing all the pieces fall into place so dramatically and setting up the original Star Wars so perfectly. This film has great action, a compelling story, interesting characters, and a very emotional ending that truly delivers on Star Wars as a \\"space opera\\" in the classic sense. The whole visual and audio experience will of course blow you away as only Star Wars can. See it even if you didn;t like Episoses I and II. Sith is the perfect end to the greatest film series of our lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"After I watched this for the first time, I couldn't wait to go home and watch Episode 4.

This episode 3 was probably the most dissapointing. I had hoped that maybe lucas could salvage this horrible trilogy but he just made it worse. Horrible acting and writing really sent this movie down the toilet. The only slightly decent thing in the movie was the lightsaber scene between anakin and obi wan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Stuff","review":"This movie was truly awful. I fell asleep during this movie. The acting was terrible. Serenity is what this movie should have been. I'm not exactly sure why people were so enthusiastic about this new Star Wars.

I'm not sure that even Harrison Ford could have saved this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rip off","review":"Playing on a name only gets you so far.

Star Wars is no more philisophical than Jar Jar Binks is the the greatest character lucas ever created.The Star Wars movies are just that, movies. They are a means to entertain not give you moral advice on how to live your life.At best, philisophically, it is telling us that there is always a balance between good and evil.The third movie did what the first 2 failed to do.

I hated the over kill of the CGI being used.However this one has some ok CGI work in it. The CGI didnt make me wanna puke in this one. Only a few times did I see something that I thought looked really un-realistic and crap.The movie starts off with action right away. And the action continues on for about 15 minutes. It is interesting, exciting and looks good. Even the ideas in the charactors I thought where a good go.To be honest, I can't remmber much of the middle of the film. I'll have to see it again to remember it.I did get a bit nitpicky about a few things. But this is a review, not a spoiler so i'll keep them to myself.The movie was alot better then I expected. Most of it ties in well and completes the 2 trilogys of the saga. I think i do like it better then the first 2 star wars, but they don't hold torches to the original trilogys."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie without an ending","review":"DVD of Revenge of the Sith needs extra scenes and longer directors cut version. I wanted to see more darth vader The end of the Movie was rushed and left the door open for an alternate episode IV. They need to Have a Animated cartoon to Fill in the Gap between III and IV.I got The Impression that Obi-wan Attempted to Kill Anikin. and later in IV told Luke that Darth Vader Killed His Father.

I didn't see the first two movies about Star Wars, but I can tell you that this is silly and a waste of time.First of all, it's all about people fighting each other with swords made out of lasers, which is not very realistic--even in the future (when this is supposed to take place). Also, there are a great deal of creatures and robots that are not very good actors, except a hilarious fella named Jar Jar Binks (give that guy more screentime!)The human acting is really phenomenal, but lightweight effects and a not-too-well-thought-out story makes this movie too terrible, and I can't imagine there will ever be a Star Wars 4. If there was one, though, they might want to put Tim Allen in it, because he's hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Of All Time.......Forever","review":"This is the best movie I have ever seen, and that will never change.

Besides you could take a few tips from Peter jackson (director of Lord of the Rings Trilogy) just please save us all and STOP making Bad movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you possible like this film?","review":"Let's not beat around the bush, this film is aweful. The entire first three movies are aweful. Lucas writes dialog with boxing gloves on, there is no subtelty, there is no character development. Hell, the rules of his world change depending on what he needs the rules to be. Verily I say unto you, these are the worst big budget movies of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of all","review":"anyone who liked this movie must like flash over substance. 2 hrs. of eye candy and not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome to the starwars nerd convention","review":"well if you've read this far you are probably a starwars nerd too. its kind of pathetic for those people when you think about it... lots of bickering and we still have 7 months and 22 days and 13 hours (western time) until revenge of the sith comes out! Those people need to \\"really get a life\\" if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible end to a nice series","review":"Let me preface my comments by saying that I liked episodes one and two enough to watch them a couple times. Sure Jar Jar and some other things were annoying. But I was able to enjoy those films for their better parts.Episode three had a very tough task to accomplish - that of showing Annakin's turn. And it failed at that task miserably. The dialog is terrible, and the whole thing is just not believable at all. This is the type of film that is so bad, people would like it. But of course it takes itself way too seriously for that.This is a complete waste of time - not worth dvd, or the discount theatres."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPSET","review":"We all knew what was going to happen, we knew Anakin was going to become Darth Vader, and the Republic, was going to be the Empire. But the producers and the director could give the movie a better way to end the Jedis and the Republic. Make it more exciting. The acting of a Natalie Portman it's terrible, the film it's more an episode of a soap opera show on a local TV channel. Love me, love me not. Good special fx's like always, plenty of objects on the scrren so you can fix your eyes on something... The only good thing are the first minutes when the fighters are approaching the evil command ship, then, the movie and dialogue are so horrible. And we didn't saw the Mon Calamari, someone said there was going to be an under water battle. They said it was good but I was fooled like many others. As a Star Wars fan I'm upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple message, distorted","review":"Remember Episode IV? Good wore white, bad wore black. Lucas gave interviews on the writings of Joseph Campbell.This ain't Episode IV, folks. No magic left. Just special effects, and so many scene transitions you'll get dizzy. And if you're looking for a story, or characters to like, look elsewhere. It's like some apostles pasted together a tribute sequel, a few hundred years after the original was written. It's not clear who wrote it, why, what they were trying to say, or why we should care.Yoda did OK though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas = Crap","review":"I thought this movie was just plain crap. Compared to the first two movies, like the three newest ones it was crap. Hayden Christensen is just awful and like watching a piece of wood trying to act. Natalie Portman, who I liked in Closer and The Professional, is just awful too. The dialogue is awful. I thought the CGI during the space dog fight battle scenes looked almost like a video game and very animated. The origional use of miniatures was much better. I am not going to waste anymore breath on this worn out junk. Lucas just churned out 3 pieces of crap (4 if you count that stupid one with the Eewoks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome idea, horrible movie","review":"Revenge of the Sith was by far the worst movie of the Star Wars franchise, it was an bad ending to an unsatisfying set of prequels. The acting, for the most part, was forced and unnatural, the dialogue was so bad that I actually laughed out loud a couple of times (my favorite line, paraphrased, was from Padme: you're going to the dark side? Hold me!) And the jedi all died like pansies, I mean did anyone else notice that in ep. 1 and 2 each jedi could take out about 20-30 enemies and in this ep. Jedi masters were killed easily by 3-4 enemies? Anyway, If you want to see a review that sums it up a little better go to http://boxofficemojo.com/reviews/?id=1815&p;=.htmIt's a good review that sums up the uselessness of the movie a little better than I can even though he didn't seem to think that it was quite as insipid as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raises a question about Hayden's acting","review":"I won't explain the story. We all know it. I'll just give my opinion on the quality of this film. I think the special effects in this movie are good. There is a part in the beginning where Duuku drops a catwalk on Kenobi. The body looks terribly fake and is laughably ridiculous. The other problem I have is Hayden Christensen's acting. I have never figured out if he is just butchering his role, or is his character supposed to be awkward and almost expressionless. I know that Darth Vader is a wacko, but this is ridiculous. Those are the only complaints I have with this film. I really enjoyed this movie, and I think it's worth owning. Empire Strikes back will always be my favorite though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars 3","review":"The birth of the Empire and the defeat of the Jedi by the Sith is what the 3'rd Star Wars episode is all about. Oh, one other thing:THE \\"BIRTH\\" OF DARTH VADER\\"! Okay, technically not his \\"birth\\", but you know what I mean and shame on you if you don't. Some of the best sci-fi ever made, EVER. Star Wars is like Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica; IT WILL NEVER DIE. The most popular sci-fi ever made IS Star Wars. 'Nuff said(if you do not know where that came from, shame on you as well). I \\"Marvel\\" at your ignorance, apprentice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck Wars III","review":"Ok it was better than Episode I and II - which is saying I prefer eating hard dog crap over diarhea- is that how you spell it? That being said there are a couple of cool scenes in this movie but I can't understand why he chose these horrible actors in this movie and of course there was too much cgi in this one as well - more tastefully done compared to the last 2 but still too much for Star Wars. If you watch this movie prepared to see a joke - you will feel better watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"why this film is so good!","review":"Before people say whats the point of writting a review before the film has come out, I already know the story plot, but I will not say anything.This film is going to be the BEST star wars film ever. It has a minimum of 5 lightsabre duels, the clone war battles, the eradication of the jedi, the rise of the sith and loads of stuff. Just one more thing, yes yoda and sidious are going to have a very violent lightsabre duel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Road to the Beginning","review":"Finally after two decades George Lucas finishes his work of the Sci-Fi epic movie series Star-Wars. It had been in my life since the first Star-Wars movie, the initial weapon light saber has always been one of my fantasies. The third episode really wraps up the story of young Annakin Skywalker. His desperate struggle for love, which was forbidden by the Jedi order, led him to destruction. From the fall of the Jedi order to the start of the epic war, everything seems to be so dramatic.The special effects are also one of its features, the battle fields present just some of the scenes you will never see in other movies. Laser beams everywhere, monstrous battle cruisers and light saber fights. It's just what a Sci-Fi fan wants.I am a big Star-War fan myself, this is definitely worth collecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I cried when the entire Star Wars story finally came together and to think how many times I waited outside theaters to see the movie the first night. The special effects are stunning as usual. I couldn't wait to see this epic and I wasn't disappointed. The extras in the DVD are equally as explosive and accomodating. I loved the film and my family did too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to see the movie!!!","review":"I'm a big fan of the old Star Wars movies. The new ones aren't that good. I only like Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan. But the trailer looks promising. There is a lot of action. It looks like it will be a dark movie.I hope it's better than Episode 1 and 2. But I will see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"As always, the special effects in this film are great. I found the arc of the story to be lame. It is two and a half hours of fluff, then the climax with Ani turning into robot Darth is uneventful. They put the mask on and there is a little steam that comes out. George Lucas is just using the Star Wars name to make cash money now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"The finale to this overblown and wooden trilogy turns out to be a let down. The story has no real punch and it feels forced and rote. The special effects are spectacular but the rest is just dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Turn to the Dark Side","review":"THE REVENGE OF THE SITH completes the Star Wars saga begun almost 30 years ago. The final installment rivals the original STAR WARS and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in terms of both spectacular visuals and epic storytelling. The characters are more developed and the action is virtually non-stop.The DVD release is extremely well done. Both sound and picture are pristine, revealing the meticulous and creative genius of one of the best moviemakers of all time. The added features on the second DVD are a treat and will please both die-hard fans as well as those not quite as familiar with this great saga.Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,Very Boring","review":"This movie is SOOOOOOOOOOO boring I had other stuff on my mind that I was thinking about during this waste of 2 hours and 28 minutes It was bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. It just did not click with me this is the worst movie and Star Wars movie ever made SKIP IT. My grade over all (F-------------------)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"It's obvious George Lucas felt that by simply having the name \\"Star Wars\\" attached to these prequel movies they would be a hit. In my opinion, he couldn't be more wrong. Sith is the best of the three prequels, but that's like saying a Pacer is better than a Gremlin or Pinto. It's all junk. Lucas failed his audience by focusing on special effects and not the story and characters. He was once interviewed as saying \\"a lot of directors fall into the trap of spending film time showing off their sets.\\" I guess he forgot that when making these movies. Sith moves too quickly. Anakin's turn to the dark side is so quick you could miss it if you blink. The whole REASON for the prequel trilogy was to show us the fall of Anakin Skywalker. And we get it all crammed into a few minutes of screen time? Thanks George."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finaly! Star Wars redeems itself!!!!!!!!!1","review":"First of all i Would like to say that the first three original star wars movies are amazing. Im sorry to say that the first two prequels were pretty darn bad. The acting and dialouge was not so good in those particular movies. However, the third prequel was very well done. While there were still some flaws in the acting and dialouge on the whole it was still much much better that the other prequels. The action scenes are very good and the 20 or so lightsaber fights are very cool. It ties together the previously unfinished story in a very stisfying way.See it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 3rd best of the series","review":"I was completely blown away by this movie. George Lucas has given his fans a great ending to the greatest series in movie history. The action scenes are thrilling, and keep you at the edge of your seat. The score by John Williams is beautiful and ties all the previous movies scores perfectly. The acting is also the best of the prequels as well as the dialogue. There was only a few scenes that had terrible dialogue, and they were all romantic scenes. Hayden Christensen has definitely improved over his performance in the second movie. He doesn't whine at all in this movie, and when he turns to he dark side he's amazing. I highly encourage all of you to go see this movie, because it will restore your faith that Star Wars can once again be an amazing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major problems with the DVD","review":"DVD will not play on most computers because of heavy DRM, and even some DVD players have trouble using it.

But that's besides the point. Badly directed, with an overabudnace of cgi vainly attempting to cover the lack of story and characterization, Revenge of the Sith is the final insult in a long line that began with the dreadful Phantom Menace and the three hour toy commercial War of the Clones. Avoid avoid avoid at all costs. Maybe someday Lucas will get greedy enough for more cash that he'll re-release the original series unmodified on DVD....and maybe Hayden Christiansen will learn how to act. Why isn't No Stars an optional rating?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing this had were sets and costumes","review":"It was interesting to see the story pan out, but the dialogue, acting and direction were so unbelievably cheesy and took themselves too seriously.The costumes were fantastic, as they have been in all the prequels. It seems the crew from this film was dedicated and talented and thoughtful, but the script was plain awful and had even talented actors like Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor gasping for air and not engaging the audience.This is the first film I have been to in a while where I was actually cringing in embarrassment throughout many scenes, particularly the romantic exchange in the bedroom between Padme and Anakin. It was so BAD.It was nice to see the story come to a head, but we couldn't take anything seriously it was so poorly written and directed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"If I had seen this clock in a brick and mortar store I wouldn't have payed more than $10.00 for it.

At the time (January 1956) it seemed like such a tradegy and waste of life when 5 missionaries were killed in Ecuador at the hands of the Waodani. This film goes on to tell the incredible story since then of forgiveness and love on the part of the family members left behind. Not only is this an amazing story but the film is does exceptionally well weaving loss, tears, saddness with an occasional interjection of laughter to help the viewer through to the end. Don't miss buying this.

Breakbeat, stripped back techno, Electro-punk...this album is another great 2000 release by an Australian electronic act. Well known for his dj'ing, GT has produced an album which is eminently groovable while being harder than your typical dance release. The 'Sunshine Song' is a great example (IMHO) of re-working an old standard. My only major beef with the record is that it didn't include a longer mix of 'Losing Ground', a song which i really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied --- looks GREAT in NEW kitchen","review":"Looked at WAY TOO MANY $100+ trash cans ... losing sight of the fact that their SOLE purpose was to hold TRASH!!!Have totally redone my kitchen ... including bright white countertops and wood trim.

Without it, you take the chance that the eggs will crack in the boiling process. With the egg piercer, you can count on some leakage from the egg every time.

We purchased one of these based on the rave reviews. First we found that the moving part binds instead of sliding freely so we crushed many eggs before we finally threw the egg piercer away. (Being an engineer I had first tried to fix it by lubricating it with vaseline but to no avail.) We wonder if the design has not been cheapened recently, especially since the one we received had no magnet as apparently the earlier design had. We are utterly confused by the rave reviews this product has received. We still loved the idea of an egg pricker and we found a more expensive stainless model on the Internet that we absolutely love. We just ordered an extra one for our second home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I first though it was ok, upon more use--it's horrible","review":"well, the thing that punches the holes is too big and has already shattered 2 out of 10 eggs, Also it's completely sealed so you can't clean the egg or anything else out of it that spills in it. It's this second part that really grosses me out. Why would you make something that comes in contact with raw chicken stuff that you can't clean and disinfect? If the egg crushes while trying to pierce it how do you clean the raw egg out? (it doesn't come apart and the base is sealed?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what all the fuss is about","review":"I boil about a half dozen eggs every few days. Peeling them has either gone really easily, or sometimes really hard and frustrating, and it was about a fifty/fifty split. So I bought this little gadget thinking it would make a big difference and make peeling every egg easy. Not the case. First of all almost all the eggs cracked after boiling despite the product description claiming there would be little to no cracking, and second the eggs are absolutely not easier to peel. Just like before the egg piercing, it's still about every other egg that is difficult to peel. At least I didn't waste a lot of money trying this product out.Want perfectly hard-cooked eggs every time? Place four eggs in the pot and fill with water until the eggs are just covered. Bring to a boil, remove pot from heat source and cover the pot for twelve minutes. Take out eggs and enjoy! This method ensures eggs are neither over cooked nor under cooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Piercer","review":"I was skeptical about buying this, but now I see there was no need.

I dutifully punched holes in a dozen eggs, one of them exploded in the process. Then I followed my normal boiling process, start with cold water, eggs in, heat to a roiling boil, then lower to a simmer for 10 minutes. Follow with a cold bath for another 10 minutes. Perfect eggs. But out of the remaining 11 eggs, 7 of them had broken shells. I rarely get a broken shell, perhaps one out of three dozen. But this thing managed to break 7 of 11, and destroy one before I had the chance.Strong don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that ther's a soft/hard boiled egg heaven","review":"scenario: Old guy living by himself likes occasional soft boied egg(s) for breakfast.Problem: Of eggs boiled roughly half break (outer shell) while being boiled.Solution to problem: Always use eggs that aren't store fresh, bring eggs up to room temperature by leaving them out (from the frig) so they reach room temperature, and use the egg piercer...it works. Prior to using the egg piercer there were still occasional cracked eggs. Since using the egg piercer the there have been no cracked eggs and eggs are much easier to peel.Summation: Egg piercer is highly recommended.Additional comment: If only someone could come up with a solution to keeping salt free flowing from salt shaker when humidity is moderately high. mainly during the summer months, Forget the nonsense about placing rice grains in with the salt...it \\"don't\\" work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form & Function...A Good Egg!","review":"- Egg PiercerHad this been made in the USA & had a magnet on the back, I would have given it 5-Stars. It is both cute in appearance and gets the job done. I glued a magnet to the back, now I can easily find it on my fridge & it is a conversation piece, as well.

This CD, a nightmare set to music, is ambient music for the damned, Muzak from hell (or is that redundant?). As far as I can tell from the minimal liner notes, it is based on a novel by Robin Cook, using the nom de plume of Derek Raymond. He reads excerpts from the book Dora Suarez, with swirling tones and intermittent gushes of music punctuating his slurred recitation. His expressive voice, familiar as only an author reading his own work can be, paints a dark, gruesome picture of the mind and acts of a killer. The music complements the verbal scenes being set, but I found it difficult to listen for too long. The music is foreboding; if you have a vivid imagination, you will find that your mind takes you to places you do not want to go, but the grim scenery is offset by the artistry represented. Still, listen at your peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"A waste of money","review":"Apart from flashes of Ursula Andress naked I thought this a total waste of money.

Adding and removing pages is a HUGE hassle. Given it's size I like the carrying handle and the slots in the inside front cover for putting away discs quickly if you or more likely a lazy child does not want to search through the pages to put it back into its correct slot.

I had to save space wherever I could, so I purchased 2 of these binders. The price was right and they shipped fast. Packed well and arrived as dsecribed. Buying these was absolutely the right choice.I love how the pages allow you to showcase the paper from inside of the DVD case. I find this very helpful since some DVDs have small print or no title. I haven't had any durability issues but I am also careful. I really only go through the binders for movies on weekends and I don't have kids flipping through them. The binders aren't the most attractive looking, but I store them in one of those coffee table/ottoman things so that isn't an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the collector who organizes alphabetically.","review":"This Caselogic DVD storage system works very well. The sleeve material will not scratch the disk surface and each page has pouches for 2 liner notes. The construction is sturdy and durable, and it looks good. However, the page release mechanism is very clumsy and is a pain to use if you re-organize/add new movies to your collection frequently. This is not the storage system for people who like to arrange movies in alphabetical order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but bigger then you think!","review":"The product works great and hold many DVDs. I am using it to hold games for my PS3, 360, and Wii. It also have a way to add more sleeves for more liner notes (game/dvd books). The only thing is that it is very large. Its about the size of a 5 inch binder. Its also looks like its made of very good quality materials so hopefully it will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD storage case","review":"I bought this case in order to reduce the storage space required for my DVD's. It works great. I literally emptied a couple boxes of DVD's and now they're neatly organized in an easy to use case. The only thing I would have changed is the material of the case...it seems strudy enough, but I would have preferred a nylon material like the CD storage cases are made of. Again, the material works great so far, just a personal preference issue. I'll be buying another one shortly to store all my VHS tapes when I transfer them to DVD's.

It will but, you will have to put dvd's behind liners that they don't go with. In other words there are two slots behind each liner holder. This is great if you have 92-two disc movies or bonus disks to go with the movie. Otherwise this is a 92 DVD holder. Once the DVD is in the slot you cannot tell what it is, same for the ones in the front cover. Also, this thing is HUGE!

This is really the ONLY large storage case that also holds the covers. There are 2 smaller versions of it.

This definitely fit the bill, takes less than half the space of the DVDs left out in their cases and is strong and durable. Definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable Space Saver","review":"It is a great space saver. I travel and like to bring one binder along to watch movies on my laptop. I have many binders and never found problems with the zipper or carry handle. It's true that a 200 disc binder is only about 100+ but putting sequals together in one sleeve helps. Never found anything better than this design and the plastic straps hold better than the 3 hole punch method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Underwhelmed","review":"Compared to other similar binders, I found this product to be very underwhelming. The pages don't turn easily due to the clumsy attachment to the spine and the disk insertion process must have been an after-thought to the design. Things that should be simple are difficult. There is plenty of room for improvement for their next model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koskin DVD Binder 200 Capacity .","review":"I love this case. This DVD Album holds 200 discs and 92 movie title notes. Fast-File system that allows for quick storage and immediate access to 16 favorite or \\"now playing\\" DVDs. Quick-Lock Moveable Page System makes reorganizing or alphabetizing your DVD collection a snap. Durable, padded outer-material resistant to heat, moisture, and tearing. This case also has a see-through front pocket that holds movie title notes. If you're like me and have large collections of DVDs and have ran out of room to store them, well this is the case for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold 200 adequately","review":"The product description failed to tell you that the \\"200 capacity\\" is not adequate. The sleeves are designed to hold two DVD covers or inserts in the slot, then on the back there is room for 2 discs per slot. The slits for the discs are a cheap black material so you cannot visibly see the disc. If you have a DVD with double discs this is ideal. If, like most DVDs there is just one disc it would not make sense to fill up the other slot with a second, totally different DVD which you can not properly display the cover. So, in actuality this case holds approximately half of what it claims. Unless you would like to pull out each DVD individually to see what is in each slot. Not practical. Also, this is not real leather; it is pleather- fake and stinks like plastic. Other than that this is great for saving space and throwing out those old cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper Broke within a Week of Useage","review":"While I love the concept of having all those pesky dvd cases condensed into one case, this case is poorly made and once the zipper broke there was no way to close it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, bulky, diffifult to switch out pages.","review":"I just returned this dvd case. It's needlessly bulky, the sleeves seem very likely to tear, and taking pages in or out is a trial. Even zipping up the case is awkward.

I was quite excited to file them in this system. We have a smaller version that DOES have the three rings. Huge mistake in changing that. It is extremely difficult to file in DVD's in this storage system (the smaller one is great). Also, to ensure the movie is protected we like to place the whole sleeve on top of the player and then refile after viewing. Can't do that with this system.

Horrible coloratura, pinched high notes, lax phrasing and ZERO characteristation. (Compared to her Dame Joan Sutherland acts as wonderfully as Bette Davis!) Eaglen, a lyric soprano (Perfect for Mimi, Liu etc.) is pressed into those \\"huge\\" role because of her looks. BIG Isolde, Brünnhilde, Norma etc. which is ridiculous.

I'm just wondering if they are going to start with season 1, which was filmed on 16 mm. Well, I think with Buffy's cult following a blu-ray - no matter which season - would definitely be a hit.

Sometimes revisiting a childhood favourite can be dissapointing as an adult, but not Kim the story is so imaginitive it grips from start to finish. The acting of a young Dean Stockwell as a streetwise street urchin blagging his way through life and finding himself embroiled in espionage reminds me in character of Errol Flynn at his cheekiest. Ironically Flynn co stars as 'Kim's protector Red Beard. Both actors work together so well they draw you into the story set in India during the Raj.

Lori(drummer) did an awesome job on \\"Earth Invasion.\\" \\"Eating Me Away\\" is a bit worse then the others but it goes into \\"Kill Me, Heal Me\\" which makes up for it. \\"Stronger\\" might be my favorite and it is much more harder and fast paced. Also \\"Rippin Me Off\\" is one of my favorites with an awesome solo. Those are all of the rock song, Alien Youth also has some slower songs if....you want slower songs. Overall this album is awesome and is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd yet from Skillet","review":"The new Skillet cd titled Alien Youth is the best cd, so far, that these guys have put out. It incorporates nice hard rock with a few softer pieces. Through the use of bone crunching bass and guitar effects (*Please have the treb and bass all the way up for this cd.) along with awesome vocal effects, this cd is a MUST BUY for the crowds who like Creed, Metallica, and all other hard rock/heavy metal bands.

But thats not all they're about. The lyrics are the cream filling in this twinkie. Check out the powerful \\"One Real Thing\\" where he cries, \\"I get down on my knees and i... feel your love wash over me.\\" Cooper sings with an intesity and real emotion that you don't find in many artists. Skillet can rock it out, but they also give you a couple slow ballads to complete the package. \\"You are my hope\\" is a beautiful song that's easy to sing along with. If you like Alien Youth, don't hesitate to pick up Collide, which will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock that simply rocks","review":"This is a really good album, because of what the Skillet band has simply become. They, unlike several other rock bands, don't try to hide what they feel in inscrutable lyrics, but by saying out loud (literally) what they want to say. And I respect that. Also, they have hard rock, good tunes and ryhthm. Overall this is their best album, equal to their new album \\"Collide.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a christian alternative","review":"I first got this cd a couple years ago, when I was turning away from secular musik. To be honest I was more impressed with earilier skillet releases that were more rock, less pop/\\"metal\\". To this day I can't deny the inventiveness of some songs on hey you I love your soul. However, their stab at industrial metal is less than satisfactory. There are no guts, no edge.This album is though, a true christian alternative to Marilyn Manson. Just understand that along with the removal of the anti-establishment lyrics, the raw music is also taken.The music deserves three stars, but the lyrics and content take one. It is only a christian alternative, don't expect it to make you think about or force you to re-examine anything except your faith, if even that. I do understand that faith is enough to justify an album's content. However, I prefer music like Project 86 or Pink Floyd, that make me ponder society, politics and often music itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I think this is their best work yet! I can't even get past the first 4 songs. I believe that they spent time with God on their faces before they wrote the songs for this album.

The album's theme of the alien youth thing is reflected almost exclusivly in the first three songs Alien Youth, Vapor, and Earth Invasion. After these three songs, the album is great. Eating Me Away and The Thirst Is Taking Over are two of the best songs that Skillet has ever done. I can't say that I didn't like the theme of the album, just that I didn't like the songs that conveyed the theme much at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Item, If Pricey","review":"I'm not sure what the other reviewer received, because mine are well-sized for comics from the 1960s to modern.

My comics are all from the 90s-current. The sleeves are too wide. When I put the boards in between each comics (i'd put two, one facing each way with a board between them) there was still a lot of room on each side to allow the comics to rub against one another. Also, I guess I didn't realize before getting them that the top of the sleeves will always remain open, allowing air, moisture, and anything else to get in. If you dropped the binder, and it turned upside down, the comics could also slip out.I guess this can be avoided with keeping the comics in their own bags inside the sleeves, but that just seems too messy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Described","review":"The description & pictures show clear pages with a pocket, sized for comic books.

The description states that the product is soft but I have to differ. I traced the cloth on my face and was not pleased. It felt scratchy and course. Lastly, I have NO IDEA what the embroidered picture is. I've been studying the picture and I have no clue.Hopefully the softness will appear after I wash it.

This is one of my all time favorite songs, and a song which was once on legendary St. Louis Radio Station KSHE 95 Klassics list. But it has not been available for years. I don't know why. Peace of Mind, is, IMHO, a fantastic song, good enough to be listed with the all time classic, and on par with anything by the Beatles, Stones, Who, etc. The 60's and 70's had so many awesome groups, that Rare Bird somehow fell through the cracks, and never really hit it big before they broke up. But they are probably better then 99% of the groups nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscovery","review":"Checking to see whether Somebody's Watching was still available, I rediscovered Born Again, mislaid and forgotten years ago, and found I liked it even better now than before.

My usually quarrelsome aunts and uncles were always more gracious on the Dia de Gracias than on other, more materialistic holidays like Christmas.The account of the \\"First Thanksgiving\\" in Dr. Loewen's book is a good deal more plausible, less chauvinistic, and more instructive in real citizenship than the mythic tale in American history textbooks. Much the same can be said for the other chapters of this forthright and amusing book. There are already more than 200 reviews of it on amazon; YOU can be thankful that I won't expatiate any more. And I am very thankful that there are honest, intelligent historians, representing different political philosophies to be sure, ready to laud and also to castigate the Americam people. Thanks, James Loewen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zinn Did It Better","review":"Here's how Loewen did it. He compiled a bunch of high school history text books, grabbed his well worn copy of Howard Zinn's \\"A People's History of the United States\\" and got to writing. As a high school teacher I'm not surprised that Loewen found his material for \\"America's History Texts\\" on the dusty shelves of the Smithsonian. Maybe he should have looked a little harder, like his local high school, than a realiance on what have to be outdated text books that support his thesis. I'm just hoping Loewen is paying royalties to Zinn, who did all this 15 YEARS PRIOR TO THIS BOOK, and did a much better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"Amazing book! This book changed my perspective on myself as an American and on the rest of the world. I feel like I was cheated in high school (and college!), not knowing some of the content covered in this book. I believe the main thesis, that history is a web of controversies that students should not only understand but contribute to, is incredibly inspiring and I would have been motivated to take more history classes had I been introduced to this perspective earlier. Overall, I recommend this book to every American -- it is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Pages of What You Need to Know","review":"This guy badly needs an editor. He writes about all the \\"hot\\" topics that everyone already knows about and then spends 300 pages presenting his political views of how those topics should be written about.And we wonder why students are confused or simply don't care. They know when they a being \\"bull......., rather than informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous","review":"It would be bliss to see a \\"history long taught wrong\\" text without any more than a passion for truth and an urgent desire to \\"set the record straight\\" evident as the motive force behind the text. Is there such a thing as passion without agenda? If so, it is not found in these pages. A substitution of one's agenda for another is a far cry from balance. An almost religious zeal (for . . .?) unmistakably taints what could otherwise have ALMOST been a decent book. And, despite the lack of impartiality, \\"Lies . . .\\" still could have been a decent book -- instead, it seems more like half a book -- the \\"bashing\\" half. Perhaps the \\"constructive solutions\\" half is forthcoming?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Excuse me. As a parent of a student who just finished a year course in high school US History I would be the first to admit that history books need improvement and that the slant is not always accurate.

No thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stop PC blabber","review":"I bought this book to give to my US History teacher, who wrote me a college recommendation. Before I gave it to him, I skimmed through tha pages and was appalled: Page after page of gruesome details and facts on how EUropean settlers and \\"whitey\\" in general oppressed the native Americans, blacks, and every living thing on the face of the Earth. I was under the impression that this was an educational book that would have a few smart quips about the wrongdoings of the settlers and white America throughout the history of the United States. I did NOT expect it to be some sort of politically correct drivel that is so popular with the far left these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most dead-on correct view of over 300 reviews here is the african-not-necessarily-meaning-black one","review":"Loewen is purely guilty of taking everything about the continent of Africa and wrongly presuming it all 100% relates to black people.Maybe he didn't actually know the dna studies of people like Egyptians or Libyans shows them to be more akin to white middle-eastern folks than sub-saharan african ones but he more for sure knew of a fanatical Libyan leader named Khadafi! Was Khadafi anywhere near as black-skinned as, say, Sydney Poitier, Loewen? No the native born-Libyan wasn't in the slightest! In fact Libyan-born Khadafi was quite southern-European looking. So yes the book is certainly and deliberately somewhat garbagy just for the overplay by the author on the subject of africans-are-always-black-people. Thank you to the reviewer who pointed this out previously. You have by far the best take on the worst thing about this book and it's author."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star. Not allowed less, as in a totaliatrian government","review":"It is true our history books are a mess. It is also true that the professors who wrote them are a mess. Writing from their ivory tower where they benefit from the best education and style of living a free capitalisc society can provide, they diligenty spend their time in a fantasy land of mental utopias attempting to destroy all this country has provided for them. This book is socialist diatribe. While much may be true, the intent is an ugly expose of the professorial thinking college students are \\"brainwashed\\" with in most of today's universities. It's not that a lot of the basic information is wrong. It's that it has a socialist agenda, and young people, having no more experience in the real world than their spoiled brat professors, \\"eat it up.\\" Kind of like a child molester preying on the innocent. Garbage! Not because it doesn't make honest clarifications in history, but because of it's political agenda"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like a school book.","review":"I bought this thinking it would have short stories.

It is unfortunate that Mr. Lowen has recieved so much attention for such rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Typical Liberal View","review":"The substance of this book is all crap - the typical liberal view of history. Writers like this never see that they use the same argumemts that the orignal history books in school use. Their argument is just based on their non-objective views. One example: we all know ( from many school history books) that Columbus was not the first explorer to discover America ( the name of our continent should prove that - are continent is not named Columbus). Yet this author prefers to go into a long list of explorers ranting about not getting credit for it's discovery, and the only proof he offers are other books written by other book selling want to be's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Anti-American Book Ever Written","review":"I was forced to read this anti-American, class & racial envy provoking propaganda my first year at a public university in PA.

Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marxist Americans Unite!","review":"As a history teacher I thought this book could enlighten me, but really it only depresses me. According to Loewen, everything good about American history (and America) is a fake distortion by WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants)...wait a minute, America IS great! Columbus IS the first American hero. Washington SHOULD be honored. It IS okay for Peace Corps members to grow intellectually, even SPIRITUALLY; Vietnam WAS lost because a Democrat president escelated it, and hippy protestors gave aid and comfort to the enemy.This miserable author is either a liberal Democrat, a former hippy, a member of Barack Obama's church, a Marxist, or all of the above.

In a well-researched volume, he demonstates how misinformation and fear of teaching anything less than patriotic have damaged the thinking of our country's populus. As an African American and Native American reader, I find the book flushes to the surface the pain of having been marginalized and misrepresented in the annals of this country's story. Both European Americans and People of Color will, no doubt, find it cathartically challenging and refreshing as an aid to begin rethinking critically the road this nation has taken. Quite simply, the book should be considered mandatory reading by all who are concerned about the state of this society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Blow Your Mind","review":"This book is quite interesting.

History should be like the news is supposed to be, just the facts.Read the book but keep in mind that just because it's in a book doesn't make it true. And continue to read and talk about these subjects. And most importantly remember the events covered in this book are taken out of historical content. And you can't be sure what you would have done in these times, in these situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"This book certainly has some important points, and much of it is interesting and informative. The central premise that our textbooks are biased to color history is well supported. However, as one can surmise from the less glowing reviews, the author rants way too much, and much of the book is repeating the same point over and over. By the end of the book, I was quite ill from the hurling of pieties from the mountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dryer, Dustier Book than Any History Text","review":"This book's cover suggests an excursion through US History to show what realy happened and what gets commonly taught in schools. Instead, it is a humorless, plodding, neverending series of the author's views of what is \\"important\\" in history as compared with the versions found in various textbooks he reviewed. And again. And again. And again. This book alone could turn anyone off the subject of US history. If you want a good book, try \\"Don't Know Much About History\\" (I think that's the name) which covers a similar subject with wit and charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and agenda-driven","review":"I read this book hoping to learn some interesting facts that I missed in school. Unfortunately, the author really injects quite a bit of personal interpretation and agenda into his assessment. I wouldn't mind it so much if the entire book weren't so dry and boring. Much of it was predictable stuff -- like the typical drivel intended to make the white man hate himself for stealing land from Native Americans. I read to the end, hoping to appreciate it and learn something that made the time spent reading the book worth the effort. It never happened, and I feel it was a big waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!, it's a polemic, not history, but a good one","review":"This book is not a history textbook and I do not think that was the author's intention. The book, or pamphlet if you like, is an argument meant to clue everyone in of the clear bias in U.S. history textbooks that teach high school students tripe (in the words of Lisa Simpson). The examples are few but well argued and it is slanted to the left and deals a lot with race and class relations. It is meant for the layman and does a good job arguing part of what is wrong with U.S. History textbooks. You will find theories on why the textbooks all seem to say the same, un-thought-provoking things, included in many of the examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent examination of high school history texts","review":"As a kid, I read history the same way I read simplistic fiction. The story washed over me, taking me along the obvious path. I enjoyed it, but it didn't really make me think. \\"Lies My Teacher Told Me\\" shows how textbooks shortchange a facinating subject and in the process shortchanges our kids. It examines what textbooks have to say about a few specific subjects and then looks at what is left out. As and example, Helen Keller was not just a brave blind-deaf girl but a radical socialist woman who helped form the American Civil Liberties Union. Talking about her adult life would involve looking at parts of our history that are not admirable, which is something that the textbooks avoid like the plague. I intend to give this book to my daughter so that she can understand the limitations of what she reads in school. Hopefully, she will want to look for more for herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good jumping off point into deeper study","review":"This book opened my eyes to history. Not that I bought everything the author put forth (although I think he is on the money); only that it created in me a desire to find out the real facts through my own study. This is a well-written and endlessly fascinating book. Since I read it, I always look between the lines of what is being told to me regardless of the poltitical orientation of the person speaking. An eye-opening read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author forgot what his own title was.","review":"This book starts off on the right track. It corrects or fills in parts of early American history; Colubus, Revolutionary war, Civil war ect. BUT then it takes turn to push the authors own political agenda. The author believes that high school history should be used to push students toward his views. It is full of the usual jabs at the Reagan/Bush admin. with little supporting material to back up the claims. This author should have stuck to the title. Or the book should be retitled \\"Lies I Would Tell You if I Were Your Teacher\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart people don't need this book","review":"The most shocking thing I came away with after reading this book is that it the author thought he was telling us something we don't know. The most shocking thing I came away with after reading the rest of these reviews is that people in this country aren't as smart as I would have hoped. This book is like an email that is funny at first...but after the 100th time you've received it its annoying. Retreads of factoids...I'm surprised he didn't devote a few chapters to \\"George Washington never chopped down a cherry tree.\\" There are some passages that are simply the authors soapbox....throwing in facts and stats that are obviously part of an angenda, because they are not refuting anything specifically cited from a book. If I wrote a college paper like this, I would get a D at best... The more you like this book, the less thinking you've done for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Three Stars Have It","review":"While this book does bring up some valid points there is absolutely no doubt that the author's extreme left-wing bias gets in the way. However Loewen does footnote all his assertions so his sources can be checked in the back. I found this very useful in discerning the truth from the propaganda. Read the five and one star reviews with a grain of salt, anyone who said this book was dead on is way to set in there liberal ways. On the other hand those who say the book didn't even raise one valid point are leaning hard in the other direction. Definitely get this one at the library or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Correct","review":"Fantastic audio book and easy to listen to while commuting-I also bought the book to read along and for the documentation within.I really appreciated the details regarding the current and historical 'Class' structure in the USA. Historian Heinrich Armin Rattermann also brings up the probles of allowing the wealthy to get involved in politics (back in the psot Civil War era before 1890).This should be read and heard by all - remember - the rest of the world already knows this info and one can see how they feel about America."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea ruined by ideology.","review":"If you are looking for an enjoyable read exposing commonly held historical inaccuracies as I was, you should probably skip this title. There are a number of interesting facts in this book, however to get through to them you have to page through line after line of the author's apparent ideological crusade and ramblings against the institutions. A few valid points are brought up but most are taken to the extreme: Do we really care if history books neglect to mention Helen Keller was a communist?Overall the overtone of the book was heavily biased, perhaps even more so than the history books the author was criticizing. I would have preferred to learned of the events discussed in the book from an objective point of view without the author sticking in his cynicism after every sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why critical thinking is dangerous","review":"I read with great interest many of the posts reviewing this book and they appear to fall into three categories: general praise, qualified praise, and derision of the author's \\"liberal\\" bias. With the exception of some of the qualified praise comments, I did not find any criticism of the book that I would call responsible or helpful. If careful analysis of the historical record and a critical examination of standard high school textbooks in light of that record leads inexorably to the charge of a \\"liberal\\" bias, perhaps it is time for such liberals to accept the label and wear it proudly. Perhaps they should be made to wear an \\"L\\" patch on their clothing so that all will be forewarned of their \\"leftist leanings\\" before they speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for the educated person.","review":"This ought to be required reading prior to high school graduation...

It's both very simple and very profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"Although I knew intutively that history's facts( ? ) depend on who is writing it, I was educated to some interesting and new revelations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets into important subject areas.","review":"For the most part this book is what one might expect from the title: it covers a lot of ground quickly, and is fairly interesting and fun. What raises the book a notch in my opinion, is that Shenkman sometimes gets into important subject areas. For example, there is a fascinating section on myths of Nazi war preparedness and wartime production. I had read Albert Speer's somewhat self-serving book years ago, and the material Shenkman provides helps put in better prospective the apparent lack of impact of allied bombing on Nazi armament production. There is a chapter on the American family which is jumpy and incomplete, but at least it whets the appetite for a book on this subject, as well as providing some fascinating facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"History revised for a specific agenda.","review":"This book does exactly what it complains about. The focus is on the author's personal agenda and, once again, history is distorted to support a personal opinion rather than presenting well documented facts. People reading this are advised to seek out original sources from the particular period and come to a more informed viewpoint rather than letting others distort America's interesting and colorful past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically-correct lock-step nonsense","review":"This hyper-politically-correct tome will win the affection of academia, with their hatred of power (real or perceived) and hostility toward the very idea of dispassionate truth. It's not that the author makes no good points -- indeed, many of his points are extremely well-taken -- it's that his agenda is so open, his axe-grinding so blatant, that unless you've already researched the histories in-depth, you just don't know which parts of his analysis to trust and which to discard as leftist hyperbole and fiction. In fact, the best thing I can say about this book is that the author made little attempt to hide his very pronounced sociopolitical biases.My advice: Ignore the book. There are many books examining the mind-boggling distortions of \\"history\\" -- distortions as gladly perpetrated by the political left as the right -- which still manage to avoid the strident anti-establishment tone and vomitous academic pandering that Loewen glories in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal View Point","review":"This gentleman has white guilt.

A look at the materials that are being used to teach our children and the picture that is presented is not pretty.This book is very important for anyone interested in history or in why our young people seem to be clueless regarding it. One quarter of college freshman believe that the Vietnam War was fought between North and South Korea. How can that be? This book can shed some light.This book also provides detailed \\"period looks\\" at events in U.S. history. It amazed me how this book played out and what was left out of the high school history books that are being used throughout our country, no wonder young people have such dismal knowledge of history.Read this book and open your eyes. Changes need to be made and this book should be read by all teachers and parents. The gaps need to be filled in.Buy it - read it - and be shocked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing View of History","review":"I liked this book because it offers a refreshing view of history, a break from all the boring, heavy, lifeless American history books from high school. I learned much more \\"history\\" from this book than I learned in big American history books. It revives the question, \\"How should history be taught?\\" Certainly with passion, emotion, and accuracy. This book has all that, and shows what can be done about the problem with American history textbooks. Definitely, it shows sides of American history that you probably wouldn't think about right away when you think of America's past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb reading ... Highly recommended","review":"When I first started reading this book, I expected a liberal/leftist ideological presentation. I was surprised that there were only a few instances where I found that to be true. Overall, really loved this book ... read it twice back to back! It clarifies so many aspects of history that were paradoxically \\"hanging\\" without making much sense as a whole. The reason for this is that our commonly accepted history has been heavily edited. This book is a real eye-opener for anyone who is concerned that our American history is currently undergoing revisions from what we all believed was true. WONDERFUL book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lies my Teacher told Me","review":"Along with \\"Lies Accross America\\" this book is outstanding to demyth the corruption of history over the years.

Although there are some interesting points he does make, for the most part he goes on and on about how bad anyone who has managed to do something with their life should feel (that person could only be a white male according to Loewen) and that history books are only here to make those same people feel not so bad about their position in life. It is a terribly slanted book, and I would strongly suggest that unless you are forced to read it by your liberal history professor (as I was), let this one stay on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making a point and then running with it.","review":"This book, while making some valid points, chooses to revise history in a way that is truly unforgivable, often going too far.

North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia, Morrocco, Egypt, and Libya) are actually containing people usaully far more white in their dna structure than black. Yet this author takes it for granted that the moors who came from North Africa (plus the even more white-inhabited west-asian Middle East) and conquered Spain were all black. He also takes Egyptians SPECIFICALLY to be all black too when he alots the African-americans the right to be interested in the Egyptian discoveries of america."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-righteous polemic","review":"Regarding the title, the author ought to look up the meaning of the word \\"lie\\". It clearly means KNOWING, conscious dissembling. It doesn't mean misstating or disagreeing.Every profession is haunted by liars, cheats, and incompetents, but to state, without reservation, in one's title that social studies teachers en masse are liars is inexcusable. At heart it is self-aggrandizement as a way of promoting one's book via an outrageous title which, ironically, lies. Equally as bad as liars, perhaps worse, are self-righteous polemicists. Their mischief, promoted for the purpose of self-puffery, has been one of the banes of all societies from the dawn of civilization. Nothing feels so fine as the knowing certitude that you are right and everyone else (except Zinn) is wrong. Subtlety and ambiguity are the spices of history.

The scary thing is Woods and Loewen are both supposed to be history professors. They should be banned from educating chickens if they cannot keep their bias' in check. It is depressing that we cannot manage to get the benefit from history as long as authors like Loewen hide behind a false title to promote their own views.There are as many Falsities in the Lies My Teacher Told Me as any kid would get in school.

Do not be intimidated by this book just because you will find it on good history teachers book list. It describes people you have studied in a completely different way. He encourages you to question what you are learning right now, he even encourages you to question what he is telling you.

There were many interesting facts about the truth behind many parts of history that I had no idea about prior to reading his book. Most of the chapters kept me interested except for a few. Some chapters started to lose my attention because I felt that many of the chapters were too similar to previous chapters. They talked about different things in history but it was just talking about one piece of history after another for just about all the chapters of the book. Overall i believe it was a good book and I would recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, but unsettling","review":"Very good book which is obviously the result of lots of research.

I certainly would have read it just by the title and if I had I would have learned a lot and likely paid more attention to what the teachers were saying to catch them.Some of the interpretations are open for discussion but the mere fact they are discussed makes them worth throwing against the wall.I also want to point out that some sources used in this book were ignored by writers of textbooks for many reasons, some of those reasons are that they are alone in their assertions or accounts and not verifiable.Read it to spark important discussions at your next party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"There is much here that is useful and important, but Loewen is, alas, quite a screechy advocate of his positions, not all of which he satisfactorily defends. Instead of puncturing myths, he often digresses into quibbles over words. For example, one of his \\"lies\\" is that whites took over Indian lands in order to farm them, which statement offends him on the grounds that the Indians were already farming them. But obviously the textbook in question means \\"... so that they (the whites) could farm them for their own purposes.\\" Aging hippies will love this book, conservatives will despise it, and liberals (like me) will be alternately intrigued, irritated, and embarrassed by Loewen's holy crusade and narrow focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone in america","review":"While high school history textbooks aren't a major authority on history, they are the only history most of the US citizens will receive and at least partially remember. What they will come to learn slowly, too slowly, over time is that most of the attitude taken in these books is dangerously biased and sometimes all out wrong.It can be dry in some parts but just fast forward if you think your done with the topic. You may miss some interesting things though so just try and sit through all of it.Recommended before teaching any history course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book, offers some different perspectives on some major American myths. Certainly an excellent companion to most major texts on American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My expectations probably caused me to dislike this book more than any other reason. I expected to learn some things I didn't know. I didn't.I did not expect to be preached at. I was.Many of the author's criticisms of textbooks are valid ones, but his clear political agenda will probably prevent anyone's being persuaded who does not already agree with him.My own orientation is important here: I consider myself a moderate liberal; I am not the conservative he seems to despise."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting project completely ruined by a political agenda","review":"First off, this review is based on the original version of this book. These issues may have been corrected in the revised version, but I would highly doubt it.Loewen's main gripe seems to be that much of history has been whitewashed. He claims that many of our \\"heroes\\" had ugly dark sides...and he's right. But, if Loewen's point is that history, as often taught, is nothing more than a series of half-truths, Loewen is equally guilty of the same sin. He clearly approaches history from the left and seeks to negate any positive contributions from the right. In so doing, he would have us accept a different set of half-truths that whitewash ideas that he doesn't agree with. There's nothing wrong with presenting the bad along with the good (and vice versa), but Loewen isn't interested in presenting a factually accurate balanced version of history. He simply wants his ideology to be better represented."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"That history text books, especially high school text books have to walk a fine line and omit and distort parts of American History is obvious, and I looked forward to reading Mr. Loewen's book. Unfortunately, he ends up often doing the exact same thing he accuses the textbooks of doing.Rather that providing a factual correction, he chooses to write history as an editorial, and not let the reader decide for themselves. The tragedy of this is when reading other Amazon.com reviewer's comments was how many accepted this book as pure fact. This wholesale acceptance of one point of view as fact is the exact issue Mr. Loewen is trying to stop, yet still many readers praise the book as gospel. I hope this irony is not lost on Mr. Loewen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for raising the issue of \\"heroification\\"","review":"I have not read the whole book, but two years ago I did browse a large portion of the very generous sampling available here on Amazon. My encounter with the book had its main effect in forcing me to the realization that I had committed at least \\"second degree heroification\\" in the writing and publishing of my book, \\"Carrie Chapman Catt: A Life of Leadership\\". At the time of browsing LMTTM, I was planning a lecture on the woman suffrage movement. Instead of using my previous lecture topic, I was inspired by Mr. Loewen's book to imagine an anti-heroic take on my subject, leading to quite a successful presentation entitled, \\"What Fox News would have said about Carrie Chapman Catt\\".

I have no problem with an iconoclastic view of American history and the author did cause me to reframe my perspective on Woodrow Wilson. I even learned a thing or two. But this book was PAINFUL to get through. I was hoping for a little irreverence, but instead got a whining, repetitious sermon on the ills of America perpetuated by the brainwashing authors of school textbooks. While the author railed against the covert agendas of textbook publishers, it was pretty clear he had some kind of unhealthy agenda of his own. Even after I surrendered, putting the book away without finishing, I still can't quite figure out what that agenda was. I thought this would be a fun, enlightening read, but it was neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK I get it...textbooks told us all lies.","review":"This book promised to be an informative history book with fun facts about the real history of America. It turned out to be mainly a tedious whine about how school textbooks didn't include all the gory details about American history. Scattered in between blame and indignation about being lied to by the man, are some interesting facts. I just wish this book was written with the understanding that anyone who would buy a book with this particular title, already knows that textbooks lied, so we can get on with hungrily reading stories about what really happened and how it shaped this great country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly flawed book","review":"Loewen should have titled his book, Lies the History Book Told Me. He obviously hasn't been inside a high school history class to see what goes on. The US History team at my school decided to read this as a way, we thought, to gain new information. Instead, what we got was an opinionated critique of history books and accusations that aren't true in any of our classrooms. Perhaps a brand new teacher, who doesn't know anything and teaches straight from a book, might fall prey to some of what Mr. Loewen says, but, in over thirty years of teaching, I haven't met any history teachers who deliver the version that Mr. Loewen suggests goes on in the classroom. The book is misleading and not helpful at all to a person who knows any history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, get Zinn's book instead....","review":"While I agree with the premise of this book, the author spends a lot of time trying to convince us that the reason behind the phenomena he describes is merely incompetence on the part of historians and teachers. Any notion that there is a class of people who benefit from keeping the population \\"dumbed down\\" about the actions of the American government is dismissed as conspiracy theory.

That in itselef does not scuttle this book, but his heavy handed approach does. Thus, even the valid points in this book get lost among the overbearing agenda.In fact, Loewen's approach in this book mirrors his own argument for what's wrong in schools. Loewen knows 'The Truth' and to hell with anyone who sees history differently.

It has little new information, especially for history teachers. It is pretty much a standard revisionist rehash. It vastly overrates the importance of using textbooks in the classroom. Most modern history teachers are not married to the textbook anymore. The author assumes that teachers are stuck in an outmoded method of instruction where teachers just teach out of the textbook every day. It ignores innovative teachers that use primary source readings, simulations, films, debates, projects, class discussions, etc. When was the last time the author actually stuck his head in a classroom to see what is going on today?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new from the Left.","review":"I was hoping that a College Professor would present some new information.

I was very displeased that I wasted my money on this book. Loewen gave us the same Liberal speel that the Education system from kindergarten through College gives us. I cannot endorse this book as a guide for anyone wishing to learn anything new. Columbus didn't discover America and brutalized the people of the West Indies...we all already knew. Wilson intervened in Central America because of personal reasons...common knowledge.

Why can't he then criticize fellow Marxists whose philosophy he probably shares - Stalin, Mao and PolPot? In a matter of few years, these left-wing atheists murdered tens of millions of their own citizens. Stalin alone killed 6,000 innocent Polish officers, not to mention the millions that died during forced deportations and collectization - all the while promoting the modern rice religion - Marxism.So American heroes are somewhat tainted, Communist heroes are even more so.

And while I agree that our history should not be taught without truth, or boredom, I cannot agree that we should put a corrupt, mean, bullying, lieing, spin on it. It is obvious that he holds a extreme fanatical liberal view of the country and our history at times and as one who believes that for all it faults, this nation tries to repeatedly do 'the right thing', Mr. Loewen does not.

His rather silly Marxist analysis of the class structure of america and its assertion that the upper classes all powerful tentacles creep into everything from high school text books to explaining why the poor are poor, are laughable since no one has taken this kind of analysis serious since the 1920's (except of course college professors in the nit wit departments of history and sociology).

This book came out during the very popular, \\"everything is so dammed Eurocentric\\" sentiment bandwagon of the 90s. The question is whether you wish to teach kids to be so incredibly cynical as a learning foundation. It's a bit like reading a book on the world by Abbie Hoffman.

On the whole, the book is passionate and interesting. It may or may not have been written by a leftist, but it avoids being either left- or right-exclusive in its review of how American history has been and continues to be portrayed.

Even just a tiny bit more would have kept it on my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Points blame at the wrong people","review":"The book itself does not shed any light on things that most who have studied history already know. Yet it now puts the blame on teachers who are the ones trying to correct the wrongs of past teachings. Prior to 1980, a coach was hired and then stuck in history in order to \\"teach\\" history because \\"anyone can do that.\\" Not so anymore. Schools are now hiring teachers who actually know history and do not have to rely on a horridly written, inaccurate, and boring textbook. Lies my teacher told me is a misnomer and shifts the blame from parents and school administrators who don't know any better. These are the people who would rather see their children win a sporting competition than see them graduate. It should be called \\"I should have listened to my teacher, Lies my textbook told me.\\" Poor product with not much new information for anyone who is acquainted with history."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one. Besides, some of it is just plain wrong. To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:\\"In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general.\\"Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity. He attributes to them, two \\"liberal\\" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas by the Edwin Hawkins Singers","review":"I love this but isn't missing a song on the album..I do believe that OOH CHILD is supposed to be on this...Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I thought I was stuck in a world of unproven idealogy and blind faith until I read this book. I have gone on to read more about Buddhism and the more I read the more I like it. IT is actually difficult to keep reading about it though, since it is so fundamentally simple, just like Hagen's title.

Much appreciated take on an often misunderstood exploration"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Meditation Book","review":"Buddhism Plain and Simple by Steve Hagen is a book that claims it is simple but you might want to read a page or two and contemplate it for the rest of the day. You start to see reality for possibly the first time and start to see the wisdom of yourself for the first time as well. You will learn techniques for mediation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a really amazing book for those in the West who don't really know that much about Buddhism, and are looking for a place to start. However, one doesn't need to be Buddhist or even plan on becoming Buddhist to read this, it is relevant to everyone.One warning, this book teachs the basic principles of Buddhism. It is not very comprehensive, but that is part of the beauty of it. Steve Hagen doesn't go on and on about the differences between (for example) Theraveda and Zen Buddhism. He doesn't teach us about Buddhism, instead he teaches us how to be Buddhist (which I would argue is much more important).If you have been practicing Buddhism for a number of years, I doubt you would learn much from this book. But if you don't know the difference between dharma and duhkha then I can't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing simple about it","review":"This book is definately not gears towards people new to Buddhism. The title is also somewhat misleading as it comes from a Zen Buddhism point of view, and not a general Buddhism point of view. because of this people may end up confused or making generalization about Buddhism as a whole. A better book is 'A Buddhism Primer - An Introduction to Buddhism', if you want a general overview of Buddhism this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain & Simple?","review":"This book about Buddhism says it's plain & simple. I found it to be neither plain nor simple.

Hagen explains Buddhism in an absolutely clear, perfectly concise manner and gives simple, everyday examples to illustrate his points.

I would reccomend this book to everyone, not least of all the people who feel somewhat lost in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddhism Plain and Simple","review":"I've had many changes in my life.

Thank you for making my search a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very straight-forward","review":"There is a ton of great stuff in here and it's very accessible.It was pretty obvious to me after finishing this book that the worse thing about Buddhism is the name. I think a LOT more people in the west could adopt these principles if they didn't have such an odd name attached to them. But as we learn in this book, this problem with names is true for everything with a name: the name never does the thing justice but still influences our decisions.Now stop wasting time and just buy it.

I wouldn't say it was the best book I've read on buddhism and I'm just learning so it was good for me. It was definitly worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccessible","review":"I have to agree with petersmaclean. I have no prior knowledge of Buddhism and picked up this book out of intellectual curiosity. I finished it, after having forced myself to get through it all. The book is written in a fluffy and nebulous way. The author talks of \\"seeing\\" (if I see that word in italics again I'm going to puke), and his explanations build off of weak analogies. When I put the book down, I felt I had no substantial knowledge of Buddhism, aside from some foggy notion of enlightenment. Towards the end, the book reads like a cult handbook. I got the feeling that it only makes sense once you've bought into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience . . .","review":"I'm glad I have other sources re Zen, because if it were only this book I checked, it would be history. The editorial review at the beginning said: \\"You might want to digest this book slowly, a few pages at a time.\\" Otherwise, you may want to toss the book across the room.It seems very circular and unclear to me what point he's trying to make, and that isn't the case with other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise and objective","review":"After reading so many Buddhist texts and being frequently confused by the profound yet ambiguous explanations, I found this book extremely refreshing and simple. It is by far the clearest explanation of the Buddha's teachings that I have read.

Regardless of credentials, I don't think the author really knew what he was writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your looking for an unbiased look at Buddhism look somewhere else","review":"I bought this book to give me a nice overview of Buddhism. I was encouraged by the introduction. Unfortunitly after that the author began to make fun of every other religion. I know that buddhism isn't about that. And i think by putting people on the defense about their childhood religon will make it very difficult for them to remain openminded to the spiritually enlightening concepts that buddhism has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a different book","review":"This book was not helpful to me. I found it confusing and redundant. I strongly recommend buying a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated and Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book in order to gain some basic knowledge about Buddhism as a religion - its origins and goals. Unfortunately, I learned none of that. This book is frankly boring. It's repetitive, indirect and unenlightening. Don't waste your time with it. Not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Steve has written a very obfuscated and hard to understand book about buddhism. His writting style is painful and glib and I can't recommed this book as a intro to buddhism. Try \\"Mindfulness in plain english\\" or \\"Buddhism without beliefs\\" instead. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the book that convinced me buddhism is nonsense","review":"Having wasted 7 years of my life as a buddhist, this is the book that convinced me that it is nothing more than mystical gibberish and double talk.

Truly a Zen approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buzz Kill","review":"Taking under consideration all of the 5 Star Reviews, I was disappointed. It started off really good but the author seemed to belabor the same point over and over and over... It was like a movie that starts off really good and never reaches a climax. I would go to a book store and read the first chapter to get the whole gist."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bibliography?","review":"This book started out slow for me. Buddhism Plain and Simple seemed to be to the Dharma what hardtack is to bread. It grew on me and many of it's insights are beautifully written and invaluable for those studying the Dharma. However, the work remains deeply flawed because there is so much left out. I can only imagine someone picking up this book and instantly thinking they are some kind of Zen master because all there is to Zen is seeing. There is also a certain cultural superiority implied in the work, decrying what Hagen views as cultural accretions. The problem I find untenable, however, is a complete lack of notes or bibliography. Even where Hagen directly quotes someone, no sources are given, no translators, zilch, nada. This isn't Zen iconoclasm. This is just lazy writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpfull","review":"Finally a book that is readable for the average reader.

The result is a prose style so cloying and insipid as to verge on the unreadable. If you want to find out about Buddhism or meditation (which are really interesting; more so than you might think) try Mindfulness in Plain English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Simple","review":"If something is not simple, then the author probably does not know the subject well.

But,if you still insist on listening to Buddha, then this is next best thing to a buddha nature awareness.Read the book well & discard it completely from your mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's got to be more to Buddhism than this","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to get a basic understanding of Buddhism. Although it was easy to read (hence the title, \\"Plain And Simple\\"), by page 30 I had no clue what Buddhism was about. It seemed like the rest of the book was going to be the same way. If Hagen is doing a thorough job teaching about Buddhism, than Buddhism seems to me to be more of a practice than a religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I had read several other books about Buddhism before I picked up this one, and I have to say it did not live up to its title. After reading it, I still found Buddhism to be bewildering. (Of course, that could also be due to the fact that its practitioners seem to be in a tooth-and-nail competition to show how enlightened they are by being as obtuse and incomprehensible as possible.) Anyway, this book did nothing to clear things up for me.It has been a few years since I read the book, and my spiritual journey has taken me to a way different place than where I was at the time...so maybe I should thank Mr. Hagen for keeping me from pursuing Buddhism any further. Personally, I think there are better basic explanatory books on Buddhism, like *The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching* by Thich Nhat Hanh. Mr. Hagen's book will leave you just as puzzled as you were before you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddhism Plain and Simple","review":"By trying to make it simple the author ended by distort the content and make it painful to read. the author try desperately to sound knowledgeable but it sound more like it really did not get the fundamentals of Buddha's teaching. he preach instead of showing a way, enumerate instead showing a path. the book will bring only confusion to anybody rather than opening the mind. it is not a realization of our suffering but rather a mirror of Mr Hagen own distraction on believing or trying to be a zen master. Obviously having been allowed the title of teacher went straight to the head of the person but certainly did not enlighten him. well at least that what i felt and that is my own feeling. i would recommend to start with other reading materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Presentation","review":"I have advised people against reading this book as an introduction to Buddhism.

Whoever handles Camp Lo's promotions, needs to do a lot more in the advertising department. \\"Let's do it again\\" is far superior than over half of the garbage that gets released nowadays in the hip hop world.

The author lacks the skills and judgement on how to handle serious issues such as homophobia, racism and environmentalism in a remotely ingenious way.

Notice the grate-like lid? It is not able to keep the proper humidity; one's hand might get sore using that dinky spray bottle to maintain proper saturation. Despite their name, hermit crabs live in colonies, and need \\"buddies\\" to keep them company. It's good to start with two of these fascinating crustaceans -better to start with three- so a ten, or even a twenty gallon glass aquarium with a hood is a much better way to start. About the only good thing about this is that, instead of gravel, it offers sand. Be sure to research proper hermit crab care before bringing any home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be for sale, not appropriate for Hermit Crabs","review":"I agree with the previous review, this Habitat is not even remotely appropriate for Hermit crabs.

Once you think you've figured out how to get the paper and stickers and plastic together, you've used half of each roll and there are not additional rolls included, nor can you buy them separately! There is an internal piece that just doesn't fit once the stickers were in place - this toy is ridiculous.

I believe they were all like age 20 when they wrote this yet the music, although poppy, is lyrically and musically superb. Songs like \\"Pressing On\\" and \\"Sadie Hawkin's Dance\\" are the catchy singles, but it also gets into their Christian roots with \\"For the Moments I feel Faint\\" and \\"Those Words are Not Enough\\". This cd also shows their humorous side with \\"May the Horse be with You\\" and \\"Maybe its Maybelline\\". This cd got me hooked on Relient K. It will get you hooked too.Great for Punk/Pop fans and Christian music fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"I really, really like this CD. I've listened to this whole CD around 10 times already and I just started listening to it last week! I like that the lyrics are still clear, even though most of the songs are punk. It's also nice to find punk songs for Christians. Personally, the best songs are \\"Those Words Are Not Enough,\\" \\"Sadie Hawkins Dance,\\" \\"Down in Flames,\\" \\"May the Horse Be With You,\\" and actually... ALL of them!!! It's hard to find CDs these days that you actually listen to it from cover to cover. I guess this is one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CLEAN music!","review":"Ok, I love Relient K. They are one of my favourite bands. This Cd as wella s their others is just plain awesome. The content is something that all teens can relate. Their latest CD mmhmm is a little more mature than their previous ones, but they are all awesome. They are very fun and upbeat, AND they send a positive message which is rare to find in music these days. I would definitely recommend this for everyone. BTW if you ever have the opportunity you should go see them live. They are 100 times better live. It was the best concert I had ever been to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relient K Strikes Back!","review":"If i had to descibe this album in one word,i would have to say that-i'm sorry,i can't! this album ranges from being funny,to being worshipul,and funny again. There is no one word to describe this album. I am especailly impressed with the songwriting skills of the Matts in the band. Much better than their first album(which is still very,VERY good) they are now writing lyrics that are catchy,and easy to listen too,but they still make you think. I have been a fan of this band since the beginning,all because of the song \\"Staples' (off their first album)i would love to see them in concert again,and i can't wait for their next CD. my favorite songs on this CD are What have you Been Doing Lately?,Less is More,The Rest is up to You,My Way or the Highway,and For the Moments i Feel Faint. Overall,it is obvious that these boys love God and are not afraid to show it in a fun punk way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relient K rocks...","review":"woohoo. This album rocks! Relient K is a great group of guys with incredible talent and love of God. This album is the cd that is constantly in my walkman. With fun songs like 'Lion-O, and 'Sadie Hawkins' to more spiritual songs like 'For the Moments' or 'Those Words are Not Enough' I love it all. From biginning to end this album is great. This is definately an AWSOME buy...i highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the first one... and the first was awesome","review":"Finally there is a talented Christian pop/punk band. There first CD was awesome and this one does not disapoint. I recommand this cd to any Blink and Green Day fans that want a punk cd without all the offensive lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"RELIENT K IS AWSOME!!!","review":"Relient k is probably the coolest cd in christian/punk rock history! You will love this cd and once u listen, u will want more! Once u listen u will be hooked! I think that relient k will make more and more money with their hit- \\"pressing on\\" on this cd (the anatomy of tounge in cheek). When i first heard pressing on i loved it; i listened to it until i could sing it perfectly. I couldnt go to sleep, eat, or do anything without hearing it in my head! My opinion is that u should buy this cd ; it is highly recommended for punk rock lovers. RK RULES!!!-Andrew"},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah!!!","review":"This is relient k's second best CD and i totally love it, i love the religious songs, and even the weird ones are okay. Anyone who disagrees with me is on crack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of Tounge in Cheek","review":"Even though Relient K is labeled as christian, not all songs have a relation to God. \\"Sadie Hawkins Dance\\" (in my opinion, one of the best, if not the best, tracks on the cd) has nothing to do with god, and it is really good. I personally enjoy the whole cd, beginning with \\"Pressing On\\" and going on. Even the songs that do have christian roots (\\"pressing on\\", \\"these words are not enough\\" \\"for the moments i feel faint\\" \\"down in flames\\") have a good sound, and arn't bad to listen to. I enjoy the band cause they have a good sound, are upbeat with their music, and have a positive message. Even if you hate god, you should still at least listen to the cd, because Relient K has outdone themselves with this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"[poor] music","review":"this album isnt funny when it tries to be and sounds stupid when it tries to be serious. the music is boring and the whole album sounds so much the same that i can hardly tell the songs apart. the worst christian cd i have bought since bleach."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"THIS IS NOT A VERY GOOD CD THERES ONLY 3 GOOD SONGS ON HERE PRESSING ON SADIE HAWKINS AND THE MOMENTS I FEEL FAINT.

Listen to the high pitched nasal voices so commonly used in this genre of music! Who are they trying to fool...heterosexual is def a word they aren't familiar with. THe cd is terrible, with every song having the same upbeat tempo and lack of musical talent....One of my best friends loves this group, what a shame!!! Do urself a favor and buy real metal with talent such as Byzantine, Soilwork, Meshuggah, Children of Bodom, and Darkane, etc, etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey kiddies this isn't punk","review":"Um, a word out to you little kids out there, your probably thinking, wow this punk is cool, but no this isn't punk at all, it doesn't even closely resemble punk, it is just nice little love songs that have disstorted guitars in it, and that doesn't qualify as punk at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD was a joke, Right?","review":"I'm gonna be brutally honest with you, I thought this cd was a joke when i first heard sadie hawkins dance. i listened to a few other songs, and this is the dumbest cd i've ever heard. the lyrics of sadie hawkins just made me laugh. a friend of mine played this in the car on the way to school once and we almost threw him out the door, not to mention we still make fun of him about it. for this of you who actually like this, go put your head in a microwave or something, and listen to good music, i suggest pearl jam, but if your into punk, then blink and brand new are good, not this crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of the Togue in Cheek","review":"This cd is the best! Pressing on and Sadie Hawkins Dance are two of my favorites, even all the songs were the bomb. Relient K. is the best group out there, not to mention, they're christian! Nonsense songs rock too. The newest cd is the funny, especially the Nancy Drew thing. They let the listener have fun AND worship God too."},{"rating":"1","title":"relient K","review":"This band is alright. The beat is definately perfect for a punk band, but the lyrics are so emo and christian. I think you shouldnt waste ur time on this one and go for maybe pennywise, millencolin, anti-flag, rancid, operation ivy, dropkick murpheys, etc. Those are the true bands in punk today, but if you wanna get original...go for some ramones or misfits. all awesome bands...check em out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relient K","review":"Hi,the first time I heard Relient K's music was not so long ago. I heard 'Be my Escape' on MTV's TRL. And when I told my friend from church about it.She said that they were a Christian band.And I replied \\"No there not.\\" But what did I know?I heard it on MTV...so I had a reason. Well yesterday I went to an amusment park with my church and'Sadie Hawkins Dance' came on the radio and a boy sitting behind me started singing it.He said 'He loves Relient K!' And I thought for a moment and relized I know that group.So the band is great.But after a while,you notice...alot of the songs kind of sound the same. But it is one of my top favorite Christian/Rock bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages","review":"I bought this CD after I listened to a few songs at my friend's house. I have to say that this is a great CD. I'm into rock, especially punk, and this puts a twist on Christian and punk. It's not nasty at all, and the lyrics, as well as the music, are awesome. I like how \\" Failure to Excommunicate\\" goes, because it is one of the songs that I listen to when I run into trouble, or have a rough day. \\" For the Moments I Feel Faint\\" is a great pick-me-up song, too. Overall, it's great music for anyone, Christian or not, young or old. Relient K has made another brilliant CD, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll find yourself singing these all day!","review":"I had never heard of Reliant K until today. Now I'm hooked. I had talked to people that had been to their concerts and had their cd's and so I borrowed it and listened to the whole CD. Never skipping a song. And then I listened to it again. It is an amazing cd and it just gets better as you go through it. My favotite song is \\"For the moments I feel faint\\". It has such a strong christian message but dosn't seem to force christianity on the listener. I think this would be a great cd as a gift for any teenager because the music is awesome and catches you right away and then later mixes in the christian lyrics. I can't wait until they put out their next cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rats. I actually Like them.","review":"Well, I have long since mocked relient k, though everytime I would talk to one of my friends, they would say they rock. I never met anyone that said they didn't. So I decided to purchase the cd. And I hate to say it, but I like them. My favorite song is \\"Failure to Excommunicate\\". \\"Maybe it's Maybeline,\\" and \\"Pressing On\\" are cool as well. Well, I think if you are looking for new christian bands to try out, you should check these guys out.Thankyou for Reading.*Vapor*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relient K is awesome!","review":"This one is a lot better than thier first, which was pretty good to begin with. it's really well arranged and it just sounds good! Sadie hawkins dance has to be the cutest song ever (oh, oh oh!!), my friend and I crack up when we listen to 'may the horse be with you' in the car (my parents still can't figure out what that song means), but their deeper songs are great, too. I often find myself humming them to cheer me up when i feel a little down. The music ranges from humorous to sweet and mellow to loud and fun, but it's all arranged so well it's definately not choppy or anything like that. definate reccomendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skittles and Combos","review":"OK, for all yall who think this CD is a joke, its not. The songs on the CD are fun and not to mention GOOOD!!! I'm guessing the only people who dont like this CD are people who close thier ears to christian music. Just because they sell it at Mardel's does not mean that the CD totally sucks. This CD is probably the CD I would take to an island with me if I had to pick out of my whole selection. It's defenitly the CD I listen to the most.The beauty about having this CD is that its not a CD about sex for once thats all you here anymore and it gets old. I defenetly would recomend this CD to who ever is interested. And to whoever thinks that Relient K: The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek is a &quot;JOKE&quot; or &quot;CRAP&quot;, you are SOO wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pop version of MXPx.","review":"Relient K comes through with an amazing album that will satisfy any Christian music fan. As the title says, I believe that this band can become the next MXPX, a popular hardcore Christian. band for those of you who don't know. Each song delivers a strong Christian meaning mixed with the fun antics of relient k. My favorites are probably \\"Pressing On,\\" and \\"sadie hawkins Dance.\\" The only song that I don't really like is \\"Lion-O,\\" yet, a ton of people think that its a good song, so I may be the only one.Anyway, no need to end a review on a negative note, 'cause this Cd is AWESOME!!! Buy it today. It will satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"When i first got this cd, i wasn't sure what to really expect, the first two songs on this cd, \\"Sadie Hawkins Dance\\" and \\"Pressing On\\" were amazing, but it went no where but down hill after that. There is no need to mix pop/punk with religious beliefs, its just selling religion. They have always had the potential to be an awesome band, and they've just proved me right with their new cd \\"Two lefts don't make a right...but three do\\" This cd has totaly changed my perception, of this previously lacking band. This is easily the best cd to date for Relient K, and the one that will take them to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relient K Rocks!","review":"Yeah, this CD is probably one of their best yet. I especially love \\"Kick Off\\", it's really good.-Albert"},{"rating":"2","title":"The defining work in the field","review":"In this work, J. B. Rhine explores the various research done (at the time of the initial writing) on extra-sensory perception and concludes that there is such a thing.The work is important because it is cited by a wide range of others including Dr Carl Jung in \\"Synchronicity.\\" Most other reasonably respectable research into similar topics has been derivative of Rhines.Anyone interested in this field either to debunk or advocate it should read this work.

But in the end Stewart had me laughing; The Yoga Mamas embraces the pleasures of having kids. Starting with pregnancy, going straight into childbirth and all the diapers that follow, five women's stories woven together unravel the complicated lies we tell ourselves to make it from one day to the next before coming to a heartwarming end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yoga Mamas Rocks!","review":"This book is absolutely adorable, smart, and funny! I enjoyed it immensely and feel that most any female would as well. It is a great story of friendship, and bonding that anyone can relate to.

The battery was completely dead when charger arrived ( under 3 VDC actually 0.2 VDC) used the battery terminal fixed mount harness provided with charger instead of alligator clips, charger would not turn on because of the batter state. I used a regular charger to bring the voltage up above the minimum 3 VDC and then connected the battery tender and let me tell you it took three days to bring the battery voltage to 12.6 VDC shortly after the charge was complete and the battery tender automatically switched to trickle charge mode and has not let me down in the five weeks of using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Device for Boat Battery!","review":"I have a boat and during the winter, the batteries would discharge.

However, I was disappointed in the condition I received it from Amazon. I usually order from Amazon because the items have always arrived in the sealed original manufacturer packaging. This time the battery tender arrived in the plastic manufactuer's container but it arrived opened. The opened container had been placed in an open plastic bag that was placed in a box for transport. Obviously, someone who packed the battery tender was aware it was opened and did not care, since they did place it in a plastic bag. My question is why was it opened? Why would they send a product that was opened? Had it been returned and now Amazon sends products in opened packaging but think that placing them in opened plastic bags compensates?I haven't had a chance to see if the battery tender is operational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable, waterproof, and effective.

There are plety of servers and for each servers, one can make up to seven charaters. there are Barbarians, Elves, Dark elves, Dwarves, trolls, Haflings, all which can be Enchanters, CLerics, Warriors, Shadow KNights and many many more combinations. with that many combinations there is definately something for new players and Veteran MMORPGs alike. this is an excellent game and i would recomend it to anyone that likes RPGs of all kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review based on previous experience with SOE","review":"I played Everquest. I never had a single good experience with the good folks at Sony Online Entertainment. The people that bring us Everquest and Everquest Online Adventures. While the game had it's good points, and was occasionally fun, I don't think it is worth the risk.The computer game still has bugs that were listed as bugs by beta testers, years after beta was done with and several expansions later. When there is a problem with the game it is always a problem with your setup, never with their funky/broken code. I would expect these problems to be less frequent with the PS2 version, but I would probably be disappointed.I have to agree with the person who said to wait and play Final Fantasy XI. That is what I plan to do.

Without a doubt, it was the worst book I have read dealing with business matters/consulting.When I ordered this book, I did so based upon other reviews talking about the book having \\"no fluff\\", etc... I can assure you that nothing is farther from the truth. There is little if any \\"meat\\" to this book. Instead, I found it to contain only general ideas and nothing of practical use.Did I mention that the book has only 97 pages? Frankly, as I read the book, I found it as nothing more than a pretext to offer the authors other products such as their \\"seminar in a box\\".Hopefully, I will be able to spare someone else the misfortune of buying this book. If you are so inclined, re-read this review and if you are still unconvinced, wait and buy it used if you must.

I have been a Quickbook consultant since the birth of the product and this \\"easy read\\" book reinforced a lot of my practices and gave me some new ideas to help me be more efficient in the future.Pricing services, adding value, and assessing the \\"Health\\" of the data file were outstanding parts and this should be a must read for anyone who would like to be a consultant with Quickbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful","review":"While Quickbooks is one of the most popular accounting programs for small businesses, this book should definately not be. I found the amount of useful information for Quickbooks specific consulting in this book to be rather lacking. The author tends to be overly repetitive about the use of seminars, group training, and workshops. While these are important topics, the space in the book could have been used for some much more needed information. This is also true for the amount of advertising the author includes in the book for his own company and associates. True there are only a few consulting books out there for Quickbooks, but I think this is one to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"My husband loves making his own beer.

Most of my favorite authors appear in this book! You'll enjoy reading these splendid yarns. In particular, the one by Whitley Strieber. Mr. Strieber is right to express his future fears in his tale. Everyone knows that we Christians are longing for the day when we can take over the world (like our Lord Jesus Christ so eloquently taught us to) and oppress the masses with our conservative agenda. Beware, ye evildoers! Every true Christian yearns to see the masses crushed under the thumb of our control and trodden underfoot by the ever-advancing army of Christ. We know who you are, Whitley! WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU AND ALL OF YOUR MINIONS! Be very afraid.I will never, ever get enough of Ray Bradbury. Read his story here, then go and pick up another book by bRAdburY. He is the man.

Koontz, Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, M.R. James, Ambrose Bierce, Caitlin Kiernan, and unfortunately, this collection pales significantly in comparison; both in terms of chills and writing quality. I purchased this book based on these rave reviews, and am sorely disappointed. For readers seeking true chills, the Best New Horror collections offer much more in terms of true horror. This story collection can only hope to vaguely discomfit, if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Collection of Modern Horror","review":"First, I'll say that in my opinion, there wasn't a single \\"clunker\\" of a story in this entire anthology. Each tale worked in its own way to captivate and satisfy --even for this \\"jaded\\" reader of horror.Second, I must say that I strongly disagree with the reviewer who attacked Whitley Streiber's story on the basis that it had a \\"liberal\\" slant. (What does that have to do with merit of the story???) If you don't like liberals, that's fine, but why include your opinion in a book review?)Anyway, I digress, as did the writer of that review.Finally, some of the best stories in the book are by the lesser known authors, though the superstars who were included didn't send in any \\"trunk stories\\" either.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Delicacies- not at all delicate!","review":"I was wonderfully surprised and not at all dissapointed in this horror anthology edited by \\"the Nancy's\\". I am an avid horror anthology reader, and hate it when I pick up one that claims to have \\"new writers of horror\\" but instead half of the book holds old, totally dull classics.

Good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has good points, but the overall purpose is too religious","review":"The points Peck makes in this book are both good and bad. I agreed with many of his assertions about discipline and love, though his definition of love is too narrow. For someone that went through medical school, he ignores many scientific principles that contracdict his assertions about science and religion. The last section of this book is evangelism, rather than persuasive writing. Overall, the overtly religious intent of this book made its argument far less effective than it could have been.

I'd tried to read this book numerous times, it wasn't until I reached a crossroads in my own life that I was truly able to read the book -- and then I plowed through it in a week.One tip - don't just read the parts you think you want (i.e. LOVE) -- the book's wisdom lies in how all the pieces fit together...Dr. Peck - thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generational Read","review":"I enjoyed the book and subject matter.

Peck does a wonderful and thorough job dealing with somewhat intangible topics. This book is far from a self help book, but yet it is somewhat the epitome of self help books. There is a gentle flow towards his views, experiences and opinions of psychotherapy, mental illness and grace. The melding of an openness for mental and spiritual growth are well demonstrated by his words and examples from his practice.I'm very glad I read this book. It is true that Peck expects a bit from the reader, but he should. He doesn't provide many, if any quick answers. This book truly focuses on where the mind is at, your ability and will to grow and how your openness to a larger force can help you grow.Many people will be insulted or intimidated by his point of view, but those who are open to these ideas will be lifted.May your path be a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three strikes - I'm done.","review":"Sections on Love and Discipline I found very interesting and to some degree enlightening. However, I had a few problems with this book.1. On page 61 - the section on Discipline - Peck recalls a male patient that expressed homosexual tendencies. His advice to that patient - date a woman. My next thought, \\"Is this guy a homophobe? Why didn't he explore the possibility that his patient could genuinely be gay and might successfully and happily live as a gay man?\\" ..but I continued to read.2. Peck seems to brag about himself as a psychotherapist, A LOT.

The view that one has to face the pain in life is indeed a road less traveled in this world that sometimes overemphasizes the easy way out. I think his definition of love attempts to grasp the concept of it, but I am happier with the definition given by Jesus. Trust HIM on that rather.

It was written over 20 years ago but still is a great introduction to how to start to explore the meaning of your life and the relationships around you. Peck has a pragmatic approach and when I first read this book it gave me insights that I had never been exposed to. This is the type of reading that should be presented in schools so that the next generation is exposed to a broader pespective of life.

What I remember all these years that helped me work through my feelings is 2 concepts: 1) His first sentence, which every one has mentioned that \\"Life is difficult.\\"; and, 2)how much energy we exert by not trying to feel and that this very act of not feeling made ones emotional state more difficult and creates a barrier to healing.My interpretation of these concepts was that if I let myself feel and go through the grieving process it would actually hurt less and it would take a shorter time period to heal.I remember it was a tough book to get through; however, I clinged onto those two concepts and they really helped me heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in Self-Help literature.","review":"With the opening line, \\"Life is difficult,\\" Peck begins this classic with what might be the most straightforward statement of all time. This book continues on with Peck's assessment of what it takes to lead a fulfilling life through responsibility, discipline and self control. It is well worth the money and I highly recommend it. I would add that Albert Ellis's book,A Guide to Rational Livingwould also be very helpful to you if this is the kind of book you would like to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Insightful, Potentially Life-Changing","review":"This book blew my mind. The perfect balance of where psychology meets life. It was unexpected, practical, deep, well-written & I've already purchased copies for several friends. I think I expected to be inspired (and I was), but I didn't expect to get new insights on life to the depth that I received from reading this book. I assumed it was a Christian book from the mention of spirituality in the sub-title, but was blown away by the approach it took on the spiritual dimension of living (turns out it wasn't Christian-based & would not be offensive even to an atheist, deist or non-practicing person). Can't imagine a person who would be bothered by reading it & can only imagine how many people I wish would read it because it would benefit them. Just read it - even if only out of curiosity - you WILL learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an educated opinion on life, but well worth the look.","review":"Let me start by saying that The Road Less Traveled does not provide short cuts in the elusive road to happiness or self-satisfaction. It is a map, constructed from Peck's profesional opinions that assists in guiding those of us who are afraid to acknowledge challenge and pain. I've often found myself shut off from the world, but after reading it I came to discover that my isolation is a direct result of my choices. It gave me an outsiders perspective on the multiple excuses people make for themselves to avoid the loss of personal security.The Road Less Traveled is not for everyone, for there are portions of the book that seem misguided. Still, this is all part of the charm in Peck's philosphy on life. He isn't afraid of his imperfections, and he recognizes that in some areas his book is flawed. The Road Less Traveled is simply his educated opinion on life, nothing more, and nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Beginners!","review":"If you're thinking about getting into photography, but find the idea daunting, this book will be the perfect companion to help you get started.

Many of the songs are good, but have been destroyed in the disk production process by amping them up to beyond the 0 line on the db meter. Many of the tunes--Abyssinean Dub for sure--are now peaked out so high that what you hear for the most part is scratchy mush during the bass thumps and the pounding drum beats.Give this one a miss...and this company too if they can't get someone to master these disks who knows how to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy Chill","review":"Chill-out music is a global phenomenon and this trendy lounge music compilation by Putomayo is excellent for perfecting the act of lounging idly. Modern downtempo masters like Italian producer Nicola Conte and German DJ Project Jasmon love marrying South American elements with enigmatic middle eastern melodies to create a novel, entrancing aural backdrop for a moodsome lounge session. This eclectic collection with European DJs validates that Parisians have no monopoly over chill-out vibes. So whether you are on a warm rug at your own lounge pad or at a chic Parisian lounge, just lay back on this chill out odyssey. My faves: Mau Mau, a folksy accordion with quirky percussion, punchy bass and subtle electronic remixes and bits of African pop & Blue Asia (Japan) which fuses exotic Indian sitar with oriental trumpets. Classy.Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cocktail music","review":"This is a great soundtrack for a swanky cocktail party.Whenever I play it at my parties, my friends always ask where the wonderfully different music is from.

However, for those who aren't so designer conscious many of the references may be missed. Those in the know will find it very entertaining.

My son was so excited when the box arrived. We torn the first package open to a fruity aroma. We each took a cherry twist and we both were overjoyed how good it was. I like the chewy texture I was a fan of Redvines (hated Twizzlers tasted so chemical) This has a nice flavor and the bonus of being able to savor the twist because of the chewy texture.

The other three characters in the book could be merged into a single one without any loss, and in general the entire book's message could be condensed in a few pages.

At least it is a notch better than the disaster with Dudley Moore and Peter Cook. Laughs are here and there in Without a Clue but far in between. After maybe forty-five minutes, the film goes downhill from there and has never recovered. It's hard for me to see Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley being Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively. I've read all of the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, and nearly none of what Caine and Kingsley did even remotely matches the typical bearing and deportment of the two famed characters. The conversations don't sound correct either. So, it's hard for me to watch Without a Clue and appreciate it at the same time.

Rick took off about five years of any studio work, and decided to take his time before this release in 2002. The long, and often hard wait, for this Supertramp fanatic was rewarded with nine solid songs on \\"Slow Motion\\". \\"Broken Hearted\\" is as good a song as Rick has written. \\"Over You\\" takes you back to almost the big band era sound. John and Lee on saxes and horns outdo themselves and make this album so distinct from other music of today. The two long songs ( Tenth Ave Breakdown and Dead Man's blues ) contain great instrumental breaks that in my mind is one of Rick's great trademarks, going back to three previous albums sans Roger( Somethings Never Change, Free As A Bird, Brother Where You Bound ). The only better thing that can happen to me now, after listening to Slow Motion constantly since buying it, is seeing them live in the USA ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"It is a real shame that Supertramp just plays long drawn out Jazz.

This book was an impulse buy for vacation based upon the blend of styles and plot lines offered in the description. I was curious to see if the author could pull it off. And did it ever work.In a nutshell Thursday Next is a Literary Police Officer in England making sure the literary classics maintain their integrity in history. There is magic, comedy, disbelief and fun. The characters are great and most interestingly, in their literary world, quite believable. Those of you that lack a sense of humor or have a literal aura about them probably should move on to some non-fiction, but if you want a well written book that is a fun read, order away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick and fun read","review":"This book was a lot of fun! It was a bit confusing in the beginning, while I was trying to get a handle on the world. Great Britain circa 1985, only with time travel, supernatural creatures, dodos as pets, a 130 year long war with Russia over the Crimean Penninsula and everyone having a very passionate love of literature.Literature geeks start riots in the street, steal original manuscripts and try to pass off fakes. SpecOps 27 is in charge of dealing with these lawbreakers. Literary Detective Thursday Next is in the middle of it all as she tries to rescue classic literature from being permanently changed, while dealing with her own past and personal problems.The puns and play on words are very amusing. Reading Jane Eyre first will increase your enjoyment of this book, although not completely necessary.Overall, an enjoyable, quick read. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Class Smart-Arse Makes Good","review":"I read Fforde's 'Nursery Crime' books before I read this one and am surprised by the number of similarities between them, not to mention some of the same characters. But more than anything else, Fforde is able to take a few well known characters and books and use them to create something totally different and new.He writes in the (now well) accepted method of 'Monty Python' where nothing is too sacred to be spoofed or made fun of, or both. The ongoing argument (during the story) of who wrote Shakespeare's plays is such a treat because of all the time people waste on this ongoing search. And the whole spoof of Austen-ophiles and the aura that has developed over the Bronte girls is worth the reading alone.But Fforde also has his way of throwing in as many SciFi genres that he can think of at the same time, making these books unclassifiable except for them being 'Left-handed Mysteries'. All in all a great beginning to what I hope will be an ongoing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frivolous and fun.","review":"The Thursday Next books strange but delightful confections of mystery, science fiction, and very-British comedy, with a dash of romance (or of chances missed) thrown in. Scattered throughout are literary references that some readers will revel in, and some will simply miss. It doesn't matter which group you fall into, the books are a treat in any case. Being such an indulgence, they are not to be consumed all at once, as they will become cloying. But reading one now and then lifts the spirits.Which is all a nice way of saying that there is a great similarity among the books, so spread your reading of them over a long period.The Eyre Affair is classic Fford. You don't have to be a Bronte fan to be entertained, or to follow the plot, but if you happen to have a soft spot for Jane Eyre, you'll get a real kick out of it. I loved it. It gets four stars instead of five simply because the writing is at times uneven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really creative and fun.","review":"I am a bookworm who rarely sits down to read novels anymore but read a review of this in the New York Times which made it sound great -- and it is. The plot is outlandishly funny for anybody who likes books, and pushes some very creative notions on you with good effects.

Moves fast, funny and flatteringly insiderish -- perfect beach book."},{"rating":"2","title":"downright hilarious","review":"Quite the funny-book. The plot is absolutely absurd, which is oen of the reasons it's so incredible! The irony and the dialogue in the so-British humor is absolutely intoxicating and hilarious.

It was a little slow at first for me, but then was very good once I got into it. I don't normally pick sci-fi type books to read; however, we read this book as part of our book club. I am the only one out of most of my friends that didn't enjoy Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and it seems like I have heard lots of comparisons. Thankfully this book had a lot of saving graces in it to make it only slightly similar in comparison.The main character was well developed and basically quite likable. Other characters were fairly well developed when needed and played their parts - everything fit together for the most part. I especially liked the antagonist in the book. I enjoyed the literary references through out the book. The ending was good too. Overall, it was an interesting concept in many ways and a good read. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Likes itself too much","review":"As a flight of fancy this book has plenty of spirit, but for me its cleverness and self-conscious whimsy became a little cloying after a while. The characterization is weak, and, if you take a step back from the story for a day or two, the mass of ideas becomes instantly idigestible. The style also conveys a certain authorial smugness, which, once noticed, becomes annoying. A nice try, but ultimately unsatisfying. If Fforde is truly brave he will do something totally different next time - dare I say, something more conventional? But I expect publisher pressure will ensure more of the same - only probably not as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little wordy, but worth the read","review":"Despite the fact that the book doesn't really get the point until the very end, I was hooked on it. The best part of it, to me, was the villian, Acheron Hades! I was glad the exhausted book finally came to an end, but I was really upset about not being able to read about Hades anymore.Losing a great villian is worse than losing a main character.It also seemed a little far-fetched to me to have people jumping in and out of literature. Then again, it depends what you're interested in. Either way, it's a great thriller and it will keep you reading to the very end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleverer and Cleverer","review":"Ingenuity, humor, a brilliant idea almost seamlessly carried out--nuggets of gold for book lovers on almost every page--even something for those Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans out there! A book with parts of some many other books deliberately woven into it, and yet like nothing else written (except for his sequels)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to be honest here","review":"I am a total fan the serise but this book is just really slow in places and as a result I can totally understand if you can't get into it. I also have a problem because I have never read Jane Eyre before and I realize that half the jokes are going over my head. I plan to read Jane Eyre than go back and read this book than I will be able to appriciate it more.Overall-Give the other three in the serise a shot even if you have a hard time getting into the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fforde Finds a Place on my Bookshelf","review":"This book was recommended by a friend, and boy am I glad I checked it out. Let me first make it known that I had not read Jane Eyre when I read The Eyre Affair, and I got along fine so don't worry and think you have to read Jane Eyre to get this.Thursday Next is a literary detective in a world where dodos exist, the Crimea War has been going on for 100 some years and the black market for literature is quite lucrative. Next must take on Acheron Hades, a villain of wide repute and is stealing original manuscripts. Hades has kidnapped Next's uncle who has invented a doorway into fiction...literally. Now Hades is going into original manuscripts and holding the main characters hostages...and it's up to Next to get his victim...Jane Eyre.In Fforde's debut novel he blew my mind away! I have never read anything so original and clever. I find myself wishing I could go into the books he describes....and how well he describes them. Keep up the good work Fforde!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"The more well-read you are, the more you will enjoy this book. It's clever, full of puns and witty. It's intelligent. It's silly. It's got a super plot. It's got realistic characters. It has a bit of science fiction. And best of all...it uses Jane Eyre as a springboard for the plot.As a former English major, I have spent 4 years reading literature and discussing literature, spending time in the dining hall with my fellow bibliophiles debating some obscure point or other...and this is such a good book for true book-lovers.Trust me, if you love books and love to read, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start...","review":"I'd missed the first book in the Thursday Next series, so I thought I'd look back to see how it all started just to see if Fforde's work was always the hodgepodge of time travel, book travel and random bits of soap opera that the other books have proven to be. I found the introduction to the world of Spec. Ops to be a bit more linear and cohesive at the start. Thursday's \\"sad sack\\" demeanor is in clear evidence but the novel is much more plot driven and works a bit better than some of the later material. All the characters are in place and Hades never seems to be quite as menacing as he is in his first appearance. You soon realize that with time being so fluid in these storylines that Fforde always has an escape route if he wants to use it if the story gets too dark. This series was off to a good start in the opener and even though I have found the novels to get a bit sillier as time goes on, but they are generally funny enough to deserve a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eyre Affair","review":"I am a S-L-O-W reader, but am enjoying the book; I am about 25% through it. Great wit in Fforde's wordplay and interesting means of transporting the reader back in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Combination","review":"All I can say: Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series are the books everyone has been searching for. It combines a realative herione and the antogonist, the quirky charachters and details, romance, suspence, and imaginative ideas. You will find it's an honor to read such a fine crafted novel as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"too weird - not fun enough","review":"The book tries to be a funny book but does not catch you enough but also it is too weird to be worth it - it gets stuck in the middle . go for other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"This book is just too weird, too descriptive with uninteresting wordiness, too bizaar for my taste, too far-fetched. I like a credible tale. This book has NO credibility, whatsoever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative idea; inept execution","review":"I love mysteries and crime fiction and geniuses policing good and evil while abandoning the morality taught by half-wit parents, clergy, teachers, politicians and news programs. I love the surreal premise of the lines between life and fiction, between the past and the present, between reality and fantasy blurring. Blurring them all at once is ambitious. Doing so with flat characters, predictable twists, and such a complete abandonment of reality makes for a boring book. You can't get caught up in the characters when they are so trite. You can't get to the edge of your seat when people might become invisible, some characters are impervious to bullets, and good and bad sit so clearly opposed to each other. Dragsville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Bear Thought","review":"Fluff. One or two cute ideas bogged down in an inconsistent effort to be whimsical. As you look at reviews for later Fforde books, keep in mind that it's only the people who liked the early ones that are reading the later ones, so the attitudes of the readers tend to be more favorable and the rating results skewed upwards..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barfable - Save your brain the pain of reading this book","review":"I was deeply disappointed with this book. I do *not* understand how books like this become best sellers. It occurred to me as bad children's literature - the characters are stiff, boring and unlikable. While I like the premise, the writing is choppy and shallow. The book has a major non-sequitor - at one point, the main character travels forward in time 36 years, but all the supporting characters don't age in those 36 years. Huh? Also, one unlikable character is named Schitt - a very immature play on the poo word. Give me a break - are we still in grammar school? Read the \\"Number One Detective Agency\\" books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"If you love words you will love this book. It's full of word play and literature puns while at the same time telling an exciting detective story with a futuristic twist. If you're not very well read you may miss a few of the puns, but you'll probably still enjoy the nice writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the whole series","review":"Great book! Reading this book made me want to buy the rest of the series. I love the author's technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, fun, and full of puns----","review":"This was such a fun book. Just like a previous reviewer, I laughed out loud often. The puns are hilarious and I am sure I missed some. The more you have read, the more you get out of this,i.e the discussion about \\"Love's Labour Won\\"? How could you not chortle? However, it was not just a bunch of puns strung together. In fact, most were subtle. No, it had a plot with a beginning, a middle and an end. How nice. I have already bought book two, and am looking forword to delving into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" first is not necessary","review":"You don't have to have read \\"Jane Eyre\\" to understand this book, there are enough internal clues to make it clear. I've read a couple of Douglas Adam's books and find the type of humor similar. Several places I laughed out loud. The wordplay is delicious. If you say the characters' names aloud often you'll find each name is a word. If you've ever been in a Shakespeare course or attended a Shakespean play, you'll enjoy the book. I look forward to reading the series as it appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Ingenious concept... it sort of reminds me of The Matrix, except relevant to the literary world. Well written with witty and intriguing characters... I wouldn't be surprised if it was turned into a movie soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Literary Fun","review":"I hesitated before reading this. I shouldn't have. Quirky characters mixed with tons of tongue-in-cheek literary allusions had me turning pages with abandon.I devoured the entire book in one sitting and am now waiting for the sequel.Cheers to Jasper Fforde for a fabulous fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"most interesting book I've read for a while","review":"I read about a book a day but I finished this one several days ago and I still keep thinking about it. I loved the adventure, the mystery, all the plays on familiar plots -- I most loved the resolution to the great mystery of who REALLY wrote Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Amusing","review":"Fforde's well designed and intreaguing alternative England is thoroughly created and fascinating. His characters are amusing and I laughed out loud several times while enjoying their escapades. A very different book and nice change of pace. Can't wait to read the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very stupid book","review":"Creative idea, however, the main character is ridiculous. Always at the right place at the right time. Very predictable and I will never read another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe Those Four-Star Reviews!","review":"Cliché-riddled writing and derivative characters trapped in a mildly-original though poorly-executed narrative. I never believed in protagonist Thursday Next, I never believed in the novel's universe. Contrary to other reviewers, this book is NOT Douglas Adams, NOT Jonathan Lethem, NOT Monty Python, NOT Stephen Hawking, NOT gripping, NOT witty, and certainly NOT Bronte. AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not witty, just plain stupid!","review":"I wouldn't have even finished this book had it not been that I was reading it for my book club. It just didn't appeal to me and many of the supposedly \\"witty\\" things were just plain stupid. I didn't find this book appealing at all. It could be an interesting concept, but the author fails to carry it through with any sort of wit or class. Hasn't the time travel plot aka. \\"Back to the Future\\" been done and done and done before?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bronte Fans Beware","review":"This book cashes in on one of the greatest books of all time without aspiring to be even literate. The book is one huge, smug, pretentious cliche that hopes that discussing greate literature is the same thing as creating it. This book is subpar and a waste of time.Lovers of Jane Eyre should avoid this book like the plague. The author's bio says that he \\"arranges words on a page.\\" This is a very apt description for he is certainly not \\"writing.\\" Fforde should return to his day job and stop wasting paper. Trees are precious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price is OUTRAGEOUS!","review":"I was hoping to get this book for my Kindle, but when I discovered that I could get the \\"dead tree\\" edition for less... This is insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear lord!","review":"This might possibly be the worst book I have ever read. It strains to be deep and engaging, but is simply unengaging and predictable. The consistant use of puns just makes is worse. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splat","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I love Harry Potter, I love Douglas Adams. I bought this and expected to get it home and devour it. Instead, I could barely bring myself to finish it. I have nothing against cleverly constructed alternate realities, but this was instead an alternate reality of pure cleverness, awash in puns and \\"highbrow\\" literary references that made me feel like I was being sassed at by a smart-alecky pre-teen bookworm. The writing was flat and trite, suited more to internet fanfic than a published novel. The characters were transparent, existing as not much more than stock caricatures with clever names and added, apparently, as needed, with no life of their own. Thursday Next herself failed to materialize at all. My advice: save yourself the crushing disappointment and don't even read the tantalizing book jacket - just pass this by and read, well, anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun -","review":"Fforde has done a great job inventing a new alternate world. So much fun reading about a world where the book-loving people make up the majority. I thoroughly enjoyed it & the references to classics - and the story of Jane Eyre's previous ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear.","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the many-starred reviews on it's cover; reviews from the NY review of Books, the Washington post, et al.I'm still waiting for the 'verve', 'quirky charm' and 'clever wordplay' to emerge. Admittedly, the premise is clever; the alternate universe with details such as the Hyperbookworms, ChronoGuards and the biblio-centric society well thought out, but the prose is pedestrian in the extreme (as one other reviewer wrote, it's of the 'I did this, the he did that.....' style). And the witty word play? A character named Jack Schitt? Not funny the first time, and after the two-hundredth mention of Mr. Schitt, I felt like screaming. (I did giggle at a few of the names though, like 'Millon De Floss', but it's hardly subtle is it?)So, excellent ideas, shame about the writing. I should mention that I did finish it - and will probably take the rest of the series out on loan from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel!","review":"Jasper Fforde's debut novel is astounding for a first time author. The book follows literary detective Thursday Next, who is trailing the dangerous Acheron Hades. When Hades begins stealing characters out of books, it's up to Thursday to stop him. The 1985 alternate universe is entirely believable and intriguing - filled with dodos, bookworms, and other inventions. Thursday is a wonderful heroine - strong, yet vulnerable in her own ways. This book brings up many thought-provoking ideas, and keeps you reading till the very end. It's a terrific science-fiction-esque novel without being too 'far out'."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are some good story ideas in here...","review":"If you are that person out there who's read a thousand character driven classics, but has a secret love for plot driven books, this book was made for you.I liked the time travel gags, and enjoyed the field trips into _Jane Eyre_ (who wouldn't?).I'm still shaking my head at the parallels between Thursday's life and Jane's, which added nothing of substance to either story. The surprising part is that you can take an independent woman who's been betrayed by one man and is invited to go on a mission with another and make her resemble Jane Eyre so LITTLE.It wouldn't be so bad if the author didn't remind you in every third sentence how well read he is. I got the in-jokes, and they added nothing to the story either. I don't mind congratulating myself for having read Shakespeare, but I want to feel MORE than just smug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that was fun","review":"What a blast. This book shows that it's possible to be literate without being literary, clever without being pretentious.This is a great book for people who grew up reading \\"imaginative fiction,\\" a.k.a. fantasy, but who now want something more substantive and sophisticated. You won't need to have read the Bronte canon to enjoy this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love literature - you HAVE to read this series.","review":"The first time I read this book I was blown away by how imaginative Fforde is. He creates a world that is fascinating, hilarious and realistic at the same time. How I wish I lived in the world Thursday Next inhabits and had the ability to jump into books. I won't go into the plot or details (several reviewers have done that already) but I will say that every book in this series is worth reading. I've recommended these books to several of my friends and each one came back to thank me for pointing them towards the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very clever and very funny","review":"I liked this book more than I thought I would. Time travel and detective novels are not usually the sort of thing I'm drawn to but the dry wit in this novel made it a very enjoyable read for me. I may have enjoyed the atmosphere more than the story but I found myself giggling at such things as rioting gangs of conflicting art enthusiasts (impressionists against the expressionists) or the idea of seeing Shakespeare's Richard III as a Rocky Horror Picture show experience where the audience joins in for the battle scene.I'm sure this book isn't for everyone but it's impossible to describe and I highly recommend giving it the 50 page test because I know I was surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't really earned its praise","review":"This little book was amusing at first. It boasts a lot of creative and interesting tidbits, but ultimately fails to do anything but titilate readers with flashy narrative devices. I've read this book twice, and I have to say that, having done so, Fforde's debut novel has even less to recommend it than I originally thought. Most of the characters have quizzical, if not nonexistent, motivations and a good portion of the book involves tangents that lead nowhere or fall flat. He doesn't even do anything interesting with the characters from 'Jane Eyre.' All in all, the book is melodramatic, confounding and, above all, cynical, relying as it does on bells and whistles sure to draw the attention of readers (and especially reviewers) hungry for anything remotely clever in concept. True, there are some amusing parts, and the prose is competent, but there's no accounting for the sensation this book was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Quite frankly, I don't know just how Jasper Fforde makes this stuff up; a parallel 1985. A hundred and fifty years of Crimean War. England giving the Isle of White to France. Dodos. But the best most fun part of this world is that the technology that allows the characters to jump in and out of books seems quite plausible.I also don't quite know how to describe Fforde's heroine Thursday next. She is as special and unique as her name. She's brave and headstrong and nothing ever seems impossible.It's also equally difficult to pigeonhole the book and its sequels into one single genre. Is it fantasy? Science fiction? Comedy? Adventure? Who knows, but once you pick up the EA you might, like me, not be able to put the darned thing down. I can't wait for my own cloned dodo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, and fun.","review":"Certainly, I haven't read a book like this in some time. It's the kind of book that you give to your friends and say, \\"Hey, why don't ya check this out?\\"I wanted a change of pace, something outside of my normal reading habits. Instead of reading psychological suspense thrillers, Oprah Book Club Picks, Pen/Faulkner award winners, National Book...you get the idea, I wanted to step outside the box. (I was also reading some fluff too, but don't tell anyone.) I happened upon this book, and didn't want to let go. I read it in a week, and was so happy with the creativity that I visited the web sites that go along with the book. The whole experience made reading fun, and I will be looking forward to the next Thursday Next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love obscure (and not so obscure) references","review":"I'll not repeat what others have already said, but this book is a great deal of fun. I don't remember the last time a book made me laugh out loud, but The Eyre Affair is worth the price for just one of its scenes (when Thursday attends the play Richard III). This book includes so many interesting references to other literature and history that even the minor shortcomings (the only developed character is Thursday) don't hurt the final effect.I would also point out that a background in literature will make this book more enjoyable (along with a sense of whimsy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic, funny read!","review":"This is one of those books you just want to share! I devoured it in record time (especially considering my husband and I were battling it out for our one copy), and then started plotting which of our friends to lend it to first.Full of literary allusions, witty asides, and jokes that will have you digging out your old English Lit. texts, \\"The Eyre Affair\\" is a fantastic first novel! What if we lived in a world where literature was more important than sports--and gangs of artists roamed the streets? What if everyone had the equivalent of a masters in the classics, and pop culture was made up of, well, culture? Combine these absurdities with secret service agents, time travel, and a bit of romance, and you have a great engaging mix.I can't recommend the book highly enough... and it may even inspire you to dig out your dusty old copy of Jane Eyre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"and series.I'd been hearing about the Eyre Affair for months, and finally decided to try it. I think I was through it in two days, and ordered the second as soon as I finished.I love the universe that Fforde has spun...the characters are interesting and it's a complete world, not just our reality with a few changes. The author doesn't go out of his way to explain everything, he lets the story do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious romp of a book!","review":"I was completely charmed by this book. What a fun concept! The idea of a world where literature is the principle form of recreation and where people are as passionate about books and authors as they are about professional sports here (heck -- even more passionate) was irresistible in and of itself, but to then add time travel, alternate history, a plethora of literary in-jokes, and James Bond-ish spy-type antics on top of that...!Pure delightful fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain fun!","review":"Jasper Fforde has invented a one of a kind thing with this series. Those of us who love books and read some classics in high school will definitely enjoy having those characters come to life! Everything from Mycroft and Polly's latest invention to Thursday's adventures inside a novel will have you feeling like you can't wait to read the next installment of this wonderful series. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to jump inside a book and have a conversation with their favorite character!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Jasper Fforde is very funny. This series is well worth your time. He uses so many references to great literature (as well as poor literature) and it's caused me to go back and do some re-reading. The plot lines are mysteries/ adventure while at the same time revolving on how the story lines we all know are changed by Thursday Next and her counterparts to end up the way they are today, as she jumps from book world to book world. Read the Thursday Next books before the Nursery Crimes books."},{"rating":"2","title":"very clever, charming conceit about books","review":"for a bookworm this is a great idea, a world in which reading is so central that books are real as life, and people can slip back and forth between them. characters from books appear in abundance and there are witty turns on literary devices and such. it's very cleverly done, with a nice light hand, and especially fans of jane austin and the eponymous bronte classic will love it. it's set in an alternative universe in which people keep cloned dodos as pets, etc. and it's entirely too fussy, but it's so english, that just seems in character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"No time to talk now; off to read the next in the series. Wish I knew how to rate a book without reviewing it. almost gave it 5 stars, then remembered that smiling happily is not the same as a GREAT BOOK, the sort that you only read a few dozen of in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait 'til Thursday Next... read it now!!!","review":"Alternate world sci fi literary gag type writing... really nothing else like it I can think to compare to. But it works!!! The world is easy to buy into and doesn't waste too much time in description. It takes a little bit of literary knowledge to catch a lot of the puns and subtle humor. However, even without that, the story holds its own. Others have covered plot and storyline. I would just like to add my two cents and say that if you like to take chances and look into alternate worlds... you should really give this book a shot!!!All the best,Jay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously? A book-ridden 1970's?","review":"Yep, Jasper Fforde pulled it off! This is a strange, but known world. Jasper must have done his homework, because there are so many gems in this book that you could read it, then write a paper on ideas of who wrote the Shakesperean works. Or, it might make you want to read Jane Eyre. Even without the book references, it has great characters, relationships and odd mechanisms that are almost steampunk to keep anyone interested and turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"still one of my favorites.","review":"The first time I tried to read this book, -about 10 years ago- I couldn't get into it. The whole alternate 1985, literature crime sci find combo was lost on me. However, I held onto the book and gave it another try a few years later, and loved it. I followed it up either the sequels (some better than others) and after a few years had a hard time remembering what happened in which book. Thanks to a kindle deal I picked up the e book and gave it another read and again loved it. I still can see where the stumbling blocks are for me at the beginning of the book.it's one of those things where you just have to push through that first chapter and accept the strange to move forward. Also, ignore all the comparisons on the dust-jacket reviews, and just know that if you have a love of both British literature (Bronte) & sci-fi (time travel, world's where literary crimes are of so much import they have their own division), then you should read this book and will likely enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt at clever","review":"Unfortunetly the plot of the book did not start until midway into the book. The last 1/4 of the book was pretty decent; it was a clever idea for a novel yet somehow it didn't come out right. The acutal \\"Eyre Affair\\" wasnt as main a part of the book as you would expect. The first half of the book was slow paced background that had little pertience to the plot. To make the book better, Fforde should have expanded the Jane Eyre part of the novel and perhaps made Thursday Next's stay in Eyre-land longer with more episodes. I just was amazed that the title had little to do with the book. I expected more from this book because the unique plot line appealed to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am being generous...","review":"The premise is good, albeit unoriginal. A writer with a gift could turn this into a fun adventure, like the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, The Eyre Affair is written in an amateurish, cliche-ridden manner that dulls tbe effects of potentially creative plot. The villain, Acheron Hades, is so hopelessly Hollywood-like, he brings Batman's foes to memory. There's no complexity or interest to the main character, besides her amazing ability to be in the right place at the right time. Again, Harry Potter is deeper, funnier and all around more human and interesting than Thursday Next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I have seen this book recommended countless times for people who are looking for intelligent, witty humor.Huh? There is nothing intelligent, witty, or humorous to be found within these pages. The plot is too unbelievable (and this is coming from a reader that loves a good fantasy), the characters are black and white cartoons, and the wordplay is forced. I didn't laugh once, and I am not that difficult to amuse.If you think numerous references to British authors makes Jasper Fforde an intellectual, this may be the series for you. If you know better, and realize he is just a pretentious and untalented hack, you might want to look elsewhere for your reading pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncalculated Crassness","review":"Jasper Fforde set out to be a genre buster; he intended to show that a book that is undeniably genre fiction could also be intelligent. He litters the book with high minded literary references, Charles Dickens for example. While most of the references probably go over his reader's heads anyway, what they look like to someone who notices them is an attempt to look smart, nothing else. There is little purpose to his references.He also likes to use crass, and unnecessary puns like the character named \\"Jack Schitt\\" or \\"Thursday Next\\" the main character in the series. Obvious puns like this hurt his overall cause to make genre fiction intelligent and viable. He would have been better off leaving the crassness out of the final draft.Overall, it's a fairly quick, but irritating read by an author who is dying for you to think he's smarter than you. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I simply can't finish this book!","review":"My bookclub is reading this one. Most of the time I can finish a book, even if the topic doesn't interest me, but not this time. Realizing that I don't like mysteries nor sci-fi, I still thought I would like this book (having loved Jane Eyre), but I don't. Perhaps I read too closely, perhaps I was not in a fantasy mood, perhaps the book just isn't good. Whatever the reason, it is going into the box of books for the used book store and I am moving on to the next book on the list. If you like literary fantasy, sci-fi, and twisted names and plots, then you might like it. My disclaimer is: I have only read 137 pages, so it might be better in the second half......I will never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mental Gymnastics","review":"It takes some time to get fully into this book, but it is truly worth it! This is a book that requires some serious reader participation; you must really try to imagine things as much as you did with books when you were little.

I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classics-lover's treat!","review":"I picked up this book 1 1/2 years ago for the sole reason that the title referenced Jane Eyre, the beloved Charlotte Bronte classic. It took me some pages to get into the book, not having done any research on it before starting it. But after I adjusted, WOW! So fun and quirky! The wordplay is genius, made me laugh out loud several times.I had no idea this was the first in a series until I recently saw the rest of them displayed in the bookstore. More Thursday Next, yippee!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction, but lacks some info for beginners","review":"This DVD is a short, yet clear and informative, introduction to GMAW welding.

I was a bit disappointed to find that it didn't cover anything more than that, such as what a good weld looks like, what a bad weld looks like, technigues for avoiding errors, and so on. Unfortunately, such a DVD doesn't appear to exist anywhere and so trial-and-error appear to be your only instructor unless you're willing to pay to actually go to a welding school (which you should if you're looking to welding as an occupation)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and go to youtube for free !","review":"This DVD is a total waste of money.The DVD is well made, but the information and depth is not what would be expected from a beginers instructional Welding DVD.It offers nothing that you can not get for more and for free off the internet.In fact, the information on the web and youtube are superior to this DVD.Here is my tip for you:If you have not bought an auto darkening helmet yet, use the money you save from this DVD and buy the helmet by adding another $25.The Helmet will last longer and it will surely improve your welding.Something this DVD will not do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it","review":"After reading reviews I decided to give this book a try. Unfortunately I couldn't make it very far. This book was beyond boring and every time I picked it up it would put me to sleep. Maybe if I was able to push through the beginning of the book it would have gotten better but I just couldn't. Which is unusual for me because I try to finish all books that I start reading.I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arduous, uphill struggle","review":"The title refers to my attempts to get involved with this book, rather than the author's attempts to get on with her life in Tehran. This book was chosen by our book club and I started it with enthusiasm, wanting to learn more about that period of Iran's history. I found the book extraordinarily tedious to read, and failed to connect with any of the characters or the author herself. At times I felt as if I was reading a chunk of text lifted directly from an undergraduate's essay on whichever book the group was discussing at the time: this interrupted the narrative and ultimately became extremely irritating. A pity, because I feel the story of intelligent, educated women in Iran should be told and the premise of the book seemed to be the ideal way in which to tell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"Bought this for a friend. I had read it last year at a book club and my friend wanted to read it also after I told her about what happened to the women in Iran after the takeover. How difficult to give up all your freedoms, or be punished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading Lolita in Tehran","review":"Boring. Tough Read. If you need this book shipped quickly for a school assignment then this is a great option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I picked up this book because of all the great reviews it was getting. I previously read Bookseller of Kabul and wanted to read another book that was kind of like it. When I started reading it I thought maybe it would get better. I only made it up to page 70 and then gave up. This book is the most boring thing ever. It's like reading analytical essays that you would write for your English class. Azar Nafisi makes it sound like she should be pitied for what she's gone through. Other people in Iran have gone through much worse. What should be pitied is her writing style. Please lady, learn to engage your readers. I was greatly dissapointed. I do not reccomend this book. Read Bookseller of Kabul instead; anything but this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing!","review":"The Title is misleading. She spends so much time explaining how Nabokov writes, while I really wanted to know about the girls in her class, how they related to the books, their lives...what did they they think or feel, I waned to know about their lives at home! what do they do or think after the discussions! I didn't feel a connection with the people in the book! I felt as if I were a student in one of her classes. It's a very slow read. I think everybody rushed out and bought the book because of the title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad choice","review":"So I'm in Logan airport, trying to choose between this book and a biography of Joe Namath. I made the wrong choice. I HATED this book and was glad to see that I am not the only one. I have 20 pages left and didn't even bother to finish. I don't care about the author, any of her \\"girls\\" (how condescending to call grown women, some with children \\"girls\\") or the whole boring stream of consciousness writing style of the author. I ended up buying Hello and OK Magazine in the Frankfurt Airport and found reading about Tom and Katie's expected baby far more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Sleeping....","review":"While the book held the promise of a good look into a \\"foreign\\" culture it failed to deliver. I felt like I spent the whole book waiting for the main event. It had no spirit behind it but an un-impassioned woman who seemed to be writing about someone else's life and not her own. So disattached was she that I felt cold. One of the most boring books I have ever read... And I've read a great deal....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book -- read \\"Lolita\\" instead","review":"Although Nafisi claims to be a Nabokov scholar, she seems to have learned nothing from him. Like Nabokov, Nafisi was born into a privileged life which was turned upside down when her native country undergoes revolution. Nabokov tells us in his autobiography \\"Speak Memory\\" that his losses made it possible for him to have a richer, more meaningful life. Nafisi cannot stop whining about her losses, even though they are far less severe than Nabokov's. She is overwhelmed by self-pity and bitterness. She expresses contempt toward her less \\"sophisticated\\" countrymen and their vulnerablity to the appeal of the Ayatollah, but she fails to see the failures of her own economic and social class. I'd choose Nabokov over reading about Nabokov anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a memoir at all....","review":"I was expecting details about the authors life in post revolutionary Iran and insight into women's lives there. This is not a memoir its really more of a very long essay comparing disjointed aspects of life to a few books.It only made me want to find a copy of Lolita. It got very boring and I am sad to say I put it down and didn't want to go near it again.I agree with the other one and two star reviews that the book is short on insight into the personal relationships (which I craved) and gets repetitive. I only need to read the same comparison once or twice in the same chapter! She also keeps repeating that she isn't comparing Humbert with Iran...but isn't she?I suspect in our post 9/11 zeal to embrace insight into from Muslim culture this book was placed on a high pedestal it honestly did not deserve. Sad, as I am sure there are other more deserving authors out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrutiatingly Dull","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but the author failed to captivate me and keep me interested. She goes on and on, with seemingly little purpose or point, accounting her experiences and people she interacts with. I expected this to be about literature, but I was sorely disappointed and do not recommend this book. If you're after something about women in post-revolution Iran, I have to believe there are more compelling and interesting books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please","review":"I just can't believe all the hype about this book. This woman is not a good writer. Didn't anyone else get tired of hearing about what she was eating and drinking. And her elaborate descriptions didn't even help me keep the young women straight. I stuck with it because I really thought there was going to be something worthwhile that I got from it. I may try the ice cream with coffee and nuts on it. As for Iranian history, try Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis. It is beautiful and poignant. She doesn't eat any ice cream though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews first","review":"I could not get thru this book. It was like being at a book club discussion without having read the book. I wanted to know more about the characters at the book club. I probably should have guessed from the title that it would be all about Lolita and not really much about Tehran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I picked up this book out of curiosity and wasn't sure what to expect. It reads easily, but there is actually quite a bit going on in these pages. I was pleasantly surprised to get so much out of one book. Nafisi effortlessly weaves her personal history and that of her girls into the larger story of the revolution in Iran. Not knowing much at all about the Middle East, it was a huge help to have the larger cultural/historical landscape explained. As if these threads were not enough, Nafisi decides to weave in one more - the relationship between literature, the Iranian revolution, and the personal lives of the girls. Best of all, I got the itch to revisit many of the classics mentioned in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathe It In","review":"Reading Lolita in Tehran is one of the most beautifully written books I have read. Full of lines such as \\"Life in the Islamic Republic was as capricious as the month of April, when short periods of sunshine would suddenly give way to showers and storms.\\"Another one I liked is: \\"A novel is not an allegory... It is a sensual experience of another world. If you don't enter the world, hold your breath with the characters and become involved in their destiny, you won't be able to empathize, and empathy is the heart of a novel. This is how you read a novel: you inhale the experience. So start breathing.\\"She uses this logic with her own writing, drawing you in to revolutionary Iran. Deftly comparing and contrasting nightmarish, totalitarian scenes of the Islamic Republic's \`morality guards' that feel like something straight out of 1984 with scenes and analysis from novels as diverse asLolitaandThe Great Gatsby.A very enjoyable and one of a kind book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes!","review":"Reading the reviews, I was excited to start this book. I am disappointed to say that it was horrible. The author is one the most pretentious, condescending \\"teachers\\" I have ever come across. I think most people have said they \\"love\\" this book because they don't want to admit that they can't follow the memoir and her tirades on Nabokov and Fitzgerald's works. It's too bad. There really could have been something great here with the interesting premise. Great title, bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want a literature lecture? Buy this book.","review":"This author obviously knows her stuff. She's qualified and makes it a point to share her knowledge on her area of expertise.Unfortunately, there's a lot of rambling and repitition that is frankly unnecessary and unfortunate for a woman with such an amazing story to tell. She drones on and on about literary blah blah blah. But, she's a college professor so it's not entirely unexpected.I enjoyed her stories of Tehran and oppression in Iran. They were captivating, perhaps forced and often even a little over dramatic, but interesting nontheless. She captured the scene and draws the reader (me) into the situation with amazing detail.Still, I would not recommend this book unless you're interested in being lectured on literature. If you are, then you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" in Tucson","review":"This is an excerpt from the full review, which can be found on my blog:\\"If you look up \\"existential\\" in the dictionary, you'll find this book. Each character passes in and out of Nafisi's life, and she herself has a proclivity for blocking out the outside world. You can't even take for granted that each one of them exists somewhere in the world, doing marvelous things. You hope they are, because you've started to get attached to them. They're boldness, shyness, the things they say and the silences they keep draw you to them like a lost, lonely little dog looking for a kid to love. You want the best for them, but what if they don't exist? What if one of \\"them\\" has decided that, on her way home from school, she walked too seductively in her blackout robe and should be executed?

And I really wanted to like it. I generally enjoy reading and learning about life in the Middle East but this book just did not grab me.One problem was my fault - I haven't read all of the books she and her girls have and they played an important part of the story. But I also found the sequence of events confusing - it's not entirely chronological. I found Nafisi's writing style to be detached, almost arrogant and therefor I found myself not really caring what happened to her personally. I would have like to have known more about each individual girl in her reading circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money or shelf space","review":"i'm so glad to know i wasn't the only one that reacted so negatively to this book~ i too agree with the reviews below, i was so excited to purchase and read this book with all the accolades this author had been receiving, i was extremely disappointed to discover how absolutely BORING this book was. and the funny thing is, i tried (very hard!) to continue reading, hoping that maybe in the next chapters or pages the story would turn interesting, but it never did! if you're looking to read a book to follow a group of young women, hoping to escape the adversity of their country and find peace in the world of fictional novels, this is not the book to read. Reading Lolita critques various novels, but fails to connect to the characters of this book, resulting in reader confusion as to where the storyline is leading (so i'll tell you now, it leads nowhere). don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Subject, Poor Writing","review":"I made it 3/4 of the way through this book because the subject is so interesting. But I finally had to put it down. Too much literary analysis, too many characters to keep track of, too many timeline changes, and too much of the same stuff over and over. Ok, enough of the bombing, and your girls, and the Muslim extremists. A lot of this could have / should have been boiled down to make it a readable story. I can see that book clubs with time on their hands could use the classic references to dive into discussions about these books and their relationship to current times, but I just wanted a readable story about that time in Iran and how the circle of friends coped. A few literary analysis would have been ok, but it got to seem like she was showing off a bit and diverging from the story at hand..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel Infested missed a big part of the book","review":"The book is set in IRAN not Iraq, and Iranians are not Arabs, so by reading THIS book you would get a view into the Iranian world and NOT the Arab world.

She references other books ALOT - so I think she should have put out a pre-requisite list for readers BEFORE reading this book. Also, it was hard to keep the characters and the timelines straight. It was like pulling teeth to get through this book.

It contains a lot of disjointed literary criticism in additon to descriptions of the lives of the author and her women students in 1990's Iran. I found it boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate portrayal of Iran today","review":"The real reason for this book's popularity is that it confirms negative stereotypes. The fact is that Iranian women today are better educated than ever, and the author's personal experiences have nothing to do with modern Iran.So, I would have to agree with the views of Iranians expressed in Karl Vick's article of July 19, 2004 in the Washington Post (\\"Sorry, Wrong Chador\\") that this book has nothing to do with modern Iran, and that the author is pushing her personal grudges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erudite reading","review":"Our book club selected this book to read. It was slow, ponderous, and not about a book club. When I sold my copy to the local used book store, even the clerk groaned and said he liked the first few pages but after that, it was way too boring and slow for him. Although this may be fine for the serious student or scholar, it is not a book for the casual reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful premise, but too much literary theory...","review":"I usually read every book that I buy since I am an English instructor as well as a lifelong avid reader. However, this book was not engaging at all. I expected to glean a few insights on the nature of literature and how it enriches our lives and connects us as human beings, whether we are Muslim women in the Middle East living under extremist, fundamentalist religious governments, or whether we are people in the white bread, tree lined streets of the Midwest who live in relatively peaceful and stable circumstances. Instead there was too much revealing what the author herself knew about and was expert in, and it started to sound like the literary criticism class I took and dreaded in graduate school because the professor was so narcissistic.I choose books because they give me a look at how life works in other cultures, historical eras, and geographical locations, but this one, no matter what the setting, does not appeal to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVING TRAVEL TROUGH IRAN","review":"A BEAUTIFUL BOOK ON WOMAN'S CONDITIONS AND LIFE IN IRAN DURING THE REVOLUTION THROUGH THEIR READINGS...

Fundamentalists had seized control of the universities and morality squads staged arbitrary raids, so these women risked jail or worse if discovered. This story depicts the horror that affects every life as an oppressive regime closes in. Imagine: women enter a special gate at the university where they are physically examined; females are married at the age of nine; adultery and prostitution are punished by stoning to death; women, under law, have half the worth of men; two women, former cabinet ministers, are sentenced to death after the revolution. The book is also a celebration of the power of the literature to awaken and inspire resistance. Nafisi makes you want to read or reread all the books they discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Lolita in Tehran","review":"I can't say I didn't enjoy it. I did.

Being a woman in a book club and very interested in hearing what it has actually been like to live in an Islamic country, I was intrigued by Nafisi's story. However, I was extremely disappointed. The story wasn't told very well at all and the literary criticism dragged the storyline. I felt I never really got to know any of the girls in her book club, or her for that matter. Not the best book if you are looking for a true life account of the plight of women in Iran."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bestseller?","review":"I originally selected this book because it was on the bestseller list. However, I quickly learned that every book on the bestseller list is not a good book. Despite a compulsion to give each book that I choose to read a fair chance and to make a serious attempt to complete each one (even non-fiction books, which I believe are often very dense), I found it extremely difficult to work my way through this book. In addition to the author's repetitiveness, poor and/or irrelevant use of imagery, and under-development of the books \\"characters\\", the book seemed to be more of a homage to Nabokov than a memoir of exploring the liberating powers of literature in a hostile environment.

Okay, she has read all of these classics, but she spends so much of her book talking about male professors she does not like and male students she does not respect (because they do not share her feminist views). Why include all of this gossip about strangers? She offers little insight about the books themselves. I went away from this book feeling that the author had a big ego but did not really understand literature. She spends too much time on gimmicks, gossip and cream puffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing, but not very believeable","review":"I liked this book, to a certain extent. It's very interesting (eye-opening) to get a glimpse of Iran during during such turmoil - especially how difficult it was for a woman! But the author seems a bit more removed from the actual tension and violence than the reader is led to believe, in my humble opinion. Perhaps that's because she was at the university and therefore was somewhat sheltered. I mean, how could the local authorities not discover the ladies' meetings when the brother of one of Azar's friends always dropped off his sister with car brakes screeching. Surely that would draw attention to the group....right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable picture of Iranian society","review":"The book addresses political and social structure of Iranian society in an awfully biased way.

I am over half way through, after forcing myself to read it.Even if it completely redeems itself in the second half, I would not change my rating based on the abysmal ~200 pages I have read so far.Her writing is disjointed and her thinking is jumbled. Parts of the book are lectures on classic books, others are simply an enumeration of events that have happened in Iran.I have no idea why Reading Lolita got such a good rating.

It is more like a text or reference book, than it is a story of women bonding, or women that you get to intricately know and care about.This writer sounds like what she is, a teacher, and that is how it is written. The lines and quotes from literature in relation to the plight of the women do parralel, and true, the book makes some profound statements, and instills sympathy for the repressed women, but this is something we already know about, what with our own soldiers over there fighting to help them live better lives.I did not find this an enjoyable read and had trouble picking it up each time I had to, reading this for my Readers Group discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at life in Iran","review":"This narrative works on a lot of levels, autobiography, reflections on famous literary works. It works well in today's political climate and gives its readers a glimpse into how another society works. It is not a happy read, but then, if you approach some of the novels in the book, i.e. Lolita, The Great Gatsby, neither are they. The book's only problem is that unless you have read all of these works recently, you will not get the intrinsic value they have in Nafisi's work. She talks about these books in relation to her experience and I know I missed a lot, just by having read some of these novels eons ago. But, this is a solid narrative but a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was not what I expected. The description led me to believe that I would learn about the struggles and stories of a group of young women braving it in a book club in Iran.It's really a book full of literary commentary and criticism, which gives it a pretentious and distant feel. It's written almost like a reference book for a college Lit. class, lacking real emotion.The book is also difficult to follow, since Nafisi skips back and forth between time periods. I also had a tough time keeping track of the characters.Please don't be misled! I'm sure there are better ways to learn about the struggles people have endured in the Islamic Republic. If, however, you have read the critiqued books (Lolita, Gatsby, etc.) and are interested in Azar Nafisi's literary critiques...then it might be of interest to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Yes, Nafisi is bright. Her memoir has a few passages that offer insight into the lives of Iranians during a time of oppression and her discussion of literary works of Nabokov, Fitzgerald, and Austen are interesting. Unfortunately, she is also arrogant and humorless. Her book, for the most part, is a disjointed memoir filled with smug self-congratulations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"After all the rave reviews, I thought this would be an enjoyable read. In fact, for the first 70 pages or so, it was, a little. I liked the comparison of Humbert Humbert in Lolita and the ayatolla in Iran. Each attempted to make over their object -the child Lolita and the country Iran- to match their image of them. Each, to a greater or lesser degree, destroyed the object.The author tends to be pretty self-absorbed. Is it really possible that she is the hero in all her relationships? Toward the later part of the book, she acknowledges that she has a tendency to pontificate. Well, by then, this is not news.The experience of reading this book was very difficult. In fact, it became simply a chore to go from page to page. Finally, 60 or so pages from the end, I gave up. I decided that I deserve better than this.I'm glad that some people enjoyed it. Isn't it grand that we can disagree, and in public?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent idea--unimaginitive execution","review":"&#65279;What a promising idea! The plot of a group of women performing literary rebellion by reading banned western books under an oppressive regiime. It sounded like an enthralling read.Unfortunately, the author does not deliver. It becomes clear that the plot is a thin disguise for a reconstituted academic paper regarding the relevance of Nabokov in this culture. The charactersare not developed, and events are cursorily described. There is little opportunity to become engaged with this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"In need of serious editing","review":"I wanted so much to like this book. A book about life in Iran in the 1980s written by a woman, a literature professor, sounds fascinating. I was surprised to find that this book isn't very well written. Most of the dialogue and descriptions of the \\"girls\\" are just painful and the tone of the book is patronizing. I couldn't help wincing every time she used the term \\"my girls\\" and called her friend \\"my magician.\\"The academic analysis is repetitive and doesn't go very far (almost embarrassingly so), and, unfortunately, we don't learn that much about the author's students or other people around her. The discussions of James, Nabokov and Austen simply reminded me that I could be spending my time reading something much better and more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read about reading","review":"It is truely amazing the things we take for granted in the United States. This book is about how emotions and situations that occur in the great books of fiction litature are so interesting to those in Iran. The author teaches a group of students about western litature and at the same time liberates there minds from the confining circumstanes that they find themselves in Tehran. This book really opened my eyes as to the extremely challenging environment of living day to day in Tehran. Also, it shows how fortune we are in the west to have access to great works of literture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a disappointment","review":"The author eventually tells us that she hates writing but it shows in the disjointed narrative long before she reveals her preference for teaching. Her sense of loss when she loses her teaching position is obviously intense but very boring to read about after awhile. This is a book that does not live up to its reviews. I recomend that you not waste your money unless poorly written books on important topics are irresistable to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The ingredients I usually love were all there: a memoir + a focus on women + a discussion of books + insights into a fascinating country. Unfortunately, they failed to add up. Neither the diatribes on the authors nor the personal anecdotes were interesting. This has been done much better by much more skilled authors. Try \\"Honeymoon in Purdah\\", \\"To See and See Again\\" or \\"Nine Parts of Desire\\" for far more interesting, enjoyable books on Iran and Muslim women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. But I couldn't decide whether I was reading a bunch of reviews from a literature class, or if I was reading about Iran. It was frustrating and I wish it had focused on one or the other, since the mix was too inconsistent and irrelevant in most cases. I ended up skipping a ton of pages in the book. Overall I'd say it was \\"okay\\", and wish it had simply focused on Iran as the main topic. I suppose the approach was pretty original, but it just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but in need of organization and editing","review":"Just about everyone in my book club that read this book found it hard to get through, despite the fact we wanted to like it. Interesting material, of course, but it was all over the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tehran: the real Orwellian 1984 in 1984","review":"This terrific book by Azar Nafisi paints a nightmarish Orwellian portrait of modern Iran. During most of the era portrayed, a wrong word or glance threatening the political elite could literally get you killed. For a woman, showing too many strands of hair from under your shawl could get you tortured or killed. It's a revealing story of Iran from an insider's perspective. There's a stark beauty in the paradox of Nafisi teaching great Western literature to sheltered young Islamic women in the midst of a brutal far-right political regime.I listened to Reading Lolita in Tehran unabridged on audio narrated by Lisette Lecat. Lecat does a terrific job capturing the constant tension of Nafisi's world. Her strong voice and wonderful English accent make her narration compelling and captivating.My rating of 4 stars reflects a very interesting and engaging narrative (5 stars) that sometimes lacks cohesion (minus 1 star), leaping abruptly across years, moods and events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Another Book","review":"Life is too short. This is a very disappointing, fragmented, dry read. The author tries so very, very hard to impress the reader with her intelect, always reaching for connections, and ultimately failing. Not one of the six women in our book club liked this book. We picked up our books in egar anticipation but our collective opinion at our meeting was that we felt \\"ripped off\\". Do yourself a favor -- choose another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I really really wanted to like this book...I even read half the book in the hope that it would improve...but I just couldn't stand it.The book starts out about about a weekly book club that meets in Iran to discuss western novels. It's a great subject but the author doesn't take it anywhere. She spends pages discussing Lolita like the english professor she is, but not enough on the people in Iran, or even those in her bookclub... I wanted to blare out, please move on! Please stop talking about lolita, I can buy Lolita and read if I wanted myself, I read about about \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\", not \\"The True Meaning of Lolita\\". And what the heck happend to her bookclub? The club appears in the beginning and then vanishes...The title should be changed to \\"Much You Do About An English Professor in Iran\\"..Just my two cents..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had high hopes","review":"This book sounded REALLY intriguing, but I just couldn't get through it! I hope others have better success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self congratulatory drivel","review":"At the end of the day, this book was more about telling the reader how wonderful the author is than how beleaguered the women of Tehran are. The author was so self-conscious that it overwhelmed the subject matter. I found this book a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats Me","review":"I don't understand the success of \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\". I thought it so boring at times. I hated the Nafisi 's lectures on Henry James etc. Nafisi made great writers sound deadly. I wish that Azar Nafisi had spent more time on her students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I selected this book as my pick for my book clubs November read. Only one person of twelve could even stay interested enough to complete the book. The author is just really boring and hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Author loves to drone on and on.....","review":"I was so bored with this book that I ended up not finishing it. It's a shame because I love reading about other cultures and was very intrigued by the concept of this book.Unfortunately, the book is very unpleasant to read. First of all, the author is rather cold and emotionless, the book reads like a textbook; secondly, the prose is not pretty and does not flow well, again, reads like a boring old textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz....","review":"I found this book to be very difficult to read, and more about the literature than about the lives of the women involved. The overblown prose and flowery language were difficult to decipher, and I fought to stay awake more than once. I had trouble finishing it, and never reached the point where the effort paid off in lessons learned or insights gained."},{"rating":"2","title":"cinsandiego","review":"I loved this book, although I started it three times (over a period of two years) before becoming thoroughly engaged. After that, I looked forward to getting back to it every day and made sure to set aside a time and place to enjoy it, without interruption, as it took my full focus. I read the book first, then listened to it on cd's (narrated beautifully by Lisette Lecat). After sixty years of loving books, this one ranks among my favorites and I will enjoy rereading it many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Women of Iran","review":"This is an extremely important book because it gives the women of Iran a voice, and one that has been heard around the world. This book is many things: a discussion of English literature, a memoir, a history of the last 30 years in Iran, and more. It is especially worthwhile for those interested in women's issues, Iran, and literature. Just a word of warning--for those not familiar with the writings of Jane Austen, Nabokov, Henry James, or Fitzgerald--parts of this book may not make much sense. May there be freedom and democracy one day in Iran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"It has been a while since I read this but I felt obligated to rate it.I read this book to assist me to better understand womens views on Iran. This book assisted me in so many ways. it was a true treasure to find. I recommends this book to anybody who is vaguely interested in other walks of like outside of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much in this book","review":"This is a fabulous book. There are so many ways to look at it and so much you can take from it.I particularly enjoyed the analysis of books from the perspective of women who are in a very controlled environment. Books were the only out these women had and the passion that is underlying the descriptions is evident and touching. The way they talked of books and saw the authors or stories was beautiful. It gave me an entirely new perspective and appreciation of things I found ordinary.Truly beautiful"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I'm sorry to have to title my review as such. I wanted to read this book for quite some time. I had expected to read about the struggles of educated Iranian women in an oppressive regime. Instead I was subjected to the pompous ramblings of an English professor. I don't mean this to sound like an insult, but she writes like an English professor - trying to sound educated but not actually relaying a good story.I hate to not complete a book, but at page 42 I just cut my losses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow, boring read","review":"I was very excited to read this book after all of the rave reviews it had received. I was under the false impression that it would introduce the readers to women they could connect to, struggling against the norm for the sake of intellectual curiosity; I was instead lost in a dull, monotonous tome where the characters were so poorly developed I couldn't even distinguish between them, let alone care about them. I struggled through the entire book (almost giving up multiple times) always hoping that it would get better, but unfortunately it never did. I do not recommend this book at all - in fact, I truly believe it is the worst book I have read in decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally Gave Up","review":"I slogged faithfully through this...it has been praised from there to here and everywhere, after all...but towards the end I laid it down & I just couldn't finish it. And that is a rarity for me.I think the book lacks a true FOCUS. Perhaps the author is a good writer, perhaps the subject seems interesting, but somehow it never seemed to come together. And I am disappointed because I really wanted to like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of literary crap","review":"im only giving this one star because I cant give 0. The book doesnt reel you in like you'd expect. Nafisi writes so pretentiously that you want to slap her and the droning on about Nabakov is unreal. None of it really brings together a great STORY. Its just a bunch of rambling, and i honestly got a headache reading it. I am one of those people who can read long books, i have no problem with that, but this was brutally boring and just pointless.Also, i have heard many people in reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere that claim many of the books were not banned in Iran and it doesnt make the book much better in my eyes.If you would like to read a book about a Islamic society, well written with enchanting characters, read THE KITE RUNNER."},{"rating":"1","title":"No! don't do it!","review":"I tried really hard. I read past half the book and I tried, but no it did not catch my interest. I kept thinking it was going to get better, that i was getting to the good part, but no. I wanted to know more about the women in the story. I hung in there just to find out, but nothing. It is the book reviews of book reviews and I wasn't even getting college credits. NO entertainment. Acctually if a professor made her class read this she would most probably want them to hate reading. It was given to me by a friend and I told her how I felt and she felt the same! Don't do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for everyone...","review":"It is not that I disliked the book as much as it did not meet my expectations. This is NOT a book about a book club, which is what my book club wanted. I belong to a book club for mom's-- none of us had the kind of time it required to get through the books in six weeks' time.... and we are a group of women who happens to often read two books in that same timeframe.This is also not a book for the casual reader, as I am. I have not read, nor will ever have the time to read, all of the books that the author discusses in her book. Her \\"book reports\\" within her novel are distracting, confusing, and tedious. I was excited initially to learn more about a new culture, as I know very little about Iran, and the struggles of its women. I am not sure I feel more enlightened after having read the book.I would recommend this book to those with the time, background, and love of classic literature. Other than that, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious","review":"Academics who have written a few papers for conferences sometimes think they can write for a general audience and believe that anything they say will be of interest. Sadly, this book is one of those. Being pretentious, it has two strikes against it from the start. While there are some interesting observations along the way, the book is slow, generally dull, and often rambles. A good memoir needs more life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after getting half way through!!! Very dissappointing.","review":"I thought this was going to be dangerous, and scandalous. I thought that I was going to be reading about a group of women who defy society and the law. I got halfway through and still hadn't come to that part and against my usual practice, I decided that I had wasted enough of my time getting to the guts of this one. Most of it is about a university class dissecting the Great Gastby and the over indulgences of Western Society. I thought that I was going to get a great \\"sisterhood\\" book and be inspired by women that stand up for what they believe, I felt very let down. This book lacks passion for anything, life, love, friendship, students, and freedom. This book is very flat and did not inspire any response from me at all. I was disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know what everyone is raving about...","review":"The author must have used every 3+ syllable word in her vocabulary. No, it's not that I couldn't understand her, it was just pretentious and hollow. Come on, taking a whole paragraph to describe getting out of the shower?!? I could have done without all the flowery language and it would have been a better book. It dragged a lot in some places, too. I think if she left out all the inane descriptions and exaggerated language, it would have been about 50 pages shorter. Her intentions were good. The stories to tell were interesting but her style of writing was too phony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"This book is like reading a text book. It is rare that I don't finish a book, but I just couldn't do it with this one. Can't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bit skiewed...","review":"Basically, this is an extremely exagerated portrayal of Iran and the middle east, and it only furthers false stereotypes such as \\"the suppressed middle eastern woman\\" or the \\"the sexually aggressive muslim man.\\" Both of these ideas are false, and I would know because my mother is an iranian woman who has gone back to visit her hometown Shiraz many times in the past years, only to find that she manages to enjoy herself in this oppressive society. I myself have visited iran twice, and I recall seeing and meeting many many happy women while I was there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus On The Story","review":"Nafisi has a wonderful concept: writing about a group of women who are so desirous to learn, that they literally risk their lives to do so. The shortcoming of this book is that the writer is more interested in conveying her opinions of the lessons she gives than in relaying the stories of her students. Nafisi can't resist lecturing the reader. Quite frankly, I couldn't care less what she thinks about Nabokov. Apparently, Nafisi is more interested in her own apparent insights than any risks her students take or any wisdom them might have. Her ego is too prominent in what might otherwise have been an inspiring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt offer any new insight","review":"There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Islamic Republic of Iran is an oppressive regime. Not only is Reading Lolita in Tehran a 200 page rambling essay that tells us nothing we did not know, it also makes the ridiculous suggestion that the only way girls in Iran can escape from this oppression is by reading western literature because only (male) western writers can truely express what an iranian woman feels. Don't waste your time with this book. If you are looking to learn about Iran and the reformist movement at the turn of the millenium read \\"Searching for Hassan\\" by Terence Ward."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was so pretentious","review":"Normally I love reading about Iran and I love Iranian movies, but I couldn't finish this. Jane Austin is nauseating anyway..then to have it disected by Iranian college girls is awful. I just found this very elitist."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"yo I read this for a class on iranian authors and it sucks. its very girly and hard to follow. also you have to have read gatsby, lolita and others to have a clue as to what shes talking about. if you like wordy girly stories about nothing and incoherent, non linear story telling this is for you.along the same lines read persepolis or the bathhouse - both are much better and actually have more insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply, not true.................","review":"What more can you expect from a person who doesn't even believe in GOD? I have been to Iran on a one month trip, and to the school she's talking about in her book, since I am an English Professor, and have found that she has made all this up.I'm very disappointed to see such great imagination used in such a disgusting way, in order to step on her own country, with her own feet!Just like Jesus, I can only pray that GOD forgives her.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection for anyone who loves literature","review":"I just finished \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" which I have been engrossed in for several days. My first reaction is sadness that I have finished it. My second is to start reading all those canonical authors that I have managed to neglect over the years.This is a beautifully written book about literature and the transforming effect it can have on people's lives, even in extremely dire circumstances (such as in Iran for the past 20 years). It's also the story of several thoughtful, feeling, fully unique individuals who have lived through and coped with experiences most of us can barely contemplate. I am floored by the author's command of language and ideas. I have already recommended it to several people.Were I ever to meet the author, I would thank her for writing this story, and giving life to the lives she has chronicled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity,","review":"Although I picked up this book hoping to gain insight into the plight of intellectual women in Iran, I was distracted by the overall lack of cohesion in this book. The point of Nafisi's book becomes buried in literary anaylsis and disconnected narrative. She intends to use Lolita as a metaphor for Iranian society's oppression toward it citizens and women in particular, but instead of letting the metaphor emerge on its own, she drills it into us through pages and pages in ecstacy of Nobokov.Nafisi seems unaware that the strength of her novel should come from the stories of her students, not from her own ponderous pontification. She has an evocative style of writing that would have been well suited to illuminating a world to which we as readers would not otherwise have access, but her prose is wasted on novels that we can read on our own and draw our own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The spirit of Aloha","review":"We saw Chris in summer '02 at the Broiler on Waikiki.

I do however disagree with Dr. Drew in saying the 'day after pill' is 'birth control'. When you take this pill, you could possibly be murdering an innocent child; this pill takes the guilt and responsibility away but knowledgeable people educate themselves on such matters. Oops, most physicians still call a baby a 'fetus'. If you take the pill the day after, why are you really taking it...to prevent a pregnancy or to get rid of one that possibly is? It's bad news all the way around. Certainly, Moms and Dads will stand before God and explain to Him your decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does MTV suck so much??","review":"Come on, this doesn't even have anything remotely to do with MUSIC- what's it doing on MTV?

Marisa is an imitator, she has the voice and the manners but not much more... She doesn't sing the Fado... Brrrr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh!","review":"Mariza has the \\"balls\\" but not the soul. Amalia Rodrigues was not only the Queen of Fado but one of the greatest singers ever. Mariza is not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opposition","review":"Sorry everyone, I do not see a connection to Amália other than singing Fado. It would be like comparing Acqua to Rickie Lee Jones just because they sung Pop music in times. Mariza has her own space and style and though the comparison should make her proud, it does not fit. Mariza inspires the Listener even without knowing a single word of portuguese - and that she has in common with Amália, but she does it in her own way. Maybe her african roots help her, maybe the inner voice is more \\"real\\", maybe it's just something personal, but reality is that she does sound unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Fado CDs I have ever heard","review":"This was one of my favourite CDs of 2002, and certainly one of the best Fado CDs in recent memory. Mariza's voice is spectacular, and this production is immaculate. I was captivated from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"She moves to tears!","review":"When I saw Mariza perform live on Mountain Stage, (Charleston, WV), I was virtually mezmerized! I do not speak Portugese, but I did not need to. The fado touches the soul, and Mariza IS fado! I had to have the CD, and each time I listen to it, I'm amazed with her range and her movement through the pitch of each note."},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice of a goddess","review":"Mariza molds her talented and beautiful voice, interpreting with finesse the soul music of Portugal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariza's Albums","review":"I saw Mariza last year. It was a performance of a lifetime. Her rendition of Primavera is far superior to any other including my all time favorite by Amalia (Rodrigues, that is). My CDs, I have all of hers, are almost worn from playing them. I hope she releases another CD soon. Oh, yes I am going to purchase the European release of the Greece Olympic Games, apparently the song she has on that album is pure fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vibration of Beauty","review":"I have had the great pleasure of listening to Fado since I was a child. Mariza's voice is pure emotion and beauty. I have always felt that Fado was more than just music, it's a feeling of love that can soothe the atmosphere as far as it's sound can reach. To me, Mariza has the power to channel this feeling of Fado to a level of beauty that has pierced my soul. It leaves you longing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Fado since Amalia Rodriguez","review":"Without any doubt, Mariza has a great voice in the tradition of Amalia Rodriguez. A super recording and a \\"must-have\\" CD for those who appreciate excellent singing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She sings her soul out","review":"I consider that Mariza has a very personal style to sing fado. She has a great voice and her songs display a wide range of vivid emotions.This is the kind of CD I enjoy by myself with a cup of coffee at the end of the day.If you enjoy fado, I would also recommend you to get CDs of Cristina Branco, Misia, and of course, Amalia R."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Amalia","review":"Mariza has a voice that will touch your soul. If you have never heard fado you will be enchanted by the voice of this artist. She has a depth in all range of keys and sings from the heart.

The people who gave a 1 had a reason, because they are more experienced and know more than you. One cannot sustain a 20% plus monthly return, or you ll be among the richest people on earth. I personally sweared by SMM and WSMM back in June and July, when I first started trading options and had some initial success like some of you. I got wiped out by September.

You can take my advice or leave it, it's up to you, but I'm telling you anything you buy from Wade Cook is a total waste of your money. Every book, seminar, or course he sells has one motive in mind, to get you to buy more and more Cook products. There are lots of excellent books available on investing and trading from people who actually made their fortunes trading, not by selling seminars and books like Mr. Cook. I notice one of the reviews said \\" Mr. Cook realizes most people read on a 9th grade level, so he keeps is simple.\\" I've got some serious news for you my friend, if you can do no better than a 9th grade reading level, and you think you're going to learn to trade the markets, you are sadly mistaken.

Read books by investors with PROVEN track records like William O'neil and Peter Lynch. The trades Cook has disclosed don't tell the full story of his stock and option market dealings. I'd like to see what his trading account started out at and where it is today. This would show what his TRUE annual rate of return has been and not the claims he prints which could possibly mislead thousands of investor's into thinking they'll be better investor's than Warren Buffett. If Wade is such a savvy investor, then he wouldn't need to charge $4000+ for seminars to \\"show investors the light\\".

I would recommend Wall Street 101 if you want a really good basic manual on how to invest. The author, Frank Saunders, systematically walks the new investor through all the steps to follow and gives the reader everything he needs to do to realize excellent returns in the market.

It was basically a \\"re-hash\\" of ideas and concepts mentioned in the first book, WSMM, except I feel that the \\"advertisements\\" for the seminars and products are much more prevalent in this book. The only miracle that did occur was that I actually \\"won\\" the book at Cook's free seminar, so I did save a few bucks.

In the process, they've managed to revive the guitar solo from its post-rock dotage (credited to Steve Stevens), unconsciously echo the obscure 60s group Carmen (the last folks who tried to crossover Flamenco), and display a sort of lowbrow wit in their placement of gunshot samples and sexy Spanish rantings amid a recurrent \\"I *hate* robbing banks\\" refrain.

This CD shows and proves that this girl still has what it takes. Great vocals and a nice mix of uptempo songs and ballads! There are a few songs on here that just don't seem to fit on here but the rest makes up for those.Standout tracks on here are: \\"Mr. Cool\\" (a fun upbeat song), \\"On My Way\\", \\"Still\\" (a good slower song). The BEST song on here is the slow, ballad: \\"Tomorrow\\" - Tamia's vocals are on point with this track. It is such a good song.For any Tamia fan: You should own this. For anyone who is looking to explore good R&B; mixed with a bit of hip-hop this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"As an older listener, much of this CD was not to my taste. I really need to give it another go round to realize more positives. It took me forever to realize that the best cut from Nu Day was \\"Tell Me Who\\"; it just hit me one day. I had been drawn to that CD by the wonderful single \\"Stranger in My House\\". The early cuts on the current CD remind me very much of other R&B singers in Tamia's age range. It was a bit of a turn-off. There were no songs to match \\"Tell Me Who\\" or \\"Stranger\\". However, the duet between Tamia & Levert knocked my socks off. Were they ever in synch! Then, when I reached \\"Tomorrow\\", I realized that my money was well spent. It made the wait very much worthwhile. Just listen to this young woman's voice! A phenomenal talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back girl!!","review":"This cd totally rocks, I would recommend this to anyone who is a Tamia fan.This cd shows her talents on so many different levels.There aren't many cd's that i can listen top over and over but when i got this one i listened to it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still.....I have Questions...","review":"This album is a great R&B album. Tamia is yet another Canaidian Diva that has found little success off of the dance floor, and its a shame. This girl can sing, and no not in a Mariah Carey way. She doesn't over do you with oversinging notes, she does it by feeling the lyrics and hitting the notes perfectly when she goes for them. \\"Still\\", is a great track, \\"Questions\\" is awsome, although for me, the standout is her ballad \\"Officially Missing You\\", one of the best ballads probably since she herself released \\"Stranger In My House\\". If your a fan of Deborah Cox, please give Tamia a listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EW EW EW EW","review":"This cd reminds me of ashanti, being a mix of annoyingness and a bad voice.

Tamia, do youself and society a favour and stop singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocals are on point, but album leaves you wanting MORE","review":"Tamia is an artist that is overshadowed by other female singers, like Beyonce, Ashanti, and Alicia Keys. Tamia, perhaps best known for singing the hook on Fabolous's hit single or for singing 3 songs has the opening act on the Ladies First Tour, needs to be way more popular for her vocal ability. She can sing better or equal to those previously mentioned. Her album is good, but after song 15, which she tears up, leaves you wanting more of her amazing sounds. Stand out tracks: 1,2,6,13. Number 7 is a song that is way to short. At first you are groovin' to and then it cuts off. If you are lookin' for an album with a mixture of ballads and club bangers, then you should get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD - Tamia has done it again!!!!!","review":"I was skeptical about purchasing this cd at first, but I am truly happy that I did. Not only do I enjoy the cd, but my significant other as well and that's rare. It keeps your attention with the club tracks MORE and MR. COOL; and the sensual ballads like STILL, WHISPERS, AND WHY ASK WHY. I think the cd is a must have in your collection!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More......That's Right!!!","review":"To relax after a long day at work or to get the party started before you hit the club, this CD is all encompassing. I have been waiting for Tamia to make this transition and give her music to everybody and this time SHE HAS. Her beautiful, melodic voice dictates that she can cross these boundaries with ease and she has done it....WELL. Go pick this-up you will NOT be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST Perfect","review":"Tamia is undoubtedly one of the most overlooked talents in RnB music. Her music is almost at par with artists like Beyonce and Alicia Keys. Her anjelic voice is pure and strong. On her third LP, Tamia gives her fans a good balance that her past two albums were missing. There is a nice finished fealing that sticks with you after the album is over. However, there really are now powerhouse anthems like \\"A Nu Day\\"s \\"Stranger in My House\\". And songs like \\"On My Way\\" and \\"I'm Your's Lately\\" get old because you feel like she is trying to be something she isn't. She shines more on ballads like \\"Officially Missing You\\" and the Babyface produced, \\"Smile\\". Overall Tamia does a good job entertaining with only a few \\"filler\\" songs. So don't sleep on \\"More\\", get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamia can blow!!","review":"Damita Jo is supposed to be the thing right now. I Want U I didn't want that though. Tamia got my attention. 1 Smile Babyface did it again! 2 Poetry 3 Questions 4 Why Ask Why 5 Still 6 Whispers are all 1st runners up worthy of going platinum. 7 Officially missing you 8 Mr. Cool 9 More 9 On my Way 10 So Into you 11 Tomorrow . If you just like sex songs and slow jams from females cop that Janet, and Beyonce They are good too but lack the strong lyrics and vocals Tamia's hitting you with."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost thought I was listening to Syreeta","review":"I bought this album the day it was released. I did not know who the artist was, but the cover sucked me in. I put it on in my car and my jaw dropped.I swear, I felt like I was listening to syreeta. Tamia has that same ultra sexy, girls voice. No real grit or rasp, just angelic.All my people out there that can remember what it was like(or still is like) to listen to syreeta should cop this album now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've been much better...","review":"After anxiously anticipating the release of this CD, I was dismayed at the lack of quality music on More. I love Tamia, her voice is excellent, one of my absolute favorites, but this CD is replete with Bubblegum Music; rappers, cameos from has-been artists, and a terrible remake of a classic Tamia favorite (So Into You). Though I loved Officially Missing You, I don't understand the tease about the Officially Missing Bonus Tracks. The first and second CDs were definitely 5 stars, but this CD is lacking from start to finish; maybe 3 songs worth putting on repeat, all others could be skipped without missing anything. Though it took a really long time to get this album out, I would have gladly waited another year for something worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting For More!!","review":"I feel cheated that Tamia album is just a filler. I thought this album was called Still, and what happen to the album cover isn't that a clip from Fabulous video. Why does this album only have about three songs worth listen 2? How could she agree to release some trash like this. I'm sorry but this is trash just like Mario Winans cd(but I do like Mr Cool).I Still waiting for more. I recommend her first 2 release (Tamia and A Nu Day)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIce CD But...","review":"Tamia's 'More' doesn't really blow me away. While she is a great singer, Tamia has yet to create an identity of her own, and she is often confused with other talents like Debrorah Cox. There are a few good tracks like 'Officially Missing You', 'Still', 'Questions', 'Whispers', 'Into You', and the outstanding duet with Gerald Levert, 'They Long To Be Close To You', which was originally from his recent CD.Now, if the CD had everything advertised, I'd give it 4 stars, but Elektra failed to include 2 Bonus Remixes they promised. My copy of this CD only has 14 tracks, while the 2 bonus mixes aren't included. This cost the CD 2 stars, and if they wonder why we burn so many CDs, this is a reason why. The companies always give American customers inferior CDs (compared to the international buyers, who often get bonus tracks, etc!). I like Tamia's new CD, but Elektra can kiss my *ss!Peace, SD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this was immensely boring.

They had come to feel like family. Catherine Anderson has a true gift - she can create deep emotion better than most other romance genre authors. Her plots are compelling and tender. If there is a quirk, it is that the hero was seemingly without flaw in his pursuit of his lady. He moved heaven and earth to woo her, but all that selflessness was just a tad unbelieveable. However, we can all use an uplifting fairy tale now and then. This is escapism at its finest. Keep 'em coming Catherine - you have a very devoted fan in me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"I read all the time, so anymore if the plot is weak, I throw the book away and move on to my next adventure.

I was not 40 pages into the book, when I realized that Ryan (The main male character) was perfect. I mean he was rich, handsome, and the most understanding male on the whole planet. Ms Anderson seem to make light of the fact that Bethany(main female character) was in a wheelchair. We didn't see any deep emotions either of the two characters. In fact, at on point I did stop reading the book and the only reason that I went back to it, was I paid 6.99 for it. If you are a fan of Ms. Anderson you will like, but if you are looking read emotions, go else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"phantom waltz","review":"excellent book.

There are always going to be opposing views, and if you are looking to pick apart something and be skeptical, then certainly the message will not resonate within you as positive. I have the DVD and the book and I think both of them are great. I understand that this message is nothing new, but the way it's presented, has allowed me to fully understand and put the tools together for use in my daily life. The book is beautiful and the materials used are quality. I keep it by my bedside and pick it up to read a chapter here and there, just to refresh my mind with positive thoughts. I do recommend reading The Secret!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NO SECRET","review":"The idea of If you want to know where you are going, look at where your thoughts are already exist in the #1 best seller of all times - The Bible. The ideas in The Secret focus on materialism and abundance. It is sad to manipulate people searching for the missing link in their life with this. You may feel better and aquire more for a while because you change your perspective on life. In the end that void will still be left empty without God.

Since none of the material is young enough to be copyrighted she gets away with it. However there are dozens of books basically saying the same thing. There is nothing different here except a nice looking cover and a decent presentation of the basic thoughts.I suggest you find an indepth class elsewhere with a cohesive philosopy behind it.

Now that fact on its own is not bad (several self-help books really do help people live better lives) but the content in this book presents -- what I believe to be an incorrect(even destructive) way to look at life. It suggest you always look to what you want to become in the future, and that by doing this you will create your future. But in reality only one person can win the gold medal, and if you spend all your time focusing on it, not only will not be able to enjoy the moments leading up to it, but if you do not win it all that anticipation will destroy you inside.

It did not take into consideration the actions of others, the environment, choice, etc. It read as though one should be able to wish things into being instead of working hard and making good choices and forging the plan and path to achieve one's goals. Because I have read so much about these topics, I understood the underlying meaning of The Secret, but this book did a disservice to the subject of the Law of Attraction in my opinion.

When the foundation is already there, attitude is important. A talented, hard-working person with a positive attitude is more likely to succeed than a similar person with a self-defeatist attitude. But, unfortunately, just wanting something very badly is not a shortcut to getting it - it's not a substitute for talent and hard work. There are no shortcuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"It isn't for everyone although it should be","review":"someone suggested that I read this book.

I decided to change my mindset which wasn't really that hard. who wants to stress all day. any who a few days later I get an email from a company I've been applying to for over a year now. they want me to come in for an interview. that right there made me a believer.

You just have to believe that you can win the lotto and it'll happen, basically that's the point of this idiotic book. I'm going to let you in a little secret, THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE!

The author seems to confuse a huckster New Age theme with the actual law of magnetism which states like poles repel and opposite poles attract. This is the actual 'science' that justifies The Laws of Attraction? The Laws of Attraction is obviously the opposite - positive manifests positive - good things happen to good people.Anyone starving in Africa, living in the terrible conditions of refugee camps, or living in the dangerous conditions of American public housing - are negative people that created their own condition. Beautiful happy people are positive, good people, that deserve their beach house and adoring successful friends.

My girlfriend suggested The secret. I sat in the bookstore and spent a couple hours reading it. I'm still wondering what the big SECRET is, as if I had missed something crucial. I wonder like many desperate readers, \\"am I too thick-headed to buy into this \\"law of attraction\\" as a cure-all device for the needy?\\" Am I too pessimestic that I cannot fully quench the message to make success my reality?I was quite unsatisfied and confused after reading the Secret. Positive thinking should be a state of mind that bolsters our confidence in times of doubt and crisis, not a scheme to arbitrarily take and expect the riches that are not due. This book is hokum and doesn't articulate it's message but rather reiterates it in various phrases. I am dissappointed to say it is a book promoting false hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT a Secret and it's nothing new!","review":"1. The concept (Law of attraction) is not new. Among many others, Yogananda expounds it in his \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" written in 1946.2. There are contradictions by the self-professed \\"experts.\\" One says the best way to make your wishes come true is to write them down. Another says the \\"secret\\" cannot be expressed in words. Another contradiction is that the film claims the \\"secret\\" was kept from the masses by those in the know. It then quotes Henry Ford's famous saying, \\"Think you can, think you can't. Either way, you're right.\\" So much for keeping \\"it\\" secret.3. Except for Jack Kornfield, most of the \\"experts\\" are simply huge egos.

Apart from that, though, it's a complete waste of time. Most of the \\"secrets\\" in the book are just recycled New Age nonsense, its claims to antiquity and supposed links to secret societies are purely fictional, and its primary appeal is to greed rather than well being. The \\"Law of Attraction\\" is simple: Work toward what you want and you might get it. Sadly, this book encourages readers to simply want what they want, which is -- at best -- very poor advice.A related observation: Any time someone claims to have realized a great truth after hitting rock bottom in their own lives, their \\"self-improvement\\" tips are bound to be either obvious to anyone with common sense or dubious to the highest degree. This book's advice falls primarily into the second category, with smatterings of the first.

I give the credit to God for blessing us with the gifts we have inside and a mind willing to allow good in.Many say The Secret is not a new concept.

The Secret is not new, it is also known as the law of attraction, and you will find many books on the subject; however, I must state that Ms. Byrne's style is what is making this book do so well, not specifically the subject matter, but how she wrote it. So, yes, if you have already read/learned about the law of attraction from someone or someplace else, then this is not the book for you.

It will, if anything else, open your mind to new possibilities and give most people hope where it never existed before.More in the lines of a story, you MUST read the book \\"Her Name Will Be Miracle\\". It follows alot of the practices mentioned in this book \\"The Secret\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks energy","review":"Basically there is very little of Rhonda, or her experience, in this book.

The Secret is also the worst DVD/television programme ever made. It is worse than lowest common denominator - It is Divide by Zero error.What is the secret ? - there is no secret.It is all fluff and filler and no facts.The TV show is 2 hours of nothing to break up the commercials.If you like to be handed everything on a plate very slowly, and then get to the end and find out it was all building towards nothing then you are going to love this.The production values are slick, but the message is empty and trivial to the point of non-existance.Your life is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed concept","review":"How can you respect a book that posits thinking of things so that you attract them as a \\"secret\\" when it uses an untrue and unscientific analogy?Opposites attract and likes repel.

In fact, the DVD tells people to think of the universe as a \\"genie\\" and you can just make a wish and believe, and you will eventually get your wish! It even tells people that you can substitute that energy/universe/genie for God if that is how you choose to think about it.Whoa!

Everyone that I know that has read this book and followed its advice has become very rude, greedy, selfish, conceded, and basicly arrogant that they are superior than people that actually work and earn their living. As an example, my mother started to take its advice and now she is rude, cruel, heartless, greedy, and only cares and thinks about herself(also her friend is like this now).

Oh, and here's The Secret -- if you think good thoughts, good things will happen to you. Okay, I actually do believe in positive thinking, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that we're going to win the lottery just because we keep having thoughts about this happening.

As I read it, phrases echoing with what I was taught from the Bible as a child, and try to live as an adult, resonated along my nerve endings. Reading this book reminded me of the power of personal faith and positive thinking. It reminds me to ask with the faith (knowing) that I will receive. It reminds me to walk in the spirit.This past Christmas, I gave a few people \\"the secret\\" to a happy, productive, and prosperous life. What makes this book and others like it so special is their power to lead us back to the Word. It is a concrete step-by-step guide to activating our lifelines to God (\\"the universe\\").

The information is so important and life changing, it takes time to absorb and implement it's message.It is not always easy to keep your thoughts focused on what you do want instead of what you don't want, but the results of doing so can and will change your life. By envisioning the future you desire and feeling the good feelings that come with that, you start creating the life you have always wanted.This book is for everyone but can be especially helpful to people who are going through a difficult time such as divorce,depression,loss, ect.Afterdiscovering \\"The Secret\\" you spirits will be lifted and you will feel more in control of your destiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was upset by the King interview","review":"Larry King did an interview with one of the people instrumental in \\"The Secret\\" project.

Personally, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"This book is extremely overrated! I mean, come on Ms. Byrne, it's no secret that the power of positive thinking can do wonders for all of us. If we wish hard enough, will we ultimately get what we desire most in life? NO! It takes more than that.....hard work, determination, persistence, faith, etc. Ms. Byrne suggests that we will get what we want out of life by simply thinking hard about it and not letting ANY negative thoughts into our head. That may be all well and good, but in my humble opinion, it isn't the answer for people who wish to make real change in their lives. This book is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After all the hype I was sadly disappointed. I thought I was going to discover something new.

Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern repackaging of an old \\"law\\" that has still to be proven effective","review":"The book is a modern version of the famous Law of Attraction. This may work for some people some times, for reasons that have not been well studied in fields other than psychology, but I have yet to see a single published research to prove that it works most of the times, for most of the people. So it resembles more of a religion/sect than a \\"law of the universe\\"...It surely attracts a lot of attention since it sells hope that many people today desperately need and seek anywhere. Sorry to disappoint you, but the truth is out there and not in this book!There are numerous techniques to get yourself motivated and if you use this book as one, and only for that, then your money may be well spent. However, don't take it too serious so you don't have to face dissapointment if nothing happens in the end as you've dreamed of, because this will leave you in a much worse state than before reading the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pc","review":"the copy of the book i ordered was poorly printed. blurred pages and some pages quite unreadable. i believe it was a manufacturing mishap. i have ordered many books from amazon and have never been disappointed. i ordered several of this same book for my sisters but theirs were fine.as far as the book content itself it is interesting but a bit superficialand requires a broader sense of self and the world to be beneficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret on CD","review":"Love being able to listen to Secret contributors as I drive. Plus there are some additional comments in the CD set that were not (I believe) included in the movie and definitely were not in the book. You can also focus on those portions of The Secret that you choose to reinforce the concept.However, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired; it is a fold-over cardboard-type wrapper and 2 CDs of mine slipped out of the jacket and were damaged. The mfr should have distributed the 4-CD set with a 4-CD jewel case, supplied a single-CD case with the set or added \\"sides\\" to the cardboard wrapper.The only thing lacking - and this applies to all versions of The Secret --nobody tells you HOW to do this ... or that you need to be spirtually planted, so to speak. Just general steps 1 (ask), 2 (believe), 3 (act like you have it) are given along with lots of comments by contributors."},{"rating":"1","title":"the secret","review":"It was an ok book. I'm not sure what I was expecting. It basically said what a lot of other self help books have said, just in a different way. Who knows, it might be the way that would make a connection with you.

I'm using the The Secret now to change these thoughts with a new one so I can have what I want.The hard part is how to fight your thoughts and attract the new one, this is not explained in detail in the book.

How else can you explain babies getting terrible diseases ... did a one year old draw cancer to him or herself? How about 911 or Hiroshima or a million other horrors?

Get real. We need a realistic and practical guide to things, not by means of some black art or magic that this book relentlessly pursued.

The book is well written, I will give it that. I also have to give the editors credit for doing a good job; however, it is quickly so repetitive along the thought line that it becomes very monotonous. The power of positive thinking coupled with materialism is quoted repetitively throughout the entire book. Many of the quotes and concepts shared have been around for quite some time. The quick fix philosophy has many flaws in it as one can imagine. I recommend reading the Bible; you will find \\"Many Secrets\\" to provide self-help and positive thinking as well.

But guess what? If you really don't plan ahead, you WILL FAIL.If order to achieve your goal, you need the combination of three things, and they're equally important:1) The IQ and EQ that you're born with.2) What you have learned (from experience, books, internet, etc.) and applied.3) Luck/opportunities.Unfortunately, there're books/people like this \\"Secret\\" that will mislead you and steal your money at the same time. Of course, thinking positively is a healthy thing to do, but to achieve significant goals you need to do a lot more than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's try again...","review":"My previous review appeared, then disappeared, for some reason.

I have to give credit to the author/publisher, though. The real 'secret' is that slick marketing works, and there are fortunes to be made out of snake oil. And, in a consumer society, so long as there are gullible people with low intelligence and a disposable income, they will continue to be made. Which is good news for everyone involved - apart from the schmucks with more money than sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret is no secret","review":"I give this five stars for marketing with one star for content.

In theory the idea of the law of attraction is a good one, logically known to most and a good reminder of being self-aware and simple common sense.The way the information is presented is painful to read. The commentary notes as each person speaks is painfully repetitive and takes on a choppy cult-like cadence.For those readers/reviewers that had an epiphany and may have experienced a life changing event from the words in this book... I'm sincerely glad. The message this book presents is positive one and, for this only, The Secret deserves an atta-boy.Kudos to all the media frenzy and hype their marketing people generated for this book!

Seriously, the emphasis on material goods without any corroborating emphasis on the effort it takes to succeed is simply disgusting.We all have heard about the power of positive thinking.

I found it to be quite inspirational, thought-provoking, and it made me do a great deal of soul-searching. Suddenly, many things became clear to me. It is not the type of book that one can just pick up and read from cover to cover in one sitting. I found myself reading just a few pages at a time so that I could absorb all that was being written.

I'm not even sure if the famous people she mentions in the book actually agreed with that assessment either. Namely, Einstein. Or else why would he have fled Nazi Germany? I wish it were as easy as she makes it seem, that all you have to do is wish upon a star. That the Universe will reward you with whatever you wish for, as long as you believe. Great con job!

As for all of the \\"philosophers\\" who contributed to the Secret, I would be curious to know how many actually have degrees in philosophy, and who are either professors of philosophy or written books on philosophy. It is interesting that although the book states that the Law of Attraction was known and practiced by a lot of very famous people throughout history, it gives no references to any statements by such people supporting their knowledge and practice of such a law.

The basic idea is that if you wish for something and keep wishing really really hard, it will finally happen for you. Your wishing and your determination will manipulate the universe (God) into giving you what you want. Since a good many people don't want to do the hard work to accomplish their dreams, this kind of nonsense is appealing to a huge population. The author claims that a good many famous and successful people knew and practiced this secret. I can't verify this, since those cited are dead and the dead cannot defend themselves.

For those professing religious beliefs in Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, you might find the book also problematic on moral grounds, as it never does account for events in everyone's lives, where other people's actions have directly impacted yours. It basically blames the victims. Going through Jim Crow and lynching, well, change your mindset and the oppressor class will automatically calibrate their behaviour towards you.

They do touch on some long-held beliefs shared by people throughout the ages, but they have an ability to turn such nuggets of truth into a life view that embraces the pursuit of wealth and fame. And you can have it, too - just follow the law of attraction!

The Secret is basically a religion, and the God in this religion is basically your mind. It is not psychology anymore; it is magic.Not only is it a religion, it is a calvinist-type religion, where it is your fault that the holocaust happened to you or that you are fat, etc.So I don't buy it, but I don't buy Santa Claus, and yet a lot of people think it is a good thing for kids to believe anyway, right?

This book can work for someone who does not want to see the greed, jealousy, and selfishness connected to it. I'm not saying the book is all wrong, just it's primary emphasis. But why take my word for it, maybe this Buds for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this less than one star I would","review":"This is pathetic rubish. Positive thinking is great and there are a lot of wonderful books and tapes with affirmations. but this book basically says if you wish for something with every fiber of your body it will magically become yours. Simply not so. That is not the law of attraction. The law of attraction is if you are expecting good and are happy, you will bring about good in your life through WORKING toward your GOALS. If you want to buy a book about changing your life through positive thoughts keep looking. The only real secret to this book is that the author and her sister want to get rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Scam","review":"Rhonda Byrne should be ashamed of herself for writing such garbage. There is no 'secret'. These ideas are very old. To a lot of people this is commonplace thinking (positive thinking). She has some nerve to say that anything negative that happens to you is your own fault.I feel bad for people who wasted their money on her nonsense. If she truly wanted to help people why didn't she give out the information for free.I truly hope her company goes bankrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I have the DVD and the audio CDs.

It advertises a very simple idea that is an actual philosophical truth of sorts, but the author does not approach the subject in an unbiased scientific manner. It lacks depth and at one point I had the feeling those who worked on it developed a feverish pitch that felt cult like in nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Secret","review":"This was a waste of money. All the teachings she explains have been written by other authors. She never tells you how or how the others accomplish their goals. People go and read Catherine Ponder's books and you will see it has been written before. It is amazing how Rhonda must have read a lot of these older books, from different authors and packaged them with a catching name and sold it. Before you all purchase books like this one and waste your money. Check out the authors from days gone by. They have a lot to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, cheesy, too good to be true, leaps of logic","review":"Simplistic and corny are a good start to describing The Secret. Napolean Hill, Tony Robbins and others have talked about the power of positive imagery without making it in to a magic formula akin to \\"just think, you may win the lottery\\".imagine, ask and receive? Ok, how about know what you want, positive imagery helps, and work very hard to get the things that you want. Oh wait, its a much easier sale if you tell people they can just imagine it and it will happen.They make leaps of logic using pseudo-science, and take famous quotes completely out of context to make their case.sad that folks are deceived by such"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret","review":"I thought my head was going to explode!!!!

It carefully touches on the importance of each individual without going into religious depth, which is what I liked about the book. I guess it appeals more to everyone this way. The law of attraction does have it's ring of truth but for those who are skeptics, this book is still worth reading to remind you of how special you are.

Huh??!!! Wait until one of these law of attraction types cannot vibrate their cancer or heart disease into remission, and they will see that not EVERYTHING is in one's mind.

Yes, changing your thoughts does help. Hopefully thinking about these things will get you to formulate a plan to accomplish them, but does anybody seriously think that just thinking that high calorie food will not get you fat will not actually get you fat?

If it is true, then there are not enough resources in the universe. Please don't waste money on such trash.

My excitement didn't last long though; I kept wondering when I would across something earthshattering or noteworthy. That moment never came.

He knows that each individual has his own view of what happiness is and there was no one secret to acquire it.I have a secret for you. Do what makes you happy.

The audiobook was just perfect for my commute to and from work. It's inspiring. It packaged up a philosophy I was familiar with from a variety of teachings--mostly Edgar Cayce--into one fluid, accessible product.

I can sum this book up in one line, \\"Pretend your a Magnet that attracts good things and you will attract good things.\\" Wow!! How much money do you want to spend for that.

Deep down, they already knew it, but someone IMPORTANT is telling them so they'll follow the advice and think wow! This book's great! Same stuff here, someone close to me recommended it and I promised I'd read it. Well, save your money (self-help is a money machine, too) and I'll break it down very simply:1. What goes around comes around (origin, \\"don't know\\")2. Do unto others as as you'd have done to you (origin, \\"Bible?\\")3. Think happy thoughts (origin \\"Peter Pan\\")4.

Don't do any work anymore, instead, sell books, tapes and seminars to teach other people how to do what you are no longer doing because it is really hard and involves lots of risk and besides, my success in that area was average and if I could really figure out how to be a fantastic success at real estate or \\"life\\", why would I tell you how to compete with me?

Also thrown in for good measure, are chapters by \\"author\\" Jack Canfield, and \\"Dr.\\" Joe Vitale (marketing superstar).

It has enabled me to change my worries and negative thoughts into positive ones.

It does not take into account that we live in a broken, unjust world when she talks about things like poverty, accidents and illness. She seems to claim that we can be our own mini Gods, and I found some of the language that she used to be downright offensive to the Christian beleifs that I have.

A good attitude and a lot of hard work can get you far. I also believe that there is nothing more positive for your soul than to care for and help those who are sick, hungry or alone. To exclude them from your life is to set yourself up as being somehow better than them. Always remember the story of Job.IMO, this book is a jumble of rehashed, 60s psychobabble created for the sole purpose of making money for the authors. All that's missing are the love beads and the Jim Morrison posters on the wall. A positive attitude is a wonderful asset when it comes to dealing with life's problems. However, visualizing Hummers will not make it happen. And, the truth is, that Hummer will not make you any happier with yourself then you are right now.So, don't bother to buy this book.

It's just another fab that a few people are getting rich off. The reality is, BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW MUCH GOOD ENERGY YOU SEND OUT.

The goals of getting bigger houses and bigger cars are a slight to the original eastern philosphy it tries to embody. Don't waste your time with this shallow and misguided book. Read something of value that will teach you how to truly put the law of attraction into your life. Unless of course, you'd rather sit on the couch and visualize your life away, lusting after things you don't really need. Ancient religious texts, philosophy and yogic texts use the same ideas but have a profound meaning. This book misses the mark entirely. Her interpretation of why bad things happen is a malformed definition of karma.

If you want to change your life then do things to change your life. For example, don't say \\"I want to lose weight\\" and then sit around and eat chips all day. It's not rocket science people. Positive thinking will lead you to positive actions. Positive actions will lead you to positive things happening to you.

That's not a secret, it's just logic. However, this book takes positive, proactive living to a silly, ridiculous level. The idea that the bad things that happen in life happen because a person \\"attracted\\" them is arrogant, cruel, and dangerous. And for the people for whom the \\"secret\\" doesn't work? The people selling this - and that's what it is; sales pitch - would say that it is that person's own fault because they didn't believe enough. What a convenient excuse.

Wishing won't make the cancer disappear, or your sex change, or your leg grow back, or your son come back to life or any number of countless horrible things that happen to normal people. \\"Lifestyle\\" books like this that make pretend that if you make a wish it will become true are simply fads.

It talked about doing thingsthat were do-able. And it feels so much better to feel good about life than sad. I lovedthis book so much I bought 3 used copies, and gave one to each of my sons and a friend.It helped both my sons and friend, still pending.

It is not your regular book in that many authors write all throughout, and their message, help and advice is powerful indeed.If you will read this and apply its principles in belief, the chances of your living a happier, more productive, fun, and fruitful life are increased many times. It makes you feel good about everything, and it puts you back in control.I can not place any book above this one.

After all, if it is just common sense stuff, why isn't the hundreds of billions of people in the world appling it?

I am truly a believer that faith can bring about some amazing things but this book makes it too easy - to the point of recklessness - to get everything you've ever wanted. The claims about fixing your eyesight and pretending you have more more in your checking account are laughable. Unfortunately, there are people who beleve this stuff - or I say desparately want to believe. Just ask the universe for whatever you want and then believe you'll get it.

I have not finished reading the book, but from what I have read, I'm not a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real secret?","review":"The real secret is that \\"The Secret\\" is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. It's incredibly cheesy with graphics, icons, quotes, and fancy paper, and it is largely lacking in content. The book is written as if based on science, but it is factually inaccurate. I think Byrne's point about the value of positive thinking (i.e. positive thinking improves health and happiness) is important, but there are dozens of books that do a better job of conveying this notion. I believe in the power of thought (though not in the \\"Genie\\" of the universe), but if I did not, I doubt this book would have convinced me. \\"The Secret\\" repeats itself, adding quotations from people who repeat themselves, and there is almost no specific evidence or anecdote to support its claims. Ironically (or not), Byrne's best support for her thesis is that she believed she could become rich, and she did -- by selling way too many copies of a lousy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of context, disappointed.","review":"I think this is really a selfish, self-centered book. Everything is about \\"me, me, and me\\". I'm sorry, but I don't agree (and believe) that everything is about \\"you\\". I want to know if the author study the Bible quotes. I am a firm Christian, and I must say she did not even study the Bible because she took the meaning out of its context. NO, you can NEVER do that to the Bible and use it for your own selfish and self-centered needs. It gets to me that she dares to take it out of context and use it for her selfish needs. Honestly, I don't care how she wrote, but I care what she wrote. I'm sorry if I am being mean and harsh on this author, but when it comes to the Bible, I will refute this kind of usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"I won't try to expand on the work that has already been done in evaluating this book's merits, or lack thereof. I would simply say that the entire basis for this book, the invisible energy radiated by the individual, may have some merit, but it is certainly NOT a scientifically proven fact, as the book claims.For serious inquiry into this subject, I recommend Lynne McTaggart's Book, 'The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book of illusion","review":"The worst book on personal development I have ever read. (being a coach and reading 80 books a year, winning the prize as the worst book was not easy).The metaphorical message of the book is right: change your thinking and you change your life, embracing the future you want. But the author goes way beyond that, declaring that the universe will conspire with your positive thoughts and make things happen for you. She even tells you that if you are receiving bills to pay, it's because of your negative thinking: think positive, and you will start receiving cheques!! (well, that's convenient!!)so, although the principe is right, the book goes way too far, thus deluding people into thinking that just thinking hard about something will bring change. thought without action is just philosophical debate: actions in accordance to our thinking is what shapes our future.

It was boring. Having read all of Wallace Wattles, Og Mandino, Robert Collier, it was basically the same pitch, only filled with the same over and over tidbits from the other same people doing the same thing ala Chicken Soup for the Soul.Basically what it says is, \\"Stop playing the victim and get into the right way of living!\\" How do you do that? By praying. Put yourself into a good frame of mind and ask the Lord for blessings, and be grateful.Just remember, Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You.Jesus tried to impart The Secret to his followers: You can have anything you want, you can do anything you want, you can be anything you want.

In particular, I feel it is limited by putting much emphasis on achieving your desires.This book is seen as a 'spiritual' text but really it's anti-spiritual, since ultimately it promotes a kind of selfishness and egotism.

You can take your time and meditate on ideas and thoughts more, because it's easier to pause.

I was always skeptical because his claims were pretty far fetched. All my skepticism vanished when I finally took the time to read it.What a powerful piece of work. It truly touches on points and subjects that seem redundant and pointless and brings out amazing qualities. This is a must read book, truly. For anyone who is soul searching or who just wants more insight into their spiritual self, read this book. It is incredible. There really isn't a clear cut secret, but it does open doors that I didn't know existed. I felt like a better person after reading this book. It really matured and grounded me. The Secret should be on every thoughtful person's bookshelf at home"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money","review":"This book is nothing new, it is just the same old new age, metaphysical garbage that has been espoused for years. Basically, the idea is there are waves in the univers that you can latch onto.

My friend gave me the cd as a gift, and I love it because it makes me feel good. I also love books by Joel Osteen and Emmett Fox. Joel's books are current day, and he definitely understands the thought process, as Emmett did when he wrote his books 70 years ago. Bill Wilson, the founder of AA also understood the power of thought. None of this is new, but The Secret presents the thought process in a way that the average person can understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"This book may be one of the worst I have ever spent time with. Their are no actionable suggestions on how to improve your life--just a rambling conspiracy theory about a secret that all the smart people in history knew. Formal logic or objective information rarely comes into play. If you are looking for a book that can help you put yourself on a better track to success, this is not it. If you are looking for something funny that you can ridicule, The Secret is for you.

The idea behind it is good but its execution is terrible. Positive thinking generates a greater chance of success in your life; no problem there. But to claim that desire without work or making plans to reach your goals is not only foolish, it is also a dangerous thought system. Just another cheesy self-help book that throws responsibility to the wind and promotes a seemingly lazy faith in the world around you. The most amusing thing of all, however, is when one of the speaker in the DVD format of this book claims that you \\"can get something out of nothing!\\" Looks like someone needs to take another physics class or at least a critical thinking course."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all been said before","review":"The real secret is how does the author convince us that this is a NEW idea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff...","review":"This is one of the many books i've read trying to find the \\"answer\\".

Although this book contributes to a shift from negative to positive thinking, it's so lite that anyone who is into this topic, or wants to get real information on this topic, will take offense to the many randomly scattered statements that often make you say \\"duh\\". They possess the double whammy of not telling you much while lacking support. On the opposite scale, and I do mean opposite scale, there are books like Ordaining Reality which provide enough information as to how thoughts change outcomes to allow you to debate this topic with professional physicists. A newer version makes the case with a less hard science. It's not an easy read or real cheap, but this book clearly piques the interest of any serious reader of this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspireing","review":"I've listened to them twice and find them to be a life changing experience.

Other than that however, I thought that the songs of this album were really great. Although a lot of the other veiwers did not care for Remnants of Percy Bass, I felt that it was a really beautiful. I do understand peoples' dislike for this song though, because the sound of the dulcimer is very unusual. The dulcimer is a very ancient musical instrument, most people aren't even familiar with it's sound unless they have heard Asian music which is why the dulcimer can really take some getting used to for the ears of many westerners."},{"rating":"2","title":"And They Return...","review":"I personally loved this album. I have just recently (within the last year) become a Rasputina fan but I was already dying for their new album. I agree that, yes there were some fillers in this album. Still, I think that others on the album make up for this. 'Gingerbread Coffin', 'Thimble Island' and 'Hunter's Kiss' are amazing. The harder edged songs such as 'AntiqueHighHeelRedDollShoes', 'State Fair' and 'Rats' are also great. My favorite song on the album, however, would have to be 'Crosswalk'. I don't know why but I find both the lyrics and tune extremely haunting. It may not be as strong as 'How We Quit the Forest' and 'Thanks for the Ether', but 'Cabin Fever!' is still amazing. Its Rasputina, how could it not be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Brown has made something grand","review":"I read and re-read this story when I was a little girl.

Of course these versions are not as good as the originals, but I still think it's cool that Thalia was willing to experiment and take a big risk with this project.

Undoubtedly the contributing writers are well-respected and immensely able but their writing lacked the Howardian flavour I have come to love. Ghor's sudden personality shifts are hard to follow and the various ideas in the story lack sufficient depth. This book is not the way Mr Howard would have written it.

I have not read the book so I can't vouch for its accuracy. The acting in both versions are excellent and so were the movie. However what makes the 1949 version better is its presentation. Mind you, this is 1949 and the sets and color, Technicolor, are outstanding. Watching the movie is like going back into the Currier and Ives world. Movies were supposed to be an escape for about 2 hours and this movie delivered. Curl up into your easy chair, especially on a cold winter evening with the fireplace burning.

It is heartwarming and deeply moving. One cannot help but be inspired by this classic tale.June Allyson plays the character of Jo March and none could play it better. Oh, don't get me wrong; I loved watching Katherine Hepburn (one of my favorite actresses) in the 1933 version, but June Allyson made the role hers. Yes, she can be both powerful and subtle.Backing up her performance were three more wonderful actresses: Margaret O'Brien, Janet Leigh and of coarse Elizabeth Taylor.This story of a female writer struggling with personal problems and cultural limitations is indeed a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST PLAIN WONDERFUL!!!!!","review":"This movie is flawless! The best adaptation of the book, with the most amazing cast ever put together. June Allyson, Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Leigh, Mary Astor and of course Peter Lawford were just incredible. The entire cast is excellent, and the movie is beautifully filmed! If you want the REAL DEAL, this is it. The 1933 version was also good, but of course dated and just a tad corny. This 1949 version could not be any better.Get this movie, and if you want a more affordable copy, look for the TCM collection of 4 movies, that this is included in.

And then, I saw this movie (on TV, thank heaven I didn't pay for it!), and it nearly ripped away all my respect for the storyline. I confess, I lay much of the blame for this on the peculiar casting choice of June Allyson in the lead as Jo. Her acting is mediocre, she really doesn't ring true as Jo. While some other actresses do seem to do a fine job, the whole production lacks a certain depth. While I'll never reach my mom's level of adoration for all-thing-Alcott, I do agree that 'Little Women' is far worthier than this production suggests. If you are in more mood for movie than book, let me recommend either the Wynona Ryder or Katherine Hepburn 'Little Women' movies.

The book contains a wealth of very useful models and methods for effectively using Excel as a management / decision tool.The book was published in 1996 (14 years ago) but is still a good buy if you can get it second hand. The methods employed are likely to be relevant also for the next 14 years to come or more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORALITY COMES FROM LIFE EXPERIENCE","review":"I wish I had read this book when my child was an infant, as I would have understood how morality in children really develops, and I could have assisted more in the process. William Damon really is an expert in this area, and his book is an excellent outline of how children develop a moral viewpoint from their own life experiences in sharing, developing empathy and reciprocity, and understanding social expectations. I plan on giving this book to some friends with preschool children, and I hope they will like it as much as I do. This is the best evidence based/scientific based book on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral Child: Nurturing Children's Natural Moral Growth","review":"The book made it to me in fine condition.However, I had trouble staying awake throughout the reading. I found the material to be rather redundant and unhelpful as to the conclusion and steps to take thereafter. I had to read this bok for a college class and do not recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not separate","review":"This product seems to lack the fundamental function of egg white separation in that it does not separate. The slits are not wide enough to allow the egg white to drop after separation. It hangs there in a viscous, gooey blob, requiring you to use your hands to literally pull it downward. On some attempts, the egg white hung over the top edge of the separator, again without dropping. I tried this on two separate shipments of eggs, just to be sure it wasn't a particular brand of egg or goofy hens. I would not recommend this product. Instead, go with a more tried-and-true company like Pampered Chef. Disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK for the price!","review":"Santa brought the princess edition to my daughter and she is very happy with it. I didn't have any problems adding songs and pictures, just drag and drop! I was also very surprised that it took the songs I downloaded from Itunes. For videos, yes, you have to convert the songs to an special format but the pdf guide in the website explains step by step what to do. I think is a very good mp3 and video player for the price and for a six year old kid. Let's see how long it lasts. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy at all","review":"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and have spent the entire day trying to get some music videos to load and play correctly on it. They require as special format of WMV (which it does not say on the box.) The documentation is VERY poor and so is the support info on their web site.I would not purchase this for running downloaded video. I guess if you only use the special Mix-max cards it would be ok, but converting your standard music videos for this is a pain! I still haven't figured it out and I have a feeling they have a bug. I have to call support after Christmas.I expected more of a Disney product."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the way Disney treats customers they don't deserve any !!!","review":"I thought I was a bit savy about codecs and windows media player10 plugins but this Media Player made by Memorex for Disney will humble you.

Customer service calls were a waste of time. I asked how I could upload kid friendly videos in wmv format and his reply was, \\"how should I know\\". For a Disney product, you would think it would be more user friendly. Don't waste your time unless you want to use the video clips only. I am giving up and returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!","review":"I made absolutely sure that this would be compatible with macintosh before I bought it for my daughter this Christmas. I figured I'd have to do a few conversions here and there but nothing major. Well, it's the day after Christmas and I still can get it to play anything other than the Mix Max video clip I bought for it, and a couple of Disney Podcasts I downloaded via iTunes. Not even my daughter's disney cds will play properly after we uploaded them to iTunes and then downloaded them to the Mix Max. If my 18 y-o son tech guru of a son can't even figure this out, I'm guessing this is a major problem.The manual that came with the MixMax is worthless, as is the support PDF I downloaded from Memorex (who makes Mix Max). It might be helpful for those of you with Windows, but they offer no online support for mac.I'm in a major snit right now and not very happy about this expensive purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How frustrating!!!","review":"Santa should have just brought an MP3 player, for that is all this is. I have spent days on this, and I still cannot download video files to it. What a waste of my time. I do not know why they would make it this difficult. And as far as the converting files...I wish someone could explain it to me. I went through the process, and it just tells me I can't convert because the files I downloaded are protected. I am ready to scream!! When I tried to call the support number, I got put on hold and hung up on three times. Then I got through, and guess what...they were closed. I can't imagine making a product that does not support a normal wmv file. Part of me wants to buy the clips just so my daughter can watch something on it, but I'm sooo angry, I don't want to put any more time, effort, or money into this product. I think we're taking ours back to the north pole, and will save up for an ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Santa brought my 7 yr old daughter the Disney Mix Max for Christmas. By Jan 5, it stopped working & would not even turn off. We returned the Mix Max & exchaned it for another. To my surprise, they were all on clearance ($49.99). After I re-downloaded all of the songs again,the 2nd Mix Max did not shut off either. I again returned it to exchange for another one. After the 3rd Mix Max failed to work properly, I returned everything back to Target (approx. $150 worth of stuff, Mix Max, clips, case, etc.) and am getting her an IPOD. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington by Design","review":"This is a wonderful book that highlights all the most important buildings in the District. It gives a short synopsis on each buiding highlighted, some like the Capitol and the White House getting a bit more coverage. It was quite comprehensive, and the buildings covered came with pictures. It is not up to the level of the AIA Guide to Detriot or New York, but it is a nice guide none the less. I definitly recommend it to anyone interested in the architecture of the District."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant listening experience","review":"I agree with the \\"monkey in the cathedral\\" reviewer. This music is uninteresting, unenjoyable, not tuneful in any way. I got no pleasure at all out of this CD and consider it a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a monkey loose in the cathedral?","review":"Is this a recording of a primate or small child just banging on a pipe organ? I understand and even appreciate the use of dissonance in music, but come on - that's all these \\"songs\\" are. It reminded me of a psych patient taking out their agressions on an instrument. I only gave it one star because that was the lowest rating allowed!If listening to the samples offered doesn't set you on edge like fingernails on a chalkboard, you may want to have your hearing checked. Listen before you buy and save yourself some bucks and a serious mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be.","review":"I was very disappointed in this cd. I expected Dan to be on his A game and deliver some very funny material. I expected him to be as funny, if not funnier, than Homer Simpson. Goes to show that comedy is in the hands of the writers. Dan has a few good moments, but they are few and far between. I was very turned off by his wife. She was even less funny than he was. This husband and wife comedy act would be booed off stage in a new york minute. Don't waste your time buying this. Stick to watching the Simpsons to get your fill. The only thing worth listening to on the album is the last track when Dan gets into his Simpson characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Nor are you funny, sorry","review":"Dan is a vocal talent, but not a particularly funny one. Sketches meander, go nowhere and fail to amuse in the journey. Sorry Dan, get some good writers and try again. Funniest thing is the Leonard Nimoy reference in the title and cover photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert Laughter here.","review":"Very dissapointed with this cd. Anxiuosly unwrapped it before i left the store, listened to it, and it just fell flat. There was one funny moment in it. The Horoscope bit made us chuckle. Am Therapy, was way to long. Not funny in the least. Bagder Baseball, good idea, bad follow thru. Timing, pace and tempo, all remarkably bad. Dan should have had someone write this for him. And, this woman, comic genious? Hardly. I was so tired of hearing her, i bought the album to hear Dan. My wife made the comment, she thought that she just did not get it, she was relieved to find that some of my friends and I all agreed, we did not get it either. The Homer song was terrible, no tune, and really out of touch. If you do not belive me, just wait, and see, this album, will not be heard on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan,Dan,He's The Man","review":"When I received this CD in the mail as soon as I got it I put it on.And what a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"glitchcore masterpiece","review":"This album is a skittery, jittering collection of textures that manages to be simultaneously noisy and lovely, like the best of Oval's work. This strangely calming array of digital fragments belongs in any basic primer on digital music."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly nothing","review":"Im new to the whole noise as music concept, but i have grown to appreciate a well constructed collage of sound, just as i've learnt that every entire musical genre has moments of truth and integrity...There are a few intruiging moments on the textures throughout this hollow album but for the most part we are looking at the controled experiments of tempo and static and not really rising above that, other albums by the artist engage in their subtleties more effectively then the controlled experiement of this cold sound in a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I got this CD for $1.95 on a clearance rack, and I can tell you it wasn't worth even that little of money. Frankly, I was completely unimpressed with this album. The guitar playing was OK, nothing amazing, but the lyrics were the most boring words I have ever heard. I have to agree with Jason, the only other reviewer who gave this less than 5 stars. Do the other reviewers not care what the band is singing? Unless AM Radio comes up with a lot more creativity, I don't think they're going anywhere soon. I wouldn't waste your money on this tasteless, boring album, but hey almost all the other reviewers gave it 5 stars so maybe it's just me who cares about what the band is saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously - TAKE A LISTEN!","review":"The 5 members of AM Radio have really outdone themselves on their first major label release. Long time favorites in the LA club scene, these gifted musicians have crafted an amazing CD. It's not only the kind of music you want to listen to when you're falling in love, but it's also the kind of music you want to hear when you're trying to get over a broken heart. A lot of thought has gone into song lyrics and melodies - these guys are not one hit wonders. I defy you to listen to this CD and NOT feel better after the spin. This is a must-have for 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"loving Jannel Raps music","review":"Jannel Rap has such a beautiful voice. The Sea of Red album is something I never get tired of listening to. Thank you to Jannel for such lovely entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Backstreet Boys!","review":"I love the Backstreet Boys, but like this CD is awesome! I have this CD already and I listen to it like all the time. My favorite song from this CD is \\"Late Bloomer\\" because it helps me relax. Jannel is a great performer I have seen her on many occasions in person and like WOW!GET THIS CD cuz like you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a list of mathematical subjects one should know","review":"This book is simply a list of mathematical subjects one should have a working knowledge of for physics. It should not be advertised as anything more than that, since it can not claim to sufficiently teach any of these subjects. The examples are simplistic, and will not help you when working problems in this book. If you are required to get this book for a course, then look at the syllabus for your course to find out what math books you'll need to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too light for a doorstop, too obtuse for a textbook","review":"If you already know math methods, buy this book as a reference or to refresh your memory. If you hope to use this book to learn math methods, keep looking. If you're buying it because it's required for a class, be prepared to gather a few more books to get through.I just finished a math methods course. I found myself constantly reading other books to learn how to solve the problems assigned to me out of this book. I used Kreyszig and Arfken & Weber to get me through my math methods course. This book is not for those whose math skills are rusty. Its derivations skip steps which are probably obvious to those more knowledgeable. It simply baffled me.It may be baffling, but at least its expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can judge this one by its cover","review":"With a cover slightly sturdier than newsprint, and binding that seems like it's held with Elmer's GlueStik, M&W is a text you can probably skip with no remorse. I can see it having one target audience: If you already have more than a working knowledge of advanced mathematics, M&W should be good for a reminder on specific topics. If you're a grad student preparing to take a class on this subject, then you're in trouble. M&W, while covering a number of subjects, does not go into any of them in sufficient detail to understand the concepts or complete anything beyond the simplest of problems. Their examples are sparse and poorly explained. Out of a class of 50, I don't know of any that found M&W to be of any use (other than the professor, that is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, but very useful","review":"Most mathematical physics textbooks are huge tomes (Arfken), multiple volume sets (Courant and Hilbert), or both (Morse and Feshbach). This book covers the essentials in a reader-friendly way without pages and pages of exposition. The discussion of integral equations with separable kernels is a perfect example, rather than going on and on with the theory, Mathews and Walker just give an example that illustrates the technique; this approach makes it easier to follow than the rest. The book was originally based on lectures by Feynman, and his mark is apparent on it. If you just want to see how to solve problems and aren't interested in long-winded discussions of the range of applicability of a technique, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and useful","review":"This is a very nice little book. The explanations are concise and to the point, and the wealth of examples make it easy to really learn the material. I took away a star simply because it is cheaply printed and falls apart, which is unacceptable for such a pricey book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor textbook","review":"As many other reviews said, if you are using this as a textbook for a class where you are just learning the material, this book is useless. If you already know the material, well, you won't need it then either because you probably already have more useful books in your library. The homework problems tend to be long and difficult, but generally instructive.It is a very cheaply bound paperback book. My lightly used copy is already starting to fall apart. Any teacher asking a student to spend $120 for this book is being really irresponsible. If it is required for a class you are taking, you will be better off photocopying the pages with homework problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"For decades, still the best dog training book!","review":"Got this book decades ago (late 60's) after we purchased an expensive 6 months old German Shepherd from Germany. When she came out of her crate snarling, my husband obtained this book from the public library. We had wanted a good protection dog, but also had a baby and toddler. After training with Mr. Koehler's method, this dog won top awards at many obedience shows, and became a most protective and SAFE dog around our children. Recently bought this for a niece who rescued a hyper, very assertive pit bull ... Mr. Koehler's principles are timeless and will work for any breed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite teas!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this tea.

I have fairly eclectic taste and listen to alot of classical and jazz. I can say that this CD makes me smile. There's something very positive about most of the tracks here. The title cut \\"Pacific\\" has a hypnotic groove. Great music to drive to. Smooth with an urban edge. It hasn't left my car CD player in the last week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacific - Natural High","review":"Excellent! The best CD I have purchased in a long long time. Every track is awesome. For those who ballroom, the grove is on-point."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will kick you into gear...","review":"I have taken so many acting classes that in essence really didn't help me to become a better actor. This book dispels everything most acting teachers will try to tell you, and allows you to focus on what's really important- the things you can CONTROL to help you become an effective actor. While a lot of what is advocated may seem like too many details and a lot of work- well, guess what- it is. And if one truly wants to become an effective actor, you have to work at it, and hard. But the results will pay off in spades, and I can testify to that as I have noticed a huge improvement in my confidence and in getting roles.Barry Pineo writes about acting and life in a way that is refreshing- it is all interwoven and connected- the way it should be. This book is inspiring, passionate, and forces you to look at acting in a way you probably never have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Discrete Mathematics (4th Edition)","review":"I used this book for a sophomore level Discrete Math class in the CS program at Park university. It was pretty difficult to understand for everybody in the class including myself and I've had math through Calc III. It was apparently not written for that level student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good except for its coverage of mathematical induction","review":"The discrete math course at our university is a sort of \\"rite of passage\\" for math majors- it introduces students to the idea of proofs, as well as basic set and graph theory and combinatorics. It is an introduction to the abstract aspect of mathematics. This book serves this purpose well, with a number of examples and drawings to illustrate concepts. However, this book explained induction in a manner that confused me. Also, our department wasn't too fond of this book- they switched to another after one semester. Still, I don't think it's too bad- unless the current book that the department uses is that much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy to read book for non-maths students","review":"I am not a maths student but I used this book (the 4th edition) as a supplement for my combinatorial chemistry course and also my CRE course which has a section on spanning tree model. Quite easy to understand. Not bad as a reference for self-studying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plateau Breaker","review":"This album broke new ground with me. I thought I knew jazz until I heard this. In this album we have new instruments (not used in jazz much), all kinds of timing variations and what I think is a great recording. You will not be sorry if you purchase this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pere Ubu at its most improvisatory","review":"This is the original line-up of Pere Ubu at its most improvisatory, nearly every song clearly built up spontaneously in the studio around some core musical idea. David Thomas riffing on words (\\"Dishes! dishes! dishes! All for love of you....\\"), Maimone's killer bass lines, Herman and Ravenstine working it out in the best free-jazz tradition. Although it isn't jazz at all. And then all the mounting but masterfully controlled tension is released with \\"Jehovah's Kingdom Come\\", Thomas' most beautiful pop song until the Cloudland album a decade later and the album's only truly \\"composed\\" piece. New Picnic Time falls almost unnoticed between more rock and blues-oriented masterworks like Modern Dance and Dub Housing, on the one hand, and the more self-consciously arty Art of Walking and Song of the Bailing Man, on the other. But it stands as Pere Ubu's singularly greatest work in this first period of their career. An incredible masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Downhill From Here - Blame Thomas and Thompson","review":"At one point in history, Pere Ubu threatened to be one of the greatest rock groups this planet has ever seen or heard - avant garde yet accessible, uncompromising yet listenable. Then David Thomas took over the reins and drove them up the nearest cul de sac. So instead of being the Sex Pistols of the avant garde, they became the Henry Cow of punk rock - some achievement! This album is where it all began to go off the rails, or more accurately into a overgrown, moss-covered siding called \\"art rock\\". Worse was to come when Mayo Thompson replaced the brilliant Tom Herman (whatever happened to....), Thompson being a thoroughgoing obscurantist, heroically dedicated to musically disappearing up his own hindquarters. Stick to \\"Modern Dance\\", \\"Dub Housing\\", \\"Datapanik\\" - remember them THAT way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better books available","review":"When I started working in Radiation Therapy, somebody recommended this book to me to learn the theoretical aspects. I am also required to teach a resident lecture out of this book. The more I use it, the less I like it. While the book may contain information on all basic and necessary topics, the way they are presented is less than optimal.I find the writing style is not conducive to learning. The author has the annoying habit to insert sentences hinting at advanced topics without really explaining what it means. For the reader not familiar with the advanced topics, those remarks just create confusion. Some of the chapters, especially on electrons, are very unorganized and jump back and forth.Compared to other excellent works available, e.g. Hendee and Ibbott, or Jayaraman and Lanzl, this book is much weaker in quality/price."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone please come up with something else!","review":"Worthless for anyone without a degree in Physics. Since it's being used to teach Radiation Therapists, can someone please come up with a better alternative? The lack of units in equations makes it impossible for a lower level student to learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you wanna rock?","review":"Russell Simins's drums are booty-shakin' cataclysmic. Everything a good album should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as any of the last four or so Blues Explsions.","review":"To pick this out as a weak album compared to Orange and beyond seems to me like an odd thing to do. It may not be as raw and F-ed up as Got Worry, but it's definitely a \\"return to roots\\" compared to the so-polished-you-can-see-your-face-in-it Acme. I'd say it's on a par with Orange. Their Altamont-era Stones influnces are on their sleeves and whipping in the wind. JSBX really hasn't been all that agressive/experimental since Extra Width. They found a niche and settled into it years ago. If you still like what they do and haven't gotten bored with it yet, you'll dig this. I can understand if older fans tuned out after Extra Width (and a lot of them did,) but to point this album out as a sudden downfall is way off the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is weak","review":"This is by far the weakest JSBX album of the lot. Sure its more accessible and sure its straight ahead rock, but its also limp in comparison to the other albums. If you are looking for a Blues Explosion album, start with Orange, or if you're looking for them in their primal form, check out Extra Width. These guys are getting old and the songs are a little tired, its kind of like buying one of those new Rolling Stones album without the nostalgia. Don't judge them by this album. It deserves more like 2 stars but I wanted to bring down the average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's hoping for an Xtra-Plastic Fang","review":"Damn those Japanese imports... JSBX saves some of their beststuff for overseas. \\"Ghetto Mom\\" deserves to be on the domesticversion but, alas, you must shell out $ to get it on this.

I found the dialouges extremely moronic and unrealistic. Endless repitition and substitution drills are really no way to learn English. Furthermore, the first unit, in which students are complete beginners, contains 1. a reference to Social Security Numbers and 2. introduces the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Students at this level are still trying to cope with English letters and sounds; it is unfair to throw a cultural reference at them so early on.

I have used book 1 & 2 for the last 10 years, and if I could only take one book with me to my next county - that would be it. These books are the best out there for developing accuracy of forms which are necessary for beginning students. It provides realistic dialogues with ample practice through substitution drills. The illustrations are both humourous and clear so that the books are easy to use with real beginners. For students at the pre-intermediate level and above, I would suggest only using this series as a supplement to practice grammar forms (I usually make an overhead and let students practice in pairs).As for comments about dialogues with social security numbers or talking about San Juan - if something doesn't apply to your situation - skip it!!!! (That information is relevant for some students)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A textbook that rates a C minus","review":"As an ESL teacher, I have found this heavily-promoted book very disappointing. Some of its many deficiencies: (1)overuse of proper names, which are difficult for students and distract them from the substance; (2) overuse of vocabulary irrelevant to the lives of urban adult immigrants (skiing, skating, working in the yard, drinking lemonade, vacationing in Paris); (3) stilted and artificial reading selections; (4) sketches depicting dated fashions or artifacts (bell-bottom jeans, large Afro hairdos, record players, dial telephones); (5) introduction of common errors in grammar or word meaning without identifying them as errors (\\"how come?\\" as an alternative to \\"why?\\"; \\"nauseous\\" in a context that requires \\"nauseated\\"--actually I think that example may be from Book 2, but I have the same criticisms of all four books in this series.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first step for English learners with previous knowledge.","review":"This book would be too tough for absolute beginners of English, but an excellent aid for anyone who has prior knowledge and usage of English.

It offers very little about Peta Wilson herself other than a scant look at her life and career that was available in most magazine articles (the book is un-authorized). And the synopsis of the series is pretty basic. Half of the tome is taken up with a lot of silliness that is more for kids than adults.There are also very few pictures.

I have went out to buy the book, but didn't after looking over the book. I haven't read any backstage gossip, nor anything about a realtionship between Peta and Matthew. Maybe there is another book with the backstage information as well as the information about Peta and Matthew.The book didn't have anything in it that I haven't read online.

It is beautiful. My brother liked it the moment he saw it even though it was placed right next to Sony Viao.Lifebook has a big, 13.3\\" screen, large keys, fast centrino chips, 802.11 G wireless card, 40 GB hard drive, 512 MB RAM, CD RW/DVD drive and still it weighs just 4.3 lbs!It is an amazing piece of technology. To top it, Fujitsu backs its machine with a 1 yr. INTERNATIONAL warranty! Yes, you can take it anywhere in the world.Positives:1) EXCELLENT, UNBEATABLE configuration2) FEATURE PACKED, FULLY LOADED3) VERY LIGHT, just 4.3 lbs.4) Much finer looks than overexpensive Sony ViaoNegatives:I haven't found any yet.FINAL VERDICT : I wish I had bought a Lifebook instead of this clunky Dell Inspirion 600m.Lifebook is the notebook for professionals who do or do not travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst Album.","review":"I am a HUGE ATL Fan. Black Mafia 4 Life, know what I mean. I waited a long time for this release, and it was painful to listen to. It just seemed to lack direction.

The book is amazing, clear, with beautiful photos and very legible text. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, insightful information for parents","review":"This easy-to-enjoy book is written with a great heart for both children and parents. It covers most areas of interest and concern for those involved in the raising of children or grandchildren and offers new evidence of the vital importance, from neuro-science discoveries, of early conversation and interaction of mum and dad with babies and toddlers. A lovely description of play as 'joy juice' highlights the crucial part play has in the emotional and social development of children. The book also suggests some creative approaches to squabbling and sibling rivalry.Beautifully illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative easy to understand","review":"This is a wonderful book- I wish more parents had easy access to this book! The world would be a better place if more parents had this information!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had heard that this book was highly recommended and believed it until I read it. Although most of the information was good, I do believe it is for certain types of parenting styles, like the shared bed and no-cry solutions, which is not realistic in my house. When I read the part about how daycare affects your child in a negative way, I felt like the worst parent in the world. Daycare has been a blessing for all of us, but especially her. Yes, it is hard at first and was probably tough for her but she got used to it and now loves it. So if those above mentioned styles are for you, this book is worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality","review":"Nice quality, but as usual, the chain is rather skimpy.

Lynyrd Skynrd's never ending performance of Free Bird is somewhat lethargic. but the highlights outweigh the bad. these are Rory Gallagher, Captain Beefheart, Tom Waits, Bill Withers, Ramones (Joey has a double tracked vocal, hmmm), and Edgar Winter Group's unbelievable performance of Frankenstein. the sound and picture quality are spectacular on this dvd, well worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Been Warned - Don't Do it....!","review":"This is the \\"Americanized\\" single DVD release of the great UK 2-Disc Set of OGWT classic performances.

The UK version of the OGWT has some stunning material not on the US version, and is well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in my collection.","review":"This dvd is one of the finest collections of live classic rock performances from the 70's. It contains masterpieces from an innocent Elton John playing solo Tiny Dancer, a crazy version of Frankenstein with Edgar Winter jumping from instrument to instrument, Bob Marley with the Wailers at their best, original Lynyrd Skynyrd rocking out on Freebird like never before.

For those who, like me, learn better by seeing and hearing, the lack of a text is disappointing. The tapes are Munster Irish, not the standard language. As courses based on the living language - from any of the 3 main dialects - are becoming more popular, this should not be a problem. The pronunciation is no more different from the standard than O Sidhail's \\"Learning Irish\\", a very popular course using Connacht Irish, or the \\"Irish On Your Own\\" course which uses Ulster Irish. Munster Irish was until recently the most widely learnt outside the Gaeltacht areas, so most Irish speakers would understand the pronunciation used on these tapes. It is similar in most respects to the pronunciation used in 'standard' courses such as \\"Teach yourself Irish\\" by O Se. The main problem with this set is that it leaves you knowing very little Irish - a longer course is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick & Simple Irish needs a book!","review":"My problem with this is that I am a visual learner and I really would have been helped by some accompanying written material. I have absolutely NO background in Irish so this was very confusing. (I do have a slight knowledge of French and found the Pimsleur French just fine.) So, for me, this was neither quick nor simple. I'm going to try a different system, something with a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great course, as far as it goes","review":"An excellent and effective way of learning to speak and understand. Very inexpensive - worth much more. As another reviewer said, a 30-lesson course would be great. This 8 lesson course is very worthwhile, but limited in scope. I could have done without the last lesson's endless repetition of phrases for asking a lady to lunch, and \\"my place\\", \\"your place\\", or \\"the hotel\\", and instead would have preferred a simple listing of many more words, with pronunciation. Things like car, plane, bus, pub, shop, music, school, book... basic things, so we could then say \\"Where is the pub?\\", When is the bus?\\" A few useful phrases like \\"My name is ___\\", and \\"How do you say ____\\" And, as others have said, a written guide to go along with it would be very helpful - just a list of the words in English and Irish, to have a clue what they look like written out. Still, it's well worth getting, and going through several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really difficult","review":"I had a really hard time with this. I've never had any exposure to the Irish language before this. I started listening to it, but with no written words to look at, I couldn't tell what they were saying. I didn't know if the words started with a \\"D\\" or \\"T\\", \\"M\\" or \\"N\\", things like that...so when I repeated after them, I just had to take a guess. I probably wasn't saying the same word they were, but I couldn't really tell. If you've had experience with Irish, it might be helpful for improving pronunciation. I took German in school, then got the Pimsleur German, and it helped my pronunciation, but I already knew what they were saying, so it was easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will shelve this record after one listen","review":"Three first songs are good, the single beautiful Day kind of reminds you of Radiohead.

As a matter of fact, this is one of the worst autobiographies of ANYONE that I have ever read. Self-serving and monotonous, this book belongs in the same class as Canseco's steroids tome.

I wish I could say that for the built-in NEC DVD+R that came with my Dell. It was always very picky and finally I gave up on it. Then I bought a second internal model made by IO Magic. It reads everything quite well but doesn't write DVD-anythings nor even CD-Rs.

The sheer brutlity of this is what most Deeds fans will love about it. Where as \\"Mark of the Legion\\" contained more intricate time changes, this one does too, but the songs are more drawn out. It really starts to pick up in the second half of the CD, with the tracks \\"Human Trophies\\", \\"Banished\\", and the nearly 12 minute long \\"The Endurance\\" (Mike Hamilton needs a standing ovation for his performance on this one). I cannot stress how much I reccomend this to any fans of \\"Deeds\\" or of other grindcore, but it is definitely not meant for a novice listener.

The fall of the American sailor in world competitions such as the Americas Cup and Around Alone is directly related to the popularity of Royce whose work even in 2003 results in the manufacturing of new pocket cruisers that sail like those illustrated.There has been a revolution in sailboatthinking and today this book should be viewed for historical interest rather than as a primer for learning how to sail because boats designed for high performance are sailed much differently than the style advocated in Royce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royce's: Great Sailing Handbook","review":"Dunno what happened to the copy I bought many years ago, however it was a delight to revisit Royce's book. Even after 35 years of sailing, I learn a few more tidbits of sailing thanks to this book. There is a lot of information to absorb so I find the book most enjoyable by reading maybe just one or two pages at a sitting, similar to eating fine chocolates, leaving some goodness for later. For the most part, the book is a fantastic reference. I found one annoyance and I cannot understand why the content of a book would be printed with a light blue colored text. I find the lightly colored text difficult to read, too little contrast. Also, I would rather have seen contemporary sailing expounded upon rather than digressing back to the tall ships, trivia, though some people might find this to be of interest. Still, a must book for all who enjoy sailing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zircon MultiScanner i700","review":"I bought this scanner to be used on slightly textured drywall ceilings.

There are sections of plywood, OSB, and particle board in my home and a single floor joist was not found on any of them.It does wall studs well, as long as the insulation in the walls is not packed too tightly and there are not other items in the wall (such as vents or wires).It gave me several misreadings on live AC electrical wires as well.It did a fine job as a metal detector.Really, I believe you are better off buying a cheap one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"It does not find studs well.

I made my walls look like large sheets of swiss cheese following this things poor advice. The only reason for any stars at all was the AC finder mode working well. Tapping the walls with my knuckles and hammering finish nails in the walls to look for studs was more accurate. I was very disappointed.

For those of you who dont know how this thing works here is a quick run down. hold the top portion on the wall. Not over a stud because it calibrates when it turns on and if it is on a stud then it will read wrong. The top and the bottom section swivel independant from each other . you hold the top next to the wall and push down on the bottom and it turns on. if you lift the bottom just a little it turns off and you have to start over.

You know how heavy that flat screen TV is, so you don't want your mounting screws are off the stud's center line aren't you?I was very happy with this i700, (I talk to myself: \\"Ah, I finally bought something that it works!\\"). It helps me to find the left side, the center line and the right side of the stud easily. To be honest, 90% of the time is correct (after tested 5 times on the same spot), that's enought accurate tolerance for me.

To me it just feels bland, and nothing compells me to listen to this CD again.The lyrics are the only redeeming feature, but I honesly can't see why anybody would want to listen to a song repeatedly on that strength alone.Of course taste is relative, and I don't mean to offend the fans. In fact I'm willing to admit that it's probably just me -- apparently whatever makes these guys so great just flies right over my head. Just being honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album.","review":"I'll just say this: Will Bryant, from Sullen Cloud, TX, couldn't be more wrong about this cd. Had he spent more time listening to the album, and less time trying to sharpen his sad little put-downs of Dave Bazan, he might have actually understood what this album is all about. Unfortunately this music rewards engagement and emotional investment, so if you're just going to stand back and pose and try to be witty and aloof, you're not going to get it. Like nearly all of the reviews from the website that his was ripped from (pitchforkmedia.com) his misses the point entirely. Enjoy your Flaming Lips, dude. I suppose I just prefer music that actually matters.Buy this album. Buy it. It's one of the most amazing things I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LISTEN, YOU WILL HEAR GREATNESS!","review":"Pedro The Lion is known for its intense lyrics, and astounding rock sound. This record is pure perfection. In it's third concept c.d, Pedro tells the story of a man and wife who are experiencing problems. The man cheats, loses his job, has no connection to his children, and then is murdered by his spouse. Sound depressing? Maybe so, but it is actually not. Pedro has this unprecidented way of evoking thought in all their listeners with their clever lyrics, and realistic outlook. Pedro needs to be appreciated for what he has to say about all the illusions that so many people believe. We live in a sad, depressing world and Pedro is just pointing that out with sweet rock music in the background. This album deserves a listen because it is just wonderful. Close your eyes and listen..mmmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically great, but extremely depressing.","review":"Musically I think this is Pedro's best album yet. Upon first listening I loved the harder, louder, faster electric sound. But as I got it home and really paid attention to the lyrics I realized it left me with a bad taste in my mouth, which I think is because it lacks the hint of hope that previous albums had. The characters in this one have no hope, and therefore it is a very depressing album to listen to. It is an honest album, but it leaves me feeling like crap afterwards. Still, it is addicting and I can't stop listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Introduction to French","review":"I have been speaking French to my daughter since she was born, and now that she is nearly 5, I have begun to work with her in earnest. I was delighted to find this volume first in our local library. The clear black and white illustrations and the well structures short passages provide an excellent introduction to written French. A far more useful resource than most recently published materials.This book is a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Spiritual Work","review":"St. Alphonsus is an incomparable spiritual writer. His command of Scripture and tradition is breathtaking. I highly recommend all of his works for those who are looking for meditations on the life of Christ. You will enjoy this book if you have read and enjoyed \\"The Imitation of Christ\\" by St. Thomas a Kempis or \\"The Introduction to the Devout Life\\" by St. Francis de Sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been turned to the dark side","review":"Recently, my wife started to make me watch BBC with her. Being the good husband that I am, I watched it, mainly to spend time with her. This show came on one day, and I was hooked. The area in the show that is called Glenbogle, is visually stunning, and the cast is great. I was able to laugh and relate wih this characters. I won't give anything away, you MUST buy this series. We have watched this over and over again. I hope it is not possible to wear out a DVD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"It took a couple of episodes for me to get into this series, but once I got hooked I haven't been able to stop watching! I want to buy the complete series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fabulous dvd","review":"If Glenbogle actually existed, I'd move there today. Monarch of the Glen is my favorite television show (ever, I think) and I was delighted to find it on DVD. And what's better, the widescreen format allows me to view even more of the beautiful Scottish Highlands than the BBC America broadcasts. The DVD is beautifully done - picture, sound and menu-wise. If you're a Boglie like myself, you'll love this. The only problem with the DVD series is that they're not releasing the volumes closely enough together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monarch of the Glen","review":"The great series with breath-taking views of Scotland. Love the characters, and I am watching them develope as each season progresses.
