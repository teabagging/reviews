After reading some of the horror stories, here at Amazon, related to D-Link's customer service I decided just to throw it away and buy new Motorola Surfboard. Although I don't notice any speed difference with the surfboard, it takes much less time to boot up. Whereas with DCM 200 it took approx. 40 seconds to boot, with my new Motorola it takes no more than 10 seconds.

That is the context to which THE ORTHODOX WAY is best suited. It is distinctly a theological explination of what Orthodoxy is in terms of theological ideas and beliefs. It is not the what but rather the why. Having said that, it is an excellent condensation of Orthodox theology in reletivly easy to grasp language. This makes sense as the book was intended for those new to Orthodoxy. However, while there is some explination of ritual, this book is concerned with what the Orthodox person believes, not what he or she does. Still, it should not be passed up by one who wants an introduction to Orthodoxy. On the whole, not bad. I recomend it if you've got some spare change."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction","review":"This book is clearly written, specific and to-the-point on introductory Orthodox theology. Ware's style is scholarly but not haughty or unattainable. Those who come from a Western Christian background, whether Catholic or Protestant, will be able to grasp an elementary understanding of the important elements of Eastern Orthodoxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"Bishop Kallistos Ware does an excellent job of offering the reader a modern Orthodox catechism. The book presents theology in a way that is never stuffy and always enlightening. Non Orthodox readers will be impressed by the similarities of the basic trinitarian theology of the Orthodox church and other branches of Christianity whether it be Roman Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, etc. However, readers from other traditions will be challenged by the depth of mysticism in Orthodoxy and the emphasis on a serious relationship with God this side of heaven. Eastern Orthodoxy has a message for the rest of Christianity and this book delivers it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Random review","review":"A very good book, same with the first Elric. I can't rate it perfectly though as some of the stories have parts which sort of clash with my sense of taste ;) Though even then, if the elements seem bizarre to me, they fit in with Moorcock's multiverse and help paint it better. And some of the stories are simply excellent.I've introduced several friends (who normally don't read) to Elric and they've read the first text as well as the second. A good story with action elements with deep underlying themes, with fun stylistic device, but it's good even if you don't care about such things =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISJOINTED, CONFUSING, AND DISAPPOINTING.","review":"Elric of Melbone is a dark anti-hero who was portrayed perfectly in The White Wolf(WW). His dark and sorcerous soul was given solid definition. This book, Stealer of Souls(SOS), was an extra-dimensional nightmare that was fortunately easy to escape. In WW the journey of Elric had an undeniable flow that all great fantasies possess, but in SOS there was no firm plot that a reader could enjoy. Try as I might I could not stay interested in Elric's blundering about the Cosmos in search of Lord Knows What. The many small subplots could not generate enough concern about the characters. As hard as it was for me to do I could not finish this tedious tale of a once proud prince who has been reduced to a traveling sideshow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appears to be...","review":"According to D-link's website description of this product:The DWL-P100 Power Over Ethernet (POE) Adapters are accessory items designed to supply operational power to devices with an Ethernet port and power requirements that do not exceed 5 Volts/1 Amp.

Never mind the time line that even a two year old might notice.She is visited by The Scarecrow (Jermel Nakia) and Tin Woodman (Orien Richman).

There was NO reason for these cuts. Basically I bought it for the Doors \\"Light My Fire\\" video. Like most of the rock artists on the shows I remember the show vividly. Jim Morrison sang with a detached passion and virility that practically made the television smoke. They edited out about 45 seconds that literally contained the footage I bought the video to have.

I found myself caught up in the mines of England and could relate to the characters with Orwell's great descriptions. But the second half of the book was totallu different. It was Orwell writing a paper about how he felt about socialism and class destinctions in England. To some this may be a very appealing subject, but to me, I had trouble understanding what Orwell wanted to say to the reader. Part one of this book is great and I highly reccommend it, but once I began to read part two I had trouble picking the book up to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusually Dull.","review":"As the story goes, Orwell was engaged to write a story about the then massive unemployment in the North of England.The first few chapters recount Orwell's experience in a working-class boarding house and then underground with coal miners...and they are fascinating. Orwell's deft talent for recounting the subtle is well demonstrated in these compelling and often hilarious early chapters...and then it happens.Orwell's insights into class distiction are well known, and way too often shared, especially here. Orwell cheaps out by prattling on about why he thinks no one really wants true socialism and blah, blah, blah.Even cheaper(!), Orwell constantly references already written works to demonstrate his point. So much so, that any reader would be vastly better off reading Orwell's fabulous semi-biographical \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\" instead.If you decided to read this book, I think you can guiltlessly toss it aside after the coal mining recallections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outshines Animal Farm and 1984 by 10,000 WATTS","review":"This is an excellent book. After having to read in high school (in the 1970s) both Animal Farm and 1984, I confess that I approached this book with some trepidation. However, Orwell's descriptions of life as a coal miner and his honest thoughts about Socialism, both in defense and in criticism, make me wonder why the English teachers of the early 1970s didn't have us read this book instead. It is much better written and more honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives a fair view...","review":"of what he really saw. One thing that many readers might not know is that Orwell was commissioned to write this book as a way to support Socialism.

Theres a few places where the movie kind of gets off track, but the two main actors are good, the story is solid, and it has a visual quality lacking in a lot of urban movies that come out these days.

The ensemble plays together organically, with great fire, tenderness, and mischief where they are required.However, be warned that there is one major problem keeping this from being my favorite among modern recordings: in the A minor Quartet Op. 132, 1st movement, at a critical point the 1st violin plays the wrong note. This is in bar 246, beat two, where 1st is supposed to play a high G natural; instead he stays on E.

As a retired military officer myself, I assure you that portrayal was totally false. I was Air Force and we did not get as involved with the enlisted men as the Army and Navy did since most combat aircraft contain mostly Officer's.

Cash was a Southerner who wrote this book and then hanged himself. If you want to experience page after chapter after page of a man with complete self-loathing, then I recommend The Mind of the South, a book in which we learn much about Mr. Cash's mind in Cloud-Cuckooland, though next to nothing about the real South.

I thought that the characters were unevenly and unconvincingly drawn. The author seemed too enamored with her own lofty and pseudo-poetic prose (which was intermittently applied), and not sincere enough in giving each character a unique and appropriate voice. The writing style seemed to me to be awkwardly self-conscious and pretentious. Many points seemed somewhat plagiaristic or imitative to me. I had a hard time caring very much what happened to any of the characters, because they seemed so flat.

When it was rejected, he tore it up. But a copy was found in the 1920's and revived. Then on Moscow TV I watched Nikita Mikhalkov's great adaptation of it. It is so typical of Chekhov's images of the despondent and pointless life of Russian gentry in the late 19th century. It is full of contrasts at that time; fascinating, intellectual, and boring. The Russians in this pivotal time in Russian history seemed to find much in common and Chekhov is very much in style today. I have many favorite scenes.By Frederick R.

After a few chapters, the book no longer is about an accident. It is about Remington's character, his capacity to change and his willingness to do so.

The fact that I still gave it a 4 star rating, and read the book after seeing what the author did to the 2 prior books in the series gives you an idea how much I like his stories.The problem is that Kim Newman can't write a decent ending to save his life. The 3 books I've read in this series are all the same - great story, interesting characters, fascinating alternate history.

So recently when I found one of her books I hadn't read I was excited. However, I found this book lacking. Rose Frampton, the 15 year old main character, is based on Rinaldi's own grandmother, but she never fully materialized as a character to me. She was more like a shadowy outline that needed to be filled in. I certainly thought that the diary format would make it easier for us to get inside her head as she experienced major life changes, like her older sister marrying, and she herself marrying an older man from Brooklyn. At least it was on the shorter side."},{"rating":"2","title":"UVEX Hawk Sunglasses - the BEST","review":"My favorite sunglasses. They are all I wear.

Why must he call his work the same thing as someone else's work?

Debating, discussing or working with someone depends on having an honest colleague or rival to do it with, whatever you agree or disagree about. Nothing positive can come from cooperating with the dishonest. \\"Tolerating\\" the dishonest, in any non-political sense, means endorsing it -- voluntarily giving it the very credibility it does not deserve.

The very moment season one was released you knew there was a very good chance they'd package the complete series at a later date, and I'm very happy they did. Seinfeld was a great show.Sure, I bought a few of the individual seasons, and I'm going to buy the complete series set too, just so I can have all of them together, nice and neat. What's wrong with giving consumers more options? It would have been nice if the complete series was available for purchase when season one was released, but you know that wasn't going to happen.I imagine they'll make more money this way, releasing each season one at a time, but to think this was some evil plan purposely kept hidden to everyone is nuts.Again, Seinfeld was a great show.

First they release the individuals - then the boxset. It's basic capitalism unfortunately.Anyway I digress. Whether you have waited for this incredible compendium or are flip flopping back and forth trying to decide whether to buy the box set as well, let me say - HELLO! buy it!With the coffee table book thrown in, a very sleek and slender double DVD case for all of the discs, and the fact that Seinfeld has to be the greatest TV programme in history, this is an absolute no brainer!So in conclusion, if I haven't been clear - buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seinfeld The Complete Series","review":"I loved the whole package.

I'm a bit disappointed in the packaging and the ease with which it permanently smudges so I thought I might at least warn others."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever","review":"This will simply be one of the best DVD sets ever released. Maybe I understand some of the people out there who feel betrayed, but, as some others have said, you've chosen to buy or not to buy.

Also, the book that came with the set had some broken binding.If the gift was bought for me I would be happy that the DVD's were in good shape but, it was an anniversary give for my girlfriend and she was not pleased with the damaged goods.

Welcome to the utterly evil world of marketing and Sony's truly despicable goal of turning a profit. Get real.My gripe is this: the DVDs are terrible. They are of very low quality, episodes often freeze for seconds and do that crazy digital pixelation thing frequently. I got this as a Christmas present from my wife but soon returned it when I saw the state of the discs. Got a whole new set and they act pretty much the same way. And before you think it's my DVD player - I have about a 100 DVDs in my collection and they all play perfectly. I am a HUGE Sienfeld fan, which is why this is so annoying. Hence the 1 star rating.

The box set I bought was exactly what I was looking for. Purchasing this instead of attempting to track down all of the season box sets individually is well worth the extra money. The \\"coffee table book\\" it comes with is also a very nice addition to the package, it gives insight to the show that you could never obtain without it. In the future, sellers of this series box set should be aware of the potential for damage during shipment. The sleek black case that the series comes in is made of reinforced card board, making the corners very easy to crunch. My package came in a cardboard box and was not handled very well in transit. Any damage the cardboard box incurred transfered to the black case. It should be shipped in a reinforced box, maybe with packaging kernals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Seinfeld.. This set is great.. Misleading advertising though","review":"I was super excited to get this on the gold box deal of the day before christmas for $85. I am glad I didn't pay full price. The bonus features aren't all that really. The shows of course are awesome. What I was most disappointed in was that it said the official coffee table book. Well anyone that watches Seinfeld is expecting a book about coffee tables that folds out into a coffee table as Kramer designed it. Well it is a book abou Seinfeld. That's great and all but I think it is a little misleading. I have seen several reviews from people expecting the same thing I was.

It was so risque! I have been holding off buying these complete set for years, because it seems so self indulgent to do so. But I am so glad I did. I work from home, and having these episodes on while I work really makes the time fly. Plus they are so well put together you can watch them again and again. Seasons 1 and 9 aren't that great, but it's fun to see the show finds its way and Season 9 has more great moments than you might think. I say if it makes you feel good, do it!

The book is wonderful and includes a plethora of pictures and tidbits and gives the viewer a far better overview and guide to the show than simply buying the seasons.

He also displays here little of the misogyny and cultural chauvinism that makes the otherwise wonderful \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" sometimes hard to take.

Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznick, a man who is unable to sleep and who has become malnourished and emaciated. His inability to sleep causes him great trouble and leads him in and out of reality until he is brought back to the source - that which has caused his troubles and his insomnia: his guilt.Bale gives an unbelievable performance in this film. I can't imagine it ever being worth what he did to himself physically, though. He simply starved himself for the role. You would think this would have horrible repercussions (and I'm sure it did), yet he seemed to have made a full recovery by the time he played Bruce Wayne in Batman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"I am not a fan of Christian Bale, not anything specific just never really cared for him, however... this movie was fabulous!!!! His acting was superb!!!! When this movie ended I found myself saying wow Bale, I completely believed you in this role. Beautifully and cleverly done!

I had to give it a lower rating because people have hyped this movie to 4 stars out of 5, which it is not. It is an entertaining psychological thriller.

It was just weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best movie I've ever seen.","review":"I bought this movie for two reasons, Christian Bale is an amazing actor and the subject of insomnia strikes a chord in me because of my struggle with it personally. I have to admit my review is not nearly complete because I did not watch the entire movie. I just couldn't sit through any more of it. The movie failed to hold my attention despite my appreciation of Bale's usual incredible acting skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word, Wow","review":"\\"While walking down the stairs, the meatloaf smelled delicious.\\" this sentence sums up this move.

If you are a fan of outside thinking, than this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"in the mind of a nut case, with superlative acting","review":"Bale is a wonderful and amazing actor. His character, who is declining in a mysterious way, is at times creepy, charming, and full of potential as a person. But there is some kind of problem - as expressed by his seeming descent into insanity that is at the root of his freak out. This is a subplot that moves along with the weird symptoms, where the viewer doesn't necessarily know what is real. While this is not original, the acting makes it quite rivetting. I will not want to watch this again, but it was well worth it and frighteningly vivid.Recommended as excellent cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb movie","review":"This movie was very dull. It was one of those movies you only keep watching because you have too much time invested to not see the end. I don't understand why so many people like this movie. It reminded me of an artsy indie movie, that only movie snobs like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than counting sheep","review":"This movie--despite the hype you might hear to the contrary-is extremely boring-in fact I fell asleep watching it. A sluggish storyline does not equal suspense. I'll give Christian Bale credit for achieving the look of an anorexic released from a holiday in a concentration camp-it musn't have been an easy task--sort of a reverse \\"Super Size Me\\"Later, after waking I finished the second half of this movie--the result was lackluster.As a sidenote--a friend recommended this movie to me--I owe him!Not much more to say--if you're having trouble getting a good nights sleep--this movie may be the cure for what ails you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Machinist (DVD)","review":"Great movie. Hard to believe what C. Bale did to his body to make this film so realistic. Great photographic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION","review":"Do we have shades of David Lynch in Brad Anderson ? With threefilms to his credit (please see Session 9 and Happy Accident),we have among us a very talented Writer and Director. YOU MUSTSEE The Machinist. It is a WORK OF ART that is both disturbingand moving. You will not forget this film, and ChristianBale has a great deal to do with the beautifully disturbingidiosyncracies of this film which deals with guilt, retribution and redemption with psychological obssession and decay asa subtext and I won't say more about the plot.Forget Brokeback Nonsense and Hollywood pre-marketed drivel.If you are interested in artistry in film, then Brad Andersonis your man. Enjoy....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant performance.................................","review":"Director: Brad Anderson, Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Ironside, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, John Sharian.Christian Bale takes method acting to whole new extremes as he looses 60 pounds to play Trevor Reznick, a blue-collar machinist beleaguered by insomnia. Unable to sleep properly for almost a year, the deeply lonely Reznick is tormented by his colleagues after a momentarily lapse of concentration causes fellow worker, Miller to lose an arm. Since his only emotional release is a world-weary but compassionate prostitute (Jason-Leigh), Reznick's world slips into further decline when he's confronted by a brawny stranger called Ivan, who seems to know more about the machinist's life than he does himself.This thriller goes deep into a world of psychosis and terrible despair for Trevor--paranoia, suicidal thoughts and complete disengagement of body and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I hope Christian Bale's lost of weight was made under medical guidance, otherwise this was much irresponsability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt","review":"This movie is all about guilt.With a little touch of Hitchcock in the direction, I moved slowly through this movie to find at the end a terrifying tale about a lonely man that most of the people that surrounds him hate, but you, as the viewer will look at him with empathy.The film is about a machinist that starts living a nightmare of paranoia and hallucinations but all of it is a contradiction since he has not been able to sleep in a year. I guess that is why the fact of his insomnia leads everyone to see that this is all about guilt.Christian Bale is a great actor. One day he will be more recognize for his work. Most of the times, when you see a performance like this; it is link to a movie that was not made to be popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome film-noir atmosphere","review":"Christian Bale is terrific, as are the other actors in the film. The suspenseful mood and heavy atmosphere of this movie is fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"the incredible maniac bale","review":"wow,christian bale sure is extreme, going from big batman to that wreck in the machinist and back is very hard and unhealthy for your body, and no doubt your psychi as well.the movie is a must see tour de force, pulling you in deeper the longer it runs, just a 5 star piece of movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy macbeth","review":"out damn spot meets sexy dark drama, yes sexy.though lost in the \\"play\\", i couldn't stop appreciating bale's commitment to the arts. usually when i think of the actor in a movie while \\"immersed\\" in the story, it's a bad sign. in this case i appreciated his difficult achievement of the weight loss so much, it added to the fantasy. on this earth of \\"human bondage\\", this weight loss cannot have been a small feat. gratifying ending rewards your time deliciously. \\"who needs food?\\" give christian the \\"sexiest man alive\\" award for his otherworldly dedication. this man rivals with david bowie as a throb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little guilt goes along way","review":"I would suggest this film to everyone,what a twisted story.This is one of those movies you have to follow and then the last five minutes brings it all together.But because of this fact you can only watch it once. So i suggest renting it,instead of buying it.If you are reading this Tom Hall e mail me and i will explain the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most amazing acting jobs I have ever seen (4.5 stars)","review":"\\"Machinist\\" totally gobsmacked me. I've always been impressed with Christian Bale's acting abilities, but this time, he almost went too far. There's a quote in the movie, \\"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.\\" That really fits Bale's appearance. He's at 120 in this film and only stopped there because the directors were afraid for his health.Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has not slept for a year. He's seeing people at machines near him who don't work at his job, someone's breaking in to his apartment and leaving cryptic notes, everywhere he's seeing connections--but to what? Is it illusions caused from him not sleeping? Is it some kind of plot?The end shocked me--but it truly explained a lot. \\"Machinist\\" is one of the best-acted films I have seen in a long time--and the conclusion really did sneak up on me. Very impressed--but I'm classifying this film as a rental for me--I doubt I could see it more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome movie","review":"this movie is awsome. only a handful of actors will go to this length to play a part in a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark but a good story","review":"An interesting story about what it must be like to have dementia, paranoia, and insomnia at the same time. This is a fairly dark movie but in the end is an engaging story with an ending that brings everything together."},{"rating":"2","title":"all because of a stupid cigarette lighter...","review":"I really loved this movie. It has so many unique aspects to it. I don't want to repeat what all the other reviews have already said, so I'll just say that after I watched this movie the first time, I watched the special features(bonus material) and then I watched the movie again but with the Director's commentary activated. There isso much more you pick up on that way. Its an intriguing story with an interesting outcome.I watched this movie just after having seen \\"The Number 23\\" (with Jim Carrey) and I thought there were someinteresting parallels between the two stories. Granted, the two stories aren't overly similar, but there definitelyare parallels and similarilties.I'd definitely recommend this movie, but like I said, watch it first, then the bonus materials, then watch itagain with the director's commentary. There are some interesting subtleties that you learn about throughthe Director's commentary that you might not even notice otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) hasn't slept in a year. But he's a machinist, which is a dangerous job for someone who's mind is going. So what portion of the story is his nightmare, hallucination or whatever, what part is memory, and what really happened the way it is presented to the audience? An interesting question if the truth is eventually figured out. All I can say is that this is the poor man's \\"Number 23.\\" We never do find out exactly what is real and what isn't, even when Trevor finally says to Ivan, who has been haunting him, \\"I know who you are.\\" He doesn't tell the audience!!!The other thing I hated was that Trevor was so skinny he looked like he was just released from Auschwitz. Various people ask if he's OK, but he says he is. Clearly he is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Idea Executed Poorly","review":"The film fails to create a bond between the viewer and Bale's character until the very end, when it's too late to enjoy. Perhaps watching it for a 2nd time might be better, but it would hard to watch it again because of the stupid insertion of the role of IVAN, a character poorly drawn and awkwardly portrayed in the film. And then there's the ridiculous scene when Bale, after having been crushed by a car, runs away from the police. Simply absurd. But when we know what Bale has done to bring on inscrutable insomnia, much of the film comes together a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand these great reviews","review":"This movie is absolutely dreadful. My wife and I wanted to turn it off after 15 minutes, but I hung in there because of the stellar reviews on Amazon.The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere. This movie is a mystery with really bad awful clues to advance the story. The \\"twist\\" is such a let-down. I actually said, \\"Really?\\" when it was over.Wow, so Christian Bale was grotesquely skinny. Big deal. Not worth buying just for that... we've seen him do this a few times, and word is that he's getting freakishly thin YET again for another movie, Concrete Island. Maybe that one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The only think shocking about this movie is how think Bales became. He looked as if he just came out of a prisoner of war camp. The whole thing didn't make sense. Another wanna be mind bender that didn't work. I could not figure out how his bosses didn't know he was sick and let him continue to work there doing dangerous work. A complete waste of time. The movie Repulsion with Catherin Deneuve was so much better in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bale lost weight. So what?!","review":"Bale must have lost his mind! (no, not completely: he signed for Batman, and that is a very CLEVER movement...). He lost so much wight for a movie that did not deserve it. Useless piece of filmmaking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"Right upfront, let me tell you that I didn't enjoy watching this movie one bit. We've all seen it. It used to be shocking and smart, but now it's been done so much that it's dumb and predictable. Let's have a whole lot of random odd things happen and in the end it will turn out the guys nuts. It's just not a twist any more. You can now see it coming and you now say, \\"What, not this again.\\" If this picture has any meaning to it or is trying to make a point about something, I sure didn't get it. The movie doesn't let you know what is happening until the last few minutes of the film, so it requires that you sit through almost an hour and a half wondering what is going on.The dark gloomy atmosphere, together with the dark gloomy characters in the film help make it even more unpleasant. We know something is going on, but there is no hint of it until the movie is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled Jumble of a Film","review":"The cinematography was great but unfortunately that alone a worthy movie does not make.

Very depressing also.I would skip this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"---You can't hide from yourself---","review":"In the Machinist, Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as a man with insomnia and severe delusions. This is a dark and rather disturbing film and not for everyone!To perfect his role, Bale lost over 60 pounds and that itself is depressing. He is such a wonderful actor; however, I feel compelled to say that no movie is worth an actor's health. Perhaps losing 20 pounds, wearing lose clothing and heavy makeup would have been sufficient for Bale's role in this film. I hope to see this young man around for years and many more films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Came fast,","review":"Bought because the price for a single pair was pretty high. They came fast are were satisfactory: The posts are metal and the wing nuts seem to be pressed from a sheet.

I have had the camera since it first came out (about a year ago). There are much fewer color options than other cameras produced at the same time and earlier than the F450. In fact, you basically have your choice of color or black & white. Although the pictures look normal once you upload them to your computer, on the LCD display they will look like a reddish haze. That's if you use the flash. Pictures are impossible to take without flash. They will be unusably blurry. Which means you will end up with red eye even when you're in a brightly lit place where you wouldn't normally need to use the flash. Less than a month after I bought it, the camera began \\"sticking\\". I turn it off and the zoom doesn't retract. So I have to turn it on and off again to be able to safely put it away.This camera was a huge mistake - Fujifilm's for making and selling it, and mine for buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it!","review":"I'd never heard of this lady before a TV programme about her but this was my loss.

For the most part, I feel she achieved this end, I for one am convinced. I wish she wrote more on Goya's technique and his personal life, both of which she does not go into much. The 300 or so colour reproductions of Goya's work are excellent, and there are many good close-ups. Unfortunately, Goya produced around 1,800 works, so it is disappointing that only a fraction of them are in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat outdated, but good book","review":"Unfortunately, most would never seek out this book unless you've gotten bad news that you or someone close to you has Macular Degeneration.

Wahlberg fits the bill to a T in this flick and his acting chops have improved wonderfully in the past few years, a great job, although I think the fact that the character wasn't much of a stretch was part of it. An out of work teacher gets a shot in the NFL, and makes it -- even if only on special teams -- a rousing true to life story with a very well worked screen play that added enough elements to make it a great movie without completely diluting the actual events and story.

That being said, it is still a great story, shot beautifully on the streets of South Philly, with an understated, yet powerful performance by Mark Whalberg as Vince. I got the opportunity to hang with the REAL Vince Papale during the shoot, and he was simply overwhelmed by the experience of a hollywood studio producing a story of a portion of his life. The DVD also has a nice 30 minute documentary of how it all came together as a film, and the soundtrack is great for those of us who grew up during that time period.Academy Award material? No, but a nice feel-good story with some great football action shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie.","review":"Beer and football, need I convince you further to see this movie?

It has the further benefit of being based on a real person's life and experience. In some ways it is Dick Vermeil's story as well as Vince Papale's. Both are embarking on long-shot careers. The fact that we know how Vermeil's will turn out provides reassurance that Vince's will turn out well also. A sweet and engaging film about individual aspiration, family, neighborhood, and friendship. Watch it with your kids without any fear of embarrassment. How often can you say that today?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope and dreams","review":"A good feel good movie about a man overcoming his circumstances (many out of his control). A well tempered performance by Mark Wahlberg, who continues to show growth as an actor.

But we love better the (what I think is the original version of it), 'Family Songbook, 137 songs to play and sing' by Tony Fiyalko. We love it better because the arrangements are more complex and exciting - more like what the big bands play, yet not that much harder to play. As the song selection in the two books is almost identical, both are superb. Actually, a couple of the songs are exactly the same arrangment. The worst thing about having both books is the occasional key changes from book to book - it hurts my fingers.This is a very good book - like all of the Reader Digest song books. It only looses marks because of the direct comparison to Tony Fiyalko's book, which is also available in paperback on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better condition than advertised!

Beatrice was a good Princess and a good daughter, wife & mother (in that order, actually), and an intelligent woman who was molded by her straightlaced upbringing as the youngest child of her mother, Queen Victoria. There is a particularly interesting appendix regarding Prince Alexander of Battenberg, his reign as Prince of Bulgaria, and the Princess Victoria of Prussia, which has information that I'd never seen in any other book.

I couldn't put it down. Having read this book, I have a new appreciation for Madeleine Albright as a woman who raised her children and then started a career which took her to the top. Dobbs is deeply sensitive to this, and you get the feeling that even as she climbs the ladder to her ultimate success, she wonders whether she is up to the job that lies ahead. Don't we women all have this experience at one time or another, even as we stop what we are doing to raise our children? Dobbs seems to have presented Albright with the only family tree she has even seen. He found branches of her family she never knew existed. The tragedy which befell her family in the Holocaust is not in vain - at the end of a century which molded and shaped her family, she has found them all again. A riveting story and it's beautifully written - I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Dobbs deserves credit for breaking the story of Albright's Jewish roots. but this book is little more than a collection of previously published stories that draws no new conclusions. I read another Albright biography, Seasons of Her Life, that was better written and contained lots of fresh material about this fascinating woman. I would recommend it over this Dobbs book without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn apart like UT's defense on a run play","review":"The size says fits all, but it would not go on my 1999 Ford F150 steering wheel.

The other three tracks are more staight jazz tunes that evolve into the same idea.Free Jazz can be amazing when well planned, but here, there is no backdrop or counterpoint draw you in. There is a reason Coltrane always had Tyner comping behind him; free playing has to work against other instruments for it to be interesting. Otherwise, \`you are boxing with air (which, by the way, i did in my drinking days, and this is not too productive, either)This is not the worst album in the world, but listen to Fire Music and then tell me this is up to Shepp's brillance. I don't beleive that.Amazing cover, though. If you are going to buy this, try and get the 1967 ABC Vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs big, but sooo soft and cozy","review":"These run big but are so nice and soft.

Great concept, and as a mom of 3 I can honestly say I wish I'd have found these with my other two. Be advised though, these do run big. If you have a petite baby, you'll probably want to size down.

The previous reviewers have done a good job detailing the differences, so I have nothing to add there.If you are a fan of western fiction, you'll not be bored,and Henry is an established name in the genre.

They are sturdy enough to do the job without much play or bending. They are lightweight, grips are comfortable. I purchased 2 spatulas, I believe I can get a few years out of them before replacing.

It's only about 210 pages but mercifully, most pages don't contain a lot of text. So it's easy on the eyes, and easy on the mind. I agree whole-heartedly with the author's premise that the pace of life has sped up because of what he calls \\"macro-realities,\\" a sort of mega-trends that are here now and continue to impact every element of our lives. Buy this book for yourself and for people you care about. It'll give you insights and perspectives that are unique and vital.

The only issue I have with the game is that it's to hard, and gets you mad easily. When you first get the game it's like the best game you've ever owned. But then. As you progress through the game it's gets exremely hard. What makes me really get pi$$ed off at the game is when it says \\"tap a butten\\". It's supposedly supposed to get you out of a pin quicky. Of course you sit there beating the buttons down and nothings happening. Thats my only problam with the game, other than that its a very good game.Most people should like it. I would not get this game though if you get angry at games easily. I also suggest you get four controlers when you get this game also. Not for multiplayer but so you have extras if you break one like i did(i'm not just trying to be funny either)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first fighting/wrestling hybrid is a blast","review":"This game is great. The graphics are top notch & the game engine is 2nd to none. The moves are fluent without glitches. You have a whole cast of colorful charatcers. There are 39 total. Not 45 like the game ads suggest. The best thing in the game are the finishing moves. I love the slo mo poundings. They are very outragoues & extreme. Getting GF's is nice too..:) The bad parts are tag team matches. (Awful & confusing) No creating your own charater. (bummer) Lack of modes & weapons. Still its worth the 50.00 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wrestling Game Ever!","review":"This is the best wrestling game I have even played and I have played alot of 'em. First off, the controls are easy to learn and use during gameplay and they give you the option to go through a tutorial just in case you're new to the genre. There is also a pretty decent story mode which is usually lacking in wrestling/fighting games. The graphics and sound are pretty solid. I have read reviews that said unless you are into rap music you can skip this title...I totoally disagree. I don't generally like rap music and I found this game wildly entertaining.Finally, the game is a little on the easy side. I finished with relative ease and little headache. But I believe it has pretty good replayability in that you can play the story line with 4 different characters developing their skills along the way and the versus mode is sure to be a hit with all your friends over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"I wonder who was the genius who came up with the idea of glorifying and incorporating hip-hop style violence into a video game whose target audience is made up of teenagers?

Kids love Thomas-not just for the characters-but because it is predictable in setting and style. Yet new stories make it fresh each time. The new animation makes their mouths move like Jay Jay the Jet Plane-not like Shrek. The original Thomas stories were grounded in music and a great narrator's voice telling the story. It is too bad they have once again \\"fixed\\" something that was not broken. I wish they would stop trying to take things over the top. Our kids don't need it. I agree with the other reviewer who gave it one star. My son got very upset and demanded that we turn it off.

The only thing I do not like is the ergonomics: learning to zoom smoothly takes a while. I cannot change the options for the movie, or even add a backlite when filming in the sun without taking my hands off the camera, looking for the button and activating it.

So what happens? That's right--Sony gets more of my money.If you are using a PSOne, get a trustworthy 3rd party memory card (InterAct ones work well and hold good amounts).

Not a replicate of idols(ideals), but a product of his influences. You can hear as much Coltrane as you can Sun Ra and above all you can hear Pharoah. Moaning, Screaching, wailing and a nice (mellow)melody, that you cant wear out. A leader through example and as small as crickets in the dead of night. What do you think?

The japanese language is set to music about commonplace events like going to the zoo, surviving a rainy day, etc. The problem is that the songs are not catchy at all and don't keep the attention of children. The scenes, themselves, are not riveting enough to do it either. Therefore, little ones don't stay in the room to learn anything. My kids are eight years old and very vested in learning Japanese, but they watched the video one and a half times, then put it away forever. When I asked them what they learned, they replied that they didn't know. Unsuccessful for kids in this age group.

I can definitely feel the difference, especially with the 17 gauge strings. This synthetic gut is a pretty popular choice on some tennis forums I visit, and I would recommend it as a starting place for those who are starting to experiment with strings, as synthetic guts are one of the most popular types of strings. Definitely has a different feel, and once you get used to it, you will see an improvement in your game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"I bought this tripod for my 2-week trip to Asia last summer and had it in my backpack the whole time. I never felt the \\"weight\\" of the tripod at all. It took mere seconds to \\"assemble\\" and \\"disassemble\\". To assemble, you just pull each leg all the way out; to disassemble, you just push each of the legs in.The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars was because a couple of times, one of the legs wouldn't stay extended and start to tilt when I'm setting up the shots. Granted, I was using the compact Sony DSC-T9 digital camera. If it was a SLR camera, this tripod will definitely not be able to support the weight.Again, for compact digital camera and compact trip on a walking/hiking trip, it's a great tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christianity the Way it was Intended from the Beginning","review":"Years ago I had a copy of a book that documented the move of the Holy Spirit since the first century to the present. It was loaned out and never returned and because it was privately published I could never find another. For years I have prayed for someone to write the truth how the gifts of the Spirit never really stopped down through the centuries. This is the book that I prayed to be written. Eddie L. Hyatt researched and documented how the gifts of the Spirit continued for the past two millenium and the revivals that broke out in spite of the persecutions the Spirit filled Christians endured. Every Christian needs to read this book to understand that the dry stale so called Christian church of the modern and postmodern era is not the real church that Jesus died for. The miracle working power of the Holy Spirit is still touching the Church. I am buying another so I can have a loaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acts and Beyond","review":"I've often wondered how the Church developed after Acts in the Holy Bible.

Starting from \\"Flying home\\", the songs just go on and on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, even for people who hate baseball","review":"A fascinating cultural history disguised as sports lore. I bought this book because I'd seen it quoted in several other books about Japan that I had greatly enjoyed. Even though it turned out that I knew several of the best anecdotes, I still found the book to be wonderful in its evocation of how a different culture approaches something as all-American as baseball. (The aside about British tutors having to teach their charges baseball instead of rounders or cricket during the 1870s made me laugh. How odd.) The book seems a bit dated, with some of the stereotypes that mark the bubble years still in evidence. But Whiting's prose and research combine to make it a solid and accessible contribution to popular writings about Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"This book is a fun read about American players in Japan. From my experience seeing a game in Japan, it is a bit dated, but I'm glad I read it beforehand. It gets repetitive at the end. The chapter about translators is a hoot!

Because of this, Benny, in this live performance, did not have to bow to the demands of the \\"whiter\\" side of his audience who wanted a more popular sound instead of a sound that was artistically superior; i.e. jazz. While performing many standard tunes, Benny captures the flavor of jazz far more than in a greatest hits CD, and, in my opinion, sounds better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hair metal","review":"If your a big fan of motley crew ,you should love this album.It has fun lyrics and great guitar plating.It hard to tell these guys oringally came ftom japan,imported rock and roll at its best.Love bomb is the standout cut ,but all these songs rock,except a couple.My opinon on this buy it,it wont let you down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This movie is so funny!

The entire movie is a series of funny quips and happenings, making the movie-watcher laugh until their sides ache. Class Reunion is set in an old closed-up school where they are currently having their class reunion, and the people are hilarious, from the snobs to the exchange student from Transylvania. Suddenly people start getting murdered, and the entire party breaks up to find the culprit. The ending is quite a surprise, and I think you will enjoy it as much as I do. There are a few big names in this movie, but at that time they were so young, it's strange to see them. All in all, this movie is great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it. Compared to all the other National Lampoon movies, I would say it is most like Animal House with it's comedy. I would rate it as one of the classics of the 80's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal House this in not!","review":"What an unbelievably crappy John Hughes movie. There I said it. The storyline is boring, the high school looks like a set from a '30's Dracula movie and the actors should have been paid more for having to put up with such an unbelieveably stupid script. This goes to show all of us that just because a movie has the National Lampoon production credit doesn't mean a thing. Trading on Animal House's popularity, this movie does a great discredit to anything related to NatLamp. Gerrit Graham was great in Used Cars............in this fiasco he just sucked.If you say you got some laughs from this movie you're either eight years old or have some issues with what is paraded about as \\"comedy\\".

As a Westerner who has spent time visiting through the South and making Southern friends while doing so, and listening to their stories, too, this book is thoroughly engrossing, both with the sadnesses and humor that characterize the South.

I enjoyed it quite a bit and so when Lemmings 2 came out I bought that game as well. It was a huge improvement over the original with tons of different styles of Lemmings to use. This Lemmings revolution game is a big step backward. There are only a few types of Lemmings to use and the interface seems fairly clunky. It is not intuitive how to scroll around the giant cylinder trying to watch the Lemmings doing their endless march. If you have never played Lemmings then you might enjoy this game, but if you have then go back and play your old version instead of buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work well","review":"Even though the case says Windows98/XP, the manual says Windows 95/98. this game keeps stopping on my XP computer. I really thought it would use more advanced technology - it's so antiquated. And I agree, the circular format gets old after awhile.

Yet it was not to be.Expecting a great read after enjoying Sarah Tuckers \\"Playground Mafia\\", I found this book to be a waste of my precious time. I found it to be a story lacking any real plot or a main character that I liked, let alone emphathised with.

Joe Ryan just seems too good to be true, and why would he want to be with a woman ten years older than himself? It would seem Hazel's worst enemy is herself.Though there are a few bright moments, for the most part, this seems to be a fairly plotless story. Joe is too much of a beta hero. If he and Hazel go dancing, I'd expect her to lead.

Sure, his earlier work on Columbia (think \\"Mingus Ah Um\\") was truly special, but nothing I've heard captures the spirit of this tortured master quite as well. The compositions are Trane-like: frenetic, ethereal, abstract, haunting. While recording for Impulse!, these two should have gotten together.If you're not familiar with free jazz and the avant-garde, this album will be a wake-up call. Mingus had previously worked the standards routine in his own deranged kind of way (think \\"The Complete Town Hall Concert\\" on Blue Note), but this album certainly shows that there was something brewing underneath.

Here, he cast aside all the restrictions of both genres and meshed the two into an unbelievably complex, and yet emotionally and musically stunning magnum opus. Unlike Mingus' previous albums, rather than being merely a showcase for different tunes which may have had little to do with eachother melodically and structurally, this cd comprises the six movements of a symphony, and the music and ideas flow into eachother seamlessly. My favorite moment comes during the third track, \\"Group Dancers\\" when, after Mingus hints at an amazing melodic figure on the piano, the full ensemble plays it in all its glory. Anyone who loves music is missing something if he or she has never heard this milestone of melodic ingenuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars are not enough","review":"If you are a fan of jazz, real jazz, and you have not heard this album, slap yourself now.

I'd like to add a few more stars to this rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, we know you're intelligent.","review":"I hate to disagree with my Fellow Readers, but I found this to be an insufferable diatribe about how intelligent the author is. Yes, we know she was an early reader. Yes, we know she had a terrific vocabulary by the age of 7. I was so tired of hearing how bright this child was that I found it hard to finish the book. As an American Educator, I found her mother's quote insulting as well; \\"American schools don't know how to deal with kids as bright as you are.\\" Give me a break; we are trained to enrich as we are trained to remediate~her experience shouldn't be fodder for such an unfair generalization. Maybe she should have elected to edit her mother's comment or leave it out altogether. At any rate, I have better things to do with my summer vacation than finish this essay. I did enjoy some of the snippets into Indian and ashram life so if you can get by this author's attempt to hit you over the head with her brilliance, it may be worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and wise","review":"This book has everything one could hope for in a memoir: information, entertainment, and enlightenment. The author's childhood in remote India would be horrifying in anybody else's telling; she manages to make it both horrifying and funny.

I am happy to say that his fans are right.This, the first Dirk Pitt story, is crisply told, full of accurate history (except some questions about a type of jet) and best of all, ends with several intricate and surprising twists.If you like action, history and mystery with a compelling prime character, all well written without an over-abundance of gore or other cheap narrative tricks, you will really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediterranean Caper","review":"As usual Cussler in Mediterranean Caper keeps the reader on edge til the end .

I concur. I think I would have dismissed Cussler forthright. Sure, all of his stuff is contrived, but with a professionalism that is so much more irresistible. How could he have advanced so rapidly and corrected his later style so completely? Did he really write this one, or was he fixing a car engine while that junior high student took over?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is by far the worst of the Dirk Pitt novels, I have read many of them and in my opinion this was almost as though an undersexed high school student had written it. Don't bother buying it if you have read other cussler novels this one will surely disapoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"this author is not up to Clive Cussler standards in any sense.

This means that when I consider something worth getting into, I do it from the start, and I acquire everything related to it. In the case of fiction, I begin by reading an author's work chronologically. When I decided to get into Cussler, judging from generally good reviews and my fondness for thrillers, I started with his first book \\"Pacific Vortex!\\" and have just finished this one, \\"The Mediterranean Caper\\". I have come to realize rather quickly that Cussler could not have built his reputation with these early works, because they are quite dreadful. I'm hoping things get a lot better as I read through his subsequent efforts.This book is as bad as the one- and two-star reviews have made it out to be. But I read it with the same curiosity that one would watch a cheesy 'B' movie, and basically to witness the evolution of a great writer across the years. Onward then, to \\"Iceberg\\" and hopefully the writing improves steadily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun entertaining book","review":"Can't go wrong when picking up a Clive Cussler book.

I am disappointed in the Pitt character - seems unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is really rivating.","review":"I thought this book was really well written,even though it is one of his earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun story, badly written","review":"It's a decent enough yarn but atrociously written. The protagonist Dirk Pitt is a James Bondish action caricature, and the dialogue is cliched and corny. People behave and speak in laughably unnatural ways: within an hour of meeting the female lead on an Aegean beach, Pitt slaps her smartly in the face for dwelling excessively on her dead husband. She comes to her senses, and within minutes they're making love on the beach. I'm serious - it's that dumb.If there were no other authors working this genre, I might be inclined to give Cussler another try, but as it stands there are too many out there who can write a good story AND a good sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I like all CUSSLER booksThis is an early one but still enjoyable. I recommend CRescent Dawn and Poseidon's Arrow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Dirk Pitt is Kind of a Jerk","review":"This early version of Dirk Pitt is pretty foul. He is written as a disrespectful jerk to both his friends and to women. Glad he matured in the later books. The story is interesting- but he is a hero that is difficult to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Excellent service. Some books arrived 2 days after I placed the order. Incredible. It is hard to believe it can be done so efficiently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good; not Cussler at his best.","review":"If this had been the first Cussler book I had read I would never have read another. Dirk Pitt was a jerk. I didn't like the \\"hero\\" at all; never did. I don't recommend this to anyone unless they are dye-hard fans of Cussler (and I am)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Cussler's Best Work","review":"I nearly gave this three stars because of one annoyance. At the end of the story you get all the details courtesy of a long monologue (its almost tiresome). Up to that point this is really a good story. It starts out with a bang, and keeps on going. Actually if Cussler had played out the details he reveals in the monologue in a different way, he could have added another 50 pages and made this story really well formed. Given this was written in 1973 I suppose we can forgive Pitt for his smoking cigarettes. I found that the story still translated well to 2009, its not like I was saying \\"back in the old days they did it like that...\\". If you're already a Cussler fan, then this is a must read to get the full development of Dirk Pitt over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but certainly not his best","review":"I PICKED THIS BOOK UP AFTER reading 4 other cussler novels. I wasn't disappointed, but this this book just doesn't grip you like the others. It is less involved and the ending was quick. A good read for a train or plane, it is short and goes quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let this be your first Cussler book","review":"Look, this is a very early work - and the edges are really rough. The writing is pretty stilted. The plot plays games with the reader. The attitude towards women is really wretched. It isn't a terribly good book by any measure. Read this book if you are already a Cussler fan and you want to explore his early works. Don't read this as your first exposure to Cussler. You might well not give him a second chance - and some of his other books are really quite good. My personal favorites are _Raise the Titanic_ and _Night Probe_. Those are also pretty early efforts, but even a couple of books past _The Mediterranean Caper_ he had settled down into a pretty darned effective writer who could tell a good tale without totally annoying the average reader. If you already gave this book a try and hated it - try one of the above two before you give up on Cussler entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediterranean Caper","review":"I am a Clive Cussler Fan and normally love his Dirk Pitt books but this one I did not like because the Dirk character was very different than I am used to. He angered very easily,swore a lot and was not a likable person. It was one of Clive's earlier novels and I guess the character Dirk Matured in his later novels. I do not recommend this book to anyone but read his later ones they are great!I have read at least 20 of Clive's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediterranean Caper","review":"This can't be a Clive Cussler book!!! Thankfully I have read all other books by him and his \\"ghosts\\" This one was wretched! Pitt was a foul mouth rapist with few redeeming features.

Do NOT read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dated...","review":"This was my first Cussler novel, and while I liked the plot, I felt that it was not well-written. In addition to being somewhat offensive to women, the narrator used trite expression after trite expression. Really it was irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon misleading marketing","review":"This was Cussler's first Dirk Pitt novel. I would not have bought this if I had not been mislead by Amazon. On your website, you represent this book as published in 2004. It was actually first published in 1973. I read most of the Dirk Pitt early novels and as the character has progressed, he is much more entertaining. In closing, I would have never bought this novel if you had accurately stated it was first published in 1973. If you search my buying history, I am a regular customer. Shame on Amazon for this misleading marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for the price","review":"It's not a bad price for the complete set, but the performance level matches the price.

All of my white cables, chargers and the exterior of my macbook are now stained with the red dye and are a permanent pink color.

The inside is a red suede that makes it really easy to find things in and it has a ton of pockets for organization. I have no trouble carrying my power cable and wireless mouse. There are also pockets that I can put my mP3 and cell phone in. The only problem I have is that it can be a little bit cumbersome if carrying it in a crowded area and can be uncomfortable on the shoulders if you have to carry it for a long period of time. Other than that, I absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Large","review":"I was so excited to get this bag, which I expected to be stylish and professional...however, it just looked like a very plain and huge purse.

I realized I needed a second spray bottle so I ordered this Easy Traveler Envirosprayer. To be honest, I transfer my hair stuff into this bottle ASAP because it sprays better--very evenly and it doesn't clog. Plus it's the right size for getting through security at the airport and best of all, just like the rest of Easy Traveler's bottles, it does not leak.I had a question so I emailed Easy Traveler and got a phone call back within 10 minutes--now that is good customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your standard Shirley Horn record, but still great","review":"According to the liner notes, Shirley herself doesn't think much of these recordings, but I love them. These are VERY different from any other Horn records I have heard. Either she hadn't settled into her own style yet, or, more likely, the producers wouldn't let her do her own thing. (They wouldn't even let her play piano, according to the liner notes.) She never digs in emotionally to the extent that she does on later albums, and there are a few tracks that should have stayed in the vault. BUT! That's OK, because some of this stuff swings like MAD, and its a particular breed of swing that Shirley never bothered with again, even though she could obviously tear it up.If you're looking for your first Shirley Horn record, try my favorite: Live at Vine Street: I Thought About You. Then check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truck Step Review","review":"Bestop 7510101 Black Power Step Running BoardsThe power step running boards by Bestop are excellent.

I'm not much of a reader of American Westerns, but I found The Revenant to be an interesting mix that is not easily placed in any obvious genre - it is part historical fiction but also part Undaunted Courage, part Into Thin Air. In some ways, it reminded me of survival stories that I loved as a kid (e.g., Island of the Blue Dolphins), and it is a fast-paced, entertaining read. In other ways, however, it is a very intelligent, nuanced examination of human nature - never heavy-handed and surprisingly moving. I also highly recommend it as a gift for those readers who profess never to read novels because they are \\"too boring\\": the story includes great historical detail about, among other things, the fur trade, Mountain Men, outdoor survival skills, and the incredible natural terrain of the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing the early west alive","review":"This thrilling, gripping novel brings to life the adventure and drama of the West in the 1820s, the era of the fur trappers. Based on the true story of Hugh Glass, a trapper who sought revenge after being left for dead by his colleagues following a bear mauling. The writing is vivid and compelling and, well, you'll have a hard time putting it down. Michael Punke has obviously done his research, too, because the reader practically can feel what it must have been like to have been on the Missouri River in the 1820s. Probably the best novel about the early West since Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Summer Adventure Novel","review":"Not only is The Revanant a compelling story about revenge, but it also is a story about the overwhelming human survival instinct, particularly in early frontier America. The historical story of Hugh Glass is amazing in and of itself, but The Revanant brings it to life. The book graphically describes the seemingly insurmountable obstacles faced by trapper Hugh Glass, first in trying to survive, then in seeking vengeance. You can almost feel Hugh Glass' shattered body.In addition to being a gripping story, The Revanant literally transports you to the wild, unpredictable American West of the 1820's. It is impeccably well researched with extensive and fascinating historical detail. This detail, combined with great writing and an incredible story results in a perfect adventure novel for any summer reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugh Glass would roll over in his grave","review":"If you enjoy the story of Hugh Glass and like at least a little historical accuracy, then don't read this book. It takes the story of Glass and makes a comedy of the entire struggle. I had to force myself to read the book and hoped that it would get better as it goes. Not so! The book takes a fantastic struggle of the west and makes it so fictious that it makes one cringe as you read it. I gave my copy away rather than take someone's money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nexus of Western thought and culture","review":"The syncopated strands of post Hegelian logic, the allusions to a neo structuralist synthesis of deductive reason, the pure, demonstrative joy of economics and the evocative portrayal of Shylockian ethics characterize this paragon of modern ingenuity. A compelling vaunt through basic monetary policy no American should dare miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent book","review":"This book isnt the greatest book ever on borrowing money...but its up there.

I would just like to remind everyone that John Rocker is a proven racist and homophobe, and by purchasing this movie, you are supporting his oppressive views. I have not seen this movie, and refuse to spend money on it. Although Rocker is a handsome man, I cannot hear his name or see his face without his racist comments about Asian drivers or having to ride the train next to \\"some queer with AIDS\\" resonating in my ear, and I hope it is the same for you.From what my boyfriend tells me, Rocker's baseball career is circling the drain. If we will all ignore this attempt by Rocker to remain in the public eye, maybe he will go away for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OFF THEIR ROCKER","review":"Admittedly, casting Atlanta Braves' bad boy John Rocker as a serial killer was an inspired piece of casting. However, big John is hardly in the film at all. Which means we're left with a cast of really bad actors running around in their bathing suits and what not, and even with some innovative methods of offing the victims, THE GREENSKEEPER breaks no new ground in the art of film-making. There are, however, some priceless lines: having three of the boytoys named Chad, Chet and Chuck (or something like that); when one of the bimbos has to cancel her vacation because the island is being taken over by guerillas, she innocently says \\"I didn't even know they had a zoo.\\"A lame, tired rip off of all the slasher movies you've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"How have I lived before seeing this movie?","review":"Loved it. John Rocker, Steve Rickman, Larry Wachs and even Eric Von Hessler were excellent. I have never seen anyone give the finger as well as Eric.

The scenes he was in were the best of the whole movie. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls flat.","review":"I have seen The Paleface with Bob Hope and Jane Russell and I LOVE that movie but this weird sequel/remake does NOT cut it--AT ALL. Roy Rogers is a charming addition and the few musical moments were somewhat entertaining but I don't get what this film was supposed to be. It's named Son of Paleface thus saying that it is a sequel but the storyline doesn't line up then. And if it were a remake of the original Paleface, then it completely falls flat in that department. The plot isn't very good and the chemistry wasn't there with Jane's character and Hope's which is what one would expect from the 2 main characters. It wasn't even entertaining enough to keep me awake past the first 20 minutes during my first viewing. And the second time I tried to watch this, I turned it off after 45 min. I LOVE old Hollywood films and Bob Hope but this was a huge disappointment. If you want to see a GREAT and charming Hope comedy watch The Paleface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of Paleface (Bob Hope)","review":"Very funny movie but when purchasing remember you require a multi zone DVD player to play them if you live in other countries"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old Bob Hope comedy","review":"I saw this movie many years ago on screen at old movie house.

I decided to look it up on Amazon and have it in my collection. After viewing it with an 'adult eye', it stands the test of time. Hope performs like a true Vaudivillian. It's a laugh a minute. Jane Russell and Roy Rogers are a good supporting cast. And I believe it was Roy Rogers best role. Too bad that he was the cowboy who never kissed the girl. He had the potential to be a real romantic lead, which the film bears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son of Paleface","review":"It's like watching a cartoon comic but with real human actors! A very funny movie. Another reason why the humour is so intense is because the funny things that happen take place within a rather serious plot, so the humour comes when you least expect it.

And I'm a big fan of romantic suspense novels. However, I was very disappointed with this book. My main criticism is that the story moved veeeeerrry slowly. I loved the concept of this \\"deb\\" making something of herself and trying to join the CIA, but it just wasn't exciting. Even when the book got into the \\"mission\\" part, there's was no action or excitement. It was all gathering intel, reconnoitering with their backup, etc. Another drawback to the story was that the romance was practically nonexistant. You get a feeling from the heroine that she is attracted to the hero, but see nothing reciprocated. And then all of a sudden, they fall into each other's arms. What?? I felt like, what did I miss? I'm sorry to be the only negative review for this book, but I felt it had to be said. The story did pickup a little toward the end, but it was like pulling teeth to get through the first 2/3 of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would buy another one.","review":"I had the SD card version before this and loved it.

Can't name them in reviews, but both are tough enough not to flex when pushed with your thumb, one could be stood on. Both have steel pins built into both the hinge and the clasp, and do not rely on plastic being bent over and over and over as a structural part. Both of them will stay not only floating in water, but held under water for 10-15 minutes with no leakage.Good luck to those that did not think my original review mentioning water proofing as being important.

While a little bulky, it definitely feels like our cards are protected: not only is the case made of hard plastic and snaps shut, the cards are housed in individual pockets made of hard rubber.

City of Van murderings before July 10 1915- And after Russion armies invation of Eastern provinces. Never mensions killing their own patriach in Istanbul , cause he did not agree with dashnac organization. Could be a very good book if he was objective. Unfortunatly failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author used Forgeries!","review":"The author Vahakn Dadrian (who is clearly biased because he is an Armenian nationalist and receives grants from the Armenian government) has used the forgeries called the Aram Andonian (an Armenian's forgeries) documents. These forgeries were used throughout the book to prove a thesis that the Ottoman Turks who allowed religious freedoms and minority rights to the Armenians were somehow evil masterminds comparable to the Nazis--this is absurd. His work is not scholarly; it is filled with propaganda, deceit, unverifiable information, and references to KNOWN forgeries.

It is a product of hard work and you will learn more about the genocide if you read it. I have read in Greeks \\"the crime of silence\\". I found it better.Read more about Armenian genocide, dont believe the Lies of Turks. In our days Turks are not responsible for the crimes of their grand fathers. The lands of my grand father was Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish too. This land is Turkish now and I dont want to take it back. I want justice for the death people.

Please do not support any band that works to make the American people less safe and less free."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT Fastballs best.","review":"It seems so many reviewers think \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\" is so much better than all their other albums. Its an excellent collection of vintage sounding pop songs, but it doesnt come near as good as their Sophmore release \\"All the Pain Money can Buy\\". Whereas on ATPMCB every song was amazing and melodic, I somtimes find myself skipping tracks on the new release. On the upside their are the good songs like the super upbeat \\"Your and Ocean\\", with some great Southern piano by none other than Billy \\"Get Back\\" Preston. Also there is \\"This is not my Life\\", \\"Love is Expensive and Free\\", and \\"Funny How it Fades Away.\\" The collectors edition features a pretty dull live version of \\"The Way\\" , but the two unreleased tracks will definitely get your foot tapping. It also features a cool book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluidmaster Washing Machine Connectors","review":"The Fluidmaster Washing Maching connectors I purchased are great products at a great price.

Use it if you absolutely have to pull a trailer with a small car, but be prepared to accept paint scuffs on the bumper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsung, Underappreciated","review":"These are some of the terms that come to mind when I think of this brilliant record from Unearth. Somehow, you will not find this record on many people's \\"Best Metal Records of 2004\\" list. Well, I can assure you that its on mine. I put the caliber of this album alongside other great releases of this year, such as God Forbid's \\"Gone Forever\\" or Mastodon's \\"Leviathan\\". I appreciate what bands like Unearth do to seperate themselves from the carbon copy \\"metalcore\\" garbage bands that seem to be coming out of the woodwork lately. One way they do this is to obtain a heavy sound in other ways besides low guitar tuning and screaming. They incorporate many classic metal elements like searing lead guitar work that, this year, has only been paralleled by God Forbid. A metal purist should love this album. If you are still not sure, listen to \\"Endless\\", \\"The Great Dividers\\", and \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" first to get an idea of the sound of this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Shabby","review":"Quite impressive CD, definitly rocks from start to finish. Nice guitar work, good perccussion. Overall a good metal release. My only negative feedback is the lack of depth to the album. I usually only make it through about half the songs, then I gotta throw something else in. Worth the purchase though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time is the factor","review":"Opinions on my album vary upon when I'm listening to it. After a week of exploring some Nas and Common and AZ (all really good rappers in my opinion), Unearth seemed like a good remedy. And it was. The Oncoming Storm's sound seemed so magnificent, like a giant stadium. It rocks SO unbelievably hard (almost too hard) and has some of the most straight-up badass riffs I've ever heard. And Trevor Phipps screaming is coherent and positively invigorating.However, after a week of listening to Black Dahlia Murder and Converge, Unearth seem like a cacophonous cloud of metalcore smoke. It seemed very blurry and boring and repetitive.So there it is for you. I recommend it nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it is as good as everyone says it is...","review":"Unquestionably the front-runner for metal album of the year, IMO. This album tops even the much acclaimed Killswitch Engage release, \\"The End of Heartache\\" and even God Forbid's latest effort, \\"Gone Forever.\\" Unlike some other metalcore bands out there, Unearth manages to incorporate melody into their music without sacrificing a bit of brutality. This album will have you head-banging from start to finish with such amazing tracks as \\"The Great Dividers,\\" \\"This Lying World,\\" and \\"Black Hearts Now Reign.\\" Personally, I was not a fan of their earlier studio efforts, mainly due to the poor, poor, production quality. However, Adam Dutckiwiecz (if I spelled that right, bow down to me) does an impeccable job on this release.Bottom line: If you are a fan of metal-buy this album. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So mediocre it kills","review":"Whats the diffrence between this and Killswitch Engage? Not much, as you thought. No mattter what other people say, this sounds just like all the other generic metalcore bands (Trivium, Chimaira, God Forbid, etc.)Want good New Wave bands? Mastodon, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed. Otherwise, avoid this band until they can devolope a sound thats unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 song stuck on repeat.","review":"I picked up Unearth the day it came out, I pop in it and became bored after the 3rd track. I love metal (all genres). I got into these new metalcore bands (Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, etc.)before it became the \\"it\\" thing, and after the 5th or so band I've gotten into, the genre has ran it's course. Ya really can't tell the newer bands popping up apart anymore, but that goes for all buzzing genres of metal. The guys in Unearth are no doubt great musicians, I respect that. Guitarists are very technical, why ruin good muscianship with repeation. A cd that every song sounds the same I can't vibe. Gimme just a bit of diversity please. A lot of people gripe about nu-metal, at least there was a lot more diversity. 2 years of the new metalcore and it will be the \\"out\\" thing, cause at this course, Unearth shows on this album, repeation is a murderer. So good luck with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh... No...","review":"Hmmm, what is this ? Unearth is terrible and i dont see why people find their music, good or even interesting? Its generic,unoriginal, horrible riffs and you kno what? it's not even heavy. If your into mainstream crap then buy this but for people that can apreciate better music? Look else where !"},{"rating":"1","title":"you can do better. alot better","review":"This band is pretty much a joke, ive seen them live and all they do is dance around and tell the crowd to do the same.

For any fan of metal or hardcore or both, this would be an excellent album for you to own/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer reign in blood revisited","review":"there are heaps of metal bands at the moment that sound like each other bigtime,Unearth,killswith Engage,Lamb of God,Shadows Fall and God forbid,although all these bands rock they are nothing truly original,although I prefer these bands than most of the nu metal movement,at least the nu metal movement had a little more variety,all these bands sound heavily influenced by Slayer's Reign In Blood,although this is a good thing,I really think Metal fans will tire of this genre quite quickly,I would highly recommend most Swedish bands,At The Gates,Haunted,Dark Tranquility,Opeth,In Flames,Soilwork etc.and Children of Bodom who are Finnish.American Metal has really lost it's originality at the moment,here's hoping the next movement is very soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album from a usually stagnant genre","review":"For the most part I can't stand hardcore/metalcore. Unearth is some good stuff, though. There are some who absolutely despise metalcore, and this may or may not change their minds. However, if you even remotely enjoy metalcore, then this album is essential.I was already to give this album five stars, but then I realized I was making the same mistake a lot of reviewers were making. I was crediting this as an overall from start to finish fantastic album. In actaulity, most of the album is quite good but I was so in love with a few choice tracks that it blinded my judgement. Another reviewer said it best when they said that this album lacks depth. It really fizzls out in the second half. I usually find myself listening to about the half album's worth of standout tracks before putting in a different CD.This maybe should only get 3.5, but I will round up due to the great musicmanship in a genre that I usually detest. Definately worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just....Wow!","review":"This album is superb and one of the best releases of the last year. The beats are driving and make you want to move, the guitars are excellent, with some really great solos then the vocals top it off to give you one of the current best metal bands today. From the opening track this cd had me banging my head in my car, my room or wherever else I would play this cd. Stand out tracks to me were, The Great Dividers, Black Hearts Now Reign and my personal favorite Zombie Autopilot. So if your looking for a another metal band to add to your collection you may want to consider Unearth, you'll be addicted trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metalcore by the numbers","review":"This record is as unoriginal as it is rocking. The songs become a game of \\"What band do they sound like now - Lamb of God (raspy growls), Killswitch Engage (vocal adlibs), or Shadows Fall (twin guitar harmonies)?\\" Sometimes the group even sounds like Atreyu, another band of imitators, but minus Atreyu's gift for drama. Everything is well-played, and the bass tone is full and warm. But this is metalcore strictly by the numbers, sounding very \\"2004.\\" It's time for chops this accomplished to get a sound of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is probably the second best metalcore band ive heard(the best being lamb of god). These guys just play with so much power adn passion. The singer has a hardcore type of singing which is really good. The guitarists are awesome, they play melodeath riffs throughout the album and make it sound cool.The best songs are The Great Dividers, Failure, Black Hearts Now Reign and Bloodlust of the Human Condition.

However I was totally blown away by the incredible overall sound and equally incredible performances on this CD. Every song has amazing guitar solos which only add to the amazing energy on this CD. Adam from Killswitch Engage produced this CD and everything about the way this CD sounds is top notch. The drums pound, the guitars are on fire and the vocals are a mix of hardcore/death with some nice clean vocals to boot. It sounds like these guys have been listening to a lot of Iron Maiden and In Flames. The guitar melodies are very remeniscent of these bands. This CD lists for 9.99 and can be found for as little as 7.99 in many stores, so no excuse for not buying it. The Oncoming Storm will appeal to anyone who likes the last 3 In Flames cd's, Killswitch Engage's or God Forbid's latest CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy, where to start...","review":"I've recently been going on a cd purchasing spree.

Another reviewer has said exactly what I've been saying for so long. This is unoriginal dribble. It fits so snug into the current trend of metalcore in America that I turned it off after two songs. I could throw this into a pile of As I Lay Dying, August Burns Red, Between the Buried and Me, Shadows Fall, Trivium, or any other current Ozzfest darling and never be able to tell the difference. And being in a band myself who has played with August Burns Red and BTBAM, I can tell you there is truly nothing new going on.

These guys do it as good or better than anyone else in the metal world right now. You have great songwriting, and thats what sets them apart from most of the crowd.There is definitely a trend here. No one can deny that if you have a Killswitch album album you're likely to dig unearth. The list goes on and on, but whats wrong with that as long as there is some origninality in the song writing. As long as I don't think I'm hearing a specific metallica riff, or lyrics almost exactly like pantera I'm alright. And I coudn't pin down any particular song with these guys.So if you're not jaded on metal core hardcore whatever other label people come up with, then check this album out because its a legitimate part of good heavy metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"IN YOUR FACE METAL!","review":"this is the second really good metal band I have reviewed today, the other one being All That Remains. After listening to this album I can say that this is no-frills in-your-face metal, and it fu*king rocks!

In the movie these old soldiers get together and find out what trigger happy baby killers they were when they were young. Apparently there are still folks out there that find it neccessary to keep on spitting on vets. I picked up this DVD cheap and kind of sorry that I spent the six bucks for it. If you want to see a good Vietnam flick, spend your money on WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS. It is a much better storyline and the folks in it actually do a good job of acting. UNDER HEAVY FIRE on the other hand is a B movie, with a lousy story and poorly executed. Sappy-sappy-sappy with a big group hug in the end. What a waste. Why do I have to give this move a star.

They fit pretty true to size and are comfortable even with the pointed toe. The only downside to the boots is that there's a detail on the zipper (what you grip to zipper the boots) and since it's metal, it can make a funny sound if you wear them with a skirt because the detail swishes back and forth over the zipper. Not anything too terribly noticeable, but you probably won't be able to sneak up on anyone when you wear them.

Many of the songs don't reference the war at all; others make direct reference. It's a little unsettling to think of Nazi officers in occupied Paris sitting and listening to some of these same songs, but if you didn't know what the compilation was called, it wouldn't be the first picture that came to mind.The blurb is 100% on the mark when it comes to the sound quality: all the tunes sound great. The vocalists sound beautiful, especially Edith Piaf and Lucienne Delyle. I think this disc is a great introduction to some of those classic French singers: Yves Montand, Maurice Chevalier, Piaf, Delyle, and Charles Trénet. The Django Reinhardt instrumental, \\"Nuages\\" (\\"Clouds\\") is pretty spectacular also.If you like French chanson, you won't be disappointed, but this disc is probably most valuable to the novice like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so good memoriesof the times, but the songs brought us courage and hope.","review":"fantastic CD. all of them old 78 (for those who remeber them) put together.

This is a story about how God reveals Himself to anyone who will seek Him; and it is a story about how He comes near those who trust in Him alone. The reader is pulled into the story to share the life of this precious woman as she grows in the knowledge of God. The comments by the missionary at the end of this edition are pure gold as well.

It is not as exciting, but it is entertaining and fun to watch Bond's world of menace, terror, humour and sex. Look out for the sadistic scene, where Bond gets thrown around by Bambi and Thumper! Also the character of Willard White, the rich, vegas eccentric, is a hoot! At this point I'm tired of Connery because he doesn't seem to be in the game anymore and his performance is uninspired. And the script is too simplistic, like the coda at the end when Bond and Case the female heroine rid of the remaining villains, it's small-minded and not effective. But the film transfer, yet again is superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond movie I've seen.","review":"This is even worse than a view to a kill, the movie that made me swear off bond movies forever. Connery's hairpiece is the best special effect. Why does Blofeld have hair? Why isn't Bond's wife's death mentioned? Why the hell are the production values so low? They basically use pre-existing sets, and use them poorly at that. This movie is terrible, what a waste of a great storyline that arced through the first six movies. Oh, the music sounds like it was produced with two synthesizers and a poorly tuned guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond Is Forever","review":"Being a long time fan of the James Bond movie series (45 years), naturally I have a preference for the Sean Connery Bond films. This one was one of the better of the entire series. With Jill St. John playing the sexy but ditzy bad girl, Tiffany Case, Charles Gray as Blofeld, and Lana Wood as the voluptuous gold digger Plenty O'Toole, this has to be the most entertaining of the Connery series. Jimmy Dean (the legendary country star of old, and breakfast sausage guru)was outstanding as the Howard Hughes-like Willard White. Some of the more modern Bond films, loaded up with too many gimmicks and special effects, pale in comparison to this and the other Connery and Roger Moore Bond films. A must see for all James Bond fans, young and old. Buy it, You'll like it... you'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointing follow up...","review":"...to the best of the Bond movies. Connery is back and that's about it.How in the world do you make OHMSS and then make this! What an insult! They don't even make any reference to the fact that he's after Blofeld because he killed Bond's wife. The whole story is stupid and the characters are dumb. It's Bond against three queers. This movie gave Roger Boore his \\"Licence to Kill Audiences\\" with his sophmoric humor in his horrible films. I rate this as the worst in the series; there are probably worse ones by Roger but because it was Sean in the role, I say shame on you! He knows better than this of how to portray 007.

Some of the supporting characters are unforgettable. A great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Connery WAS James Bond","review":"Diamonds Are Forever (1971)-Sean Connery looks like he should be trying to unload a parking lot full of \`67 Chevrolets; the actor playing Felix Leiter looks even dumpier.

I'm Plenty\\": \\"but of course you are,\\" he coos. Jill St. John is one of the more memorable Bond girls, the title song is a sleazy masterpiece, and the chases feature a cool red Mustang and a clumsy Moon Buggy. Is it a good movie? Irrelevant, Mr. Bond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the money","review":"Connery was at his absolute worst in this film. They had to pay him a high amount to do it, then he only reluctantly agreed. Jill St. John was a horrible bond girl. Her lines were garbage and all she did was mess things up. She could have at least been good looking. The actor who portrayed the villain was an ally in You Only Live twice. What kind of casting is this? Connery should have done his last official movie in 1969 in OHMSS which would have been fantastic with his acting ability. Nobody's acting in this was inspired. If somebody had told me that the movie was 3-1/2 hours long I would have believed them. The movie was supposed to be fun, but I felt myself yawning a lot more than laughing. If you want to see a \\"fun\\" Bond movie, check out Live and Let Die or The Man with the Golden Gun. At least I laughed twice in those movies. Definitely Connery's worst outing.

But alas, Connery returns as the calm, sophisticated secret agent, not the murderous man out to exact revenge on the one man he truly hates. This movie has severe problems as Blofeld once again escapes and isn't even brought up again until For Your Eyes Only. As much as I enjoyed the Connery films, Lazenby was truly the right man for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Bond !","review":"This Bond movie is in my opinion the worst one to date, the locations suck (Holland, the US, how exotic), the story line is silly, if you want to have an armageddon plot at least make it believable, like in \\"The Spy who loved Me\\", the lead woman is not very attractive, rather looks like a cheap slut, Sean Connery appears unmotivated, then you have these disturbing homosexual killers, who are supposed to be funny, but fail like just about everything else in this movie.

Matt Damon/Jason Bourne he ain't, there's a distinct carelessness to his work, which often allows others to master him.albeit not for long. And he's constantly putting himself and his girlfriends in jeopardy of death, something Damon avoids like the plague. In this film, it's practically all sight over substance. Still, scenes of Bond's lab breakout,the final major scene at an oil rig, and especially a wild chase scene through Las Vegas more than holds one's attention. The beautiful St.John does some impresssive work here as well, when she can fathom what's really going on around her, at a breakneck pace.What we have here finally is a fond farewell to Connery,perhaps a little rusty, yet leaving this reviewer with fond memories of 1963 adolescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment","review":"This Bond film is a bit more light-hearted than other versions, which is probably why some Bond fans dislike it.

Buffett is one of the few artists that you can play from beginning to end without skipping over songs. Each song is catchy, and reminds you of the Carribean lifestyle, very relaxing. Songs like \\"margaritaville, Changes in latitudes, Biloxi, Tampico trauma\\" will have your ears fastened to the speakers of your stereo. It's full of classic songs that will never grow old. If you want to know which album to buy, \\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\\" is the archetype of Jimmy Buffett. If you don't have this album in your collection, you're missing out. From fast rockin' songs to mellow tunes, Jimmy covers it all, and he does well. I highly recommend this album above all his works. This should be your primary purchase before his other albums; you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed in Show","review":"Attended a show in July 2011. Very disappointed.

Granted that most likely it's only been reviewed by his fans and his opposers don't waste the time to drop a line criticizing his work in Amazon, I felt I had to step in, representing the latter group. As a whole, the album lacked substance in more than one way: lyrically it was weak, almost meant to not think about it (even if you try), which I guess is fine, if all you want is not to think... as in a beach setting. However musically, most songs sounded like a refry of Cat Stevens with harmonica. In my mind, if you want beach music that is really good, you tune to The Beach Boys, so no: I did not like the album, and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The product features indicates that this product is dairy free; however, it is not.

I don't know if it would have any value to someone not familiar with the show, but I thought it was a decent parody. Nothing was roll-on-the-floor funny, but the tape did a good job of lampooning many elements of the show. The reason I didn't rate the tape higher is because it is so short. I don't know the exact running time, but it didn't feel like it was longer than 10 minutes. That puts the cost of this tape at about $1 per minute. The amount of entertainment I got from it isn't worth that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I watch the same video?","review":"Agreeing with \\"A viewer from vienna, VA\\", this has to be the worst video I ever watched.

There was no catchy music, nobody remotely resembled the character they were portraying, I can't fathom how anyone from any background, age or level of education could find this film to be worth the tape it's copied on to.

Sunpro should have better quality control on its products! The gauge frequently sticks as the engine warms. Tapping the gauge causes the needle to relocate almost randomly high or low making it unusable as an accurate real-time indication of the engine temperature. Eventually it is possible to get the needle to rest in about the correct location for what the temperature \\"ought\\" to be, but is it right? Who knows, because unless you tap it again, the needle does not change. Based on the engine thermostat, it should read about 185, but it is easy to get the needle to stop anywhere between about 150 to 230 degrees.

This packaging in this current form basically piles all the DVDs in two deep pockets. There are no separate cases for each season. So you have to be very careful not scratch the discs. I think that because of new digital download erra is upon us, that companies dont care how the deliver there dvd content any more. They lower the price and make it seem like the best thing ever, and now you are stuck with a cheep box and a pile of discs with no cases. So if you must own this product at the price of $40.00 and dont care about having your DVD cases nice and protected, go for it.

Oh my god, kids (or grown kids like me) love him!Some reviews complain about the packaging, but this edition costs less than half of the premium and previous one.

Its just a really cool set up. After watching the show, I think it was somewhat funny. The first several seasons I really liked, but as it got up into the higher seasons it seemed to not peak my interest as much as it did in the beginning. I think once it got to season 8 and 9 it was so slow that it was just not that interesting at all. Kevin James is a funny person, and I usually like watching him because he can keep me laughing. But I have to say I wasn't that impressed with this show. But of course that is only my opinion, apparently a lot of people liked it or it wouldn't have stayed on TV for 9 seasons.

His victims are typically the upper class, snobby English or, in his earlier works, the hypocritically rascist South Africans. Although very popular in the UK, his books are almost unknown in America ... too bad!In 'Ancestral Vices' we have a loosely stiched story about a crusty and warped aristocratic family, a befuddled biographer, victimized dwarves, and a murder.

E.g. Martin's attacks too often come atthe (too) perfectly dramatic moments. Also, there's no time spent onthe wrenching decision for each to leave their earlier marriages, sowhy include it?Yet, all that said, it's still a strong, moving experience.

There is nothing new; what's more, there is nothing edifying. It is also unclear through the course of the book whether Kodell supports the historicity of the Gospel accounts; this historicity is clearly affirmed in the Church's Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum), and one would hope a Catholic monk like Kodell would stick to Catholic positions. Also, Kodell does not seem to draw the distinction between what the Savior said (whether He spoke the institution narrative Himself or not) and the revealed Scriptures which transmit all that is needed for salvation.

If you're a student and don't know much about public relations this book will probably interest you. If you're a practioner and this book is anything other than remidal reading, it may be time to consider finding a new career.To his credit, the author does present case studies that run the gamut from non-profits, to disasters, to educational instituions, to criminal clients. He does provide a wide array of different situations.I have no doubt that the author is an excellent practioner of the art of public relations.

Now, I am not one of those listeners who is going to complain on the deep end by saying the band sold out. In the end, rather it was their first effort or not --this band has never been considered true hardcore nor even that lamish title floating around, metalcore.What \\"Watch Out!\\" does ok is bring in back-up vocals that overshadow in terms of quality, the main singers' overly-done shrieks. I admit, \\"Control\\" is an awesome song...the chorus that swings in and out is nicely done but it is not enough of a saving grace to save an otherwise, stale, unmotivated and simply..lackluster album.To be quite honest, I really dislike music of this type, but alas I tend to give everything a go and I can't really suggest it other than for the deeply faithful fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Fit!","review":"We used this hat as a gift for one of our VPs who serves many roles and hung her many titles from each of the jester points.

It covers over 100 schools, dividing each review into 3 sections: academic life, political atmosphere, and student life. The reviews are rather brief and do not offer any helpful information (size, location, admissions, etc.) that could not be found in other college guides. The other information presented is highly editorialized.

The stroller is still bulky but not near as bad as Graco or some of the giant evenflos. The only thing I was unhappy with was, unlike many of the other major brands, Chicco does not make the carseat compatible to click into a shopping cart, I guess they don't recommend it anyway but it is difficult to do shopping with any type of carts. I tried to edit the reveiew and change it to 5 stars but it won't let me. So although it says 2 stars we think it is a 5 star purchase, and a definite must have.

He even has a piece where he talks about British wine snobs in an unfavorable light, but then concludes with one of the snobbiest British interpretations of American culture I can imagine. If you are going to write about American drinking culture and history, try to address it without such an obvious bias or you do nothing but confirm the reasons the majority of Americans don't like wine as much as you think they should.There are other books on the topic that are more approachable and less snobby, get one of those unless you are a wine snob and want to have your opinions confirmed by a foreigner."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"This book was okay.

Adding to the visual splendor is the two color Technicolor (still a highly experimental process at the time this movie was made), which has been carefully and gorgeously restored for this video release.Douglas Fairbanks is at his athletic and romantic best and his supporting cast is top notch. Billie Dove is a true vision of loveliness as the kidnapped princess and villainous Sam De Grasse's minimalist style contrasts well with Fairbanks' exuberance.

It does enhance observational skills"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumbo Sequence","review":"Jumbo Sequence is fun for 2 or three players. No special skills are required. The larger playing mat makes it easier to see the layout. The game moves quickly, and most matches take less than 30 minutes to play out with two players. Some strategy is helpful, but the luck of the draw is what ultimately matters.The object of the game is to play the cards that are arranged on the game mat in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal sequence. But watch out! Your opponent may have the one-eyed Jack which can remove any one of your cards on the mat. Continue to play and draw cards until someone makes a sequence. Two-eyed Jacks are wild.The rules are different depending on the number of playes, so read the instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequence Jumbo","review":"Introduced to this game and it is a fun game to play.

Poker, Scrabble, Yahtzee are a mix of luck and strategy. You will find that here as well. You will find bad players who use their Jacks as soon as you get them. You may get good enough to hand read your opponents hand assuming he is making optimal plays and you can adapt by playing optimally as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Strategy just luck","review":"This game is rather boring. There is very little strategy as the players merely put markers based on the cards they are holding. If you have the \\"blocking\\" card then good for you. If you don't then you lose.

If your Defoe, (in this show) a cop, you want to find out where it came from. How can it be a suicide? Who would want to kill themselves while possessing a half million dollars? The more he investigates and finds out gets him in over his head. He takes on the identity of the deceased, this sheriff from New Mexico is smarter than he acts but much less experienced than he tries to appear. Mickey Rourke gets to be the bad guy in this one. Guess what? He's a CIA agent. He's on whoever's side they pay him to be on. This is enough. The rest I'll leave to your imagination. I should mention that Samuel Jackson is also in this show.

Typically, the platinum costs about $200 more than the gold one.The box came with pieces that mostly already assembled. Took me about 1 hour to finish putting the pieces together. This is much better than my old grill that I bought more than 10 years ago; it took me a whole day to assemble that one.The grill heats to 500F in about 10 minutes. The good thing about 4 burners is that you can do indirect cooking; for me this capability is the most important about a grill.There is one minor point: the door does not stay close firmly.Overall, it is a good grill.

Granted, there are those writers who make it seem all too easy, but Eldred throws up so many cautions as to scare the average investor away.He may tour the US giving seminars on investing, but the book seems to have been written for rich investors. He gives very little details on how to do a deal. He declines to outline his plan for the reason that every city is different. While this is in essence true, it would be helpful to an investor to have some plan, any plan upon which to start his or her real estate investing career.I did glean some info from it, but that was because I was interested in a very narrow sphere of real estate.

The system of natural deduction he uses is not explained in much detail, but as long as you have learned at least one system of natural deduction and perhaps even the tree method of proof, you should be fine. His definitions and explanations of terms and of how one develops logical rules are excellent and explained very well. There is also a treatment of informal proof methods that mathematicians use, a section on basic set theory, and a section on axiomatizing scientific theories--the latter hinting at some of Suppes' own philosophical ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is A great Book","review":"I used this book as an additional reference for graduate Logic courses and I found it is really a great book that any Mathematician or Logician should have it.

Seeing him live is a great experience: he's as technically proficient as they come, and his improvisations at times seem to be practically through-composed. \\"Largo\\" shocked me. I haven't purchased such a piece of garbage in years. By hiring a rock personel he's shifted the direction, which could be a good thing, but isn't in this case. Each tune drones on and goes nowhere, and his introduction of vibes makes it even worse. If you're a Mehldau fan, don't buy this cd without listening to it first! Spend the money on a Jarrett or Calderazzo cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mehldau's Worst","review":"I'm a fan of Brad Mehldau; he's an inventive pianist with good chops. Nonetheless Largo stinks for the following reasons: 1. The horn arrangements were musically unexpressive. They evoked neither emotion or interest and distracted me from the piano playing. Superfluous, cheezy, and annoying. 2. Mehldau's improvisations were inhibited. His playing was not as interesting or moving as on trio albums. 3. While I sometimes enjoy \\"jam band\\" and fusion albums, Mehldau doesn't sound good in that type of setting, at least on this album. Again, his playing is unexpressive.Largo isn't all bad. My favorite track was Dear Prudence; the tune sounded pretty in a jazz setting, and Mehldau played simple eloquent lines. But my overall opinion is that Largo is an overproduced cheap shot for a few extra bucks. Instead, I suggest \\"Introducing Brad Mehldau\\" or \\"Art of the Trio: Vol 1.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it, but I am not able to...","review":"Sorry Brad, you are good, this album - NOT!Like others said before:* Emotionally Sterile* Repetitive* Simplistic and Boring* Some tracks really make your ear drums HURT!* Feels too Computerized, no room for the slightest improvisationBesides the nice cover.... yep.. just a nice coverSorry brad, better luck next time :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"You'll be in for a surprise with this one. And I don't just mean the absence of the customary polemic from the mind of Maestro Mehldau spread across the liner notes. To these ears Brad Mehldau is a piano genius who has produced some of the outstanding jazz piano efforts of recent years. But don't expect another singing, sad and lilting piano trio effort here or perhaps one of his ruminative solo offerings. 'Largo' is a serious departure from his usual fare. The musicians on this CD are all out of the top drawer, no question about that, it's just that they are all over the place. Think latter-day Waits, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink drama, meets a Piano Prepared by a Radiohead. That kind of thing.

He has a very clear identity, a great foundation, and an artistic brain always looking to create...and all of this shows on the new one. He has broken ground with previous albums, but nothing really is as daring as Largo. I think it's a remarkable effort, and has a remarkable sound; however, Brad may lose some fans, as well as gaining new ones from this album.As well as Brad, I particularly enjoyed drummer Matt Chamberlain on this CD. It's a five star album as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Brilliant","review":"First off I can't stand music critics and one of them I am not. They love to spew their brain ooze all over the page as if they have created something more sublime than the music they trash. I love this album. Brad lives in the year 2002 and because of this he has offended some \\"jazz\\" fans. Why was it that when ever Miles came out with something new everyone hated it, yet now that he is dead it is heralded as pure genius. The enginering on the album is fantastic, the tone of the drums make me smile, the connection of Brad's brain and hands are a gift for this world to enjoy, I wish I had ears like him. Do you know how I know that this album is great?

However, the video quality was very poor and not even complete. Parts of it were not viewable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book Ever!","review":"It's the best book I ever saw. The colors are very bright. I especially liked when the animals were camoflauged. Porcupines ended up stuck up in the tree. I love the book very much. It shows all kinds of animals and they all were led by the panda named Milton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kraftwerk are still the masters of this genre","review":"I have a voracious appetite for electronic music old and new, and I have to say this album proves to me that, at the end of the day, Kraftwerk are still the masters of the genre. I don't normally like live recordings all that much, particularly among electronic music, but this one was incredibly well done. The sound quality and mixing are top notch, and listening to it I really almost feel like I am part of those audiences in Moscow, Riga, and Warsaw. The majority of the recordings are from shows in Eastern Europe, which is just a perfect fit. The real standout with this album for me is that my favorite songs on it are some of the titles that I didn't give a great deal of attention to on the old studio albums. It balances the familiar sound of old with some superb new elaborations. If you're a Kraftwerk fan then you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest live albums I've ever heard.....","review":"Anyone that thinks that electronic music can't translate well to a live stage,should think again........You won't be able to stop listening to this album........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe you've heard of Kraftwerk...","review":"maybe you've heard of Kraftwerk, every once in awhile they're mentioned and you never really quite heard their music. They have a library of albums in their thirty-odd years composing electronic music and influencing all genres from hip-hop to techno. This is the brief history of Kraftwerk, now go listen to this album to learn all the basics. The latest from über-electronica giants is a live compilation, but an excellent primer for the uninitiated. It'll get you feeling all 80's while widening your ear palette to take on more of their sounds. This 2 disc set is perfect even if you already own a bunch of their albums. The sounds are clean and nostalgic and stubbornly remain their glitchy monolithic kraftwerkness.

As you listen, you will envision dilapidated steel plants and the grinding gears of a manual transmission, punctuated by irritating German accents with audio funhouse effects.This is music for the gulag. Play it over and over again to the prisoners while they shriek in agony and puke up their egg substitute breakfasts.

For one, it runs choppily on my more-than-adequate system. Second, the gameplay is flawed; items often cannot be picked up until someone else tells you you need them. Thus, if you see a coin on the ground, and try to pick it up, you will rebuked with some silly reason not to pick up the coin. Thus, you'll have to venture across down to find a guy who says, \\"Hey, can I borrow a coin,\\" and be forced to make an unnecessary trip. Do yourself a favor: save your money for a game like Syberia or anything by Lucasarts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wretched game","review":"I'm glad to see others have written bad reviews for this game, as it means I won't have to write as much. The only decent thing about Jazz and Faust is the graphics. Everything else was terrible, especially the dialogue and gameplay. Faust sounds like a sedated cow, and says inane things such as \\"What a splendid fish!\\" and \\"Does nobody sweep the stairs?\\". The puzzles and problems were either simple enough for a 5 year old, or else made no sense at all. Furthermore, you couldn't solve problems or pick up items until you had spoken to the right person, even if you had figured things out beforehand. I plan on selling this game this week, although I am toying with the idea of setting it on fire. It certainly deserves it. I must concur with other reviewers, any Monkey Island game would be a much much much better investment than Jazz and Faust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this is too juvenile","review":"So now we know there is Muzak in the sailing ship era. Everything about this game is awful, starting with the music. Following comes more bad news, the install is flukey, and the voice acting is Kenau Reaves quality, if you get my drift.Everything about this game might appeal to a 12 year old, who has never played an adventure game before, but Jazz and Faust is too stupid to even continue talking about.Save your money, I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this game","review":"This game is full of inane dialogue, senseless \\"puzzles\\", and it is generally annoying. if you are looking for a good adventure game, this is not it- I recommend Return to Monkey Island (or any of the previous Monkey Islands) or Grim Fandango if you have not already played these. I will say that they did an excellent job with the graphics, but should have spent a little more time with the plot. I am not even going to take the time to finish this dull game.

Color is a matte/semi-gloss finish that is a very close match to the color of the T bolt receiver. Two screws hold each mount to the tapped receiver. A star allen wrench is provided to drive the screws. There are 4 screws to hold each top half ring to the bottom half ring & base. This split ring design makes it easy to level the scope as you can place the level on the lower split half ring to level the rifle. The contour of the rings are a true circle as the scope seats perfecly in the ring without the need to force the scope unto the ring. I use \\"blue\\" Loctite Thread Locker to secure the ring screws in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a classic","review":"This movie is truly a gem. Of all the best Spanish movies that I've seen this one tops my list. It's a wonderful character study of individuals in desperate situations and how each one confronts them. I found particularly moving the saintly mother. I'd highly recommend this movie to those who also enjoy Mike Leigh's 'Secrets and Lies'."},{"rating":"1","title":"outstanding film; technically horrible dvd","review":"\\"Solas\\" is -- hands down -- an outstanding film that paints a realistic portrait of some of the contemporary issues in Spanish culture. This version of the DVD, however, is totally worthless. For one, the presentation is a poorly mastered 4:3, with a large, distracting black bar running along one side of the screen. The sound is nothing special (2 channel), and it is impossible to turn off the subtitles, which is annoying if you speak Spanish and don't want to look at them. There are no extras beyond a few trailers. Overall, this DVD does not do this incredible film justice, especially when you factor in its relatively high cost. This is an unfortunate delivery system for a brilliant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"family you can't pick them but if you could","review":"This is a great foreign film! The characters are flawed yet strong and this film proves that just sometimes you get a second chance and can pick your family members. The main character has a troubled relationship with both parents but loves her mother in spite of what she sees as weakness. Her father is another story and in the end the main character gets to finally have a father figure that she and her mother both would have loved. I loved this film perhaps the most because I myself have learned over the years that what we're born into and what we would have picked are vastly different. The acting is strong and believable. I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only connect . . .","review":"This is a somber and troubling film, about an angry, single woman in her 30s, whose mother comes to live with her while the older woman's husband recovers from surgery in a hospital. The mother is long-suffering and patient, rarely objecting to her daughter's bitter outbursts, rudeness, and drinking, while not yielding to her pessimism and anger. It is a collision of opposites until the daughter discovers that she is pregnant by an unsympathetic long-haul truck driver. A gray-haired widower with a German shepherd who lives in the same building completes the set of characters, and we wait with considerable patience as the resolution we yearn for eventually plays itself out and brings a measure of happiness for at least some of them. This is a thoughtful film, painful to watch at times, with fine performances, illustrating E. M. Forster's belief that people would be better off if they would only \\"connect.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps her best!","review":"I am a big BD fan and have almost all of her albums.

Sing Brother Sing, the 2nd album from 1970 I believe is their finest hour. Edgar wails like Captain Beefheart,sings crazy lyrics; one song has a line something like,\\"there was a mop in the corner whose name was Mop.\\"The fuzztone guitar will remind you of SRC and George Brigman and Split at their best. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding sf","review":"This is outstanding sf with metaphysical overtones rather similar to another very individualistic writer I enjoy called Jonathan Carroll. If you liked The Wave, you'll like Carroll's books. This is sf which, like Mosley's crime stories, is almost beyond genre. Easily identifiable as a Mosley novel, with obsessions which show what a disciplined writer he is when he's doing Easy Rawlings or other kinds of fiction, for you simply wouldn't know from those books what a thoughtfully philosophical writer he can be (the same social observation is here, of course). I loved this novel and hope he'll do some more imaginative fiction in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much and not enough","review":"I liked the concept, and the story was OK. I could have done with less of the black sex experience... lines like \\"my fathers large black *****\\". Yes, that is part of the book. A serious lack of love and making his God out to be just an advanced amoebic life form... Could have been deeper in parts, but I really didn't need to know other parts. Then there was the government white man exploiting and destroying. Kind of felt like an oppression theme. I would recommend if you can handle the dealing with the authors non-emotional, graphic, somewhat vulgar sexual exploits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layered and intruiging","review":"The professional reviews listed for this book are rather stunningly off-base and seem to me to reflect industry sour-grapes for anybody who dares to progress beyond their \\"assigned\\" spot on the shelves.Mosley's not a genre writer, but an excellent writer who can easily work within and slip between the boundaries of many genres. In this slim volume, Mosley has managed to write an effective, melancholy SF story while maintaining an air of magic reality and social allegory. There are thematic echoes of Greg Egan's \\"Blood Music\\" and even Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" in this, but the voice is pure Mosley, with deceptively simple language unfolding to reveal layers of meaning; the story told in first-person by a character about whom we discover as much from what he leaves out of the tale as what he puts in. Like the Wave itself, this book rewards those who give themselves over to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish Schlock","review":"Well..I didn't exactly read the book but listened to it on CD - it was in the bargain bin at B&N (for good reason!) Listening to this was painful and time-consuming enough. The plot was pure re-hashed gibberish straight out of a B-movie sci-fi flick - Everything from the crazy scientist who wants to perform evil experiments on the \\"good\\" aliens to all the sweet mamas who instantly want to jump into bed with the hero (a top computer scientist who gave up his work to make pottery). Purely unbelievable tripe - I can't get over all the positive reviews here - which is the ONLY reason I'm adding my own two cents. I haven't read any of Mosley's other work although it sounds intriguing - I just can't trust Amazon reviewers for providing reasonable or rational feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Time, if you are so inclined.","review":"Walter Mosley is, of course, the author of the \`Easy Rawlins' series (of which I'm a huge fan) and the \`Fearless Jones' series (not so much). He has also from time to time taken a detour outside of mystery/crime fiction to write very speculative stuff in SciFi and other things; for example see \`The Man in My Basement' for a really startling view of race relations.This little volume has some really fine writing, but some problems with the plot. I had a hard time really believing some of the characters who seemed, to me, to be pretty one dimensional. But be that as it may, it is worth a read. The ideas herein are interesting, if a bit too \`supernatural' for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wave, by Walter Mosley","review":"Walter Mosley is always a challenging thinker, forcing the reader to see life, history, and future possibilities, in a new light. Here is, yet again, another foray into mind-bending possibilities. You can't go by me because I love eveything Mosley writes and I'm grateful for such a brave and independent author. I used to think he was a bit dark in his outlook on life. Nowadays, I tend to think he's too close to the truth. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING READ","review":"I gave this only four stars because of the quality of the product. It started off by saying it was by \\"Robert Mosely\\" I know it's in the science fiction genre, how that was caught in editing I'll never know. I knew immediately by the style that it was Walter Mosley, so I continued to listen. Like I said it's different, from most of his writings, but I enjoyed the provocative concept and it would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two interesting early Russian films,","review":"The Girl With the Hatbox\\" is the real prize in these two films. A cute, charmingsilent comedy of Russian girl who travels between her home in the country andan apartment owned by a greedy, rich couple in Moscow.She meets a poor student with nowhere to go, and ends up marrying him to givehim the right to stay in the apartment although the marriage starts as just a platonicarrangement. Lots of hi-jinx ensue, almost all well acted, and I found myself enjoyingit way more than I expected to. Yes, there are some over the top performances, anda couple of unneeded sub-plots, including our heroines cruel ignoring of the post manwho is in love with her, but overall this is a breezy, sweet comedy, well worth watching.\\"Outskirts\\" is an interesting, if not totally successful and sometimes awkward mix ofcomedy and drama, expressionism and realism in a study of small town life and thehorrors of WW I. Some wonderful photography, but distractingly bad post-dubbed sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time well spent","review":"This book is a great resource for tying together the Old Testament. It is not, however, light reading. I tried just reading straight through it, but it just wasn't happening. I finally read it taking notes as I went. I ended up with about 40 pages of notes and a new appreciation for Old Testament Theology. (Don't get bogged down by the first few chapters. I think you could even skip them if you want to and either do or don't go back to them later. The only reason I continued after these two boring chapters was that I had to read the book for a class.) I thoroughly recommend that anyone who desires to understand the Old Testament take their time reading this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundational Book","review":"The first few chapter are tough, but the book uses a diachronic (Kaiser's term) to present the theology. In other words, he shows how each successive time period builds on the previous time periods. The books presents an exciting unity of the Old Testament using the promises and the covenants. The books helps place each O.T. book in its historical context. This book is fundamental in understanding Walter Kaiser's approach to theology or O.T. theology in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily go-to","review":"I think this balm is a little misunderstood. Sounds a bit ridiculous maybe, but it's not meant to be a daily balm you wear about. I use it as a night 'treatment' while I'm asleep and obviously don't care about what it feels like because admittedly it's a bit bizarre of a texture. It's slightly gritty and thick (some say waxy) but you need the slightest amount and the key is warming it up. Therefore rub it on your lips a bit and add more if needed; personally I slather it on at night and wake up with the newest lips i'll ever get. My lips are easily chapped and dry and I'm a lip biter so this does a great job for me. Regarding the price; blame it on the importing. Because in France it's only $10 (7,50eu). It is a staple for many who frequently change their makeup (models, etc.), definitely worth trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"egh, overpriced","review":"Texture doesn't really spread well on lips, and is a bit too solid.

The smell is honey-esque and fragrant, however, but this doesn't make it a product that merits its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Lip Balm","review":"I've been searching awhile for a lip balm that is not only effective, but that has staying power so that you're not constantly reapplying it. Nuxe Honey Lip Balm is the most effective lip balm that I've found to date. I love this product! The consistency is pleasantly thick and not waxy.

At first I didn't like it as well, because I thought it was too clumpy and heavy. The trick is though, you don't need a lot. You just swipe a small amount and rub it on your lips, gently rub your lips together, and you're good to go. I've been using this product for a couple years now, another tip I have is, don't double dip, from my experience, doing that causes the balm to clump together a lot more. If you swipe some of the balm, use that bit before you go in for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I love how moisturizing this balm makes my lips feel and it leaves a matte finish too.

Lagrimas Negras is one of my absolute favorites of all time, but I would not compare that work to something like this.

For sound masking, it is good in the sense that it is extremely loud -- not unlike a motel AC unit on high. However, in the two units I have tried, you can hear an intermittent scraping sound (as if something is rubbing ever so slightly in the fan), which can become irritating. I realize that this is a subtle point, but for people who are extremely sensitive to sound abnormalities and are considering this unit for its white noise generating qualities, you should be aware of this potential issue. I rarely use the unit as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality - poor value","review":"I bought one of these, took it home, turned it on, and it had a bad rattle and would shake when running. I turned it off and looked it over carefully. You can see the fan through the slot on top. The fan had a section of plastic missing throwing it off balance. I am surprised the assemblers of the unit tried to slip an obvious defective part into a unit. Neverless, I took it back and swapped it for another unit. Although the new unit did not rattle, it shook when operating on low speed and made a pulsating wind noise. Looking at the fan on this unit found it to be off center slightly.

It is really a rip-off to say that it has a permanent filter & then call the replacement a pre-filter.There is too much to say negatively about this; read the fine print in the ad for the stuff that doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too loud!","review":"This filter does a pretty good job cleaning air, but we almost never can benefit from that because the noise level is all but unbearable. At the lowest setting, it sounds like other HEPA filters at the medium or high setting. And at the highest setting this pretty much makes conversation impossible in that room. It's like this thing doesn't have a low setting.After this, we got the Holmes HAP756-U True HEPA Allergen Remover for Very Large Rooms. MUCH quieter and still pushes about the same amount of air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Air Purifier","review":"We've had this for about a month now with no problems. It is a little bigger and a little louder than we expected, but given the amount of air it filters, it can't be expected to be silent. It seems to be doing a good job, even though we only have it on the low setting. It does need to be away from all walls by at least a few feet, so keep this in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Permanent HEPA filter","review":"I ordered this product because it indicated it has a permanent HEPA filter.. the \\"N\\" In the model number is supposed to indicate that.However, the one I received did NOT have a permanent filter but did have a replaceable (2x year) HEPA filter which would run about $100 yearto maintain.

Can't replace HEPA Filter with single filter!","review":"I've owned a lot of Honeywell HEPA filters over the years, but have never before encountered the bait-and-switch on the filter replacement. They somehow manage to sell you the unit WITH a single large filter, but be advised you cannot order a SINGLE large Honeywell replacement filter - you have to order 3 smaller filters & stack them together. The stacking of 3 smaller filters will of course change the dynamics and filtering capacity of the unit. The HEPA filters do need to be replaced sooner or later. I bought two of these & am sorry I did!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"permanent air filter","review":"I called KAZ the manufacturer's Service Department. I was told they did not manufacture a PERMANENT FILTER for the model50250.

Your mileage will vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell 50250N","review":"This product cleans my living room /Dining room /Kitchen fantastically! I used to have to dust every other day or it would become unbearable. Since using this air purifier it has drastically reduced the amount of dusting I need to do and the air actual does feel \\"fresher\\" (No Allergies). The only serious qualm that I have with this machine is that one the highest speed it is load enough to be a pretty big nuisance if you are trying to watch TV or have a conversation. The solution is to leave it running at high when at work and asleep upstairs and just turn it off for the 6 or so hours that I use the living room. Given that it's price tag is so far below the best consumer reports rated purifiers that may be a little quieter. I would highly recommend this to anyone just for dust management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement pre-filters are wasteful","review":"When you go to replace the pre-filter in this unit,(Honeywell HRF-APP1), You will have to cut to fit, which is not a big deal, but you will have over 1/3 of the material left over; not enough for another filter. You will have spent $15+ and end up throwing away $5. What a waste. If you replace the pre-filter three times a year, that really adds up. They really need to address this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells awful","review":"Since I have used the Honeywell air purifiers before with great satisfaction, I was surprised that when I unpacked it and started to use it it gave off a sickening plastic smell worse than the ones in the shower curtains that we are told to avoid. I've been running it as much as possible near an open window to get rid of the smell. A little bit of the smell still remains. If I hadn't already thrown out the box I would have returned it. The smell emanating from the machine defeats the purpose of the machine. The purifier should be recalled and removed from the marketplace and remade with non toxic materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purifier","review":"Short and sweet, yes it works very well and pushes a lot of air. Removed cat allergens from GF's apartment in a few days. Yes, it will raise your energy bill by $15-$25 if you run it on high all day all long. Yes, on high it sounds like a hurricane but low is just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive me crazy!","review":"I usually don't write review because I am usually very happy with my purchase. But this time I feel a duty to let other potential buyer avoids the mistake I made. This machine is so loud I can only run it when I am out of the house.I picked the Honeywell 50250N because it was the most reviewed and priced not as high as my 2nd choice (SHARP) and 3rd choice (SANYO). It was a terrible mistake. The first time I turned on the 50250N, I wanted to return it. The noise drives me crazy. I have space heaters in the house and I can worked with them on so it is not like I cannot stand any noise but the 50250N is way to loud. I was willing to return the 50250N except that the shipping would have cost me a fortune. I am not a happy customer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it, until it quit working.","review":"I own the Honeywell 50250 and loved it. I bought it because it was a Consumer Reports' best buy. It cleaned the air of cigarette smoke better than anything I've ever owned. But, mine quit working after 2 months. The switch gave out.It has a 5 year warranty, but according to the instructions, you have to mail the unit back, which is a huge bummer. It's not so much the fact that you have to enclose a check for $15 to get warranty service, but the fact that I'm gonna have to trudge down to the post office. I can't recommend anything that costs > $100 and quits working after 2 months. By the way, even though this is branded as a Honeywell, the manufacturer is a company called Kaz, according to the instruction manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, it makes noise, but that's how you move lots of air!","review":"This unit is amazing for yanking dust and such out of the air and making it go away. I'm not inclined to complain about the noise it makes, because the only way this thing can live up to its claim of being able to recirculate the air in a large room 6 times per hour is to move a *lot* of air, over a *large* space, and do it *fast*. Outside of a ceiling fan (which is a lot bigger) there is simply no other way to do it than with a blower that you're going to hear.One reviewer said it sounded like a floor blower (or something like that). Well, it blows at an upward diagonal, but in terms of air volume it may come close. It has to, to get the whole room to circulate back to the unit and get sucked in. Want your room's air cleaned for *real*? Grab one of these. I used a Honeywell 13500 for over 10 years before it finally died and the 50250 took its place. No regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more cat allergens","review":"Pro: very good ratings from Consumer ReportsCon: to read the reviews here, it's loudBut it's not what I imagined.

I couldn't sleep unless I took an antihistamine right before bed. I saw the great reviews for the honeywell air purifier and I wanted to give it a try. I get the package and its really easy to put on the pre filter. I turn it on full blast and go to work. That night I noticed I could breathe in my room. At full blast this machine is loud and even on low setting if your a light sleeper it will keep you up. I have always slept with ear plugs so it doesn't bother me but if by chance my plugs come loose the machine will wake me up. I can say the machine works great and the dust in my room is way down.

This product has done an admirable job of cutting down on the airborne dust. The dust-on-the-TV-screen meter definitely indicates a dramatic reduction in airborne dust.Its circular design does a good job of circulating air in a large living area. Yes, the turbo mode is a bit loud, but it really moves the air. The turbo mode is best used when you are out the house, then just switch it to a less intense mode when you return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"Works fine.

But we haven't been able to find any mold, or track the smell to its source. It might be coming from outside somewhere. But as soon as I put this purifier inside my office and turned it on, within a few hours...voila! I can barely smell it anymore! One of my co-workers next door was so impressed she's thinking about ordering one now too :).I can definitely hear the noise it makes. But it's more like a calm, white-noise sort of thing. It doesn't disturb me at all. In fact, I forget it's even there.The only thing is that it might be a bit on the large size for a small office...I'd say it takes up almost as much floor area as a small chair (though it's shorter than a chair at least)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too noise for home use","review":"way way way too much noise for home use.

I contacted the seller, Ace Hardware, and they responded to me the same day and said the product is no a permanent filter and requires replacement regularly in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. So anyone looking for a permanent filter that you only need to vacuum clean once in awhile, look elsewhere. I own the Honeywell 18155 SilentComfort Permanent and like it although it doesn't support as large a room as this model. But it's sold by Amazon and I find it's always better to deal with them for returns, exchanges rather than their marketplace sellers who are always a pain when it comes to returns, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell Pure Hepa 50250","review":"Good unit, helps my girlfriend who has allergies.

It is pretty big and the blue light is kind of bright. Otherwise, it is great! I have had it for almost a year now and have had to change the prefilter once (which was absolutely disgusting!).

This is a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Glad I Bought This","review":"The air quality in my apartment has greatly increased since using this purifier. I have it running every day. Before having this, my eyes would get so red and itchy from allergies and dust. I keep the purifier on the lowest setting and this works well. For the 1st week I had it, I kept it on high to clear the air faster. The sound produced by the product is fine. It's not too loud and is kind of a relaxing sound like a noise machine. The indicator light on the top is a bit bright at night so I just put a dish towel over it to block the light, but black tape would probably work well too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would have returned it","review":"This unit is noisy and is like having a fan blowing in the room, even on the lowest setting. I wish I would have returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"Do not buy this product!! I had to send back a second unit in less that a year. The units only blow out air but no intake of air. After running for weeks the black filter was as clean as the day I installed it. The company says they never have any problems like I have had but I had to pay $35.00 to send each unit back. RIPOFF!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"While a good value. Nowhere until you open the box does it tell you that it is going to off gas for a couple days. A purifier shouldn't off gas that strong it is meant to clean the air. Also I found the fan on the lowest setting to be louder than other purifiers and you could almost here it rotate."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I had an Ionic breeze which I was very happy with. I kept it on the fireplace mantle and it worked great with the \\"not in use fireplace smells\\". I had it for years till it died. I thought I would try this as it was very highly rated. Everyone said it was noisy and it is. I found that all it does is blow the odors around. The thing has to sit in the middle of the room as it is huge. I wasn't happy going to filters but I thought I would try it, because it is rated so high. I am sorry I did. It doesn't clean the air, it pushes the odors around, it is noisy and it is cumbersome. Not at all what I wanted but I was duped by the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"power consumption","review":"I have owned this filter for a week now.

For the improved health we have, the better quality of living, the reduced tissue costs, its well worth it!! hahaIts a very good product, I am pleased we bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well","review":"I bought this to replace an old Honeywell Heppa air purifier. Since we were use to the white noise of the old one, we wanted one we could hear. If you put this one on the lowest setting it's just right noise wise.The 2nd and 3rd settings we find way too loud. It cleans the air well. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the light around the control is extremely bright. I had to paint around it to black it out and it still shines through some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This One","review":"I bought this machine last summer because I suffer from allergies and asthma. It has two major problems. One is that it's so noisy that I can't sleep with it on. Even at the lowest setting its noise level makes it miserable to keep in the bedroom. The other problem is the blue light that's on constantly. The light also makes it tough to sleep. And I haven't noticed that the air quality is all that much better than before I started using it. Consequently I'm looking for a new one - and I definitely will not buy another Honeywell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet dog","review":"It seemed to be working well for a few months.

The smoke penetrates my condo unit especially in the bathroom where he smokes at night. Neither this nor an smaller \\"purifer\\" clears the smoke. In fact both just makes it worse in the living room. Both(Honeywell) models claim to clear the cigarette smoke. But in fact they make it worse. THEY ARE BOTH JUST GIANT NON-EFFICIENT FANS.

RUNNING THE SHOWER WITH COLD WATER IS THE MOST EFFICIENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well..except for the blue light","review":"This model is every bit as good as all the reviews state: It filters very well, It is loud (but I like the white noise). I returned mine to the store because unlike a previous model that I owned this one has an intense blue light on the control knob that is too bright for my taste.

Hope I get a different one that actually works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKED AT THE POSITIVE REVIEWS","review":"I purchased this hoping that my sleeping could be more pleasureable without the congested nose that comes around just before spring. I am extremely shocked at the positive reviews that this has received. I ran it heavy for the first 2 days, and then after that wanted to use the lowest setting because it was just too loud. Even on the lowest setting I got this loud humming as if the tires on my car were warped due to misalignment. I couldn't imagine how someone could sleep through this, because I surely couldn't. Not only this but the thing was just too big. And to add insult to injury there was no improvement in the air quality in my bedroom. I sent this back ASAP, and am now back to hunting for another option."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the wrong unit for the bedroom","review":"Yes, this is the wrong unit for the bedroom.

It worked really well but after 1 day of use I had an enormous headache and dizzy spell after walking into the room. I unplugged it and waited a day and tried the machine again in the main house where I had the same reaction.

One of those that cycles from high to low, so brace yourself when you first switch it on. Even on low settings, it's louder than my AC. The light on the power switch is very very bright.

I have had this thing for a few months, and had to clean the charcoal filter one time ( I just vacuumed it off with a dust buster, reset the filter-check light, and no problems).I have some mean allergies and snore like it is my job. With this thing on all day and all night, the white noise drowns out most neighborly sounds, the filter helps me breathe AND sleep, simultaneously, and I barely have to dust my apartment. WIN, WIN, WIN.However, I did spend the first month trying to figure out how to cover up that blue LED.Initially, I had duct taped an old potholder over it, but realized it was high time for a more sophisticated approach. This guy's instructions (Nathan Pullen from Sept 21, 2008 review) were right on, I snipped the LED right off, put the panel back on, and have been in business since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the N version?","review":"Can anyone tell me if they are receiving the N version of this air purifier?

But if you're going to use it in a similar application then there are a few things you should know. First and foremost is that it's noisy, even on the lowest setting there is substantial fan noise and if that will affect your sleep patterns then reconsider your purchase. Secondly there is a blue ring of light surrounding the selector switch on the top of the unit. Very bright will light up the room at night (my solution was to tape a piece of paper over light and switch to reduce the glow). So to recap if a constant fan noise or a fairly bright blue glow is going to disrupt your lifestyle then you might reconsider your purchase.

Not so good on colder days. The worst thing is that this gives off a wet dog smell. When I change out the filter, it is fine for a couple days, then the wet dog smell returns. It is strong! Blue light is annoying. Upset I spent so much money on something i cannot use comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This purifier is what I was looking for. Before buying this I was skeptical about the performance but finally I just gave it a try. We do cook everyday and most of our cooking (Indian cooking) involves a lot of spicey preparations.

Looking through the hole in the top of the second one while the unit was running, I could see that the fan was out of round - the probable cause of the shaking. In both cases the air blew out irregularly (discrete puffs) at the lowest setting as well. The first unit came without a prefilter. After two attempts to find a non-defective model, I applied for a refund.Before buying this item I had tried out a different model Honeywell purifier from a friend and it was fine - no shaking and not loud. Perhaps problems with this model are an anomoly. Very dissappointing.Incidently, as other reviewers mentioned, this unit is quite loud. One would have a hard time conversing with others with the unit at the highest setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay, has its pros and cons like everything else","review":"Pros: Cleans the air well, can tell a difference in my home.

Overall a good buy and not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice inexpesive air cleaner","review":"I like this machine. No miracles here, but keeps the smoke odor down. No sure that it helps with the dust, but it's winter and I always have more dust due to using heat, so still watching. It does cause dust accumulation in the corners near it. Yes, it is noisy, but you become immune to it. I do not have it in the room with the TV, but if I did, I would have to turn TV up REALLY loud. As it is, with it in the next room, I find I do have the TV up a bit louder than I used to. I run it on high most of the time.Easy to clean and carry from room to room. And yes, it IS as big as the measurements say it is, so no need to be surprised at it's size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I got two of these air purifiers to the office,we have a 1000+ sqf office and they seem to get the job done.The only problem is that during the day, the only way for me to have it on is on the lowest level, otherwise it is too loud to work around it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrating at times, but a good book!","review":"I didn't really like the father's part in the story-it was confusing and the sex scenes were a little too descriptive...I loved the rest of the family, though.

Every member of this family has severe physical and/or emotional and/or psycological problems. Yet, they still enjoy a rich family life that, in many ways, is defined by love, loyalty and devotion. And this fact is the underpining of this book and, probably, society at large. For while they suffer mightily, they do so, largely, together and, in remaining together, forge the bonds that ultimately allow them to survive and, in some ways, flourish.This is a rich, deeply spiritual book in many ways, though the prose can, and often does, take on a coarse, often vulgar character--again, a lot like life itself.In the end, the books is a study of the difference between happiness and contentment in working through the difficulties of life.I heartily recommend the book.

It is hilarious, just flat out funny -- especially so for any woman who survived the uptight politcally correct stages that feminism and lesbian feminism went through. Those happy days when feminists didn't want to associate with lesbians, when lesbians picketed drag queens and every body spent way too much energy criticizing everyone else's lack of activism. Not only does Valley of the Amazons shine a spotlight on the (in hindsight) ludicrous PC wars, it makes room for a tentative romantic entanglement that takes a shy lesbian through all the stages of coming out. The sequel, Who Was That Masked Woman? is worth a read, but not nearly as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what i expected, but good for those who like to know how storms are forecast and studied.","review":"This book was really well written, but i expected stories about people riding out hurricanes, not research flights.

Hear her joke, preen, charm and stimulate the audience thru her banter and mostly, her invigorating songs and singing. She really lets go on some of these songs during her concert, especially \\"Mississippi Goddam\\" and \\"Old Jim Crow\\", her \\"protest\\" songs against racism and social inequality. Considering these songs were done before the racial movement in late 60s, Nina was really ahead of her time. But it was never Nina's intention to fit in the mold, her music is a perfect example and may not be for everyone. But if you like to be stimulated by thought and emotions, then Nina Simone and her music is for you. The studio album is almost as good and Nina transcends the confines of the lame orchestrations, especially on \\"I Put A Spell on You\\", her sizzling version of the famous Screamin' Jay Hawkins song about an unfaithful lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach you how to reason","review":"Herb Sutter is capable of thinking and reasoning software problem, after finishing this book, I read all the material Herb Sutter wrote on the topic of parallel programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn through puzzles","review":"This book and exceptional c++ series are the best book series, I have ever read.

However, I've heard better stuff from him, like his upbeat rendition of Night and Day. Most of the cuts on this CD are Charlie Parker with orchestra. I have two problems with that: 1) whenever the strings come in, I always imagine that I hear Timmy calling for Lassie in the background; 2) Bird's improvisational playing is so far \\"beyond\\" straight orchestral playing that the two don't seem to blend seamlessly. The few small ensemble cuts are the highlights of this piece, but Bird himself is great throughout.

Then it comes to the end and you regret every moment you wasted wading through all that crap, and wonder what the heck possessed you?This movie is that situation.It is a pointless, jumbled, disconnected series of vignettes featuring mostly uninteresting immature self-centered people in boring, meaningless interactions. The quickie sex scenes are basically every bit as boring, meaningless, and uninteresting as the characters involved. The only one I had any sympathy for at all was Nick, and I couldn't help thinking over and over that he really needed to grow a pair.If you're into 2 hours of watching self-absorbed people be self-pitying and obnoxious, then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"The only point to this movie is that it's a vehicle to show a few simulated quickie sex scenes.wish I could give it 0 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny sarcastic movie","review":"I started watching this on HBO one night mid movie and I had to get the movie to watch it from the beginning.

The spray nozzles also dripped and in my attempt to tighten them, one broke off (they are plastic). I ended up cutting off the end of each section of tubing and reconnecting it and eliminated the nozzle section that broke off. This made it functional.

It is the story of a young boy named Humphrey who, much to his father's dismay, goes to bed with his teddy bear. As he dreams, Humphrey's front yard becomes the setting for a seafaring adventure in which his teddy bear becomes a large and rather bossy shipmate.Humphrey's Bear has a rich and colorful text which makes it perfect for sharing as a read-aloud story. The text is complimented nicely by dark illustrations which evoke a sense of mystery and adventure.My four-year-old daughter really enjoys listening to me read this book. She isn't bothered by the fact that the teddy bear becomes a bossy bloke, and it doesn't bother her that Humphrey awakens to find his father holding the bear, as if he was planning to take it away as his son slept. Maybe these are things that only an adult would notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe that I wasted any time here","review":"I can't believe that a publisher actually would publish this thing, I hesitate to call it a book. Every other sentance is '... it was like ...' The story is told from a 3rd party viewpoint but he jumps into and out of the perspective. Not to mention that the main character appears to be a manifestation of the authors over inflated ego. He makes the character a super hero of sorts but it is transpartenly thin by the use of the 3rd person taling about himself that he is only stroking his own ego. The story appears to be a collection of short stories woven together by the thinest of threads. It is a shame that they killed a tree to print this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Marketing Tricks","review":"This slim manual comes with a CD rom and six ways to slice-and-dice marketing data. But the programs on the CD rom are crippled, so you have to pay if you want access to the more interesting features.

The models were briefly and poorly explained, with little business context. Might make an okay reference text if you already know the models, and when to use them. And the software might make a nice going-away gift to a new MBA student.

Her music is pop, dance, new wave, rock, r&b, and a.c. depending on the track & time of her career. This cd does span 13 years of a 22 year career so it is a good portion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids in America was just the beginning!","review":"Ever since Kids in America introduced Kim Wilde to America, fans have clamored for more, and this collection reminds us why! Ms. Wilde's evolvement from garage-pop with the likes of Kids and Chequered Love to the awesome arrangement of the Supremes You Keep Me Hanging On and the mature You Came, is easily appreciated on this best-of CD. The new additions continue feeding our Wilde need, and I'll always wonder why If I Can't Have You didn't zoom to #1 as another classic remake. A must-have for the casual admirer, as well as for the die-hard fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KIM IS SIMPLEY THE BEST","review":"The one of the greatest artist in -garage pop,new wave,and pop is Kim Wilde.With her excellent talent she's songs are irreplaceable \\"cambodia\\" is number1,\\"you came\\"\\"YOU keep me hangin'on\\"and \\"view from the bridge\\" and the outhers too.I'm so happy that she starting new career AND i WISH HER WERY LUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of Kim Wilde","review":"It's truly the best from the queen of punk-wave.Kim Wilde had it all to be one of the greatest musical icon of the 80's, but even more, with her typical voice & music talents, the songs from this album have become irreplaceable in echoing the eternal spirit of punk-wave generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"\\"You Keep Me Hanging On\\" and more nicest songs of the 80's that is why this album is really worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CD Ever","review":"Kim Wilde is an extroidanary artist and this cd shows it I recently heard the song \\"Keep Me Hangin On\\" and I did not know who sang it and when i found out I hadto have the album i was born in 1988 so i dont remember much 80's music but what i have learned is Kim Wilde rocks.

At first I was a little skeptical about ordering it because of some of the reviews from this site as well as others. However, after we got it in the mail we were both very excited. We have had the tent for about a month and a half and I am glad that I went ahead and ordered it. Every Saturday night my daughter and I set up her tent and have a camp out in the living room. Now she looks forward to every Saturday night so her and I can have a camp-out. Honestly, I would have to say that I have not had any problems with this product. I love it and I love the fact that it gives my daughter and I the opportunity to spend time together.

The nuances of certain things that I go through with my partner are explained in full detail in this book and have taken a HUGE weight off of my shoulders. If you even suspect your partner has Asperger's, I suggest you read this book. The emotional deadweight has been lifted, and I've really been able to work on solutions instead of blame. So very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This books reviews were misleading. This is not a \\"self help\\" book. It is more of a technical book.

You know the line: The Jews Killed Christ. I have to admit, I was surprised to see us Jews treated as we're treated in this book. In two words: like people. With humor and anger and madness and greed and intelligence and generosity and love for our families and ideas about God that suit us if not you. This is a fine book. A book for the ages. I think I'll give it to my mother-in-law for her birthday. The title alone should give her a face lift. Oh, and about the stars. I'm inclined towards 4 and a half just because I save 5 for Shakespeare (even with his Merchant of Venice), but there aren't any halves, so for Philo Judaeus alone I throw in the extra half a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never be the same after this book","review":"This is some story. I never expected anything like this when I opened the book. I did think, from the first few pages, that it was going to be delicious reading since the style was so pure, even crystalline--but the story and the ideas! I don't think I'm quite the same after reading this beautiful book. As for the ending--well, we all know the ending, don't we? Let me say this--no, we don't. Not really. Not like this ending. I've no intention of giving anything away...but I cried for an hour, right through the last fifty pages. Not like Mel Gibson in his snuff film wanted me to cry, or squirm, or become crazed in my outrage, but as the whole story was meant to make me weep for the beauty of these people. In about two days, I'm going to read it all over again. And then maybe again the following week. I have to. There's so much to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I was looking forward to an imaginative and in-depth novel. Parts of this are almost intriguing, but they become lost in attempts at Biblical language. I quit before ending the novel because there was too much \\"And now comes a donkey. And with the donkey comes so-and-so. And so-and-so might be the son of so-and-so else. And now into the room comes my father.\\" Not very exaggerated, either. This is how the language sounds, and how boring and irrelevant most of it is. She would have done better to just tell the tale in her own way and get on with it. I'm surprised this got published as is, but if you can weed through it for the ideas, you might find it worth your time? Notably intriguing was Mariamne cross-dressing to become John the Lesser, and Salome cross-dressing to become Simon Magus. Definite potential here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Education","review":"Spiritual education seems to stop like there is an end to learning about our maker/s.Mary Magdelene's addition to the story adds so much more to the religious sesrmons (education) that already exist and have existed for many years. A just way to see that what life we live today creates the future we will live in. Our current life is just as important as the next life (heaven).Women who desire to become the women we were meant to be would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars by 74 out of 84, speaks for itself","review":"This is one of those books that simply spoke to me from the shelf. I could not put it down once I started, then I didn't want it to end. A rare book in my opinion. The amount of research needed for this book must have been phenomenal, especially considering that so little credible information is available. Small minded reviewers who gave it poor marks for the writing style miss the fact that it was narrated by Mary as a young girl for most of the book. That adds to its charm and does not detract from its flow; partly because there are so many gaps in historical knowledge here, so a child's perspective works well in this case. It is fiction, but seems accurate, and I felt as though I was a very part of the scenes depicted. Nicely done! Written by a woman about an important woman of our history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I thought the writing was incoherent and rambling. The author used too many names that had no meaning. The thought that a female could hide herself in a male dominated society was laughable.

This comic-book-depth treatment ain't it. A paste-up of lame ideas and actions in annoying and childish prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's keep it that way.","review":"Not one of the worst books I've ever read but pretty close. Sorry I bought it and am not passing it on to friends. Perhaps it was the subject matter that first intrigued and in the end alienated me but I had to force myself to finish because I couldn't believe the plot. I kept hoping for some relevant message. Mary Magdalene, the original feminist and Mary the Mother of God, the worn out, bitter, stay at home Mom? I won't even try to describe her take on Jesus. Not my cup of nectar. I'll certainly make every effort to keep this book a \\"secret\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book of a Different Color","review":"If you think this just another \\"religious\\" book, or something merely for questioning Christians, think again. If you think it is just another \\"Grail\\" attempt, wrong again. There is no Grail here. no bloodline, no claiming to be descended from anyone. This is a beautifully written work of spiritual depth and a search for real understanding. It uses the truth/myth of Mary Magdalene to explore questions we've been asking ourselves as humans for as long we could phrase a question at all. No creed is pushed here, nothing is required of us in this book but an open heart and an open mind. It's also a great read, a gripping adventure of mind, body, and spirit. I recommend it most highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling new way to look at the New Testament","review":"I just finished this book and couldn't wait to say something about it. Right to the very end, I was enthralled. I cried and I laughed....laughed! In a book about Jesus? Oh yes. Because these were real people going about their lives with such remarkable truth and courage. So many of the Bible stories have confused me, or left me cold. But now, after this book, I understand them all in a new and thrilling way. If I had lived back then, I wonder what I should have thought of these people? But I live now, and now I think of them as great heroes come here to help us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Eio edition, will buy Random House edition","review":"This is the kind of book you want all your friends to read, the one you pester them about.

I enjoy very much this book, hoping to live this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Stunning, A Real Page-Turner!","review":"Brilliant. Gibson at his gritty best. The action is fast-paced, the characters believable, and the backdrop real enough to be scary. A truly in-your-face adrenaline rush of a read. I heartily recommend this book to suspense, fiction, and science fiction fans alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less tech, more life","review":"This book has a little less tech than I expected from Gibson. Indeed, the virtual light glasses, although a driving part of the story line, played a very small role in the story as far as actually being used for anything. Far more interesting to me is Gibson's portrayal of the social structure built on the remains of the Bay Bridge, how bits of junk and scraps of lives formed a microcosm of the larger NoCal/SoCal world but with its own rules and mores or lack thereof. I found the characters well fleshed out and sympathetic. The book moved a a good pace with several interesting storylines. The depiction of SF bike couriers was cool too. A solid start to this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich in its visions...","review":"I had been a fan of Gibson for some time before I had read Virtual Light, but when I touched this book I was blown away. This is quite simply Gibson's best work, creating a society based entirely on the absence of planning, and then cementing that society with some of the wildest characters ever to hit paper since The Stand. If you read no other Gibson book, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a snore","review":"zzzzzzzzzzzz. A dreadful waste of time. No plot, no story, lots of endless running around to no purpose"},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtual Light: Did you say cyberjunk?","review":"You William Gibson fans have got to be kidding. I slogged through 60 pages of \`\`Virtual Light,'' then rang up the white flag. It wasn't as bad as Anne Rice's \`\`Violin'' (I got only 50 pages on that one), but it was close. There's a reason why much science fiction is dismissed as little more than weak plots and lousy writing, and \`\`Virtual Light'' is a case in point. The characters are cartoonish, the writing mediocre and unsubtle (Aaron Pursley -- gee, uh, is that Elvis? Duh.), and the plot about as interesting as a George Bush speech. In closing, let me say that I'm not an anti-sci-fi snob. I loved \`\`Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' and \`\`Voyager,'' though not nearly as good, is still pretty entertaining. But there's something to be said for craftsmanship and intelligence, be it in science fiction or any other creative endeavor.

Gibson is sadly overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gibson as a suspense writer.","review":"Virtual Light is not in the same hardcore cyberpunk categoryof Neuromancer.

I found the book as fascinating as Ifound it entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad (and I LOVE Gibson's work)","review":"Please please please do not let this be your first or only Gibson book. It is incredibly shallow, trite and painfully contrived. Get Neuromancer instead, because it is a much more deeply woven story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Sci-Fi/Cy-Fi potnetial","review":"This book was OK. It was enjoyable and I read it fairly quickly. I didn't enjoy it as much as Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson). The main point of the book Virtual Light (?? don't get me wrong but I assumed this was the main topic) was totaly under developed and wasted. Some of the imagery was nice but I do feel that there was a lot of things that were left out. As said before-charachter development. I never realy felt like I was in anyons head. This seemed like a poor excuse for a novel from someone what would only get publish as he was before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Intro to Gibson","review":"This was my first foray into cyberguru Gibson's realm, and the blend of cyberpunk and noir worked pretty well for me. Clearly Gibson is more interested in showing off his skills at imagining the gadgets and lifestyles of the near future, rather than providing any intricate plot. Indeed, the tale of a bike courier who unwittingly steals what turns out to be technology to die for, combined with a down and out former cop hired to help retrieve the missing item, rehashes some fairly familiar noir territory. But the evocation of a neighborhood built on the now unused Bay Bridge is good stuff. I especially enjoyed the clueless Japanese grad student who's trying to write an anthropology thesis about the neighborhood. If you like this, try Jonathan Lethem's \\"Gun With Occasional Music.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough Virtual Light","review":"I really liked some of the ideas in this novel, but it doesn't seem like Gibson really runs with very many of them. The title, the cover, and the back intro of the novel, suggests that it will be about this cool virtual reality glasses, but they really play a small part of the novel, the reader barely gets to see them in action. I liked the main characters, even though it takes about 200 pages for them to really meet, which seems abit odd. I don't think this is one of Gibson's better books, but don't let this one stop you from reading some of this other novels, especially Neuromancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtual Light, the sidestep from Neuromancer","review":"If you enjoyed Count Zero, Neuromancer, and others, then you'll like this.

The writing is weak, the character development nonexistant, the \\"suspense\\" not at all suspenseful, the dialogue hokey with *italics* all *over* the *place*, and the plot not terribly engaging. This novel could have been condensed into a 50-page short story, and nothing would have been lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Neuromancer....","review":"Anyone who has read any other of William Gibsons' books will find 'Virtual Light' totally unsatisfying. However, it still manages to grasp you until the 2/3ds of the book and after that it seems like there is a rush to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtual Light lacking","review":"I enjoyed Mona Lisa Overdrive but Virtual Light grew tiresome. The plot lacks substance and Virtual Light, lacks any virtual reality. I thought with the theft of the high tech specs, the book was going to be an interesting read.Maybe I'm just tired of the quirky, \\"tongue and cheek\\" dialogue that Gibson and Science Fiction has unfortunately restricted it self to over the last couple of decades. The author thinks that he and the reader are sharing some inside joke throughout 350 pages and it gets old. Give me some of that \\"old fashioned\\" science fiction with plot development, characters and suspense, fear and challenges.

Why? If you start with this you'll probably be dissapointed and you'll refuse to read the Neuromancer which would be mistake. What we have here is imaginary world without imagination, characters are not likeable and you'll forget about them on the first day upon completing the final chapter. Cheap moralty and chases from B-rated movies makes this book a lousy trash SF, no matter what anybody else could say 'bout it. Chapters are written in different manner, varying in lenght and breaking the pace of the story more than is necessary. Storyline is rather uninventive without the satisfactory end, or to say with end that is no end at all. Various appearances of countless different and not so interesting characters keeps you occupied with tracking which is irelevant instead keepin' you on your seat wondering what'll happen next. Skip this one and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition?

Unfortunately, I would rather do-it than read about it. Art history of the usual sort bores me to tears. \\"Taos Artists and Their Patrons...\\" grabbed me from the start. I'm even reading the foot-notes...an unheard occurance! This is a stunning, insightful work with plenty of juice...not the usual dried, dusty husks they tried to force on me in art school. If you are at all interested in enduring art, in truly fine painting, in the southwest, in those who risked established careers to seek new subjects and gave new meaning to hardship...and the joy of discovery, then this book is for you...and a bargain at the price.

The basic ideas on UbD is quite straightforward that one can grasp them by spending 30 minutes looking into Wikipedia or other introductions on the web.

I agree with some reviewers that it can be more concise and spend more efforts to give out practical procedures to design a good UbD lesson plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Be Better as a Booklet","review":"Others have already stated my opinion. The useful points in this book would be better stated in a booklet. The authors ramble on needlessly when, in reality, they should have backward-mapped their own main points, stated them, and then stopped typing. The extra babbling detracts from the main points: backwards mapping and six facets.

The book is quite informative and gives great ideas on how to teach for results instead of just covering necessary material.

I thought that the book was well laid out and gave you a great framework for the UbD's but there was so much flab in between. There were a lot of pages that I felt like I could skip through.

I thought the editing and the split-screen slow motion sequences were unnecesary and ambiguous. The original HBO series showed much more nudity and showed the models in such natural states. There was no backstage banter included in this one, The original documentary showed the participants in a nude outdoor funfest. This DVD had them in some type of bikini with a sponsor's name on it.

They look great- practically invisible. They are very heavy- excellent quality. One caution though: you really need to be able to hit 2 studs with the mounting screws- the mounts with a quality center channel speaker are just too heavy for wallboard wall anchors. That can make placement difficult. Hitting one stud and placing the 2nd mount only 4\\" from the first with a toggle bolt can work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaker bracket","review":"Not the best speaker bracket....I would not purchase again.

It was really a stress reducer. There were many valuable insights in a well written, easy to understand book. Being a NJ resident, I saw an article about Ms. Ehrich in a local newspaper whereby it mentioned the anxiousparents.com website. It is well worth a viist there too. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to find stable, quality help with your daycare needs. It gave me the direction and confidence I needed, especially since I am a first time Mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for families searching for Daycare Centers","review":"Unfortunately I found the book to be too slanted towards family home care or nannys - these are not viable options for everyone. I found there was no fair balance given to daycare centers. While the checklists/questions were comprehensive the author's overall condescending tone put a damper on the information presented. For anyone whose main alternative is a daycare center, this is not the book for you - save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mat Kearney rocks!","review":"If you like good music, insightful lyrics, strong melodies and a work that is both inspiring and glorifying to God, then there isn't much else on the market right now that beats this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singer songwriter.","review":"Mat Kearney did a great job with this release.

The majority of the songs on the first CD are on this cd. So if you aren't the biggest fan ever, just get this one not both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose the Rap Thing","review":"Kearney needs to decide whether he wants to be Chris Martin or Eminem, for never the twain shall meet. Several promising songs are ruined by the regression from melody to rap, frequently - and jarringly - in the middle of an otherwise pleasant track. He has a good voice. Why he's wasting his time with the whole rap thing is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sedate Rap","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend who mentioned liking the track, \\"Nothing Left to Lose.\\" Two days later I was asked about the disc. I had figured that if an artist has one likable song, they should have more, and it's worth paying them money for it. CDs are the end of a long road, reward time. Then my friend played the CD to show me something. The guy started rapping?! I first guessed that amazon had mistakenly sent me a soundtrack to a comedy, but nope, it was the correct CD. Not every track is horrible, but enough to wipe that happy, expectant smile right off your face. Nothing left to lose? How about $6.99 with Super Shipper Savings"},{"rating":"1","title":"An illustrious distinction","review":"I heard Mat Kearney's title-track \\"Nothing Left To Lose\\" and was intrigued by him. I though the entire album would be filled with the soulful ruminations of another singer/songwriter and I was right, for almost half the album. There are six songs on the album that are very good and show unique wordplay and inspired singing. The other seven songs, Mat raps along to the acoustic music. By making the ill-advised move towards rapping, Kearney joins a select group of artists who should never, ever, under any circumstances, be allowed to rap. The group is made up of celebrated entertainers like Rodney Dangerfield, Madonna, Lil' Wayne, Puff Daddy, Paul Wall and now Mat Kearney. Six good songs should warrant a better rating than two stars, but the rapping is so unbearable that the value is decreased. Hopefully, the sychophants that surround him will have the huevos to point this out to him and he will make an entire album with beautiful songs, if so I'm on board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After enjoying \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" on the radio several times and finally learning the artist's name, I decided to purchase the album. My expectation was that the style of this song would carry through the rest of the album. Some of the songs do, but the rest of album is rap. Needless to say those songs are being purged from the music library as I write this. Next time, I'm checking out the entire album samples before I purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had no idea I was buying a rap album!","review":"I'm very dissappointed in this CD.

At the time, we had never heard of him. After his set, he went to the souvenier table and signed autographs to any and all. Even had giveaway postcards to promote this album. I got one signed and later heard his music on a number of TV shows (The Unit, Grey's Anatamy, etc). I bought the album here at Amazon and have really enjoyed listening to his distinctive style of music. Very easy listening with a simple straight forward approach. This album is the type you can listen to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tunes and Lyrics","review":"Matt Kearney sounds a LOT like Chris Martin from Coldplay, but Matt's lyrics come from a healthy well in his soul--a deep and settling faith in a loving and personal God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great album. I bought the CD because it was $3 cheaper than the digital download. Always enjoy having the original disc if I can. Mat has a great range...everything from a kind of soft and soulful feel to a pop/hip hop feel. Wouldn't at all call it rap though. Listening to the 30 second samples will give you an idea.Mat is one of those singers who a lot of people know, but they don't realize it. By that I mean you hear the song and go \\"oh yeah, I know that...I like that song. I never knew he was the one who sang that.\\" I did that with a lot of these songs. Glad I bought the album...would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible..","review":"I wasn't sure if I should buy this or not, since some of the people were complaining about rap and I usually am not a big fan of rap. I am so glad I bought this CD. I can't stop playing it. The entire disc is sooo good. Kearney does such a good job of mixing different styles of music together. This is the best CD that I have came across in YEARS. I am not joking. Everyone should buy this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few good songs","review":"I normally don't post reviews, but wanted to here. I bought this CD just for the song \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\". I *love* that song; Mat Kearney has a beautiful voice. However, I don't care for the 'rap' style songs that are included on this CD. So if you're a fan of Mat's ballads, better to download them separately rather than buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"After hearing his newest cd, \\"City of Black and White\\" which is brilliant, I also picked this older cd up. I was shocked. Such a great voice and then the rap begins. Yikes! For those of you thinking of picking up his new cd, good news........no rap! So hopefully he's figured it out and we won't have to hear him rapping on future recordings because this cd is junk. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too eclectic","review":"I love artists who think out of the box and try something different in music. However, I think that Matt has tried too hard to be eclectic. Nothing Left to Lose is a great song, but then the album goes from \\"poppish\\" to indie sounding music then to what I wouldn't term rap but just talking. I listened to the album, and there is absolutely no continuity in this album. Just download Nothing Left to Lose and skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title and Cover Artwork","review":"I bought this book several years ago, and tried many of the recommendations. The book was filled with flowery descriptions of 'nutritional supplements' and their effects that in almost every case vastly surpassed the reality I experienced while enacting the suggestions. This book does have limited merit, but it was clearly a stretch for the authors to expand the amount of information from brochure length into a smallish paperback book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional read","review":"Melissa James brings you the kind of intense, emotional read you expect from an Intimate Moments, but her fresh, new voice sets her apart.

Her Galahad was a chore to read, with every plot known to man thown in randomly in an effort to make the story interesting. I tried to visualise the love scenes but the combination of bucking, spasms, load roars of \\"Jirraaaaaaaah\\" and something about dolphins gave me a spasm of a different kind. LOL. Hey - maybe it was meant to be a comedy? In that case, keep up the good work! If readers are looking for a good Intimate Moments - maybe try Jill Shalvis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed reader","review":"This review is based on only reading the first few chapters as frustration wouldn't allow me to continue. Tension is not created by the overuse of adjectives, overreactions and melodrama. Melissa, your idea was good, a pity it takes forever to wade through the waffle before you get to the point. Not only could I not finish it, but I'm tempted to return it to the publisher for a refund, just to make a point about respecting the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilling little satire","review":"Although the script was written in the mid-1980s, \\"Bob Roberts\\" doesn't feel dated. Instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of American politics. The title character, Bob, is a conservative folk singer who runs for the U.S. Senate, but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe. What struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens. While I thought that the message of the movie was right on target, I didn't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film. It kept me at a distance from the characters and, as a result, I didn't care as much about them as I might have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"biting, clever & unconventional","review":"The first writing/directing feature for Tim Robbins (The Player, Shawshank Redemption) is a biting 'mocumentary' on the functioning of American politics. Robbins plays Bob Roberts, a would-be senator, followed across the US by a British documentary crew during his campaign to be elected to Congress where he will ratify the use of US military forces in The Gulf. The problem is, Bob Roberts is a fanatic right-wing racist already renowned for his racially discriminatory folk music.While many will be put off by the unconventional nature of the film, and American pride is sure to be wrangled by a lot of what this film says, 'Bob Roberts' is nevertheless a fantastic watch and a great predecessor to more successful films such as 'Primary Colors.' If you have any interest in the machinations of American domestic politics or racial discrimination then this is a film worth owning for repeat viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I always vote Republican. I'm conservative politically. ... I can't stand Tim Robbins knee-jerk liberal ranting when I read him spout political \\"thought\\" in interviews. Which means I really mean it when I say this is a first-rate film. It's really original, brilliantly written, well-acted and directed. I was amazed to find how much I like this film. Yeah, it's from a liberal perspective. But I did think it damning of a certain character-type, and not an ideology. This is a fine film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A liberal's wet dream","review":"For those who wish to believe that the liberal politician is the selfless servant of mankind too pure and true to stoop to the horrific tactics of the conservative who of course is only interested in defending the powerful and taking from the helpless.I would echo the thoughts of reviewers Harris and Moore - Tim Robbin's film is so pathetically simple minded and transparent in demonizing the right it loses all credibility. But credibility aside - the movie was boring and stupid. A great example how ideology and self love can turn an otherwise brilliant movie maker into a dunce."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Staggeringly Biased and Unrealistic Movie","review":"The basic idea behind this movie is that anyone who is to the right of Tim Robbins politically is a hypocritical fraud. He creates a group of characters who embody the left's worst stereotypes of Conservatives and then proceeds to let us know what awful people they are . It's the kind of thoughtless agitprop that can only come from someone who's never actually met a Republican.If you've ever had a political discussion that was more nuanced than a lite beer commercial, this movie will leave you cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist dribble","review":"If you are a liberal or a socialist, pretty much any left wing paranoiac you will love this film.It's entire purpose seems to be that of putting on screen all of the bile that spew from Robbins and Sarandon.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broad Satire","review":"This movie is a satire on conservative politics. It is mean spirited, and obvious. Bob Roberts reminds me of Bill Clinton more than any conservative. So maybe the movie has an unintentional irony that makes it worth watching. It does have cameos(look for the Seinfeld connection), and it is Jack Black's first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This is the second worst movie i have ever seen, only barely edging out a horrible movie entitled \\"Shakes the Clown\\" for the Absolute Worst Honors. If you like to think for yourself and have half the brain then this movie is probably not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best political satire ever!","review":"A brilliant, funny, enraging movie - hands down the best political satire/drama since the Manchurian Candidate.

I love the first song especially ( \\"Lazy Afternoon\\" ).The rest of this jazzy album is great too.She is an amazing talent that is somewhat vastly underrated.I wish her more success and to become a household name.She rocked in the late 80's and the early 90's, and her vocals are as good on this fantastic standards album.Go out and get this album and you won't regret for that.It's so groovy to listen to it in the car or your bedroom or anywhere you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A singer of many styles.....","review":"A singer of many styles,Regina Belle is comfortable performing classic jazz,Soul,down-tempo funk....There are no weak tracks,just some that are superior to others,and a lot to like :\\"For The Love Of You\\",\\"Why Do People Fall In Love\\",\\"The Man I Love\\",\\"Corcovado\\".....It's easy to spin LAZY AFTERNOON a couple of times before the songs start to sink in - unlike her other records, there's nothing here that immediately grabs your attention, they're all growers - but the mood of the record is immediately and sensually appealing.That sustained warm, burnished, relaxed feel - at once exuberant and upscale,simple and classy - is reason enough to return to it to give the songs a chance to take root, and once they do, the album seems to be one of her most consistent records and one of her best.These picks are purely subjective,as you will not reach for the remote to skip any tracks when they cue.An essential purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This...","review":"...album contains masterful musicianship & overall production by the great George Duke BUT the album really lacks strong songs & somewhat strong arrangements. The songs are a little \\"saucy\\" arranged & lack variations in tempo which makes the album a sleeper. The definate standout track is \\"Corcovado\\" which is magnifically played & arranged (check out the bass chops throughout the whole track!).The true pitfall is the vocal production though. There appears to be none!(?). It seems ms. Belle has total freedom & uses it to the extreme. She NEVER quiets down(!) & ad-libs everywhere on EVERY track which makes the album really tiresome after a couple of tracks & leaves the impression of being very \\"2nd rate night-clubbish\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing \\"Lazy\\" about that voice !!!","review":"Although I should not have been, I was a bit surprised. I have been a fan of Regina's for years, have many of her LPs, CDs, and now to find her sounding better than ever: \\"knocked my socks off\\" so to speak. As I listened, musicians like Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, Dakota Staton, Peggy Lee, Leslie Uggams, Ella, Lena Horne, Ruth Brown, etc., came to mind. What a extraordinary talent is Regina Belle (and George Duke)! Like other reviewers, I was pleased (to say the least) to find that the vocalizations and lyrics were the main focus and the GREAT arrangements were NOT the least bit over powering or intrusive...just great music from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A needle in a haystack, a diamond in the trash.....","review":"Endangered species !Supremely divine voice and soulful interpretations with a refreshing jazz,groove sound that is a rare and priceless find in the heyday of saccharine smooth jazz, boyband, gangsta pop, hip-hop garbage.What a great CD !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister with a voice","review":"There are no words to describe what Regina, makes you feel, Lazy Afternoon, is a must have CD.

As if you are actually in the front row enjoying the wonderful sounds of Lady Belle.I am particularly impressed with Why do people fall in love,For the love of you (Perri Sisters,yeah!!!)and If I ruled the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.....","review":"How I so WANTED to love this CD...I really did. This CD dispells my theory that all you need is good music to have a great CD. The music is incredible and you cannot deny any arrangements and performances by George Duke. He is the absolute BEST, but Regina's vocals murder some really great compositions. Her voice just doesn't do what this awesome music does. Her vocals are choppy and she cannot complete a full note and carry it through with or without vibrato. If you've heard some of the great remakes of standards by Natalie Cole, Patti Austin (check out her version of Lazy Afternoon) and even Chaka Kahn, it's really hard to listen to this CD. This was a waste of some really good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ways of Nature","review":"If you are a nature lover, you will like this book. Burroughs in of the old time naturalists who loves to walk out in the natural world and just observe. Some of his habits was the shooting os birds to help in identification. He, of course did not have guides we have now with colors very correct. He later gave up this practice. Sadly, we do not have wide areas if undeveloped land to walk through. His descriptions do a lot to take us back yo that time. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"just the best!","review":"Kelly Flint and Dave Cantor! Wow! Love the hypnotic sound.

The Broken goes with an unsettling, psychological paranoia, rather than your typical American slasher. I won't bother going over the plot, as other reviews surely do; having read other reviews of this flick left me with questions about what they expected from it. Many complained about the lack of explanation for the bizarre doppelgänger effect going around the protagonist's life, when the main point of psychological thrillers is what isn't explained. That's what makes the experience so unsettling. And anyway, if they've seen Sean Ellis' work, before, they might know that it's his style to blur the line between reality and imaginative fantasy (or in this case, lethal paranoia). I'm a little disappointed in the lack of special features, but that's not at all surprising, considering how few even know about this film.Good film. Shipped well; shipped quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing!","review":"Has to be watched a few times to actuallly get the gist of the story but worth the effort, Lena Heady - great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Boredom","review":"This \\"After Dark Horrorfest III\\" flick is one of the worst in the series. The film is 93 minutes long and it could have been executed (probably should have been) in 30 minutes as an episode of the classic \\"Twilight Zone\\" TV series. It's a yawner. What a disappointment. If this is what we can expect from a potential Horrorfest IV series, then don't hold your breath. I rank this 5 on the Amazon rating system...for the slowest moving horror film of all time. I guess it's a psycho thriller...but it's a great film to turn on at midday and take a nap to. You could watch 15 minutes of it...snooze for an hour...and not miss anything in the last 18 minutes. Avoid this. The Horrorfest people should be ashamed. They've damaged their reputation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Celluloid","review":"I won't even try to describe the ridiculously vague plot, the inappropriate use of background music, or the obviously painted dummy of Lena Headey that looked like Pinocchio's wooden mother.

I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lena, Lena, Lena","review":"Yes, i am absolutely crazy in love with Lena Headey, and only watched this movie because i watch every movie with her in it. She is a female warrior on the level of Ellen Ripley. That being said, there are at least three scenes in this movie that are among the scariest i have ever seen in any movie, and i spend more time than i care to admit watching atmospheric thrillers and horror. Moreover, i had to watch it twice to be certain i understood what happened.

The bad and odd part is the movie ends without explanation. It is about mysterious beings that are possessing people's bodies. All of this filmed very realistically. The theme and setting are good, the plot builds, but then it's as if the producers ran out of money and ended the show. This movie will be forgotten. Too bad. It really had potential. At the least the viewer deserves an answer even if it is flimsy, difficult to recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow and bland","review":"I was disappointed by The Broken, it dragged endlessly and was sleep inducing, just took too long to make its point.

Rampant greed and colossal corruption on all levels, including the financial industry and lack of government regulation sent this country over the cliff in a short order of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End Of Work","review":"This book is a must read for all who want to understand the current employment situation, how it got this way and; how it will continue to progress.

I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable,insightful analysis but solutions are flawed","review":"Rifkin convincingly analyzes the impact on the work force of computerization and automation. The statistics are thorough. He explains the futility of current remedies, such as retraining, to deal with increasing unemployment wordlwide. His anwers to the problems, however, in the second half of the book are, as might be expected from this author, socialism with a human face, e.g. higher taxes, coercion and confiscation"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pessismistic view of the future - Interesting, but flawed.","review":"Pessimistic view of the future, where technology has eliminated most jobs as we know them. He sees downsizing as a trend which will continue into the future. It is, indeed, true that \\"jobs\\", as we remember them, are a thing of the past (cf. Wm Bridges, J. Bardwick, J. Wallulis, Chas. Handy, D. Rousseau). However, Riftkin's view is unneccessarily pessimistic. He sees this trend away from \\"jobs\\" as something that may lead to anarchy or, at the very least, a de-globalization of the working world reorganized into a community-based, third sector. This premise is interesting but flawed. Rifkin fails to see the positive consequences of this important trend. Research and thought in this area does not support Rifkin's premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope he is not right.","review":"The logic behind the book is pretty consistent and he supports his assesments with reliable data. He calls indirectly for the need of political intervention to avoid the process of technification to go to far creeating an enormous underclass of technologically illiterate people all over the World. It is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"NINE GOOD ONES BY LOUIS","review":"This is a collection of Louis L'Amour short stories from his early days, written in understandable, precise, clear-cut language which often emit a sense of justice and manhood/adventurer. \\"The Mangrove Coast\\" and \\"Fighters Should Be Hungry\\" were two of my favorites. These stories are easily read and last through a strong cup of coffee. Good introduction to Louis' writing style and his many stories and novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Short Stories","review":"Short stories, in my reading experience, are often weak.

This is completely different but good anyway.It's a collection of fairy tale-like stories with quirky, funny twists. They're all very random and amusing, minus a couple of touches of seriousness in one or two stories. There's not much else to say; it's a very cute book and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good, for a memoir.","review":"Annie Duke and David Diamond, Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions... And You Can Too (Plume, 2005)If you put aside the odd grammar of the book's title and dig into it, the first word that will no doubt come to mind is readable; I am not (to understate the case a great deal) a fan of memoirs, and I still devoured this in one day (while working on two other books as well). Duke, or co-writer David Diamond, or both, is a born storyteller. And while I grant you that people who don't play (or watch) poker are probably not going to be as on the edge of their collective seat during the relating of a particular hand in a particular tournament, there's more than enough meat in Duke's private life to keep the non-card-sharks interested as well. ***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"A must-have for any poker fan. Annie Duke is one of the most visible figures in the game and this autobiography provides a great insight into her life told in her own words. She exposes almost every facet of her personality, from her continuing battle with anxiety to her unyielding drive to win. The only slight negative to this book is that she repeatedly builds herself up. She carries a tremendous chip on her shoulder. Annie also appears arrogant at times, which is one of the principal criticisms other poker players have of her. All told, however, this is yet another great poker book that belongs in the collection of a serious player."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational for poker and for life","review":"This is a fascinating, entertaining book. Annie Duke is an incredible person -- in part because of her caring personality and her character strengths, and in part because of the turmoil that she's gone though in life while still emerging as a stong successful person. All these interesting aspects of her life come out as you read the book, together with some insight into how to play poker (both Omaha Hi-Lo and Texas Hold-Em).Duke's life provides a new twist on a Horatio Alger story -- she started with nothing, playing poker to earn her $125/month mortgage payment, and ended up winning $2 million at the ESPN Tournament of Champions. She endured ups and downs to get there, in poker and in life, and it's clear that she's come out a stronger, more emotionally balanced person as a result. This book helped teach me how to play better poker, but -- more importantly -- it gave me inspiration for how to live a flourishing balanced life."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to poker","review":"I found this book a fun, easy to read romp. I am a poker neophyte and casually picked this book up. I finished it in a day! I was drawn to the life Annie leads as well as her mind set when playing and learing poker. I especially loved the boxed poker tips. I would highly recommend this book for anyone on your gift list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares about her wasted life?","review":"When Annie Duke dies, what are people going to say about her? \\"She had a messed up family life and neglected her four children, but she played a pretty good game of poker.\\" Big deal. She's wasting her life, and this book is proof.And the book is flawed. She describes a hand where she has a king-high strait, but claims to have an ace-high straight. Even amateur poker players like me immediately noticed that error. It's simply unacceptable in a book like this. The equivalent would be Michael Jordan mentioning the NBA's 35-second shot clock in his biography, when in reality it's a 24-second clock. It's laughable. When a professional poker player can't get the rules straight, I have to seriously doubt her credibility. Don't waste your time with this unless you want to be bored and become confused with the rules of poker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Brazilian gold","review":"An excellent 2-CD best of which captures most of this Brazilian soft pop/soul crooner's best work from the late 1960s, as well as some some later traacks that reveal his shortcomings. Inventive, exhuberant pop music which occasionally hits great heights -- mysteriously, though, this collection omits his most awesome track, \\"Nem Vem Que Nao Tem\\", off the first \\"Alegria\\" album... but don't let that stop you -- if you want to check out this obscure lost pop legend, this collection is probably the best place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Comfort","review":"I have always worn Isotoner.

It can be used with or without the cartridge filter (which is bacteriostatic, and a good idea theoretically.) I gave one to my mother, and that one is in its second year and working well. On the other hand, I ordered one directly from Holmes in January, and it came and NEVER WORKED. The company was difficult to deal with...said they would replace it if I paid $10, but then admitted it was back-ordered and it would be MONTHS until they could replace it. They wanted to give me a cool mist, wick-type unit which I did not want. They would not refund my money until I wrote to my VISA card and made a formal complaint against them. It took months for them to finally refund my money for the unit and for filters that they never shipped. So, do not buy directly from the company! -CB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates puddle of water or wet carpet","review":"Major problem with this unit is the mist it creates falls to the floor and wets carpet or creates a puddle on hard floors. The only way I found to avoid this is to place the unit a few feet above the floor.On the good side, the filter is cheap, around $5.00. It is fairly quiet. It probably doesn't take a lot of power to run.I much prefer my warm mist humidifier that allows you to set the humidity you want the room to be, and there is no filter to replace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"User Unfriendly Design","review":"I haven't had the same problems as the other reviewers; it does put out a satisfactory stream of humid air, BUT the intake valve is junk.

Customer service insisted it was my fault for not leaving the tank open during summer storage, but I have another unit I purchased from Brookstone probably 15 years ago, which never had this problem.

We had a steam humidifier and, in retrospect, it worked great. A little noisy. A pain to clean. But it worked. I bought this humidifier and set it up. Heaven. Quiet, cool steam, fantastic. Then after a week there was no mist. I cleaned it, changed the water, wiped it down, even begged it but no go. The fan still works, but without the mist, it's just a decorative door stop.

Wish me luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humidifies the floor, not the air","review":"I originally bought this humidifier because it was smaller than the Bemis humidifier I already owned and because it runs quietly (I wanted to keep it in the bedroom to run at night). While the unit fit nicely in the small space I had available for it, and while it was indeed very quiet, the mist this humidifier produces did not disperse into the air but instead fell to the floor--and soaked it. I tried it in three places: first on the floor in my bedroom (where I'd kept the other humidifier I was using), next on my nighttable, and finally on a table in my living room over a hardwood floor (in the hopes that a less absorbent surface would be less likely to soak up the mist). In all three cases, the result was the same: a puddle on the floor beneath the unit. I returned it today and bought a second Bemis humidifier to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought this item and and was initally happy but after less than a month of use it stopped providing mist. I bought another as a replacement and it was dead out of the box. I called Holmes to have them replaced and they wanted me to pay $20 to have them replace THEIR defective products. After much annoyance they waived that fee and told me my replacements would be shipped in TWO months. Are you kidding me!!!. The product is a piece of junk and the company apparently doesn't care about customer service. If I never buy another piece of #@%^#$ from Holmes again it will be too soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Recommend This Unit","review":"It is pretty quiet and puts out a considerable amount of mist. But there are problems.1) Despite the fact that it comes with a demineralization cartridge that is supposed to eliminate white dust, there is white dust all over my furniture, and especially electrontic equipment.2) The unit is designed with many nooks and crannies that make it quite difficult to clean. And you will have to clean it regularly, since brownish gunk accumulates frequently.3) The opening to fill the water tank is too small to insert a normal sized hand, so it is impossible to wipe clean inside.4) As other reviewers have noted, a lot of the mist simply falls to the ground around the unit.5) Do not under any circumstances move the humidifier around while the tank is in place with water in it, or it is very easy for the water to overflow into the air vent and go down inside the base with the electrical components and short them out. This happened to me, and the unit promptly died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst consumer product I've purchased in years!","review":"This complete piece of garbage stopped producing mist after 3 nights of use.

I only use two sippy cups with my 1 year old, so I am washing both of them on a daily basis...DAILY, not a few days go by and I find it all gross and have to spend extra time cleaning it. I mean that if anything other than water is in this cup for more than 12 hours, there will be mold in the straw, the lid, the cup and everywhere in-between. I have never seen anything like it.

We have this cup in every color. It's the only one that works for us. We have even purchased replacement straw kits (found on ebay) for when the straw gets old. So far, they are holding up well. I put them in the dishwasher and they get dropped and they are still in good shape. The only thing I would recommend being careful with is the straw extension.

I'll bet a sequel comes out for the movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog and Kid Rescue","review":"We took our six-year-old granddaughter to see this movie and we all enjoyed it. I do dog rescue and my heart loved the message in the film that it is not okay to throw away our dogs when we are tired of them. The kids in the movie get stuck with some horrible foster parents and they want to stay together--brother, sister and dog. It is not all heart string pulling though; there are tons of funny moments in the film. A definite family movie worth seeing.

It is a cute example of carrying for others even animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"Most of the details of this movie have been covered in other reviews. There three issues with this movie. First of all, the kids exhibit criminal behavior from beginning to end of the film. Apparently, this is all completely excused by the end of the film, because it was all in a good cause. I would have felt a lot better about the kids if they had actually gone out and got a job and taken care of their dog in that manner. Second, the whole plot is really weak. The kids have no money, but some how have enough money to put together an amazing number of contraptions and get the power turned on in an old hotel. If they had that money to begin with, why are they pawning rocks for twenty bucks? Finally, the acting is not very good. Kids exhibit little emotion and the adult characters are two dimensional, to say the least.The only saving grace of the movie are the dogs which are well trained and cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but good.","review":"My daughters really liked the movie.

Even though I had not seen it at the time of purchase I knew that the family had watched it numerous times on Video on Demand... paying $5 each time to watch it. That meant it had to be very good for mom and dad to continue to permit the kids to rent it (plus the mom, my friend, absolutely loved the movie as well). I was able to watch it after the holidays had settled. It was an adorable movie about 2 siblings in the foster system and their dog (who they have hidden from their present and previous foster parents over a 3 year period). It shows that we all need a family, and this includes animals... that is how the hotel for dogs came to be... finding strays before the ended up in the pound.

It is impossible to deny Ms. Vaughan compliments for her melodic contours, colorful and dreamy, even. The first half of the disc, to me, is the better for its lack of the unflattering background singers.Here, her voice is maturer than her introductory \\"Body and Soul\\" or \\"Time After Time\\" while not yet reaching the vibratoed lows of her latter career.

I bought this book so I can brush up on my Cantonese. That is how I use the book. I don't know how any English speaker can learn from this book. The pronunciation keys are too hard to remember. It's is just because I know some Cantonese vocabulary that I can use it. For the words that I don't know I have a hard time of figuring out how it is supposed to be pronounced. I'll have to ask a relative or friend who is fluent in the language for the correct pronunciations. Cantonese is a very difficult language and a phrase book without any audio input is impossible.

A map is shown and directions to the hike are given along with detailed description of the hike. Many black and white photographs show views from the various hikes.

The hardest thing for any director to do is make the film following their big hit because one always feels they have to top it. La Dolce Vita (1960) was Fellini's awakening to the world of international cinema, and he was left bemused on what his next project should be. So in one of the boldest and most brilliant moves in cinema history Fellini made a film about the troubles of making that film. 8 1/2 is full of nice imagery, both real and surreal, and the inner emotions of the director come flying out in wonderous scene after scene. The human psyche has never been shown so artistically, and Fellini is able to balance the outrageous moments with more quiet moments in the film to create a thoroughly engrossing, dramatic, and fantastic film masterwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"STRONG AND POWERFUL","review":"This is how I want my movies to be.

And is a film that everything seems to work correctly: the music, photography, acting and direction of course. In a nutshell, a film that some may not like but can't say anything consistently negative against.I think the second mastepiece of Fellini is Giulietta degli spiriti (Juliet of the spirits, wich there's only a limited version around in DVD), wich I carry more hauntly in my memory, but it is not as perfect as 8 1/2, i would say.So, Buy this restored version of 8 1/2 and judge it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're lost...see 8 1/2!","review":"A fantastic film by Federico Fellini.

The sheep can't bleat their loyalty to received judgement fast enough. After two viewings, I have found nothing of value in 8 1/2. This movie consists of glamourous Italians going here and there talking about_nothing_, with occasional surrealistic hallucinations interspersed. This entire movie is a cheap trick, and that will be acknowledged in a more honest era. In the meantime, it is our duty, like the little child, to proclaim very loudly that the Emperor is naked!

I'm sure there are people who live horrible lives...but that's everywhere. And I really don't think another film about addictions, poor white trash, and rape is necessary. Just me.The acting is good. The film looks very professional. The writing...well...life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS","review":"this movie is one of the worst newer movies i have seen recently. i find it very sad that other people give this movie high ratings and praise. first of all the movie was lacking substance, the plot was so paper thin that the movie could have been a half hour long and still made its point. many things were pointless and certain things did little to move the story foward. for example, dakotas mother didnt even have to be in the movie bc her role was pointless. if they took that character out of the story, nothing would have changed. i feel this movie was full of useless fillers and pointless [...] that does little to connect me with any of the characters. another thing that bothered me was how nothing happened to the milkboy/rapist. wtf???!! then to top it all off, the movie ends abruptly. this movie was a waste of time. there are so many movies out there that wont put you to sleep, this one is not one of them. this is a very boring, slow, drawn out mistake of a movie. horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverRated","review":"I fell for the hype of this movie.I like Dkota Fanning but this whole movie was a waste of time to watch.

It's very difficult to comment on a movie that some would view as very controversial. I just think it is how we got to where we are today. Making what could be the simple life she lived, into a paranoid life that we live. Dakota Fanning was brilliant.... as always!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You ain't nothing but a Great Actress!","review":"Wow! What a great movie. This movie really is a well acted movie, especially Dakota Fanning's role.The movie is a little on the racy side with Dakota being so young and such a grisly role for a young actress to portray.

A textbook film-student's version of what the South has been and is. Films of this ilk have grown tiresome ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sad piece of crap","review":"The south is nothing like this, never was. Every aspect of the story was unrealistic. The author obviously has never been to the south and just made up their own romantic version. I've seen this happen over and over in films about the south.The only good part was when her dad got struck by lightening. That was hilarious. My sister and I watched that scene like four times. Even that was unrealistic.And what was that nonsense about the snakes in the tall grass? A pitiful attempt at symbolism?I think people like it just for the sexual content because the movie itself was garbage.If your looking for a movie like this just watch Slingblade. It's not realistic either but at least it's funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugary Poison","review":"I love southern gothic (like Cormac McCarthy's \\"Suttree\\") but this film is missing it's only crucial ingredient...truth.

Dakota did a wonderful job in this role. I can't believe another reviewer gave this gem a 1 STAR rating because of the \\"insinuated\\" rape scene. I thought it was handled very well, as there was no actual touching on screen AT ALL. Geesh, the rape scene in \\"The Entity\\" was much more graphic than this lol! I'm sure rape was a common thing back in the 60's in the deep, rural south and went unreported most of the time. It adds stark realism to the story, and I'm glad the writer, director & producer Deborah Kampmeier (yes, a woman) didn't sterilize it into another typical Hollywood Movie Machine film that conforms to what a bunch of no-brainers want to be bored by. This is definitely one of my favorite films so far this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Generation","review":"Dakota Fanning is one of those rare talents that comes along once in a generation. How many 12-year-old girls can carry the principal role in a movie, without being upstaged by the likes of Piper Laurie, David Morse, Robin Wright Penn and Afemo Omilanmi? This movie has all of the ingredients of one that you will love. The story line is deep and complex, and Penn turns in a tight performance as a woman with a troubled past, who feels a strong emotional connection with Lewellen. The unqualified star of the show, however, is Fanning, whose portrayal of a young girl on the cusp of exploring her sexuality, and struggling to understand her place in the world, is nothing short of stunning. The context provided by the south of the 1950s dishes up some great explorations of racial undertones and incestuous subplots. Morse, always reliable, is convincing as a tyrant, of course, but also as a physically and mentally compromised parent. If you're a fan of Fanning, this is a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hounddog","review":"Great social commentary on the lives of the haves, have-nots, and have less!

Instead, the author appears intent upon using the book to drive business to his Scrum certification business. He touts platitudes about \\"the rules of Scrum\\", but provides little substance. Outside of the basics -- that can be learned by simply searching for \\"Scrum\\" in a search engine -- the book offers little insight into how Scrum Masters conduct themselves differently than Project Managers. If you're looking for valuable insight into Scrum, skip this book. It was a waste of my money. One last gripe: The author wastes no opportunity to slam traditional Project Managers and projects run under the procedures of non-agile methodologies. Clearly, he has never worked for a good technical Project Manager on a well-run project. Contrary to his opinion, both do exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good case studies","review":"Enjoyed the case studies in this book, about three per chapter.

Instead of reiterating the Agilista dogmas, Ken focuses on the key aspects of Scrum (planning, retrospectives, product owner, etc.) and provides hands-on examples illustrating how Scrum has benefited each company and how it was adapted to fit the culture and sensibilities of each team.It's a quick and easy read, filled with a lot of insights.

I find these shoes to be very comfortable and one of the few shoes I can wear without special (and expensive) inserts.

Although it doesn't have a good arch support, unless you add an orthotic insert. It may be good for those who HAVE to wear formal-looking shoes at work. I can wear semi-formals at work, so prefer the black colored Asics GT-2150 over these. The Asics 2100 series are a masterclass of a shoe, no other shoe can rival the quality, fit and comfort. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing... for a Rockport","review":"I received a \\"Rockport Men's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe,Sand\\" from Amazon (sold by Shoe Station) today, paying about $96. This shoe was made in Vietnam. I have been wearing Rockports for at least 16 years, buying 1 about every 2 years; and they have all been perfect for me. I have found the Rockports most comfortable for my knees and feet, given that I have arthritis and diabetes. Not this one. After about 8-9 hours of wear and normal walking, I have terrible pain in my ankles and knees. The shoe pinches the outer edges of my feet and appear to be tilting inwards. Also, the appearance is quite tacky (plastic like) and different from the picture... although that is not the real issue here. Comfort and durability are the main reasons why I have been buying Rockports all these years. So this was quite disappointing; and I hope that this is an exception rather than a drop in Rockport standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Walking Shoe -- Uncomfortable","review":"I've worn Rockport for years hiking, working and leisure all with the same shoe and consistently had the shoes last well over a year, even after day to day use. The previous shoe style I would buy, a similar nubuck style, was discontinued. So, I gave this shoe a try expecting similar performance. That didn't happen. The World Tour shoe appears to be as well made as any other Rockport I've owned but after one week of wearing the shoe, I'm considering returning it to Amazon as defective. First, the inner soles are not uniform. The lack of uniformity wasn't enough for me to send them back, so I worn them for about a week. These aren't walking shoes. These are cheap \\"knock-off\\" walking shoes. No other shoe or boot I own causes this amount of discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking pair of shoes","review":"I bought these as I like the Rockport line of shoes.

Amazon Prime is great!I bought the shoes after reading so many favorable reviews. Most people say these are very comfortable shoes. I got the brown ones. The leather is real stiff. After wearing them for two consecutive days they still do not feel comfortable. They pinch the top of my feet, especially when I walk down the stairs.

I paid about 75 bucks for a shoe that could be had for 45 in most places...But what the hey! It will be comfortable! WRONG! Sure, they fit well.

I am a big guy (6'5\\", 350 lbs) and require very comfortable shoes or my feet are killing me by the end of the day. These shoes are perfect for me. The leather does seem to be wearing abnormally fast on the back of my left shoe, on either side of the heel, but I think it's from when i roll to and away from my desk and one of the wheels of my chair rubs the side of my foot. This doesn't affect the comfort of the shoe though, so it doesn't really bother me.

The shoes are very comfortable, however within two weeks of wearing the shoes one of shoe the lace started fraying. Reason was that one of the eyelet was not set in properly and has a sharp edge that kept cutting on the shoe lace. My first pair ever with a defect and it was a ROCKPORT shoe.Rockport needs to implement their quality control if they want to keep the brand up. Thanks to AMAZON's return policy. Defective one is out and new one without defect is in. AMAZON took care of shipping both ways.

This particular lace pulls apart when it becomes blemished!!!Amazon needs to send out extra shoe laces if this is the type of product it is selling(seconds???)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Shoe","review":"This was my first purchase of a Rockport shoe and I expected a lot more due to all of the glowing reviews of this model. I ordered a 12M and the shoes were the correct size, but the tongue on the left shoe dug into my ankle bone while walking (others have mentioned this issue as well). I wore them an entire day at my office job to see if I could get over it, but a shoe shouldn't be this uncomfortable during break-in. The stock insoles feel thin and unsupportive as well. The support improved when I put in some aftermarket insoles from my old shoes, but they still chew on my ankle. The overall stitching, leather, and build quality look good but that doesn't make up for discomfort. Some people have mentioned the World Tour's sold by Amazon are Grade \\"B\\" shoes...I'll have to test that theory if I find a retail store that stocks them. Unfortunately I've only seen the \\"Eureka\\" model in stores.

I usually buy from Zappos directly but this time I chose Amazon instead, because I thought they were doind business together already. Not so. The shoes I received were marked as XW, which is how they are always marked when I buy them. This pair feels a lot narrower than XW.

The fit very comfortably and are well constructed. I have always purchased the model MWT18. Rockport offers several models called \\"World Tour\\" and they are not all alike. These have a nice pebble finish. I believe the inferior models others found were not the MWT18. Many years ago, they came out with the World Tour 2000, which was far inferior. At that time, Macy's discontinued carrying the MWT18. My only complaint about these shoes is that they perform poorly on wet surfaces.

I've had a women's pair for over 10 years and they still look brand new. I buy the men's pair for my husband, who wears them to work every day and is incredibly rough on shoes, and he swears by them. My husband requires a new pair every 18 months-2 years, and we pay $60 for a pair through Amazon rather than $200 in Australian stores. Comfortable enough to wear all day from the moment you buy them, hard wearing and fashionable enough for men to wear with a suit, they are a perfect shoe. If you have a wide foot, get the 2A size.

I would pull the tongues up and they stopped hurting but only for a few steps, then they were back to in-pain-position. It took over a week for the corners to soften up enough that they weren't so irritating; another week and the shoes were comfortable. I've gone through 4 or 5 pairs of these shoes over the years, these were the first to hurt; previous pairs took only a 1-day break-in period.

The story alternates between two narratives of the protagonist Lucia: the memoir Lucia is writing about the week before the premiere of the first movie she directed, and the journal she is writing 30 years later as she lies in the hospital with an undiagnosed illness. The way it is written, however, both narratives feel like present day stories. Montero's conversational writing style makes her very easy to read, even with the switches in narrative and with Lucia's philosophical commentaries on love, relationships, and death. It is both entertaining and mildly thought-provoking. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exemplifies profound entertainment","review":"This book is a rare find in that it manages to evoke laughter and heartache. It can be read as a light romp, but upon reflection, the reader will almost certainly recognize and perhaps confront some of the human condition's recurring quandries in Montero's characters.

It took a very long time to get here, and on x-mass morning when he wanted to watch it we found out that we did not have the right dvd player for the region, I guess it only plays in England. We never knew there were regions and everyone I asked also knew nothing about it.

I have never been nor will I ever be as affected by a film as I was by \\"Oliver!\\". It is heart warming, sad, humorous, scary, absolutely touching every single emotion. Every single actor/actress was casted perfectly. The songs, dances and scenes all Oscar caliber, as evidenced by the Best Picture Oscar. I fell in love with this movie and have seen it well over a thousand times. I would recommend it to everyone. This musicial has heart and soul. Anyone who would find fault with this classic movie is an unhappy person who cannot delight in the happiness of a perfectly acted, directed and produced movie for all ages.

You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Disc, Different Package","review":"This movie is excellent and deserves five stars but this release on DVD has the same problem as the first release, and because I've bought both from this studio I feel I have a right to complain.

I am not a technical expert, but the sound quality for both the dialogue and especially the music (5.1 dolby digital) was so bad that I am going to return this and wait for an updated version. This movie won Oscars for sound and music back then, and they totally blew it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver","review":"The movie is great - a classic I grew up with, however, the one I purchased was missing the first half of the movie. The CD was a copy and started with the intermission of the second half. I sent back to the distributor - waisting more money with hopes that a new and complete movie will come back to me. My son was so excited to see the movie so we were all dissapointed that it was a defective DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY FILMED MUSICAL","review":"I first saw \\"Oliver\\" when I was eight at the State Theate in Woodland, California; I just finished watching it again on DVD and I still love it! Mark Lester was an inspired choice for Oliver, and his scenes are most affecting especially with Fagan and his gang.Nancy was played by the now-forgotten Shani Wallis and she's terrifically effective in her love scenes with Bill Sikes and her singing \\"It's a Fine Life\\" is a joy to behold. Ron Moody scores strong as Fagan; he's simply marvelous. Onna White did the amazing choreography and the songs are certainly well sung. The scene where Oliver awakes in Mayfair has a special quality to it: through the window, he watches below as the street vendors sing the haunting \\"Who Will Buy?\\" Oliver Reed is fine as Bill Sikes and the Artful Dodger is memorably played by Jack Wild. It won the AA for best picture of 1968 ; it's a shame we don't see more similar films in today's cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I first saw this movie at the show when I was 11 or 12. I saw it over and over. Those were the days when you could go to the show and stay till the theatre closed. I also had a huge crush on Jack Wild (the Artful Dodger). Now I look at him and think he was a cute enough kid, but where the mad love came from I don't know. There are too many great songs and moments in this movie for me to name just one or two. This one is for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family Movie!","review":"We watched this with our whole family. Our kids range from 15 to newborn and everyone enjoyed it!

Everyone in the movie looks like they could use a good scrubbing or bath. Bill Sykes is one of the most vile villans in the movie world. I mean he's just evil. Overall, I would say this is a movie for all ages. There are only two death scenes in the whole movie; one is when the bad guy dies and the other isn't even shown. I say buy it and see for yourself. This movie will suprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know!!

Watch this and for hours after you'l' be \\"Reviewing the situation\\". The movie is split onto 2 sides with an annoying intermission in the middle, which is the slowest moving thing I've ever seen, but that does not take anything away from the mastery of this movie. Plus you get a handy CD with all the songs to carry around with you, a must for all aspiring stage performers. I've never set foot on a stage nor had designs to do so, until the role of Fagin comes up in a local theater. I AM going to play Fagin at some point in my life, then retire from the world of acting knowing I have portrayed a character in the greatest musical ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"Good movie; the film came as advertised and I'm glad I got it.

Wondering over that haunted my reading of the entire book.In America Girl SCOUTS not Guides sell cookies.When reading history of the WWII era from contemporary sources almost all sources refer to Russia as opposed to the Soviet Union.The writing became very sloppy in the last hundred odd pages with many words escaping sentences. Slow down and re-read before publishing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Concept","review":"A fun reading and fascinating concept. John Birmingham hasn't disappointed again in this my second book under his authorship. The battle descriptions while enjoyable (read like a Clancy Novel) were a little long in some areas (like the first 100 pages), but the anachronistic interactions between the time travelers and residents of 1942 were not only entertaining and fascinating. The happenings and ideas from the plot line seemed very plausible and the hint of future plot directions make me excited about reading the next in this trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's....... \\"ok\\", but not for me","review":"I generally consider myself to be an alternate history fan. I've read Turtledove and Eric flint among others. I suppose the first thing that stands out about this book is that I don't think it really qualifies as alternate history as opposed to simply techno-military thriller and using, well it's isn't even \\"really\\" time travel per se but more the parallel universe premise a la Timeline by Michael Crichton, or 1632 by Eric Flint. That said I can see where others might like this book, but me personally, I must decline. The initial premise and the first meetings of the uptimer and downtimer characters takes way too long. I'd even dare to say that with the exception of the time travel event nothing really happens in the first hundred pages. I also felt the characters were not terribly likable. I only got about half-way through before I put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting alternate history story.","review":"It is not without its flaws (I agree with an earlier review in that the modern characters could have used some more personality flaws), but ultimately, I found it an interesting exploration of an intriguing idea, and am looking forward to reading its sequel. However, I would like to address both HaloJonesFan and J. Reed: lighten up! HaloJonesFan- This is not some parody of conservative fears about gender roles being upended, but a simple military thriller set in a very unique setting (I also disagree with your assessment of it as full of mindless carnage). J. Reed: calling HaloJonesFan a \\"lefty loon\\" and assuming that he is a \\"lefty-elitist\\" who feels that anyone who likes this is stupid is simply insulting and simpleminded, and calling him that will do nothing to improve his opinion of your worldview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not any better the second time around","review":"I read this book when it first came out, then forgot I'd done so. Saw a copy in the bookstore recently and bought it. Oops. I think one of the jacket blurbs describes the novel as Clancyesque, and it sure is, in all the worst ways- the uber-bitchy female reporters, the loving descriptions of weapons, and the colorfully named and one-dimensional military heroes. The author, an Aussie, appears to have little familiarity with how actual Americans talk. He also has issues with the Japanese- they're generally portrayed as inhuman fanatics, and the 21st-century characters are calling them \\"Japs\\" almost as soon as they arrive in 1942. Bottom line- if you like Clancy, Thor, etc. then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly smart","review":"My expectations for this book dropped when I read an interview with Birmingham in which he said that his goal when writing it was to produce the dumbest book ever.However, and possibly despite himself, the book ended up being very smart and is a cut above the average pulp sci-fi/techno thriller as a result. The story's background has been very well thought out, the quality of the writing is excellent and the storyline itself is an absolute hoot. The only downside is the over-long fight scene which dominates the second third of the book.While this book won't change your life (I hope!), it is a fun read and ranks well ahead of most of its' competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops more F'Bombs than real ones","review":"I wish they'd come up with some way to rate these books for language and content. I'm not entirely a prude but I don't like being around people who use more single syllable words than not and I'm not interested in forcing my brain to read through page after page of f'bombs.I understand that this is supposed to be a book concerning the military and while the language may be \\"accurate\\" I don't think it's necessary to make the story work."},{"rating":"1","title":"over the top liberal bias - no thought given to the human struggle","review":"Come on. If every \\"enlightened\\" person could go back in time they would find a world so different from today's politically correct world. We had to struggle as humans to get to this point. How unfair would it be to have some ninny from the future come back and judge as us as being so unenlightened? Well duh! People and societies evolve. Every paragraph of this book is replete with John Birmingham's liberal bias and finger pointing. It's definitely no Tom Clancy novel. You could read a kindergarten book about treating all people fairly and get the same message without the unrealistic, unresearched and ridulous story line. Go outside and count the cars that drive by and you'll have more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Get the rest of the series before you start reading book 1; you won't want to wait before starting book 2 - then book 3.

I'll post there in a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"Its a sad commentary when Turtledove is less biased in his PC commentary than this book is. This book is misnamed it should be called \\"Politically Correct Super People VS The Dead White Males of The Past.\\"The book is so pc it reads like a joke the people from the future are all paragons of virtue. While the people from the past are all racist smelly homophobes. Trashing the generation that made it possible for you to write this book in order to preach pc rhetoric just doesnt cut it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair but not Good","review":"I have to agree with a majority of the observations that Matt Kaufman made. I will not repeat his observations but will add some of my own without revealing some good plot twists.The most obvious is why the nuclear option was not discussed anywhere in the first book. I also do not think the advances in military culture (large numbers of women in high places and on subs) and technology could take place in just another 15 years, maybe 40 years from now but not by 2021. The twist at the end is also hard to fathom, but I will let you decide. The book is an interesting read, but I am not sure if I will read the next one at full price. 2.5 stars but that is not an option"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy meets the final countdown","review":"I bought the book partly because of the reviews by other readers, and frankly don't understand what the fuzz is all about. The concept of the book was 'borrowed' from the movie 'the final countdown' and rather un-original. The techo-stuff is ok, but the characters are very flat and don't seem to have a personality, besides their miltary role. True, the culture-stuff is mildly entertaining but after a few pages you get point. The way the book is structured is not very original either and probably 'borrowed' from Red Storm Rising from Tom Calncy, which by the way was a lot more fun to read. However, I did want to finish the book so it wasn't a total waste of time, but I won't be bothered buying the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"gross","review":"Birmingham goes out of his way to produce a gross, un-P.C. WWII cast of characters that attack all persons other than white males who have arrived from the 21st century. The caricatures are laughable.Even worse, he takes 21st century women journalists and turns them into the lowest form of no-self-esteem sex maniacs.From both groups the language is foul and unappealing. It adds nothing to the story. I waded through 75% of the book, first because I like time travel and second because I like to find new authors/series. I appreciate that it was free and I would have been willing to pay full price for the \\"next in series\\".In this case I feel like I need to go take a shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"This book seems to have been inspired by \\"The Final Countdown\\" that great alternate history/sci-fi film about a modern aircraft carrier going back in time to days before Pearl Harbor. The book expands on the theme by sending a multinational fleet from our near-future back to the middle of WWII. While the multiple characters do get confusing, the story is really compelling as the author runs in all directions with themes untouched in \\"The Final Countdown.\\" If you loved that movie, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Book","review":"One of the best books I've read. I couldn't put it down. Starts out with what seems like boring information, but you must read all the background information about the ships and the people involved because it will be useful later. I found myself turning back the pages to re-read the background info. It starts with a BANG! and never lets up. It mixes sci-fi with history and creates and alternate history and does a great job. I highly recommend this book and will get the next. My first purchase was a kindle freebie, but I'm hooked on the series will buy the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Starts off with a bang and rolls on.

The technical stuff is great but so are the characters..I want to know when the next book is due!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, unimaginative,boring....","review":"What a relief to finish this unimaginative book. I was sorely disappointed after having read the reviews. My only wish is that the muslim extremist had succeeded in blowning up the ship at the end and this silly \\"trilogy\\" would die the quick death it deserves. The pacing was painfully slow, the characters were numerous and not one of them were developed into anything that would make one care whether they survived or not. I wish a black hole would swallow this whole book away where it belongs...There are so many better books out there that to say this book is anything but lousy is a wonder. What do these people read who rate this book worthy of anything other than kindling? They must read worse books than this so that this looks good in comparison. Good grief.Do yourself a favor and pass this by."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Mainstream' must mean mediocre","review":"I picked this book up in the bookstore to see what all the good reviews are so happy for.Rather pathetic would be better description. I wonder if any of the critics so raving actually read it. I wonder how much history or even militery knowledge any of them might have beyond watching a few JAG episodes.This is the awful type of book I have come to loath, an unrealistic sci-fi set in the past. A modern carrier battle group falling into the past to 'save the day', why not the starship Enterrise?I should not have been suprised that this book is awful by the choice of whom the carrier was named for.Certainly all this book proves is that though the technowlogy of the past was inferior, the brains were much better.'Sexist' and 'racist' attitudes of the past so eagerly condemned can only be matched in brainlessness as tThe Politically Correct attidudes the elite espouse here in the present.I put this one back on the shelf.Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weapons of Choice (As Long as it is PC)","review":"I'm not going to add anything to the previous reviewer's objections to the stultifying P.C. sermons.What I found boring was the colossal amount of filler which did nothing to advance the story. Mr Birmingham could have neatly spun this trilogy in one book without providing me with serial doses of soporifics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me More!","review":"I loved this book and can't wait for the follow ups. My main complaint is that the lazy author should have delivered already. It looks like it's been a year since this came out.Unlike some I didn't have a problem with his characters. In places I thought there was too much character development and not enough action! Well, that's untrue. There's action on almost every page, but for my shoot-em-up tastes, Birmingham coulda chopped out some love scenes and replaced them with stuff being blown up.A minority view perhaps, but mine.Did I mention that I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for alternate history fans","review":"If you are a fan of alternate history, particularly alternate war history,this is the book for you. The pace is excellent and the issues raised concerning the clash of past and future, in both military and cultural terms, is compelling. Aside from Turtledove's works this is probably the best alternate history book I have read in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one from 1942 behaves realistically in the last 2/3 of the book","review":"The first third of the book was interesting in a Tom Clancy-esqe near future meets the past with a bang sort of way.However, after the inital encounter, no one from 1942 behaves the way that real Allied leaders would have behaved in 1942. The task force from the future had enough information and firepower to take out the leadership of all the Axis powers *easily* and likely end the war immediately, yet they do nothing of the sort.But that would mean no sequel books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to read them all...","review":"Usually I have strong opinions on what I read. But in this case I had to read many of the \\"one star\\" reviews of this book to help me determine what was bothering me. I agree with much of what is said in the \\"one star\\" reviews -- too much political correctness, predictable plot, cardboard characters.Yet, as I sit here writing this review I must admit I have read the entire series. That's why I had to give it a \\"four star\\" rating. Something kept me coming back. Maybe it has to do with my age. I was a child during WWII. There is something about the idea of going back in time with the technology of today... There is also something about how, after all these years, we have not changed enough. We still carry all our hates, fears and biases.Guess you'll have to see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike","review":"A BIG disappointment. The author shares the same qualities as Tom Clancy in that he is great at producing a good technological yarn when it comes to conflict. Character development, on the other hand, is HORRIBLE. Every one of the 1942 era individuals in the book is a borderline fascist, homophobe, bigot, etc., while the \\"modern\\" 21st protagonists vary between incredibly shallow, two-dimensional characters (the women in particular make Lara Croft seem like DaVinci) or smug and self-righteous. If you want a better read, stick with Harry Turtledove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money! Don't buy it!","review":"I tried, I really tried. I bought part 2 of the trilogy but it was too hard to follow. So I bought this, the 1st of his trilogy, but it's hard to follow a story that sounds like it's written by a 13 year old. The worst part of the story is the vulgar language the author uses. So much foul language and racist remarks make me wish I never spent money on this book and his part 2 of the trilogy.... I WON'T be wasting my money on the 3rd book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Australian SF Reader","review":"Sort of a reverse Philadelphia experiment, girls allowed.This is firmly in the military technothriller camp, with bunches of yank military types doing their thing, and details of ranks, weapons, all that sort of thing. People who don't like those likely won't like this. Throw in some time travel and a less biased outlook than say, Patrick Robinson's 'kill all the foreigners that disagree', you get something a bit more Dale Brown than that. A 2021 wormhole tech experiment screws up badly and sends a 21st century Multinational naval force back to 1942, where they proceed to mistakenly shoot the crap out of the US fleet heading to do the same to the Japanese at Midway (complete with Prince Harry and the odd Aussie on board).

Less is more or so the old saying goes or should have gone for this book. Overall, it's an interesting idea for a story but not told very well. I may or may not read the next one.

I can't wait to read the next two installments. It is fast paced, intelligent and very detailed. The technology is plausible and well thought out, the characters are interesting (a little PC though) and not cardboard cutouts. The humor is genuinely funny and not forced, the interaction between the future reporters and the 40's sailors is priceless and had me laughing out loud. I loved all the nods of the hat to Turtledove's work (Space Lizards, indeed!) and pop culture references. Finally a time travel series without a reset button and consequences for their future timeline... I am glad that a few of the past sailors weren't all portrayed as racists and sexists, a good mix was thrown in all around. My only complaint is having to wait so long for the next ones!!!

WOW!","review":"Before somebody got really smart and reissued this CD in Feb. 2009 the original RCA disc was, at times, often selling for over $100 on the big auction site. This was possibly the most collectible of all Manilow albums (more so than the TV soundtrack to \\"Copacabana\\") because of the poor promotion and handling of Barry by RCA. After many years with the Arista (and previous Bell) label Barry chose to leave for RCA and this album was his first, and only, release for that label. I have owned this CD since it was originally released and have always been amazed that with the repeated reissue of much of Manilow's music this title was never included. Now, maybe because BMG owns virtually all of the major labels and their catalogs (including RCA, Sony, Columbia & Arista) this album has resurfaced. If you're a Manilow fan you absolutely can't go wrong with the CD, and the price is certainly right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the bass player (Keter Betts) on this CD","review":"Listen to Keter Betts on this CD and you will be puzzled as to why only hard-core jazz cats are hip to this (late) great bassist.

To borrow an overused cliche, this is \\"Smooth Jazz\\" at its best. BUt the homogenized smooth jazz of today but the sweet delicious tone of Staz Getz. This is music to hold hands to , music to make love to, music to gaze at the moon.

I am annoyed that consumers are asked to pay for 60+mins of music only to receive 35.07mins. There is a great deal of empty space on sale in this CD. This re-issuing caper is not new. If a premium price is to be asked, a good strategy (demonstrated by many other examples) is to bundle up the vinyl release with other material as it goes to CD. If Verve/PolyGram are interested in delivering value then they should have got it somewhere closer to the 75min that's possible. The other problem that I have with this CD is the incredibly poor design of the CD wallet. The booklet provided within has the infuriating habit of slipping out. And why shouldn't it - there is nothing to hold it in! Were the folk at Verve/PolyGram to design automobiles then occupants could expect to be dumped on the roadside at each and every corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrd at the height of his powers","review":"I was given this album when it first came out and of all my music it's my favorite.

It spans the last 15 years of Billie's life on this planet and takes multiple tracks from all her Verve albums. Sound quality is very good, even on the live recordings from 1945-47. Billie's voice actually holds up quite well on most of the tracks with the exception of the last 2 tracks taken from her final album, I would have left out those tracks because her voice is just not there. It's quite chilly listening to the shell of the former artist. But the entire 2 CD set is well worth the experience of sitting thru 2 hours plus of what has come to be the Holiday experience, a journey thru every emotion you can experience as a music fan and lover of jazz music.

Firstly, it is a very short novel coming in at about 125 pages compared to many that are 1000 pages or more. Secondly it is fast paced compared to many of his other novels.The worlds of war and of peace, highlighted in the first two chapters are brought together in a poignant and thought provoking manner in the final chapter.The subject matter is not pleasant, covering as it does a major war situation in Korea and how it impacts upon many people, but it is a thought provoking publication and worthy of a read - the length and pace making it possible for many readers to read it in one day. The story and message though have lingered with me for much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick but rewarding","review":"Michener's powerful storytelling ability drives this book, although it's merely a fraction of the length of most of his other work. The tale centers on a reluctant Korean War pilot and his relationships with his commanding officer, his fellow soldiers, and his family in the face of impending doom, symbolized by the titular bridges. Over its short space, the story runs the gamut of emotions from despair to fear to exhilaration and back again with a you-are-there intensity. The reader may also gain insight into the camaraderie among soldiers in wartime. This is a very solid quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well known novel by James A. Michener","review":"This excellanet novel was the basis of an equally excellant motion picture that was made of the same name. It imortalizes those who fought in the air over the Korean Pennisula in what is sometimes known as the \\"Forgotten War\\".

All characters, though, are cardboard clichés without one single shadow of psychological interest or point. Pulp-fiction characters, totally, and thoroughly sentimentalized.The novella's main thesis, \\"what a shame that the noble military sacrifice so much while the American people don't really care\\", fails to explain why average Americans who are not military contractors or otherwise parasites of the \\"defense\\" milk-cow should concern themselves about an undeclared war for very far-away imperial turf. The notion entertained by the old admiral that this is simply one further battle in the endless Manichan struggle between the Forces of Light (America) and the Forces of Darkness (The Rest of the Universe) is still very much with us, but is made neither more respectable nor more understandable by this little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroism","review":"This is a well-written short story centered around a fictional U.S. Navy pilot and set during the Korean War.

It's an obscure book today, but it holds a special place in my heart and mind, and has so for nearly my entire life. I first read it in the late 1950's, when I was a young teenager. The adventure and graphic violence was probably shocking to me then, but the book inspired me to make reading about Africa and it's history a serious hobby back then.I read the book the second time when I was an adult in my 30's.

This is not a book for the hard nosed Java programmer, but definitely worth a read for someone who is starting out with Java. Concepts are explained very accurately, and this is far removed from the 600-page tomes in the sense that this is safer: It's not heavy enough to smash your PC screen when you cant get that dang program to work!

It fails in both respects. It is so heavily laced with attempts at over-the-top humor that it becomes unreadable. The reader is left sifting the text for actual information about Java, and often coming up empty-handed.

You can't call it an informative read, as lay readers will accept the key information about java, and may very well take on onboard some of the dangerous, absurdist concepts that the author, CE3, introduces around the basic concepts.It's not a book for the novice who wanted a humourous, informative introduction to Java, and certainly not a book for a Java developer who wanted to laugh at the profession.A travesty of a book.

Some of the short stories in this collection show that excellence. Some suffer a little due to dating from the passage of time and changes in our attitudes, manners, and expectations and in the technology that now exists and so apparently is absent in some of these stories.I first read these stories over 50 years ago and they were magnificent then.

All in all this is a beautiful, soft doll that will deffinatly last for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!!!!!","review":"It looked good online but when we received it - it looked like a piece of cheesecloth stuffed with cotton that has been twisted and contorted in the shape of a head and body. When I removed the tag - all of the cotton stuffing came out of her wrist. This item is so cheap and not worth even 1.00. It is really the worst buy I have ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"My daughter - now 14 months - has two of these dolls. One at home and one for day care. She sleeps with them and loves them!We got one as a \\"new baby\\" present and when she decided it was her favorite I bought a back-up. We've washed them numerous times and haven't had any problems. One of the great things about this doll is that she's so light... any small child can drag her around with no problem. Definately a great first doll for any little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute","review":"My 2 year old loves this \\"baby doll\\". She received it for Christmas last year and has slept with it ever since. I think it is so cute. I plan on buying a few more for gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD player can't read it","review":"The CD is a \\"Super Audio\\" CD. My less than a year old CD player from Costco, can't read it. I don't know what my options are because I opened it and tried to play it before I knew it wouldn't work!!!I am very disappointed and feel stuck and out money because I purchased it on-line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like this, you must try...","review":"Hopefully this will not be interpreted as a flagrant advertisement. I am not affiliated with the below mentioned artist in any way. BUT...If you are anything like me and have loved this Getz/Gilberto album (for me it was far and away my favorite Brazilian music), you really MUST hear a much more recent artist by the name of Marcio Faraco. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. He has three CD's you will find on Amazon and I have brief reviews of each. His style is very reminiscent of Gilberto and the recording quality excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful remix of a classic album","review":"This digital remix from the original analog multi-track tapes is a disaster. Why do today's engineers insist on second guessing the marvelous work of previous generations? On Ipanema, the new modified balance between Getz and Astrud is terrible. Getz's sax utterly overpowers her delicate voice. And the new widened soundstage has Astrud so far off to the right that she sounds like she's in another room.I'm listening to this remixed CD using a top-end audiophile CD player and the warmth of the original mix is very much lacking. So is the crystalline clarity of the vocals, which is now lost to the overemphasized highs. I'm comparing directly with the original release of the song \\"...Ipanema\\", found on the 2xCD set titled \\"Stan Getz: The Best of the Verve Years, Vol. 1\\". There, the song sounds fabulous; just like on the lovely LP. This new remixed Getz/Gilberto CD is a stinker, as are so many remixed classics. Look for this album on vinyl or original mix CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing to say---","review":"I do not know a word of Portugese, but I can sing \\"The Girl From Impanema\\" by heart -- in Portugese. That's how many times I've played this album.If you can and have the means to play it, get this in its original LP format. But the CD is most excellent as well, and if you haven't ever heard it, I encourage you to buy it right now; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jazz from the 60s","review":"Sax player extrodinaire Stan Getz brought Bossa-Nova to the USA with this album by teaming up with Brazilian guitar player Gilberto. Gilberto's wife (who didn't speak any English) read the lyrics phonetically, and stole the show with her cool-distant-sounding monotone vocals. A Great album that topped both the Pop & Jazz charts in 1964. It grows on you. If you were born in 1965, you may have been conceived to this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music!","review":"Wonderful and relaxing music. Very soft, wonderful sound tracks. There are two soundtracks of \\"The Girl From Ipanema,\\" with the first being the ultimate recording. I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys cool jazz or any relaxing International-style music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Bossa Nova CD","review":"One of my favorite CD's. I can listen to it repeatedly without complaint as I love Astrud's voice and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Diamond","review":"This album is just divine. The music is soothing, relaxing, and very sensual. It's the perfect album for an intimate dinner or when you just want to unwind. Astrud Gilberto's vocals are laid back and languorous. to sum it all up: perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"Got a Oppo universal player. Started reading about super audio CDs, and it was intriguing. If you happen to be looking for a full catalog of SACDs check out sa-cd.netThis disc was highly recommended. At such a cheap price compared to many titles out on the market, it was easy to pull the trigger, and give it a listen. Verdict, that was $13 dollars well spent! This sounds fantastic. The music is smooth, and very relaxing. Definitely will be looking for some more Getz Gilberto and jazz releases. I remember as a kid hearing the song The Girl from Ipanema. Never knew the title or the artist, as a kid you don't really pay attention to such things. But when it started playing, that just brought a grin to my face.Only reason for not giving 5 stars, this is SACD only; it will not play in a normal CD player. Their is a hybrid version of this disc, but it is silly expensive ($100+)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Collector's Must Have!","review":"This is a classic if you don't have this you are missing out! Very relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getz's Best","review":"I never tire of this recording. There are three great artists complemented by the natural talents of Astrud.Getz's playing was never better--before or after. I like to think that his playing was informed by true love.(Getz & Astrud had an affair during the recording.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime & Timeless","review":"When \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" first hit the airwaves I was just 17 yrs old. I was blown away. I immediately bought the Getz/Gilberto album, and thus began my collection of Brazilian music. When I saw this remastered version I bought two (one for a sibling). Thank you to Verve for reviving it. I've bought many albums in my lifetime but this is the one I listen to more so than any other. The track \\"Para Machucar Meu Coracao\\" is so beautiful - a masterpiece by the composer Ari Barroso who also composed \\"Brazil\\". Jobim performs the best version of \\"Brazil\\" in his album \\"Stone Flower\\" - it's worth hunting it down. It is music that touches your soul and inspires the spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"in and out of fashion, but never out of style","review":"It is time for a whole new generation of jazz lovers to \\"discover\\" this sound. Although Stan Getz certainly did not discover these Latin rhythms, through this album he is largely responsible for making it accessable to the American audience. The music and singing speak for themselves. They speak in the universal dialect of lounges, cocktail hours, ratpack-hipsters, romance and equatorial climes. Since we all seem to be participating in this nostalgia, good old days, retro culture that has gripped us like a boa-constrictor, why not participate with a little style and taste? Good God people, buy this album, mix up a batch of martinis, and indulge yourselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our intro to Jazz ... has lead us to discover more good music","review":"This was one of the first few CDs that pulled me into Jazz and since then there has been no looking back. I now not only Love Jazz but have tuned into an audiophile. Since then I have updated my equipment - to get closer to the music and performers.Light, soulful, deep and touches the heart, makes a great gift too.SO for me, this CD started my audiophile journey and still remains as one of the enjoyable CD in my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music I Will Propose To","review":"I am 47 and remember this album when I was a young teenager. It's not only nice to have it as a CD reissue but as a Valentine's day gift to a very young fiancé who has never heard it before is going to be my Cupid's arrow.I am a widower at a young age and for me to have the opportunity to have met someone so beautiful and so much younger and who shows real promise as wanting a lasting relationship is such a stroke of good fortune for me. I know that this music will make our love grow strong enough that my marriage proposal will be accepted.I hope you see this, Honey and know who sent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Stan Getz at his Best!!!","review":"This album couldn't be more beautiful. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it on an old LP. Everyone should have this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bossa Nova Classics","review":"This is a significant CD of Bossa Nova classics. Performers are top-notched saxophonist Stan Fetz, guitarist and vocalist Joao Gilberto and pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim. Orchestration is perfect and couldn't be done better. Recorded in 1963, remastered and released in 1998, it added to the popularity of Astrud Gilberto, who held a concert in 1996. This CD is a must-have for all jazz lovers and beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"To give you the taste of genuine bossa-nova!","review":"At the moment you put on this album, you stop to stress about everything, you cool down and relax. The best for a dinner with friends or lover. So romantical, this latin taste is a 40 minutes of hapiness. With or without wine, with or without someone else, you'll enjoy it if you love bossa nova style. The company (Verve) is an excellent company too. Good recording quality. What is best than original? Nothing! A classical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SACD recording!","review":"The content speaks for itself, a must have, but it is the SACD recording that takes it over the top!I have a decent collection of SACD's and DVD-A's, and I put this in the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"I'm one of that \\"younger generation\\" people here keep refering to and I love this record. It is one of the beautiful I've ever heard. I already loved the Sinatra/Jobin CD and was looking for more in that bossa nova style. This CD provided that and more. This will be on my CD player during many late nights to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Getz Get Any Better?","review":"This is truly a classic Stan Getz album. His rich, distinctive tenor sax sound melts into the bossa nova beat as if he had invented it. Getz's smooth collaboration with Joao Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto, and Antonio Carlos Jobim produce silky, sensuous melodics on every track. This is a must-have for the longtime Getz fan or anyone who has just discovered the legendary 60's bossa nova genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic masterpiece","review":"I am a very big fan of Stan Getz. I think is tone is superb and this album captures him at his best. One time Stan Getz said, \\"He never played a note he didn't mean.\\" This spirit is exemplified in this album.While the sound quality might not be as good as vinyl as the reviewer below points out, the quality here is still very good. The recording is romantic and the way it was recorded captures the intimacy of the moment.If you are a Stan Getz fan, this is a must own recording. This is a very sensuous album and the vocals are excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this for anyone who is a fan of Stan Getz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get carried away.....","review":"Most people born in the last century have heard \\" The Girl from Ipanema\\". However, those uninitiated to jazz may have missed the total recording that launched the cabana classic. The sum total is better than its parts.Even a language barrier is not a problem. My foreign language knowledge rests with Spanish, and then there is very little fluency, so the Portugese lyrics might daunt some listeners. However, it floats along to a degree that I could plug some lyrical parts and still be transfixed by the melodies. All serious jazz fans should have this as a part of their collection, and any interested in exploring couldn't go wrong by giving this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out for \\"Original Recording Remasterd\\" CD's.....","review":"How frustrating.....if you have a stereo CD player that's more than 10 years old, then don't buy this CD. While the music is great, you lose key phrasings to the low technology of the original recordings.1/2 of vocals of the \\"Girl from Impanema\\" is but a whisper.Great CD....but, be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered maybe, but definitely lacking.","review":"There is some good music here to be sure but I can't help but feel that the product is badly let down by poor value and packaging. For my part, I am annoyed that consumers are asked to pay for 60+mins of music only to receive 38.42mins. There is a great deal of empty space on sale in this CD. This re-issuing caper is not new. If a premium price is to be asked, a good strategy (demonstrated by many other examples) is to bundle up the vinyl release with other material as it goes to CD. If Verve/PolyGram are interested in delivering value then they should have got it somewhere closer to the 75min that's possible. The other problem that I have with this CD is the incredibly poor design of the CD wallet. The booklet provided within has the infuriating habit of slipping out. And why shouldn't it - there is nothing to hold it in! Were the folk at Verve/PolyGram to design automobiles then occupants could expect to be dumped on the roadside at each and every corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"old style jazz","review":"Someone had recommended this CD to me but I was disappointed.

This book is part of 12 related stories. I was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Nora Roberts book","review":"This is my first book by Nora Roberts. For some unknown reason, I do not have the interest in reading her works in the past (though I know she's popular and a bestseller). But 2 days ago, for some unknown reason again, I picked this book in the library. Once I pick it up, I can't seem to put it down. I think it is entertaining and the characters have their own personality (even this is not a very long story). I have now picked up 2 other Nora Roberts books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet...","review":"This is the first MacGregor book that I have read. The series illustrates a closely knit family with a busybody granddaddy who wants to see everyone of his grandchildren get married.In \\"The Perfect Neighbour\\", The MacGregor has chosen Preston Quinn especially for his granddaughter, Cybil Campbell. He arranged for Preston to live opposite Cybil without either of them knowing the plan underneath. Well... The excitment begins with Cybil trying to be a good neighbour by going to Preston's apartment and introducing herself. She never expected rudeness from her new neighbour but that was exactly what she got. What was funny about this part was how Cybil regretted baking cookies for Preston but she could not take back what she had already presented to him. The story kicks off from here...Do enjoy if you gonna buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!","review":"I agree! I want to see more MacGregors!

You can't help but wish that the MacGregors were a part of your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Funny","review":"Another winner from Nora Roberts.

I certainly can't!!! And this one absolutely lives up to your expections. One of her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude man","review":"If you like men who kick puppies, you'll enjoy this book. Okay, I admit that is a little harsh, but Preston McQuinn is a rude, brooding male. Cybil is an effervescent, sunny, extremely talkative gal. Her constant dialogue and her continued attempts to \\"help\\" the guy across the hall who is deceiving her is annoying. In defense of my earlier statement, he literally and figuratively slams the door in Cybil's face but she keeps returning for more abuse (hence the puppy analogy). In the end she wins this prize of a man, sorry for the spoiler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and trite","review":"I think whenever MS Roberts runs out of ideas she writes a MacGregor story. The MacGregors were wonderful at first but are now boring. Many of MS Roberts are among the best books I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosi not entirely true...","review":"I had to read this book as part of my Senior English course, and knowing more than one mentally ill person - one of whom is currently living in a mental health clinic - I found that Nowra's portrayal of mental illness is not quite true. Only very rarely does someone suffer so badly from mental illness that they appear similar to the characters in \\"Cosi\\". Nowra's portayal of these patient's has been greatly exaggerated for theatrical purposes, and I just want people to be aware of that as many people I know who have read this book have simply assumed that all mentally ill people deserve to be locked away for fear of them hurting others. This is an incorrect assumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs alot of work","review":"I just got this add-on earlier today, and it's ok.

I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"&#65533; and Guitar Soul","review":"I like virtuoso guitar play and I heard much prominent guitar players, playing in different styles. But Kenny Burrell not only virtuoso - I think it plays by the soul. The impression from his play much increases due to accompaniment of Gil Evance orchestra. It became for me so strong that I change my bias against the big orchestras on love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reconnect with some beautiful jazz!","review":"Jazz (early combos, big band, bebop, progressive, fusion) and the music of the world's great symphony orchestras defined and shaped my childhood. I LOVED my dad's huge collection of albums (remember those)? I connected at some deep level with the artwork, and the music was just awesome. So I was thrilled to find Kenny Burrell's \\"Guitar Forms\\" available on Amazon. I ended up ordering an import CD from Japan because it preserved the original tracks from the original LP. Some of the other offerings added things that, in my humble opinion, ruined the cohesiveness of the whole package.Burrell's clean, warm guitar is nicely showcased in Gil Evans' arrangements. It's the epitome of 1960s California cool!! The rest of the ensemble perform with flawless artistry. Great for studying by, for entertaining a date over dinner, for doing housework or other chores!! Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT AS GREAT AS LP...BUT, STILL GREAT!!!","review":"Loved this LP . Got the cd right away, and am somewhat befuddled. If they would have only presented the LP AS IS instead of mindlessly repeating tracks (takes) over & over & over &..well, you get the idea..,it gets repetitious & distracts from the impact of the original. A classic case of where MORE is not BETTER! 5 takes of DOWNSTAIRS, 5 of BREADWINNER, 4 of TERRACE THEME... Is this really neccessary?...

Elden Auker was not a hall of famer on the field but he was a hall of famer in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love baseball stories.....","review":"Ive read many a baseball themed book and this is one of the better ones! Elden Auker, a pitcher with the Tigers/Red Sox/and Browns circa 1935-42 shares his memories of baseball back in the old days before the days of high salaries and player agents.

So I have a head set that can't be repaired nor used. If you are super careful this might work for you, but I need something more durable. I'll be shopping for another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready for Prime Time","review":"The concept of a wireless headset is intriguing. Unfortunately, this design does not fulfill its' promise.First, it is not a comfortable fit. It always felt as though it was about to fall off, and I was always aware of it's presence.Second, it does not work as seamlessly as the wired headset. Voice dialing did not work properly (you could never hear the prompt tone to know when to say the voice command). Without voice dialing, you lose much of the freedom of a headset.Third, you look like a total geek wearing this thing. Not only is it large, but there's also blinking lights to attract attention.Kudos (and gratitude) to Amazon's hassle-free and simple return policy. Back it went."},{"rating":"1","title":"One fatal flaw","review":"An otherwise great headset is ruined by one stunningly idiotic design flaw. Rotating the mic boom too far (as others have pointed out) causes the microphone to stop working - I suppose it snaps a wire or something.Not preventing the mic boom from rotating too far (by some sort of plastic stop or something) is one of the worst product flaws I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product","review":"As with one other reviewer, I found the mike boom to be made in the most flimsy manner. By rotating too far in the wrong direction the wire breaks making the mike unusable. Logitech refuses to admit that the product is poorly designed and will not make good on their warranty if it the mike stops working. It is very easy to rotate in the wrong direction and go too far -- and then pfft!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mic Boom Breaks!","review":"There is a major manufacturing defect in this product. There is very limited mobility on the mic boom, and the boom will easily break off the base of the headset with minimum pressure. I had my headset for 2 days before the boom just came off. Logitech did not design the boom for it to pop out under any pressure so you can simply reinsert it. Instead, the base of the boom will break and is unrepairable making the headset a $100 paper weight.I was also extremely disappointed in logitech for not honoring thier warranty when I called them on this issue. They had no intention on helping me with the issue and claimed that I was the first to ever call in to complain about the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice design - terrible support at Logitech","review":"This headset is a nice design: easy to configure, easy to fit on your ear and the adjustable boom isn't too bulky. It's coffin-looking charger is nice, too.However, the Logitech technical support is terrible. They are hard to contact, unhelpful and mean. I had this repeatedly in trying to contact them on why the mic wasn't working."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE Tech Support","review":"I have tried many headsets and found this unit to have the best sound quality and it's the most comfortable. Out of all the headsets I have used I have not had to call tech support because they worked perfect out of the box. The Logitech unit I received did not support voice dial even though a few reviewes claimed it did. I called Logitech to find out what was wrong with my unit and dealt with one incompetent person after another. The people that answer the phone at Logitech can not spell Bluetooth and have no clue on what it is used for. Logitech does not have an 800 number for support and I spent two hours working my way up there support chain until I found a person that understood what Bluetooth was. He told me all units in the field have old firmware and my brand new unit needed to be shipped back for a replacement. I sent my unit back next day air and it took them over a week before they shipped me a replacement. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LOGITECH PRODUCT EVER.Sean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product Quality Control & Support","review":"The first Logitech Mobile Bluetooth Headset I got was DOA -- the headset would not charge. The replacement unit was defective as well -- annoying electronic tones in the earpiece, unreliable charging, and after a few days the microphone went haywire and started generating a very loud, constant buzzing/static background noise, drowning out the speaker's voice. Logitech support was non-existent. This was to be my wife's \\"big\\" Christmas present, but it was nothing but a big disappointment. An important footnote: Amazon handled the replacement and returns graciously and promptly, entirely at their expense -- no complaints about that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, but doesn't work with Nokia 3650","review":"The Logitechh Mobile Bluetooth Headset has a great design and I found it easy on the ear. There was just one big problem with it for me - it didn't work with my phone, the Nokia 3650. Seems Logitech made a boo-boo and implemented the bluetooth spec really out of spec on this baby, hence the reason the headset doesn't work with the 3650.It seems like it would be a good headset otherwise (minus the annoying bright blue LED), but if you have a 3650, go with the $79.99 Jabra bluetooth headset instead (not the $69.99 one!), as it supposively works with the 3650."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone is good except it's muted on my T616","review":"Well I just got my mobile Bluetooth headset.

I was able to pair the device with my SE T610 on the first try and it worked perfectly. I was a little unsure about the device at first, because there is almost no description for the headset, and no picture. Not to mention that the price is well below what some other manufacturers are charging for products that don't have the battery life or quality, but went ahead and purchased it because of another good review. I would have rated this product at five stars if the status light were a little less conspicuous (maybe not on the outside of the headset). Something about a little blue flashy light on the headset draws people's attention.PROS:--great range--great sound quality--ease of use--long battery lifeCONS:--status light on the outside of the headsetUPDATE-- the one major problem that I had with this headset was that the boom mic broke after being overextended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"This book has changed my life. My life has changed in many wonderous ways since I started using the contents of it in my life.Having been reading self-help books for many years, in this book, I found one that really resonated with me and actually really helped me. It is brilliantly written and I am using so many elements of this book every day already. There is so much here for anyone to use and I think everyone should read this book. If only it had been written when I was younger!I have followed the book and its structure and enjoyed it immensely. In addition, it is heartfelt, it is funny, and it is really easy to read. I thank Adam for writing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful For Many Reasons","review":"As a hypnotherapist I have been using the structure and techniques in this book and showing my clients how to use those skills and I subsequently recommend that they invest this book. The specific technique demonstrated here is very easy for anyone to use and allows anyone to apply it.Having applied much of the books content to myself as well, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to use self-hypnosis in this way. The settling techniques and accompanying explanations in this book are not found anywhere else in the many self-hypnosis books that I have read over the years. This alone made it worthwhile.I got one of the recently revised copies too and it is very easy to read and as I have said, for me it has been very useful for a variety of reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Brain Workout","review":"I found this book really beneficial. As someone who finds it difficult to concentrate for large periods of time, I have now read this book from cover to cover three times as I have found more and more each time I have read it.The techniques are sound and very easy to follow although some require a lot more concentration and effort than others. Some aspects of the book I use regularly and other parts not at all; the author does suggest that you choose to use what is right for you and I really liked that idea. All in all, a very usable book and has benefited me enormously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burmese Phrasebook","review":"This is exactly the type of reference book I was looking for. Not only does the book breakdown the phonetics of Burmese in a step-by-step manner, it also is very easy to place in my pocketbook.

While I use the book to freshen up on my Burmese, my nanny loves perusing through it to freshen up on her English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I love Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I've watched most of the episodes. But without any introduction or notice, the outtakes begin of the cultic MST3K show. The bloopers - which you would expect to be hilarious - are stale and boring. Stick to the movies guys, and forget the blooper real. It's not worth the 30 minutes to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny funny video!","review":"Every MSTie should have this tape! The first few clips feature Tom Servo's head falling off, or Tom Servo just plain falling apart. When a line is flubbed, the robots often continue along, like they're real people. Best of all, you can see how creative the cast is even without a script, because their improvisations to try and save a \\"Poopie\\" outtake are often funnier than the final takes. I only wish this would have been longer than 30 minutes, but every moment is enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most outtakes","review":"Most of the time, shows with outtakes really suck. For instance there is the blooper show with Dick Clark and Ed McMahon. All the outtakes that they show are so boring. \\"Wow, somebody forgot their lines. Boy, is that funny. Ha Ha.\\" However, Poopie is very funny. The robots fall apart, scenery collapses, and some truly funny slips of the tongue.

This is pretty much how I felt watching \\"Poopie.\\" I knew SOMETHING was funny, because everyone on screen was laughing, but I just wasn't in on the joke. I think it's great the MST3K folks had fun while making the show, but as far as Poopie's proffered zany antics go, I think you just had to be there.Don't get me wrong - I enjoy MST3K a lot and was very much looking forward to the outtakes. Unfortunately, Poopie didn't live up to my expectations; it was too short, and most of the clips selected simply weren't \\"stand alone funny.\\" They dared to ask the question \\"how many times can someone giggling as he goofs a line be funny,\\" and now we know, it's definitely some number less than the number of times it happens in this short production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not studio version Starz, but not too shabby","review":"I love the first Starz album, but as their records progressed, they became a little too poppy (label pressures I assume) for my taste. They were a bit of Aerosmith, Kiss(though more talented) and their own unique melodic hard rock. I never had the chance to see them live during the 70's, so this dvd will have to do.The dvd is about 25 years after their heyday and for what it is, I have no complaints. A small show in a club with a relatively small audience, they did a decent job. Low production values and a few mistakes makes it all the more real, no pro tools fixes or fancy lasers, just a good hard rock band enjoying playing some good songs.Nightcrawler is my personal favorite, but there are many other great hard rock tunes on the disc. Video and sound quality are fine for a fairly low budget production. Check it out for some great overlooked 70's hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for fans","review":"I'm not a Starz Fan and i get this dvd to be introduced to the band,1- The DVD quality is lower than a bootleg, almost an amateur audience shoot, and the sound is really bad.2- The band is terrible out of shape, with a lot of mistakes during the show, specially the drummer and singer3- I will try with some of their first records because this was a total disapointent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie EVER","review":"Streets of Fire is the best movie ever made.

I will admit, the acting isn't the best, the story isn't super strong, but for some reason everyting comes together in the perfect ways.

Of course, Diane Lane is just too hot for words, even today, but look at the other actors in this movie who went on to much bigger thnigs (Willem Dafoe, Michael Pare, and Rick Moranis were all great in this movie). And then theres a lesser known actor named Stoney Jackson, who never made it as big as he should have. Look for others in the background that you may recognize.The music is the star of this movie! If you arent moving from the first tune, you just dont know how to appreciate music. Jim Steinman is a master composer and it shines through on this soundtrack.Say what you will about it, but I love this movie and watch it over and over now that I have it on DVD. Its just what it says it is at the beginning...A Rock N Roll Fable..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Postmodern Entertainment","review":"To take Streets of Fire literally is to not get it. The movie is a slice of life in a post apocalyptic alternate universe. The stylistic justapositions of 40's and 50's cars and 80's fashion and Jim Steinmen songs are characterizations of this post nuclear fractured world Walter Hill created. Remember the Warriors?The movie is a triumph of style over substance and succeeds to the level of near cult status. I am reminded of Flashdance's success, which practically succeeded in spite of itself. There are no profundities in the movie; the plot is basic; the acting did not garner any award nominations. Nevetheless, I am charmed everytime I view it. I always become perplexed however when I see SOF at why and how Diane Lane has never become the major movie star she clearly is in this movie. If you liked the movie prior to DVD, you will treasure it in DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly One-of-a-Kind","review":"If you came of age in the late 1970s - early 1980s, this movie belongs in your collection. Corny? Yes. But good luck trying to forget Streets of Fire, even if you don't really care for it at first. Streets of Fire and The Warriors both have this trippy, surrealistic vibe that has never quite been duplicated.

And so many! This movie's a joke, but if you thought 'The Warriors' was cool, you'll probably find this one great as well. Rick Moranis, who usually plays cheeseball comic roles, was perfect for this cheeseball flick - in fact, being the wimp, he was about the only one I could take seriously in this dingbat flick full of 50's tough guys and 80's cheese. What a shallow pointless plot! OK, I should stop pretending this movie ever made pretences of being serious. It must be a reminiscence thing.. or maybe it's the laugh factor.. or the jaded Dick Tracy one-liners.. or the Villiage People looking cops and bikers.. or William Dafoe..

Nothing spectacular but fun to watch. A bad boy who is really good, a beautiful rock star, her promoter and bad guys and great music. This was an attempt to make a movie for the young generation of the 80's and it was quite successful. A gorgeous rock star (Diane Lane) is abducted and her ex comes to her rescue.

Great casting, from the two iconically handsome/beautiful leads, to all the quirky secondary character parts. Michael Pare's acting abilities are comparable to a stone statue's, but WHAT a sculpture! Diane Lane, a much better actor of course, was physically at her Perfect Moment during the making of the film. Loved the timeless, \\"What the hell era are we in?\\" look of the movie. The music I thought was a mixed bag, with great stuff by Ry Cooder & The Blasters, & typically mediocre stuff from Meatloaf's arranger (name?). One hilarious flub: Tom Cody's sister is supposedly typing a plea for his help during the opening credits & the hands doing the typing are huge, hairy, obviously-male hamhands!

KHPatton's assertion that Higashi Sensei wrote the book for a \\"quick buck\\" is shameless and dishonorable since Higashi Sensei has totally dedicated his life to the propogation of the martial arts in the US. Frankly, I have yet to meet an author of a martial arts book that has been able to retire on his/her earnings.

What a story.\\" The only criticism I've heard was \\"it was too long\\" but it's a big story and I told those friends to invest their time. They didn't regret it. Richard Attenborough's direction is outstanding, it is beautifully filmed, and you'd swear Ben Kingsley had a special tie with Gandhi to so portray him so well. I believe this is an important movie, particularly for people who haven't had time to read about the history of one of the key parts of our world. The world is a small place and great movies like this serve an important educational role in making us aware of other cultures as well as providing tremendous entertainment. Movie making at it's finest!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gandhi is almost as awesome as me!!!","review":"This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time and should be required in all high schools across america, and perhaps even around the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History at its best","review":"Although one person's view, this movie highlights Mohandas K. Gandhi's life and shows what struggles both India and Pakistan went through before their independences and how Gandhi was one man whose drive made it all happen. Stellar performances by both Ben Kingsley as well as Roshan Seth (who shows a remarkable resemblance to) and takes on the role of Jawaharlal Nehru. On the long side (at three hours+), but still definitely worth watching and adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite film of all time","review":"This wonderful movie touched me to the core, especially the scenes where Gandhi was thrown off the train, burned the passes in spite of a vicious beating, and lay down on the ground with his fellow protesters in front of charging horses. The other actors in the film are also superb, especially the actress who played his wife. Gandhi's message to choose self-respect has stayed with me long after I finished watching the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone to look up to","review":"I have seen this movie twice & I still find it mesmerizing. Those who prefer lighter plot & entertainment will be disappointed for this film is highly historical & quite long, but very interesting for those who could truly appreciate this great man's deeds.Through him, we have seen that nonviolence non-ccoperation can still succeed in the midst of prejudice & oppression. It may take time but it is worth the wait.I just hope that all his efforts & sacrifices have not been put to vain. In a chaotic world we all live in, we need more of Gandhi in our midst."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Gandhi is a reasonably well-made and certainly expensively-mounted version of the Mahatma's life that decides to deify its subject rather than examining him but nonetheless emerges as a solid biopic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Fabulous!","review":"I hadn't seen this movie since its theatrical release in '82. It was powerful movie then. If anything the relevance, power and importance of its message is even greater today. This is a must see!Gandhi still challenges us to live up to our highest ideals.It is a three hour movie with an intermission. I'd recommend watching it in two sittings, first night up to the intermission and then come back the next day for the final powerful conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb story of perhaps the world's greatest human being","review":"Ben Kingsly was Gandhi, in appearance, in demeanor, in manner. His greatest role as the world's greatest leader and humanitarian. This movie should be seen by everyone. It is a beautifully made film about India, about Indians, about human beings, and last of all about Mahatma Gandhi, the inspiration to billions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must watch movie!","review":"Excellent movie; a real masterpiece collection.The life of Mahatma Gandhi - the dialogues are very well written, thoughtful and inspiring.

Once our TV went out, we purchased a Sony LED 42\\" with Blu-ray flat screen but the picture quality of the VCR tape was quite fuzzy. Once we viewed the Blu-ray DVD, we were amazed at the clear quality of the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gandhi","review":"The multiple-Oscar-winning \\"Gandhi\\" explores the life and principles of an extraordinary man who became an enduring example of holiness, humility, and humane resistance. Ben Kingsley inhabits his role with saintly authority, brilliantly conveying Gandhi's charisma and unwavering courage, while Candice Bergen (as photographer Margaret Bourke-White) and John Gielgud (as Lord Irwin) also shine in their respective roles. Melodramatic epic sequences--especially the Salt March and massacre scenes, which required Attenborough to direct 300,000 extras--are handled with graceful verisimilitude. A deeply moving, masterful epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acting and historical story-telling","review":"Great educational movie that I have used in teaching civil disobedience and the life of Gandhi in high school. Great acting by Kingsley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gandhi - Ben Kingsley","review":"It is an excellent movie of an universal leader. No much technology but much light to guide one's own life through a solid example. I used it as a reference for values that we need to share and communicate in our daily life to our friends close to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Bio-pic!","review":"A beautiful tribute almost, to a man who lived according to his beliefs, fought for freedom (non-violently), and pursued peace between different religious groups. On screen his life becomes an epic that really paints him in a human way. The cinematography is beautiful. And the details surrounding certain events are done well. The film works on many levels, and it really inspires (which great bio-pics usually does)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Movie about an Important Man","review":"The life of Gahndi should not be forgotten. The acting in this movie is perfect and the messege and life of Gahndi comes through strong and clear in this brilliant piece of cinema magic.This movie should be played in every school. Every man, woman and child should see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begins to give the West an understanding of Gandi","review":"Gandi is grossly misunderstood by most Western people, and is not appreciated for the depth of his personal achievements. This film does a great service in beginning to introduce him to the West.To be honest, even this epic movie doesn't capture the most important part of his life. It concentrates mostly on the political events and under-emphasises the personal transformation he went through. I recommend you check out \\"Gandi the Man\\" by Eknath Easwaran... (ISBN: 0915132974)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Acting. Amazing Direction. Amazing Story.","review":"WOW! That's an understatement to describe this movie. Ben Kingsley is more than amazing. The man is spectacular and he truly deserved the Oscar that he won. He IS Gandhi. Whenever I read or think of Gandhi, I think of Ben's Gandhi for he helps me personify and personalize who Gandhi was by putting on a face on the Mahatma for those of us who would never know him. No movie can of course cover everything about a person, particularly a man as dynamic and mesmerizing as Gandhi but this film comes very close to covering every significant thing that had occurred in his life span. History and biography buffs MUST watch this movie. Richard Attenborough does an amazing job with this movie. The cinematography is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give this movie a 6 rating, it's the best theatrical biography I have ever seen!","review":"I loved everything about this movie. It captured the spirit of Gandhi's life, had a well developed plot, great characters, beautiful scenery, wonderful music and was a fine example of great drama. It didn't sensationalize Gandhi, his life, his impact on the world or rely on a lot of hollywood gimmicks for its strong visceral impact.This is the best theatrical biography I have ever seen and it is possibly my favorite movie of all time. It is truly inspirational and raises the bar for this type of movie considerably. In short, it is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental Film Making Worthy of It's Subject","review":"Watching Richard Attenborough's masterpiece bio-epic is both an uplifting and draining experience. The performance of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi is one of those rare moments in film history where an actor seems to inhabit the character so completely allowing the viewer to get a deeper personal experience of an historical character.Perfectly blending the political history with the personal story , this movie at 3 hours is an investment of time that pays dividends rarely found on a screen. I recently watched this again after several years and was just as moved by it as when it was first released.Many filmmakers would go for the sentimental approach and try to create myths around their subject. In Gandhi there is a an element of that but the film will stand up to time because the portrayal is historically accurate and the subject at the heart of the film is a mythical character beyond the need of a boost from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Rating and not the movie rating","review":"I was totally disappointed with the DVD. \\"Gandhi\\" is one of my favorite movies. But I was so much disappointed with the DVD that I almost disowned it. It does not have audio or subtitles in Hindi or any other Indian language. Gandhi was a Gujarati (mother tongue: Gujarati) and an Indian (Language: Hindi). The DVD has all sorts of subtitles and languages but does not have any language for Indians. I think the producers of the DVD owed this much to the very Mahatma - and his fellow countrymen - whose life has been depicted in the movie. Such products should not be simply weighed on money and how much revenue the sales would generate. Corporations owe something grander than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate","review":"Before i begin i must profess that i am from Pakistan. The low rating of this review is not based on that fact. I have the utmost respect for Mr. Gandhi; he was a very noble man indeed and did not allow the question of ethnicity or ideology hinder his preachings. In this movie \\"Gandhi\\"; Mr. Jinnah has been incorrectly protrayed as an irresponsible; shabbily attired confused leader. Hardly the characteristic of a leader who created a nation without firing a bullet. It is a well documented fact that Mr. Jinnah was an impressionable speaker and immaculate in his attire. In his dealings Mr. Jinnah is known to be very noble and just.Richard Attenborough does immense injustice to this fact and in doing so does a great dis-service in setting an unbiased and impartial portryal of characters of the time. It is to this fact and this fact alone i give this DVD a low score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperfect disk","review":"This film earned Oscars, as did Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, but I'm frustrated with the copy I received; it comes on 2 DVDs, and try as I might, there is no way I can access the movie on the 2nd disk. The movie does NOT end at the end of the 1st disk. I clicked on everything that was clickable, but nowhere did I see \\"Movie\\" or \\"Play movie\\" to click on; only on all the extras, which I clicked too, in case one would lead me to \\"Play movie\\". No luck. Am disgusted. That's why I gave it only one star. Otherwise, it deserves 5. Hope you have better luck.Subtitles are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a difference","review":"There is a difference between respecting Gandhi, and appreciating the merits of a film that portrays Gandhi. Keeping in mind that this film was sponsored by the government of India, we should take the cinematic facts with a grain of salt. The movie does not address at all the sense of insecurity of muslims in India, which was a great regret for Gandhi, and which culminated into overwhelming support for partition. Also, it is deplorable the way muslim leaders are portraited. Suhrawardy, the charishmaatic leader of Bengal was shown as a gangster, initiating the Calcutta riot in 1946, and coming to Gandhi with hat in hand as if asking for forgiveness. He was the one who tried with Satyen Bose to keep the country (Bengal) intact when congress leaders supported partition.This film is full of other historical inaccuracies and a good prpaganda for Indian government riding on Gandhi's popularity all over the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TERRIBLE LETDOWN","review":"ON THE WHOLE GHANDHI DISSOPOINTS.

That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time and money - Its a movie full of lies","review":"I watched this movie and found nothing but bundles of lies. He did his best not to divide India and it was all Jinnah who divided and founded Pakistan. Gandhi was totally against it.In short - Wasted my money. I would rather be watching a silly comedy show. That must have been atleast better than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"He plays like an angel","review":"\\"Focus\\" is one of that records that need to grow up on you for a correct interpretation of its beauty. Stan Getz plays here his best EVER, indeed! \\"Focus\\" is one of the few records that combines perfectly well Jazz and Classical Music. Getz plays the Jazz parts while the strings section show a great aproach to Classical Music. Tracks like \\"Pan\\", \\"Night Rider\\" or \\"Once Upon A Time\\" are some of the best examples of the sublime work in here. But it's \\"A Summer Afternoon\\" that puts you in another level.

I'd not listened to all of it yet, but figured that this would be good listening as I worked out. I put the second CD and started pedaling, when Night Rider came on. I had to stop and just listen. It was about the most amazing jazz tune I'd heard in awhile -- a virtuousic saxophone sailing amongst a turbulent sea of strings. After listening to that one song, I had to get the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly hypnotic brilliance.","review":"Perfection is what this album is all about. Stan Getz's tone says it all ...pure and lush , full of the warmth of a summer evening. He mesmerises you. Just listen to the track \\"HER\\" ..a very emotionally moving ballad that Stan wrote in tribute to his mother. It carries you to another hemisphere, the jazz equivalent of astral travel. The feeling he puts into the tune is indescribable.Stan Getz was a precise musician who never played a wrong note.Masters like this only come about once in a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 Stars: Disappointing","review":"I hate to be a wet blanket thrown over very warm reviews here, but this album doesn't do much for me. It lacks the bounce and giddiness of the Jazz Samba album, the collaborative briliance of Getz/Gilberto, and the energy of Captain Marvel--all albums that I have listened to repeatedly. This one, however, I have played only 2 or 3 times. What does it sound like? It is Getz playing mostly to string accompaniment. One could call this Getz's \\"Sketches of Spain\\" album. It sounds a bit like Getz playing a musical score for a film that you are not watching. For me, the melodies--Getz's strong point--just aren't here. It is an earnest effort, to be sure, but it felt too much like noodling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring movie score...","review":"I bought Focus (fortunately used) based on the five star reviews here.

I was pleasantly surprised when I got this, expecting it to be good, but not this good! The companion to this, Side by Side, is of the same caliber but I'd have to give this one the nod. It's from my favorite jazz period (1955-1963) and it's performed by two of my favorite musicians, and the recording is amazing. The sound quality of these discs is the best I've ever heard from this time period, and in my opinion, some of the remastered jazz titles from this era are the finest sounding and best engineered recordings to be found from any era - period.

Having read so many Youth novels of late (screening them for my pre-teen daughter), I am disappointed in the lack of unique stories for that age group. They mostly seem to be copies of Harry Potter, Twilight, or the Hunger Games series. Spaceling is still, after all this time, a unique story.

We tried calling Hamilton Beach, however after a 17 minute wait to connect to a customer service rep the line went dead. When we called back it was another 21 minutes to connect to someone. Another bad point is that you can't adjust the temperature - there is no temperature control - there is a switch on the back for warm off cold. That's it.

I find it immoral that the producers corrupted N!xau into making the piece of excrement that this film is.This movie is aimed at brain-dead individuals who thought the first two movies were only just funny, when in actual fact they are meant to deliver a deep philosophical message.

How the actors and director could ever believe they were doing justice to Shakespeare is beyond me. A play that should run at most two and a half hours unabridged, is drug out to a laborious 3 hour cut-and-slash abridgement. The halting monotone quality of the actors speech is, to say the least, tedious. Maybe there are some worthwhile moments on the second tape, but I couldn't make it past the first. For my own part this recording was a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This abridged version is not very good.","review":"The Durkin Hayes production of Richard II is not very good.

Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student. It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers. This was just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances would I have read this book. And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the book. I purchased the audio cassette from \\"Amazon.com.\\" After completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words, I decided to get my hands on the book itself. The only difference that I could notice was my ability to distinguish who was saying what. I do not recommend this book to anyone without a Ph. D. Even to all of you literary geniuses, good luck! You will certainly need it to stay awake. I hope I was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned The Kindle Edition","review":"This is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, but in the Kindle edition the footnotes are not activated. Because of this you have to go to the end of the scene/act to look up a word, phrase, or historical data...then there is the issue of getting back to where you were before.Is it too much to ask for publishers to do their job, and stop producing substandard Kindle books thinking the consuming public will take whatever crap they offer us.Remember, Amazon allows us to return Kindle books withing a week of purchase. All you have to do is go to Manage Your Kindle and then find where all your books are kept, from there you go to the Actions Tab and select Refund.If we all begin to complain and return these books then publishers will get the message and begin to do their jobs correctly/thoughtfully.Again, this is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays but I am NOT going to stand for substandard eBooks anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakmo","review":"This is a very good book for the lover of oddities out there.

We didn't have too many problems with assembly. I don't like the cardboard pieces that you use as scenary on the machine. They fall off when you crank and my son gets upset and wants them on there.

However, as the weather heated up, the flaws in the SpongeBob Sno-Cone Maker's design began to be more evident - the endless cranking required to produce just one snow cone means that it's very hard work to satisfy a long line of shaved-ice seekers. By mid-July, I was forced to close down the stand, with low profits and a hefty case of carpal tunnel syndrome.But while I might have gone too far, I can't say anything bad about the product.

Warning, though: the first half of the book is pretty depressing, as the author pinpoints all the horrible things that can go wrong in a relationship with an ADHD individual. But, keep reading! The latter half begins to offer solutions and ideas for dealing with the day to day struggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"While not bad, take with a grain of salt...","review":"First, my comment to my partner was \\"Well, if you take any number of self-help relationship books, and add three pages about ADHD, you'll have a better help book than this one.\\"Pros:1. It does help one to think about ADHD and relationships.2. It does help create talking points with your partner about your relationship.Cons:1. It uses pseudoscience and unproven theories of how ADHD works as some of its basis for discussion.2. It is very heavy on the belief that medication can make one with ADHD \\"normal\\". While psychopharmacological assistance for people with ADHD is good, psychological is also good, and the book tends to ignore that aspect.3. It is based on a traditional M/F married relationship.Overall, I don't know that there is anything better out there. However, this doesn't say this is good.Personally, I'd find a good book on ADHD, and a good book on relationship counseling, and read them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE WITH A.D.D NOT JUST PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS","review":"There is only one drawback to this book he talks about medicatation through out it.

Actually, Martha Notchimson's \\"Passion of David Lynch\\" probably got Lynch down better than any of his critics, but to reduce her interpretations to New Agism is really just an exemplification of fringe criticism's dread of Jungian thought in the first place - not that Lynch is a Jungian, but he is all about transcendental meditation and reincarnation, and his pictures seem to have a similar spiritual center and energy. Zizek is extremely intelligent, but ultimately he's fishing for minnows while sitting on a whale.

The story was too hard to follow, since I kept getting caught up in the words. It's most likely a good story but the character interplay and the sequence of eventS reminded me of a bad soap opera.

However, I could not get past 150 pages in the book before I threw it aside as not worth the immense effort. There were so many irrelevant characters being introduced, and then disappearing, never to be heard of again. And then there were so many incidents described that were just irrelevant to the story --silly narratives that I found inconsequential to the main action, which I knew quite well from the film. Lastly, the same characters were named in so many different ways, I found myself constantly confused. My favorite author is Trollope. He writes long novels, but all characters and all incidents are relevant and have meaning to the plot as a whole. Anyway ... I have given up on Dr. Zhivago and will have to be content with the 2 films!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a Russian Harlequin Romance","review":"I didn't like this book at all. The characters were all one-dimensional, more representations of ideals (Mother Russia in Lara; the old intelligentsia in Yuri; the Revolutionary Spirit in Lara's husband) than actual characters--and weakly written, at that. Perhaps Pasternak would have been better served (as would generations of readers) if he had put the story in the form of an epic poem where such things are acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie instead; Pasternak's no Tolstoy!","review":"Absolutely terrible.

While DZ is sometimes fantastically rich in its imagery, it rarely evokes much emotion for the contrived characters; (...) I have never read a more beautiful nature description than the \\"spring passage\\" in all of Russian literature this century. Pasternak is obviously a talented writer, but the long treatises on the place of Jews, the messages of Jesus (and so on and so forth), are just forced and too abstractly intellectual to take a natural place in any prose, much less a text which is already sorely lacking in 'real' people in the first place. A great book, but falling far short on certain fronts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Time does go by, and in a well written summed up novel, Pasternak shares through his poetry at the end of the book what Zhivago thinks, and portrays how a well-educated and successful man can be destroyed during the times of revolution"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This novel portraying the young Doctor Zhivago covers with beautiful accuracy and simplicity the many events of the Russian Revolution and its consequences in the eyes of a cast of different characters, whose intertwined lives are all affected by the political changes, some more than others.

Yes their vocalist growls and screams with the best of them, but is able to turn that growl into almost a melodic instrument...don't ask me how he does it...just listen to \\"Black Label\\" and see for yourself.

If you don't already have it, get \\"Killapelphia\\" instead.

As one of my friends put it, \\"the double kick sounds like it is being played with two empty coke bottles.\\" The CD also lacks the great riffing that I usually enjoy like about Lamb of God.

I have never heard an album this unique and aggressive by any metal band ever. You're probably saying \\"But what about bands like cannibal corpse? they play really fast. i'm stupid\\". Well, there's a lot more to aggression in music than speed. This album is a lot more raw than most albums like it, making it sound a lot more unpolished than a lot of metal albums.

That was enough to sell me. Technical thrash-style riffing with technical, math-metal complexity. The guitars are often engaged in a rhythmic thrash-style picking attack, the perfect balance between intricacy and aggression: definately comparable to Meshuggah, as everyone else has noted. Add to this a mild southern-groove, brutal and unrelenting vocal attack, and top it off with some of the most amazingly aggressive, technical drumming I've heard in a while. This is Lamb of God: technical, extreme and insanely rhythmic, yet with a real definable groove. The album oozes with such perfectly executed metallic sickness that I think I need to change my pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just barely okay...","review":"This definitely does not show extremely hot girls.

The first of these is with the trombone laden Buddy Bregman orchestra doing one of Porter's least substantial hits \\"You're the Top.\\" After doing a very pleasing chorus, Alvin Stoller on drums starts to hit the cymbal and swing through a bridge into a second chorus on the theme \\"You're the Bop\\" which has clever jazz lyrics.

It contains the original eight tracks plus seven bonus tracks (including two special remixes).The sound is big and bold, and the music of Tears For Fears is timeless. The group thrives on confronting psychological issues within the context of their music (the album was inspired by the movie \\"Sybil\\" starring Sally Field -- the \\"Big Chair\\" is what the character called her analyst's chair, and was a place where she felt safe) and their life-affirming message comes across clearly through this material.4 Stars...sixteen years later and this group can still bring down the house. I especially love the remix of SHOUT included in the bonus tracks.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essencial!","review":"While \\"The Hurting\\" is surely an artistic triumph \\"Songs From The Big Chair\\" made Tears For Fears songs.The arrangementsare fuller and a full band sound is evident but their lyrical themes haven't changed-more people just were able to share in them.The result are the classic radio hits \\"Shout\\" and \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\"-not to mention the John Lennon-like \\"Head Over Heals\\".It's obvious these guys spent alot of time not just with new wave but with John Lennon and Cat Stevens albums-the songwriting is classic and the aforementioned songs sound timeless despite this albums fairly recent vintage.The uptempo \\"Broken\\" is actually very dancable and \\"I Believe\\" is a simple,almost Beatlesqe ballad of high note.Mabye in the next twenty years or so \\"Songs From The Big Chair\\" will emmerge along with the \\"Sgt.Pepper\\"'s and \\"Pet Sound\\"s of all-time classic rock albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic, no question.","review":"There is no doubt about it: This album belongs to the Hall of Fame. Unfortunately Amazon.com does not offer the remastered gold-edition by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. It includes two bonus tracks - the extended Versions of \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" and \\"Shout\\". Trust me, it's worth the higher price - not only because of the 24k Gold-CD, but the very rare \\"Shout\\"-version with that incredible guitar solo will take your breath.

The music is of course fantastic, and the cover art faithfully done. The mastering is excellent, and quite dynamic and spacious.BUT- why then press it to very noisy vinyl.

If all the SILVER SERIES are this noisy , I will not purchase further.Is this a quality control issue, or an inferior product at a reduced price??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to \\"Listen\\"","review":"One of the great recordings of the 80's with the Classics \\"Shout\\", \\"Everybody wants to rule the world\\" and \\"Head over Heels\\". But the real gems are the unknown songs on this recording: \\"The Working Hour\\" and \\"Broken\\", but especially the absolute fantastic \\"Listen\\", repeating the same pattern of melody over 6 minutes, giving you the feeling that it could go on forever. This song alone is worth the whole album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my music while growing up","review":"Releasing their pent up dementia , they created a sober musical arrangement. As Hamlet says,\\"Though this be madness, there's method in it.\\" Or something like it.

We can work it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unnecessary and overpriced","review":"The original album- 8 songs- is a five star album. I can listen to it straight through without any problem. I also don't mind the remastered edition that came out a few years ago that expanded this to 15 tracks. It has most of the same bsides/bonus tracks found here- but you can get it for half the price of this. So what do you get for the extra $15 here? 12 remixes. Big deal. I don't need to hear 4 versions of Shout in one sitting. Do yourself a favor and get the single disc of this for half the price, OR get Chonicles instead: It has the same 15 track remastered and expanded version of this album PLUS you get the expanded and remastered Hurting and Sowing the Seeds of Love CDS- 26 other (great) songs instead of 12 (boring) remixes. That's 3 expanded remastered CDs for the same price as this bloated mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Chair Yet","review":"Well, I would have given this a full \\"Five\\" star review but as a collector of their work with everything from vinyl to CD, I can't understand WHY they put the single version of \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" when it's the same as the album version?! Anyway, they could have used the U.S.12\\" remix of this track instead of wasting time on the same track twice. Other then that, a great addition in which I had all the original sources and all collected together for this double CD set. I also recommend picking up the all there CD's up to \\"Sowing The Seeds Of Love\\" & the others if you really get into this band. I am also on the web which you search \\"Judemac Forever\\" on msn."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remastering has left to be desired","review":"This is a great album from the 80's that I have always loved, but unfortunately this remaster has one fatal flaw: it is remastered to be LOUD. It's a shame that this had to happen to such a great album. One example is during the song \\"The Working Hour\\" when the drums come in, all you can hear is clipping of the signal! Even if you disable your equalizer, the distortion still exists. So if you're an audiophile or enthusist, avoid this release and get the original 1985 release or the 1990 release. The purpose of a remaster is to increase clarity, not increase volume! I'm totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never arrived","review":"I ordered this item and after two weeks had not received it.I contacted Amazon about this issue and it took three weeks to get my money refunded.

An unusual song for gomez but they pull it off and makes it a memorable b side.Step Inside is another moody gomez song where you could imagine them playing in the corner of a dark club. Very prominant double bass line throughout the song with a gentle drum beat and Ben on fine form with vocals make this on of the better songs released.Both Chicken Bones and Step Inside can be found on Five Men in a Hut so nothing here is not found on the compilation cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like listening to the sound of a cowboy saloon / brothel.","review":"You will probably have a strong memory of the first time you heard this cd. it's that good.As soon as the cd starts, it just swaggers and feels like being in a hot hardwood room, with cowboy boots, ice melting in a whiskey and cigarette smoke. It's so so sultry. Think Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions, with better musicianship and a singer with a more inviting voice, if you can imagine. It's one trick is that it never gallops, it just trots. Think cowboy shoegazer with great, great musicianship. Some people could hate this, but i have been looking for a cd to fill that space for years. It's warm, yeah, a bit sinister, but it's somehow very comforting and nurturing.Sykes is somehow connected with Whiskeytown, but she's probably less for fans of Whiskeytown than she is for fans of Cowboy Junkies or Mazzy Star.

I'm definitely going to buy all her CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, melancholy, but best in doses...","review":"I've enjoyed listening to this album. It reminds of the slower material on the first Concrete Blonde album. I tend to frame music in soundtrack context. This album would be perfect driving music for the cast of Carnivale as they drive through hot, dusky Dust Bowl wastelands on their way to the next struggling small town, running from old demons and meeting new ones at every stop. OK, that's a little melodramatic, but the tunes are definitely moody, and a full album's listen in one sitting will definitely start to wear on your psyche. The vocals are beautiful, the guitar work haunting. I wish they would have experimented with some different pacing (the same beat got monotonous after several songs), but that's a small complaint for a well-crafted piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous story","review":"I am so happy that I purchased this movie.

It refers to Justices Wendell and Blackmun as Chief Justices of the Supreme Court when in fact they were Associate Justices. Although the book was published in 2000, it says that the Constitution has had only had 26 amendments, even though the 27th amendment was ratified in 1992.What's more, the book tells you very little about the actual workings of the court. It deals broadly with the court's historical importance which I personally found misleading since the title is \\"Your Government: How it Works: The US Supreme Court\\".Arthur M. Schlesinger's name is shown on the cover as \\"Consulting Editor\\". My best guess is that any consulting Mr. Schlesinger did on this one was strictly from a distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't swim well","review":"I purchased this for use in the pool.

It was a complete waste of my money and now I have to take the time to return it and wait patiently for my money and try to find something out there worth my time! I was very disappointed mostly because he speaks of AB's as practically the same Pit Bull's...which they definitely are not!! He makes then out to be vicious attack dogs and if you even try to suppress that in any way then you are a bad owner....BS!!NEWS FLASH!!!!

I was definitely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Jeremy Renner was fantastic in this. He plays off the wall characters perfectly. Movies like The Avengers don't showcase how great of an actor he is. It was a little tough hearing some of the things he said to Gabrielle Union's character but I felt he portrayed it in a way that made you understand why he acted that way. My favorite part was the scene at the abandoned gas station. The vulnerability they both portrayed was unbelievable. This movie really is not about racism and I hope people give it a chance like I did. I get what people were saying about the ending but I understand why it was written that way. If I could give half stars, I would probably give it 4.5 stars because of the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie :)","review":"I don't want to say this film was unexpectedly amazing(because Jeremy Renner as far as I can tell doesn't make bad movies) but because of the title and subject matter, one would probably be surprised at how enjoyable it is!I found it absolutely hillarious at times, and you really grow to love the characters and care what happens to them.

This movie is an original quirky love story about two broken people who find love in the strangest of places, a mental institute. A harmless neo-nazi with no self control and an African American woman who is as guarded as one can be due to her past. Strangely they are perfect for one another. Renner gives a performance of a character that is manic and reckless but still remains completely lovable. Union's character is so broken, but even with all her demons she is completely charming. The two, although completely broken, together seem to make a whole person. I have no clue how they pulled this off. This is a purely actor driven movie. It is a good example of the greatness one can find in independent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"I really like the characters, I cared about them. The acting was really good.

Soon after, Ned is placed in a mental hospital where he is mesmerized by a young black girl who believes Adolf Hitler was reincarnated in her. What follows is a gritty character study and poignant love story of two people brought together by a seemingly impossible connection. As a result of that connection, they both find that there is more to a person than what is on the surface. This movie is a little shocking, it's funny and its sad with a bittersweet ending all rolled in one. The acting is awesome. Highly recommend, you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated and Absolutely Brilliant","review":"Gabrielle Union is always good and she is great in this.

The corporate history of the company and the personal history of its employees share the pages of this book with many photographs, too many of which are unfortunately uncaptioned.The book reflects a mix of boosterism and nostalgia. The early decades of the enterprise bask in excitement which meets the almost unfair reality of progress through the automobile and economics of teh Great Depression.I reccomend the book to fans of interurban transit and other railfans, to historians of the region, and to anyone looking for a slice of life from the first half of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robotics Introduction","review":"My 10 year old son received this toy as a gift.

Forget Jet and all the wannabes, these guys don't just nail it, they take it back to the hotel-room and ravish it like a groupie.Take mc5 and Grand Funk Railroad, Humble Pie and Foghat, you have an idea where these guys came from. But it ain't re-hash, it's real. They're not stealing riffs, they're just the modern extension of all that, what those bands would be playing if they started today.This is a must-have for lovers of classic seventies rock, but it's also a keeper for modern hard rock fans; retro without sounding dated or tongue-in-cheek. With a debut album this good, I want to hear what they do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Very happily received.

However, they were well written. I thought I would purchase his novel to see what he could do in another form. Let me tell you what I think he accomplished. I think he was able to provide an image of life in the South during the depression. In offering this to the reader he offers a tale that focuses on how sex, love, and hate can drive someone to decisions that are less than admirable. This reminds me to some extent of what O'Hara does, but set in Pennsylvania. I love these kind of novels even if I do not agree with what the characters are doing. He paints a great image and reconstructs how the characters found themselves in the positions they did, and what they thought at the time. All in all, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professionalism","review":"This CD of Handel's Coronation Anthems shows the Choir of King's College Cambridge at its true professional height.

This book is filled with nuggests of historic information that provides the reader with greater context and historic analysis than any other book on the topic I have yet to read. Any student of history, political science, or space advocate should read this book carefully to be well-grounded in the Apollo Era. McDougall did an outstanding job in relating to the reader details of the context of the American and Soviet space programs throughout the 50's and 60's.

Technical skill becomes irrelevant, it is just a story being told. It is a sad story, told by a beautiful person.There are many musicians who could swing, play fast or slow, and do it sounding good. But there is only one Lester Young, and to hear him in a relaxed studio atmosphere with a good sound quality is a rare experience.

While there were some good episodes, there weren't many, and the bulk of the season ends up being pretty boring. It was certainly a huge mistake bringing Worf into the show. DS9 should have had a chance to be it's own show with it's own characters and stories, but the over-presence of Worf (and character's like Deanna Troi's mother) really bring down the show. There is deinately not enough Garak in the show as the aliens (Quark, Garak, and Odo) are the heart of the series.

While the third season served as a mostly introductory period to the Dominion, the fourth much more deeply explores this mysterious and terrifying new threat.IN between, some of the best Star Trek episodes ever made are produced -- highlighted by \\"The Visitor\\", which ranks with \\"The Inner Light\\" and \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\" as Trek's most moving episodes ever made.Most of DS9's all-time best episodes are in the 4th YEAR, including...The Way of the Warrior, The Visitor, Rejoined, Little Green Men, Our Man Bashir, Homefront, Paradise Lost, Sons of Mogh, Rules of Engagement, Shattered Mirror, For the Cause, Broken Link."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent episodes, poor dvd quality","review":"First, I'd like to say I have at least two HUGE Star Trek fans in my household.

Also you should put a height size on this and I bought one child sumo costume and adult size costume for my daughter but the child one was too short and the adult one was to loose around the arms and neck and ankles to keep the air in.

I loved the nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Movie, But A Huge Disappointment","review":"This follow up to the brilliant 1983 classic \\"A Christmas Story\\" is a pretty disappointing affair. The movie does not hold the same magical quality and nostalgia as the holiday movie. Kiernan Culkin and Charles Grodin taking over for Peter Billingsley and Darren McGavin, were no match for the pitch perfect performances of the latter two. Mary Steenburgen takes over Melinda Dillon's role as Mom. The film deals with Ralphie's young childhood in the 40's. Kind of bland and boring. If your a \\"Christmas Story\\" fanatic like me, you will be disappointed as well. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not what one would of hoped it would've been following the previous classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie has several titles!","review":"I have a DVD recording of this same movie under the title of \\"It Runs In The Family\\". Of coarse, Charles Grodin almost ruins it! He could never play the part of the \\"Old Man\\" in any Jean Shepherd story. What a dud of an actor - same dull lifeless character he always plays!Regardless, anything Shep produced is worth having - radio, books, movies, TV. What a loss when he left us. But think about it - he still lives on in his works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Story sequel, Sort of.","review":"This is a funny movie. I was skeptical at first. If you like The Christmas Story I think you'll like this one, even though all the characters have changed. This is why I only gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable. Family oriented entertainment.","review":"The story of the Parker family continues. My family enjoyed this film, though not as much as the infamous Christmas story. From the blasting music to the early morning fishing, they related to the turn of events in the story just as if it had happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre film.","review":"Putting aside that \\"A Christmas Story\\" is a classic, this follow-up is still not that good. The roles are miscast-especially Ralphie and Randy as the kids playing them are too young and don't act very well. I love Jean Shepherd's stories and have re-read the written forms of them many times and still enjoy them. Some of the major problems with the film:1. Tried to cram in too many of Shepherd's stories into the plot and made all of them shallow and poorly developed.2. The stories they did put in were significantly modified and made silly/stupid instead of staying true to Shepherd's writing.3. Stupid stereotypical Hollywood characters--cheesy Hillbilly neighbors, the \\"bully\\", Ralph's friends turned into nerdy runts.4. What's with the dog Barkley? Another attempt to make the movie \\"cute\\"?I bought and watched this movie hoping for a decent portrayal of some favorite stories. After one viewing, I'm going to toss the DVD and stick to Shepherd's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT \\"A Christmas Story\\" level effort","review":"This tale could have been told so much better than it was. There was none of the charm of living the story through Ralphie's eyes as with \\"A Christmas Story\\". Dad's frustrations and foibles were not dealt with in the misguided yet excusable manner as they were when Darrin McGavin took on the role. Charles Grodin's wooden portrayal of Dad left me feeling no sympathy, conjuring images of a cynical misanthrope bent on \\"winning\\" and nothing else. Randy was a complete empty hole in this movie, the role wasn't even necessary, and Mom was almost completely disconnected from the story. All in all, very disappointing considering Jean Shepard's skill at storytelling..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Ollie??","review":"When I googled \\"Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss\\", \\"My Summer Story\\" showed up on the Amazon screen. I assumed this was a remake and ordered it on Netflix before buying it. Was I disappointed! The casting of the Parker family was inferior to \\"A Christmas Story - especially Charles Grodin, who is no match to the marvelous Darren McGavin. There was no chemistry between Grodin and Steenburgen AND the story was totally different from the Ollie Hopnoodle film with James Sikkus, that I'd seen years ago, which was hilarious. A VHS version of this movie, USED starts at $70...a little expensive, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DECENT FOLLOW-UP, UNFAIRLY COMPARED WITH. . .","review":". . .well, you know, A CHRISTMAS STORY. And that, my friends, is where we all go wrong when we see a flick that's closely related to what's now a family classic. This movie is not nearly as sophisticated as it's predecessor and we can pick it apart for all it's worth just because it's so different. Personally, I'd like to have seen Darren McGavin play the Dad again but hey, Grodin holds up well and if seen as a separate movie on it's own, it has lots of funny vignettes that are all in Shepherd's stories. I thought the funniest scene was when the Bumpus's come dancing over to their horrified neighbor's house. This is a very funny FAMILY picture that can be watched with no qualms about language, subject matter and yet, it's an adult's view of growing up in the 40's. Don't let cynical naysayers keep you from trying this SMALL CLASSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful funny film for kids and adults","review":"My kids and I loved the prequel to this, A Christmas Story, and My Summer Story is certainly different, but all in all, it's a wonderful, funny, quirky, film. The reviews quoted here don't do it justice. This is one of the few movies I can watch with the kids almost as often as they watch it, mostly to see Mary Steenburgen throwing the gravy boats, and seeing the little brother catching and eating his goldfish...\\"a man gets to eat what he catches!\\" says Dad, played by Charles Grodin. It's a great movie moment. I think I'm going to have to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fiction...","review":"I loved this series, even though I discovered it about a year after \\"The Bloody Ground\\" came out. To the potential customer, I'd say buy it. It has a wonderful plot and almost perfect descriptions. To the author, I'd say to continue the series. I'm Indian myself, and though I enjoyed the Indian branch of the Sharpe series immensely, I'd much rather prefer to see the Starbuck Chronicles continued."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more!","review":"I've followed the Starbuck series since Copperhead's publication several years back, and I've loved every page of every volume. The Bloody Ground is probably one of the installment's most riviting volumes that culminates into the second battle of Bull Run. What depresses me most is that while the series' first four volumes came out in such a short period of time, there hasn't been a page published in several years, as author Cornwell has gone back to his Sharpe series, among other things. I really hope he'll come back to Starbuck, as it's probably one of my all-time favorite series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story going nowhere--slowly.","review":"Sometimes one feels powerless when reviewing a book. Already, the chronicles of Nathaniel Starbuck, a Yankee fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, are proving as popular as Cornwell's previous creation, Peninsular War hero Richard Sharpe. True, the historical period is nicely evoked and the battle descriptions are accurate. But the characters are all too simplistic. We never understand why the upstanding Starbuck is fighting to preserve slavery, why Southern blacks seem content in their place, or why all Rebels are nice and all Northerners nasty. The story of how Starbuck's leadership redeems a punishment battalion also goes nowhere--slowly. Yet whatever I say, I am sure this book will sell in great numbers. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good historical fiction story","review":"Finally, the 4th installment of the Starbuck Chronicles. As I have reviewed in the other 3 books, I find this series thoroughly enjoyable. Cornwell uses many of the same characteristic traits in Nathaniel Starbuck as he does in Derfel of the Winter King, and Thomas of Hookton in Archer's Tale.I like the way he builds the characters. They are not entirely perfect and they have lapses in judgment, but I find myself rooting for them even in the midst of suffering or trials.I found Bloody Ground to be the best of the 4 books, but not quite a 5 star (maybe a 4.25). If you are a fan of historical fiction, I am recommending you read this series. Cornwell has done better stuff, but you will be entertained nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I have read the entire Starbuck Series and really looking forward to seeing the next book in the series come out. This book is great and worth reading a first, second, third and even maybe a fourth time. It is full of action and suspense, that kept me reading non stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one, please!","review":"This was a unique plot. To see the Civil War from the perspective of the common Southern foot-soldier had me rooted in fascination. The characters were very well rounded for me. Although the writer ties off historical facts too loosely with the book, that is okay for me. It is fiction and is supposed to be fun. What is the old saying? History is written by the conqueror? How true. I found it interesting to see the South being portrayed as patriotic as much as the North. That crimes and debauchery were rampant on both sides. Too often the Southern face of the Civil War is without shape, or demonized at worst. This book delivers with good history a punch of fun. Loved it...although the author ran off on my to do other projects...British be darned...bring out Starbuck again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book I never received!","review":"I never received this book. I got a notice that it was sent to the wrong address. I checked the address on my receipt and it WAS correct. Some one, I suspect the sender, screwed up. They were nice though, they only charged me for the postage.O.K. Williams"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rattle Your Saber(metrics)?","review":"Don't get a statistic wrong; don't you dare make a mistake. Okay, Bill James correctly points out some mistakes that Mr. Halberstam makes in this book. None of the mistakes are important to the story, nor do any of them detract from the book in any way. I can't hold that criticism against this book.This is an excellent baseball book. David Halberstam masterfully brings to life a baseball season and pennant race that otherwise I could never enjoy. He makes you part of the history of the era in the US, as well as in the game of baseball. He introduces you to all the important players in the game and some of the other assorted characters around the game. It is a well written book, easy to read and enjoy by any baseball fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best moment in baseball","review":"I think that this book is one of the best baseball books that I have ever read. I think that people who want to know about the history of the Red Sox and the Yankees should read this book. This book is about the1939 to 1949 seasons. It talks about a number of players and it explains everything that they had to go through before they got into the major leagues. The players are all from the Yankees and the Red Sox. Also, it is very interesting because it talks about how hot it was in 1948 while they were playing baseball. I think that all Yankees and Red Sox fans should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant distraction.","review":"In the foreward, Halberstam discussed how he was writing and researching this book in the midst of lecture tours to discuss weighty foreign policy issues before audiences comprised of very serious people. I got the sense that this book was a pleasurable distraction for him as it allowed him to focus on a topic related to a far simpler time and place in our history.I think he's laid it out for the prospective reader with that comment. It's a pleasant distraction for one interested in baseball to get a sense of where the game was at a crucial crossroads both in terms of baseball and our country.In 1949 the nature of the game was changing as was the country. It may not have been evident at the time, but in retrospect the 1950's would represent a new era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad shipment.","review":"The book was ordered as a gift, and I'm told by the party that received it that it is a first edition. The seller listed it as being in \\"great condition,\\" however, the book arrived in a damaged package with a damaged cover. While this may very well be the fault of the party who shipped it, the book was sent by media mail - the cheapest possible way - and this is more likely where the blame lies for the book being damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Magic","review":"Halberstam was a brilliant man whose writing only occasionally reflected that brilliance. His sports books are weak; this is probably the strongest one, but that is not saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error Halberstam","review":"The mistakes here fill a chapter in one of Bill James' stellar baseball books. Mel Parnell was not a rookie in 1948. Gene Bearden did not win the Rookie of the Year award. Jackie Robinson never stole \\"at will\\" when Yogo Berra was catching. And so it goes. Given the inept reporting, this is not a book anyone should take seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Past due date","review":"Maybe if you were alive and following baseball then this would be interesting. I loved DH's other books on Korean War, Fifties, JFK, Media...but this was a total clunker, boring from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Discussion of the Era","review":"Great book, not only about personalities, but about the era. Always recommend it for both kids and adults, and even for a Worcester, Mass., native, the Yankee stuff is good.One note: reviewer James Maguire is quoting Tennyson, I believe, and not Shakespeare, at the end of his review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great American writer hits one out of the park!!!","review":"David Halberstam captures the essence and emotion of the times in this stunning look at one of the greatest pennant races in baseball histoery. His attention to detial and thoroughness in researching the subject matter are evident in the fact that as you read you feel like you are reading the box score in the morning paper the day after the game to check up on your team. Summer of '49 is one of the best baseball books I have ever read, but it may not even be Halberstam's best effort -- as his October 1964 is equally captivating and well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't make my mistake","review":"I thought this book contained 400 recorder songs, that's what the products contents lead me to believe.

When I first gt the book I was impressed with the cover it made me want to read it. The stories were great and the illustrations were good to. Its nice to see a book with illustrations. After being in contact the publisher I found out that there will be more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever Purchased","review":"This is possibly one of the worst books I've ever purchased, and I say that in large part because it really feels like whoever made this book sloppily downloaded stories from the Internet and pasted them into a word processor without bothering to do any editing. The paragraphs are spaced oddly, words are capitalized oddly, there are lots of typos, and there are even random numbers in parentheses scattered in the middle of texts. I might have put up with this nonsense if the stories were excellent, but unfortunately a large number of them are really, really boring and have off-putting messages. Whoever put this book together should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in translation","review":"This was not what I expected it to be. Some of the stories dron on forever and never get to a point. The translation is very odd and there are numerous typoes. What I had really been looking for was a Japanese mythology book and deicded to whet my appetite with this. This book was not anywhere near as enjoyable as the Japanese fairy tale book I had as a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting read .","review":"I thought that Northanger Abbey was a capturing read and yet, if you have not read any of her other novels you would find the language hard to grasp at first. I think that she describes Catherine Moreland's naivity very well and there is a very pleasing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"See it in person","review":"Preparing myself for a trip to Spain, I wanted to get some great background on some of the sights I was planning on seeing. I thought this book was going to prepare me with some incite on Gaudi's character and what was going through his mind and life during the construction of his iconic work. However, Hensbergen's biography reads more like a architectural school essay than a look into the man that was Gaudi. It was confusing, it jumped around way too much, and failed to give me the experience I was looking for. I recommend seeing these genius structures in person, they will speak to you far more than this book ever did for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young Adult Level","review":"To my mind, this biography is suitable only for the Young Adult audience. As anything else, it lacks---to the point of seriously frustrating the reader---background, detail, nuance, explication, sweep, and insight. Its views, pronouncements, and coverage are static, truncated, and simplistic, and the \\"narrative\\" choppy in the extreme. There are references---such as to Llull, Schopenhauer, and others---that are facile and, where it would make sense, completely undeveloped. There are references that come out of the blue---such as to Havelock Ellis. Mr. Hensbergen I believe knows his stuff, but all in all this bio reads like a term paper written by a clever sophomore. It is not, for instance, Nicholl on Da Vinci or Robb on Caravaggio or Gibson on Dali to name a few recent biographies of creative souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"PYLE PLG64","review":"I do not recommend.

I want to say they are inexpensive rather than cheap. The quality of materials is up to standards and the sound reproduction is as good if not better than anything you compare them to.

There was absolutely nothing about Luke in the movie. Which by the way is the REAL Prince of Tides. Tom Wingo (Nolte) is NOT the Prince of Tides as stated in the movie. In fact the poem written by Savannah titled \\"Prince of Tides\\" was already written by the time Tom shows up in NY.

The problem lies in the story itself. It's simply too unbelievable, formulaic (the \\"childhood trauma\\" at the center of the film doesn't have any resonance, it's simply a glibly Freudian attempt to tie the narrative together), and full of overripe rhetoric that cannot disugise the vacuity of the tale.The one redeeming feature in this film is Nick Nolte's SUPERB performance. This is far and away the best performance I've ever seen him give. He deserved the Oscar for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book !!!","review":"Like I said in the title read the book, and more of Pat Conroy. And forget about this movie. It only shows two actors, too old for the part playing together and not talking about this great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories not so beautiful -- an awful movie.","review":"Having just a read a book that reminded me of Prince of Tides, I was shocked to see how popular this movie is on Amazon! I saw this movie back in 1991 and it still haunts me.In 1991, I was appalled by Ms. Streisand's miniskirts and in particular her pink sweater cut SO low in the back. The wardrobe wasn't appropriate for one Dr. Lowenstein. The wardrobe was clearly a vehicle for one reluctantly aging pop star.Also, the music was so loud, so epic at times that I literally had to cover my ears. In one scene Blythe Danner left the room, but you could still see her reflection in a picture on a wall, waiting for her cue.I loved the first half of the book, hated the second. The movie was like fingernails scraping down a chalk board from the time I entered the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this?","review":"Ok, ok, the scenery is beautiful, Nick Nolte is a great actor, but I still can't understand why this movie was so highly acclaimed. I thought it was a pain to watch. Plus, the \\"moral\\" of the story seems to be \\"Have an illicit affair...it's good for you, and it's good for your marriage.\\"My other gripe about this film is that much of it seems centered around the glorification of Streisand and of the character she plays. The film seems to be singing out, \\"Look at me. I'm hot. I'm brilliant. I'm irresistable...and I heal people.\\" Yep, this character's only flaw seems to be that she didn't pick a husband as perfect as herself. I take that back--she can heal people, but not her son.Anyway, I have a list of films labeled \\"don't bother\\" but I had to put this one in a new category: \\"don't watch. seriously.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me want to commit suicide","review":"This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I watched it because my girlfriend made me. This was depressing and boring. I guess the message of this movie is if your sister tries to commit suicide and you come from a screwed up family, have sex with your sister's unattractive shrink and you will open up and live happily ever after! This is definitely a movie for the Oprah crowd or Doctor Phil fans. If you are a regular red-blodded American heterosexual you will despise this inane nonsense. The acting is terrible. This movie perpetuates the worst stereotypes of southerners as well as New Yorkers. As far as Nick Nolte, all he does is grunt and make bad self-deprecating jokes the whole movie. Why would any woman be attracted to this loser? Avoid this movie!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, horrible movie.","review":"This movie has very little in common with the book. The love story between Tom and Lowenstein was only a very small part of a really outstanding book - Luke was hardly mentioned at all and the Callenwolde incident(s) were glossed over.Why oh why did Pat Conroy ever allow this movie to be made??? I would give it a negative rating if I could..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV","review":"Only the Nolte and Streisand characters are well-drawn; the rest are stereotypes. The dialog attempts to be moving, but is more often cliche. Even the climactic revelation has an ersatz, made-for-TV quality to it. Not a bad film, just not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streisand takes away from an otherwise classic","review":"Unfortunately, Barbra Streisand got a hold of an absolutely classic Pat Conroy novel and sensationalized her role to position herself for an oscar. While the main storyline is intact, so much of the novel is missing from the film that the viewer is truly cheated. I am not a fan of Babs, but I will give her credit for an excellent acting and production job. It's sad, however, that it had to come at the expense of this momentous story.There is noone else that could have been casted for the part of Tom other than Nick Nolte. He is fabulous and portrays the role of the 'southern male' as well as anyone could. Anyone with a heart for the South should read the book, and then see the film, if it comes on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most amazing movie.","review":"This is quite the love story.

This docu-drama on that plan shows how sophisticated and resourceful the British were on actually setting the plan in motion. Within this film a round table discussion with present day military historians bounce ideas off one another, as to the feasibility of Operation Foxley, adding another dynamic to an already spell binding movie. A must see for any WWII buff. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has got something - yet not much.","review":"The images in this movie are beautiful and the music is quite beautiful too. And the lead-actress really does play well. Yet, this does not make it a good movie.There is repeatedly a kind of mystification which seems inappropriate to me.If there is no obvious story or plot, this need not be a problem; but this movie lacks authenticity, if you ask me. The movie is phantasy/imagination-driven, psychologically it is not realistic or mature; and I do not sense true inspiration or depth.Alienation is an important theme in this movie, but it is not really solved or confronted.Sex and intimacy is no solution.Beauty for beauty's sake is no solution.An art-movie without depth or primary-authentic inspiration is also no solution either.Yet the images and music, and the puppetshow-scene, make this movie certainly worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice movie but still fell flat in the end","review":"a wonderful movie, beautifully shot. screenplay not bad but directing and editing needed to be notched up a little bit. the beautiful young female actor was a very very talented future star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-OK Maybe I didn't get it","review":"I loved \\"Red\\", \\"White\\" and \\"Blue\\", but this was to slow and icky-weird for me.

I guess it is because it the limited edition classic ball, and Spalding used the rest of the leather that was left good, or bad to produce these. the ball feels like the pebbles are big, the patina feels cheap.It seems like the breaking in process would still not help it that much. If you get the balls that they used now that have the new design but still made of leather you can totally tell how different they are.

Grady Tate punctuates and acknowledges this glorious blues dialgoue. The playing is spontaneous and simple yet highly sophisticated and organized. The comping is magnificent.

She portrays Assunta Spina, a Neapolitan woman in love with the passional Michele. The acting is wonderful (and incidentally, much less exagerated than the usual acting in most silent movie), almost realistic - and the movie itself is shot in the streets and houses of Naples. A gem.Equally interesting is the included documentary, with scenes from other movies and an interview with the old Bertini, in which she watches and comments the movie (sometimes filling in the lines for the silent scenes). In the interview, she plays the role of the aging diva, but joking about it at the same time.

For those of us that can't afford to run down to Neiman Marcus and slap down $600.00 for these sexy stiletto's, there's \\"Manolo Blahnik\\" by Colin McDowell. The pictures in this book will take your breathe away. You'll find yourself salivating over everything from linen mules to toe-ring slides. The book itself is more like a work of art than a book about footwear.

Most see this as a book set in North Africa, but note the descriptions of the Alps--one can almost hear the cold, crisp air. Although his relationship with Marceline takes a back seat to his own inner voyage, I found his struggle to love her, while at the same time being pulled in an entirely different direction, compelling. His urge to continue traveling at the end, knowing deep within himself that it will kill her; knowing but not knowing how ill she was throughout, was frightening.

I grant that The Immoralist does suggest existential questions but, unlike Camus' La Chute (for instance), it simply presents the life and actions of the anti-hero without his actual and deliberate existential questioning. This is the subtle richness of Gide's writing. The Immoralist presents a unique disparity in the lavishness in description of setting, and the relatively spare characterizations. Gide does not glorify, chastise nor condemn his Michel. Michel is simply what he is, what he has become. This novel is filled with brilliant writing, lines of which one can't help but memorize. For instance, \\"The capacity to get free is nothing; the capacity to be free, that is the task.\\" and also, \\"You cannot be sincere and at the same time seem so.\\" Having read both Bussy's pioneer translation and Howard's later one, I much prefer the latter.

But we don't have anything like the array of surprises we were treated to in that first book.I liked this book, and I'm still waiting for the conclusion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Military SF that's heavy on the SF","review":"I'm generally don't read Military SF, not for reasons of political or personal taste, but because I find most Military SF heavy on the Military and light on the SF. I picked up Birmingham's first book, Weapon of Choice, on a whim, and I'm glad I did. Like the other military SF authors on my short list (Eric Flint, for example) Birmingham gets deeper into the thought-provoking ideas that come out of a speculative situation.There's some combat and some fun with high-tech weaponry, but there's also real SF, looking at the culture clash between 2020 and 1940, the effects that prolonged ideological wars might have on our current culture, and the impact of a glimpse of the future on course of the war. He also looks at more military topics like the impact that modern military theories of operations and training might have on WW II, as the high-tech ammo starts to run out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enable Speech!","review":"I enjoyed the first book in the series.

In this book Birmingham continues the multiple story lines but I found it to be a little slower paced than the first and he really didn't put as much emphesis on the emotional and cultural differences as well as he did in Weapons. The story lines don't appear to be as well thought out as before. It is a shame because I loved the first book. It is still a good read it just takes a little longer to get the the really interesting stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A first rate... teen novel","review":"This book was amazing. Amazingly BAD. I'm 15 so I should enjoy all teen novels right? WRONG. This story was full of cliches and annoying similes and pathetic attempts at \\"deep\\" writing. The main character is Danny and he's hiding from 4 \\"gang\\" members on Alcatraz...sounds like a good premise, huh? So where did Eve Bunting, the author go wrong? Well, who cares?! The fact is she did and this book reeked! She kept throwing in little hints about the city of San Francisco that proved to be completely useless and no aid to the story whatsoever! This book should be banned from stores and libraries because surely it is not legal to write so horribly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alcatraz Escape","review":"Someone is hiding on Alcatraz Island is an action story, but at some points it turns into a love story. It was written by Eve Bunting and published in New York in 1983.A boy named Danny was walking down the street when all of a sudden he sees an old woman, resembling his own grandmother, being mugged by a kid. He instantly sprints over to the old woman and pushes the boy down to the ground and helps the old woman. Little did Danny know that the boy was the brother of someone who is in the undisputed toughest gang around, The Outlaws.Danny is a 14 year old boy, he is a very fast runner. He lives in San Francisco, California. Biddy is an Alcatraz Island ranger she helps Danny out along the way and she sits with Danny on the boat when they are on the way to Alcatraz Island. The members of the outlaws are Cowboy, Jelly bean (the brother of the kid who was mugging the old lady on the street), Priest, and Maxie. The outlaws are the toughest gang in San Francisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair Overview, but lacking substance","review":"This book provides a fair description about modeling for basic business components. However, it fails to be useful for specifying a buildable or testable system and does not address enterprise issues. The models in chapters 4 and 5 are useful only for coffee discussions - they are far from practical for business analysts, requirements engineers, testers, and OO designers.Furthermore, it misses the mark by representing OO design as ontology under the disguise of UML diagrams. I was disappointed and expected more from a book that is published in the Object Technology Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not see the value of the book","review":"I bought this book by seeing its title.

It's entertaining, and for the most part, very truthful. Descriptions of the colleges are NOT written by grads who just \\"loved\\" their ivy-covered buildings. The descriptions are based on surveys that kids who are at the colleges right now filled out!! A must to have around, and most definitely a great jumping off point for any student looking to attend one of the better schools in the country. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's descriptions are not very in depth... but then again, take it for what it's worth - a jumping off point for finding out more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not entirely pleased.","review":"To read this book is to give yourself a headache.

I was not entirely pleased when I read this book, especially since I was planning to send my 18 year old son to become an assosciate for small businesses. He also wants to become a lawyer, and I have decided to send him to Harvard. As you probably realize, Harvard is incredibly expensive, but since the Univ. that I attended for 4 yrs has enabled me to become a very successful vet, who owns an also very successful string of hospitals and clinics all over the US of A and, my home country, Canada, I was able to pay the tuition fees.

The amount of information it, the unique ratings and rankings systems, the quotes from students...it was great. In total, I've bought 5 editions.Then came the time when I actually went to college and experienced it for myself. I'm a junior now. Last year, our campus newspaper printed an article that shocked me. It contained excerpts from the latest edition's description of our school. It was blatantly wrong. It made this place out to be a hellhole. Why? Because they based their review on the results of less than 10 informal surveys.I saw the new edition last week, and again, its description of my school is filled with inaccuracies.

Chief Inspector Rostnikov is frequently reported to be carrying or reading an old copy of one of McBain's works and often refers to some of the characters. And as with the 87th Precinct, there are individual detectives, each with his own back stories, investigating different cases. This time out their Office of Special Investigations is looking into a possible murder plot against a member of the Politburo, the disappearance of a bus driver and his bus and, of course, a mysterious mental patient who \\"walks like a bear.\\"Kaminsky leaves me wanting to know what happens to these guys and their families as the Soviet Union disintegrates.

The tail is wagging the dog; it's like saying you should listen to Beethoven because he paved the way for the Electric Light Orchestra. You should pick it up because Dizzy was an inspired, innovative huge-cheeked trumpet player. And his music swings, rocks and bops in all the right places. The record should really be called \\"Dizzy does Cuba\\" or something because it compiles highlights from his so-called \\"Afro-Cuban\\" phase. He developed a style of Jazz that borrowed heavily from Africa and Cuba and fused them into an exotic-sounding pork sandwich.

There was a lot left unexplained and why go for a realistic approach just to blow the end end of the movie with such fictional bulldust?However, least this time the films maker didn't try to con you into believing the story was true just to sell a low budget movie, least he had a budget for this one to hire an entire film crew to make a proper movie..... it just needed a much better ending imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believers","review":"Awful, just awful.

It's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart.

At first.The colander is a nice size, functional, and the colour is gorgeous.HOWEVER, less than 8 months later, with light use (3-4 times a week) and even lighter care (always hand washed, we don't even own a dishwasher) the enamel started bubbling and peeling.I contacted Amazon and they explained that because of the 30-day return policy it was too late to return it to them. Fair enough.They suggested I contact the manufacturer. Ok.I did exactly that, and, more than a month later, haven't even received a reply from them.If you want colour, there are other options.

I keep having 'When You Call My Name' on repeat, but the other songs are great too. In fact, 'Actions Speak Louder Than Words' and 'Better Off Without You' are two songs that he gave to Brigette McWilliams for her 1997 \\"Too Much Woman\\" album. He does a good job with them here (but they can't top McWilliams' versions). If his first album \\"Love Stories\\" is better than this one as another reviewer said, then I can't wait to check it out because this album is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shear Brilliance","review":"Frank McComb is one of this era's greatest talents. Melodically, Frank places you in a comfort zone that you will want to revisit years from now, time and time again. And when Frank places his words to these melodies, the songs cut right to the heart, allowing you to feel and live every lyric. Having Frank sing the \\"Wedding Song\\" - Love Stories at my wedding in July of 2000, was an awesome experience that my Wife and I will cherish until the day we die. I recommend my friend Frank McComb to any one who can appreciate timeless music, and is starved from an artist who in my view is the quintessential producer/songwriter/artists of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"After you go thru this book, you will find a very clear picture on how SAP works is already in your mind.

I saw the first Predator was immediately hooked. I didn't see the sequal for several more years, and when I finally did, I was very dissapointed. Without Ahhnold (or anyone exceptionally big) the movie just didn't seem as good. The first one was all about the action, thrills, and effects. This one was about how much swearing and sexual \\"stuff\\" as they could fit into a two hour time frame. I could do without all of that, I want good action, a worthy plot, and good acting. This movie lacked all of that. The action was slow, boring, and just not the same.If you want a good movie, stay away from this and go with the original -- or even the Alien series, the first one (the only one I saw) was just as good.

The music is edgy and mixes well with the action on screen. I'm glad they didn't do another jungle one. The city makes the most sense, and hot one like LA is logical. I was impressed with Danny Glovers performance. Is it any wonder why we liked him so much in the Lethal Weapon series. This is well worth seeing.

Though the dialogue is a bit dumb and very cliched, the film never fails to entertain. From the frightening opening sequence in which the Predator slaughters a group of viscious Colombians to the great climactic battle in the slaughterhouse, the film is much scarier and much more intense than the original.

This is the DVD version 'Einsteins'. If you want to spew about how much you like or hate the Bluray version, order a brain on Amazon and then write the Bluray review under the Bluray product.

Not one of Glovers best, I give it 2 stars because I like the Predator and the ending is fun to watch. The rest is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least It's Better Than The First One","review":"Decent effects and more action make this one better than the first...But as far as I'm concerned thats not saying much. Stephen Hopkins is a solid director though. See Under Suspicion which he directed about a year or so ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator 2","review":"What made the original \\"Predator\\" so exciting and entertaining was, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger, but also the swamp-like setting and incredible cinematography. Danny Glover is no Arnold, and a large suburban city just doesn't seem to be a believable place for a kill-crazy creature from another world to wreck havoc. The script is laughable, the effects are disappointing, and the star power of Glover and Busey is unfortunately wasted. A sequel that never should have happened. Director: Stephen Hopkins. Cast: Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Ruben Blades, Maria Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Kent McCord, Morton Downey Jr. Rated R for violence, gore, profanity, and nudity. 108 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Acting","review":"I found this DVD real cheap and bought it. I really tried hard to like the movie, but I just couldn't because the acting was incredibly bad, especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city. Even the guys who don't have lines display bad performances.An hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie. I broke this DVD and threw it out, something I've only done to 4-5 DVDs I felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"danny glovebox should be punished for this","review":"danny glovebox portrays the most hateful character ever in movie history - his idiotic policeman is literally incontinent with rage, splashing it over all the other characters and his own trousers in every horrible scene he is in. this is 2 hideous strike outs for glovefinger what with his lethal weapon abomination. seriously, this guy should be banned for life from ever scarring people's eyeballs again with this painful crud. i'll tell you what though, if they ever bring out a director's extended version of this i will be first in line for a copy provided that the extra extended scenes are all of glovebox being tortured and made to say sorry for what he has done. i'd pay a million dollars for that and i just don't have that kind of money. in summation, predator the original, yes sir; predator the glovehole abomination, dear god please, i'm begging you, punish glovefinger or i will know you do not exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator 2","review":"The CD was in good shape. The movie keeps you in your seat and has the right amount of action to keep you guessing as to what will happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting.","review":"This sequel is an insult to the original 5 star movie. I found myself fast forwarding to get to a good part which never seemed to come. Dont even think of buying. If you are curious, wait for 99cent rental night. Glover is good but plot, action and everything else is rock bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"I don't know why, I just simply didn't like this as much as the first. When watching the first, not only was I really entertained, I really wondered about the Predator: its history, where it comes from, etc. I thought maybe the second would address this: perhaps giving us a glimpse at his home planet. But it didn't: the closest is when it shows the inside of his ship. And I just can't understand Danny Glover being the one to save earth from an interplanetary hunter. Maybe Arnold's acting wasn't as good, but at least he looks the part. And I also thought setting it in a city would make it better: more targets. But it didn't. It was good in places, and showed off more Predator weaponry, but I still have to recommend the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is absolutly atrocious. I like Bill Paxton, but he is so bad in this movie it makes me cringe. The Predator action scene are nifty at best. My main gripe with this flick is the plot hole in the beginning. The Predator is known for killing anyone who is armed, yet Danny Glover pulls a gun on this thing and he walks away. Uggh!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than #1","review":"The original Predator was supposed to be moody and eerie and all, but its really just a vehicle for Arnold who isn't a good enough actor for something so serious.Predator 2 throws all that out the window, in favor of just plain fun. Its suspenseful and absolutely hillarious at the same time. In this setting, bad acting is a virtue! As if the setting and situation weren't ridiculous enough, you have the always-awful Robert Davi and the usually bad Bill Paxton and Kent McCord. And that's not to mention Morton Downey, Jr! Wow! is all I can say.There is something about the corny, cliched dialog, badly delivered--along with ultra, ultra violence--against a backdrop of big budget special effects that is just a winning combination. Danny Glover is fine (although his jacket doesn't fit) but I'm telling 'ya, if they had used Bruce Willis instead of Danny Glover people would be calling this a classic.Watch this with anyone over 15 and you will laugh your sides off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is the best! It's action packed, not too gory,and a little thrown in humor by Bill Paxton. There are new weapons that the Predator has which are not in the first Predator movie. Gary Busey is a great agent out to find the thing. Danny Glover was great for this movie since he had some tuff cop experience for the Lethal Weapon films. This is a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong","review":"This is a surprisingly good knife stand for a great price. The configuration allows for good flexibility with knives of up to 13 inches. It would cost you more to go out and buy the materials instead of just paying $2.97 for this stand. My only reservation was the gold sticker but it can easily be covered over. Quite a surprise to find it at this price. Since it is a stand originally intended for a particular knife, there are probably a limited number of them out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENERGETIC GIULINI","review":"Giulini is masterful throughout.

Great performance!However, EMI should make apology or recall all the dvd of this title because the sound track can only be heard from the left loudspeaker--really weird enough \\"mono\\" type. I purchased from the authorized retailer,not pirate edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"You cannot put this books down. I try to forget it so I can read it again every few years. Not like L'Amour's other books, the shoot em up, good guy gets the girl. This one is different.Not that I have the most exalted taste, but I was an English major and now am a librarian, so I have read a few books...This is a winner.Anyone age 10 and up can read it and love it.

Enjoyed by the grandkids read either to them or by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Start Reading Until You Have Time To Finish It All!!","review":"I started this book yesterday and could not stop reading until it was finished. This is an extremely captivating book.Some reviewers have pointed out that it may not be a completely accurate representation of history or reality. True, but it is supposed to be fiction. L'Amour's talent lies in telling extremely captivating tales in a easy-to-read, descriptive style. This book surely fits the bill and I plan on reading it many times in the years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down the Long Hills","review":"This book isn't one of Louis L'Amour's best. There were a few exciting moments, but the times between them were very dull. I thought he put to much into describing the settings and didn't put enough into the story. After reading other books by Louis L'Amour, I would have to say I was disapointed. For example when the Indians raided the wagon train, the story was talking about the two children bringing the horse back instead of talking about the raid. Two children being alone in the wilderness isn't that exciting. I have to admit it did get better towards the end, but I like to be able to get into a book from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"L'Amour's only Golden Spur Award winner","review":"I was surprised to see a rating average of only 4 and a half stars on this one. This is the only book for which L'Amour ever won a Golden Spur Award from Western Writers of America! It is definitely different from anything else he ever wrote, and a great coup, I thought. I usually don't give any L'Amour's more than three stars, but this one sure deserved it. It kept to L'Amour's trademark of no sex, no graphic violence, and little cursing, and I like that a lot. For that reason, if you like L'Amour you just have to read all of the books by the author critics are calling The New Louis L'Amour, Kirby Jonas. He is tremendous, and may one day even replace L'AMour. L'Amour was always my favorite, but Jonas has edged him out. You have to read this guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"The mount was shipped to me very quickly. The fit is very good and the finish is fantastic.

I immediately went out and bought my first pair and haven't been without at least 2 styles ever since. Classic, simple, comfortable, and durable, they have never failed me whether at work (I'm a Fed Ex courier) or play.

I won\`t get into the specifics (Well said in the other customer reviews) except to say if you want to see a good, if not great Walter Hill boxing movie, then rent \\"Hard Times\\". It starred Charles Bronson, and James Coburn about a streetfighter during the great depression of the \`30s. Although I really like Snipes,and Rhames I have to say that Bronson and Coburn had a lot better chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Stupid - Very predictable","review":"This is got to be the lamest movie I have seen in a while. During the entire viewing, you already know the two main characters are going to fight. But the movie tries to place some diversions to make you think \\"oh no, the warden is mad, now the fight isn't going to take place.\\" Give me a break. Not to mention during the character definitions, you already know who is going to win the fight before the movie is even into the first 20 minutes. If you still feel to so compelled to watch it, I would recommend skipping the whole story (because there really is no story) and go straight to the fight. At least you can recover an hour of wasted life."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNDISPUTEDLY the wackest film.....","review":"Let me begin by saying that I didn't buy this DVD but watched it on Cable. I'm writing this review to deter folks from buying the DVD. It was a waste of time completely. Had I gone to see this film in theatres I would've been disappointed immensely. The plot was so dumb. If Columbo could get Ving Rhames out of prison, why couldn't he get Wesley out, better yet why couldn't he get himself out??? How dumb is that? This should have been a tv movie at best, never hit the big screen. Rhames and Snipes are two decent actors, too bad they weren't allowed to show any acting abilities from this poorly written script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undisputed","review":"Even though it is a rip off of Mike Tyson, except this guy actually gets in a boxing match in prison, it's not bad. It reminds me of Digstown with out the humor. It's a fun movie, but if you psychoanalize it enough you can see plenty of problems with it.In my opinon: Kick back, relax, and be entertained. It will never be as bad as ID4 and the IMAC, or Signs and the aliens who come to a planet that is 75% water and they are alergic to water.This is fantastic boxing film. Wesley Snipes doesn't play the character he normaly plays. Yes, he plays an action hero, but for the first time in a movie...he is fairly quite and soft spoken. The best thing about this movie, is that it builds up the anticipation of the big fight at the end. It doesn't just show a story then thow an ending at you. Their is a lot of plot that is built up to give you a great fight at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Wesley and Ving were superb in the movie. I'd never seen Ving play a really bad guy before. He was great. Wesley was excellent as always, one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers what it promises...","review":"If you're a fan of either boxing or prison movies, or both, this a good pic for you. Fans of Peter Falk may want to check this out also... as he revisits his classic hard-boiled, wizened old guy role, this time in a much-aged version. The film wins points for being straight-forward and to the point... while still leaving ambiguities that keep it interesting and true-to-life, like what really happened with Ice Man's \\"he said\\" \\"she said\\" court case. The characters are presented simply, true-ly, and without a lot of bs or fluff. The filming and shoots are well-done, the characters and scenes believable. The action is linear and satisfying, and the film ends on a fine note. The only weakness is in the scene of the final fight. The fight is not interesting; except for the final few moments, you can hardly make out what they're doing, and it's not very dramatic. But overall, I would recommend this to fans of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather disappointing","review":"Let me tell yall why, because of the previews and the way the movie was described of the case I was expecting this movie to be loaded with boxing. This movie was kind of weak. I did enjoy the fight towards the movie. Lets get to the story it's about a ten year undefeated champ who is in prison for being conviceted of murder(SNIPES)and a boxer in for a rape charge(RHAMES). It's a good thing I only rented this. This just should teach to rent before you buy a movie if you have not seen it in a theater or just watch the movie on TV. Im not saying don't see the movie if you want to than do so.

When it's published, half of Washington is seen leaving for places unknown. The political satire is pretty well laid on here (it should have even been stronger), and why it's not shown more on TV is hard to figure.

For the past year my stereo speakers on the Patio/Pool area we cutting out when the amplifier was at less than volume. This was extremely annoying since the volume from the speakers was not very loud. I am running heavy gauge wire and everything is dry and protected from the outside elements other than the humidity. After using the Pyle speaker selector and having since added a third set of speakers, I can now turn the volume to full capacity without the speakers shutting off. (Obliviously there is distortion at that level and do not actually run them that high) Problem solved and for less than $35.00.Only one small complaint: I wish the inputs in the speaker selector would accept larger diameter wire. I am using 16 gauge and it's a pretty tight fit. I would prefer to use 12 or 14 gauge for the longer runs but I don't think they will fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid features and construction at a fair price","review":"The Pyle PSS4 is very easy to set up and use. The box is small enough to fit into a tight environment, but big enough to allow easy speaker connections and large, well-spaced buttons for selecting speakers. The protection circuitry reduces volume when enabled, and it is convenient to select or de-select this feature. I am only running two pairs of small speakers from the unit, off the A channel of my receiver, and never at high volume, so I have left the protection circuitry off. In that state, speaker volume is equivalent to the volume on the single pair of speakers that I run directly off the B channel.

The best part is the ability to selectively switch each set of speakers on or off. I can play movies on my widescreen and pump the sound through my four indoor speakers and turn off the outside speakers so I am not broadcasting what I am watching outside.

The man flawlessly displays just about every blues lick worth hearing. His technique is, as usual, breathtaking, but even more pleasing is the myriad ways he makes the blues sound fresh. Of course, any one who loves and knows jazz is already familiar with this recording, but the less sophisticated listener will be also be rewarded by it. It is 'real jazz,' but very 'approachable'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant album","review":"I'm rookie to the jazz-genre, and have only got two jazz cd's: Night train and Getz/ Gilberto.

I definitely haven't bought my last jazz CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite pianist","review":"I was virtually unfamiliar with Oscar Peterson until Amazon made this album their MP3 Daily Deal. After hearing the clips, I had to buy it! Not since Art Tatum, have I heard a jazz pianist with such original movement and phrasing.At times, he is almost minimalistic, playing a single note (\\"Duke's Place\\" melody on \\"C-Jam Blues\\"), then he jumps into some virtuosic rifts that will blow the mind of anyone who understands what he's doing.The swing on every track is so natural and beautiful, that you almost forget that it's \\"irregular\\".

Peterson truly is the best jazz pianist of all time, and this is one of his best recordings. The 12 page booklet includes photos of OP, Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen, as well as informative liner notes, including track-by-track notes.

The end result is excellent.Ben Webster is often overlooked today but, in his day, he was one of the best, and best known, tenor sax players. He played in the Duke Ellington band before going on to a successful career as a soloist and session player. As examples of Webster's session work, check the credits on Billie Holliday's best known albums and you'll find Ben Webster's name there.Webster had a very distinctive, breathy style of playing. He always wanted to learn the lyric of a song before performing it so he could use the phrasing of the lyric in his playing. If you're not familiar with Ben Webster, this album is a great introduction.Bottom line: if you like 1950s jazz, this is an essential album for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Classic","review":"Excellent album where a pure Peterson meets a magestic Webster in a great marriage of cool jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fits into whatever you're doing","review":"I heard samples of him on the preview section.

For example, it says to teach a D lineman how to beat a block, have a player try to block him and have the defensive player try to beat the block. Great drill? I didn't need a book to figure that out. The book is both very simple and very complex at the same time. While the drills are simplistic, as I said, some of the concepts are for much older kids.

Sadly I can see some of the potential but there is so little elaboration and it all ends so quickly. Even most of his short stories read better than this novella.The whole main plot of the puzzle box is so lacking in detail and the we are only given a glimpse of who brings the box to the plot and then they disapear never to be heard from again. This book SHRIEKS out for another 200 pages of some decent plot development. It almost seems like this was either written by de Lint when he was much younger, or by someone completely different. Of all the de Lint books, this is the only one I did not keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a dissapointment : (","review":"I'm a casual fan of Charles de Lint. I've only read Forests of the Heart and a huge handful of his short stories, but I've generally considered him a good author. However, with Into the Green, we have an author exploring themes he's already done (and better, in \\"The Little Country\\"). Plus, the reader never gets into the minds of the characters and often pages are filled with trite and redundent lamentations of grief, either concerning the main heroine or how tragic it would be if the \\"fey wonders of the world\\" disappeared. This man can write better than this. If you must read this book, try and get a used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein.

The only thing this movie has in common with DOTD or that people might call it a rip-off because is, 1.There is zombies, but DOTD did not create zombies!, 2. They tried to pull this off as a sequel to DOTD which didn't work then they later got sued by the production crew od DOTD (lol). Those 2 things are not reasons to call this a rip-off of DOTD, ok so now that that's clear on to the movie. This is a great zombie film, the zombies are probally the most detailed i've ever seen in a zombie flick. The scene where the zombie fights the shark is amazing, did you knwo the actor that was suppose to do that got sick and they made the sharks trainer be the zombie! There is also the famous \\"splinter in eye\\" scene that shook the horror world! This is a great film, lots of gore from the godfather of gor Lucio Fulci. The soundtrack blends in well with this movie, this was a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it.","review":"I saw this film in 1980 in Panama. I was stationed down there. I saw it in a hell hole of a stinking rotting theater that looked like something out of a horror film it's self. The place was old, falling a part, smelt like a sewer and all around me it looked like a freak show. I swear, this is true, they even had live chickens in the lobby. I LOVED IT. The perfect setting for this film. I could just see the zombies coming out of the decaying walls all around me. This film totally creeps me out.

There are some gory scenes, but they are few and far between. When the gore scenes do appear, they are well done, but there is a lot of garbage to get through before you see them. The zombies in this film move so slowly that I don't know how anybody could get caught. Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead are gorier films, but the effects in Zombie are better than Dawn, but not as good as Day. There are no stomachs torn open and intestines pulled out, there is a gut munching seen, but you don't see the zombies do the damage(just the after effect). The picture quality is extremely poor and is one of the worst looking DVD's I have seen yet. The commentary track doesn't explain much, but it is OK. I'd advise people to wait for a better transfer to become available if they must have this film. Still, it is uncut!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTDATED MOVIE.","review":"The acting, dialogue and overall feeling of this movie is sadly outdated, boring and with little thrill to today's standards.

And as soon as watched it thought it was excellent, the eye piercing sceene alone is very realistic and brilliant. This film only comes second to Day of the Dead.

I can now say that I can't see any connection whatsoever to the two movies.Spare yourself the aggravation, skip this one and just rewatch the Romero '... Dead' trilogy.

I've never liked it, but last night I went home and watched it again since so many people seem to love it. What I found was the same: voodoo has raised an army of flesh-eaters on a remote island, and that's pretty much all that happens of interest in this film. The camera work is blurry and dark, the dialogue is awful, and the scenes go on and on about nothing. To be fair, the film has some fantastic gore effects and truly ghastly zombie makeup, and is almost worth seeing for that reason(unless, of course, you have a weak stomach, in which case, why are you reading this?). It's just that the rest of the film is so dull and pointless that even the gore can't save it. I tried to be optimistic, but this film just bored and depressed me.

His experience in slapstick comedy and giallo thrillers shines through here. He crafts a film that shifts from bright, beautiful and tropical to gloomy and death-soaked.While its remembered for its gore and gruesome zombie makeup, its real strength is in its slow, methodical pacing and suspenseful scares. The actors do a great job, but the terrible dubbing makes the dialogue very cheesy.

And this is only one in a series of grotesque treats awaiting any serious gore hound. So on those merits alone, I think it earns its four stars.

It was boring beyond belief. It took 45 minutes of the movie to get to the zombies on the island. By then, I lost all interest and turned it off after fast forwarding to see if the gore was worth watching. It wasn't. When I read that there was a Zombie Shark fight, I thought that it had to be good. Boy was I wrong.It's not even good camp.To give you a sense of my taste in Zombie movies I like, Dawn of the Dead and most Romero,Shawn of the Dead,Fido,Return of the Living Dead 1 and 3,and Planet Terror, to name a few of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Zombie Movie I've Ever Seen.","review":"I reall like zombie movies and when I bought this I thought it would be like Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. The Zombies were extremly fake looking, the acting sucked, but the plot was decent. The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because there where zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite zombie film","review":"I am a huge fan of zombie films and this is by far my personal favorite. There are so many reasons, but I don't really want to get into them for fear of ruining some of the shock factor for those that haven't seen this masterpiece. All I will say, is that the scene in this movie involving an eyeball is my favorite scene in horror movie history. This two disc edition of the film is great, the special features are great if you're like me and love to know more about the films you love. Also, there's a mini poster inside, which is definitely a bonus to me. If you love zombie movies and haven't seen this one, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to believe it was made in 1979","review":"ZOMBIE is a movie about a woman who wants to find her father and a reporter interested in some rumors he's heard.when this reporter named Peter West hears that Anne's father is missing,he wants to help.they leave for the island with two people.After a while,the walking dead start to appear.This all leads up to a zombie gore fest of guns, molatov cocktails, and a shovel.The zombies are VERY well done.I warn you, this movie is not scary, but it is VERY violent and have some nudity.minus 1 star for the music basically ruining the suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Romero has nothing on this!!","review":"Without a doubt Fulci's best film. They don't make these movies quite like they used to,but if you're into late 70's early 80's horror, you already knew that. Instead of reading these reviews, buy the damn movie!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Like the Plague","review":"This movie is boring. If it is slow to build suspense it failes miserably. I can't believe I bought this bomb. The only remotely interesting part is the end where the zombies take over New York City and that is such a relief because it signifies the end of this stinker. The gross parts were gross -- I got to give it that, but there just wasn't enough of them. Take a caffeine pill before you watch this movie to help you stay awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this movie because I love zombie movies and I heard how great this movie was. Was I ever disappointed! This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was horrible. The story was boring. There was hardly any action in the movie. It was a total waste of my money. Do not buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me laugh.","review":"I am a young teen girl and I found this movie histerical. The effects were horrible. I was flabergasted at the women taking their tops off for no reason. I don't think that added to the film. The underwater Zombie vs. shark scene wasn't what it was made out to be.. it was about 1 minute long and it was so fake. The zombie's BRIGHT green blood ruined it. This film was a discrace to all Zombie films - if you want to see a great zombie movie see Dawn of the Dead or day of the Dead.. thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic this is not","review":"A bought this expecting a good zombie movie (apparently this is in the top 10) and what I got was a very campy(not in the good way) and overrated piece of crap. Not only that the picture and the audio on this dvd is horrendus very poor quality colors are very washed out and blurry specially in the night scenes.The audio is just as bad and the lip sync is laughable it is like 4th graders did this movie. I will give some credit in the gore department but I bought this expecting a GOOD ZOMBIE movie not for gore. I am sorry if I am offending anyone but if you want to see a good zombie movie go see Dawn of the dead(1976) not only is that the best zombie movie but when compared to zombie,zombie is nothing but a pile of crap very overrated and not worth the 13$ one of the best lol one of the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP BASHING FULCI !!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Some people think they are such critics to bash Fulci and his films. First of all, I don't see any of you geniuses directing anything better,second, Fulci was not a rich man and produced all of his own films. So now do you get it? The man worked with what little he had.Remember the old saying,\\"You make do with what you have.\\" If Fulci could have gotten a true budget to work with I believe he would've taken the world by storm so don't bash him until you can do better.To anyone else I say Buy this bad ... DVD and sit back with Lucio Fulci and witness the madness and flesh eating mayhem in one his best ever...\\"ZOMBIE.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie: A true classic","review":"I have always loved this film. Great story, great effects, great action and great music. A must for any horror movie/zombie fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst movie I have ever seen","review":"Poor acting may be excused, as may a boring story, but the absolutely only upside to this movie is a scene where a woman get a splinter driven through her eye. Groce? Absolutely, but it looked cool. Apart from that, there are few fighting scenes, a notable exception being a scene with a zombie fighting a shark that is VERY obviously a doll. Some poor movies may be seen because it is fun to see how badly it is made. This movie is beyond bad. It is boring and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic, nor a horror movie...","review":"Just because something is old, does not make it a classic. There is not one scene in Zombie that offers up any scares, discrediting it as a horror movie, and the gore is so infrequent as to make one not want to call this a gore movie. The \\"good\\" parts of Zombie could be fashioned into a 5 minute (or less) montage and be far better than having to watch the other 85 minutes. Buy this if you want a handful of mediocre effects pieces surrounded by cinematic garbage. Fulci's fame is undeserved, to say the least, as this film fully demonstrates. If he's a master, it's of horrible film-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't they ever learn","review":"How many shots does it take before you learn you have to shoot them in the head?Lesson to be learned from this movie: When you throw a molatov cocktail, make sure you do it from outside the house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutter Trash","review":"This movie is just crap. the worst slowest paced movie i think i have ever seen. the zombies look like junk, the dialog is junk, and the story is crap and takes WAY to long to setup anything worth watching. When you put nudity in a film JUST to keep ppl watchin its sad. The movie is nothing more than ghetto trash and to compare it with Dawn/Day/Night of the living dead should be illegal.Save your self the money and get something else. I dont know what movie the ppl that praise it watched because this is CRAP!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zombi 2 sucks","review":"this movie sucks. don't buy it. the gore looks like spaghetti and it is boring as all hell. if you like the camera-work of 10 year-olds and people who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag...this movie is for you.p.s. the infamous \\"eye gouging\\" scene can't get much worse...i'm no medical professional...but if a sharp piece of wood penetrates a person's eyeball, shouldn't it bleed...a lot? oh, i guess not when the shot suddenly switches from a real person into a fake eye closeup that couldn't fool any re-re on the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get eaten alive with Lucio Fulci...","review":"...in this classic gore horror.I am still very happy that I have chance to see this legendary horror.Everytime you have taste for good horror with zombies,take this film.Together with Dawn of the dead best zombie horror ever made,that,thanks to Anchor bay looks like new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore all other reviews of this film!","review":"Contrary to misplaced popular opinion this film has nothing to do with Dawn of the Dead (it was the sequel in Italy, but so what). All you need to know is this: a zombie wrestles a real, live shark. A shark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Net Carbs Are Incorrect","review":"While the recipes in this book are delicious, the net carb counts are completely incorrect. It seems the author does not count granular Splenda as the 24 carbs per cup that it is. Good recipes, but do your own math when figuring net carbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Price","review":"I do not feel that this book was worth the $17.95 price tag and have returned it to Amazon.The production of this oversided paperback book is very home brewed. The page layout, font selection, and printing of the design are of poor quality.The book gives only \\"Net Carb\\" counts for recipes rather than complete nutritional information which can be calculated easily with an inexpensive program like MasterCook. The lack of proper nutritional information makes the recipes fairly useless by diabetics and people who are other than Aitkins-like diets.On top of the production and nutritional value problems, the recipes that I tried were just plain not tasty. They lacked in basic sweetness, and in remaking some and adding extra Splenda, they never did achieve an acceptable flavor.If you are thinking of buying this book to satisfy your sweet tooth, expect to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Carb Sinfully Delicious Desserts: Cheesecakes, Pies< Cookies,Mousse,Tiramisu, Fudge, Chocolate, and More","review":"This is a cool cookbook! Things I thought I couldn't have I now can. And made with everyday products. Even my husband, who is not on low carbs, enjoys these desserts.Thank you for a great cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, entertaining, worth rereading many times","review":"We all have a book or two that's a favorite; one you cherish a bit more than others. This book is that kind for me. Studying our country's presidents is a hobby of mine so I snatched this title up at the local bookstore a few years ago. Even today, I still read specific sections about any one of the Presidents from FDR to George Bush. This is the perfect book for your summer reading list. You'll get the insights into each President that never appears on the evening news. An excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and neglected","review":"I do a search every now and then in hopes that there is a follow-up cd to this fantastic album - alas, no. I agree completely with the previous review and can only add that it takes nerves of steel and incredible vision to combine such diverse talents as Sweet Pea Atkinson, Sheila E, Merle Haggard, Terence Blanchard, Herbie Hancock, etc. into a cohesive outburst of pure crush groove..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Thing Ever","review":"This is the top product of its kind that I have tried so far. It fit perfect, felt amazing, and is easy to hold.The only downside is the sleeve is easy to damage (i.e. cut with fingernails) but I think it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry...","review":"Sorry but I hate this thing, my hubby bought it for me to livenup our sex lives a bit, but I think it is horrible and definitelydoes not feel good at all to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great item! Its kinda big for me but I still like it because it has different speeds of vibrations. It does not come with \\"C\\" Batteries. But otherwise a Fantastic Item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for do it yourselfers","review":"I bought this ish so I could develop it in my darkroom on my own, but then i found out you aren't supposed to process it in B/W chemicals. So it was useless.Amazon doesn't tell you this, but it says on the box: \\"Do not process in Black & White chemicals. Ask for regular color processing.\\"Just FYI-ing yall.as for the quality, my prints looked pretty good after i took them to a commercial developer."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"New-fangled\\" black and white","review":"As the first reviewer noted, this is not \\"traditional\\" black and white film. This is for the consumer market so it can be easily developed on color processing equipment. Have tried a few rolls and the whites come out off-white and contrast is low. Well-processed traditional B&W prints will last 100+ years. No way to know how prints from this film will look in a few decades. If you are taking family photos, go to the expense and trouble of buying regular Kodak B&W film and have it professionally processed. Your great-great-grandchildren will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing for little ones","review":"I'll just get right to it. One of the puppies is run over and killed by a tractor. My four year old ran up to his room crying when this happened and my 8 year old sat on the couch stunned with watery eyes. It really ticks me off when kid's movies do this. It is so unnecessary. My kids already have parents and we do a pretty good job teaching and preparing our kids for life. When I pop a movie in and offer them some popcorn, it is for one reason only; to provide entertainment and pleasure. It is not so some stranger can attempt to teach them lessons on death and loss. Really inappropriate and unnecessary. I am suprised no other review has mentioned this...Like other reviews point out, the kids were very obnoxious. They are horribly behaved and at one point, one of them even yells at an adult and call him names (the adult was a likeable character, not even a bad guy)in front of their parents, who do nothing about it. Awful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The retrievers","review":"This movie is almost as good as the Air Bud movies. Keeps you interested to the end and at times you cry as well as laugh.

My kids also think they taste funny. My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this book even in print?","review":"Why don't the publishers just put the solutions in the text book? As anyone should know, once you know the solutions to any logic or math text, you realize how easy it all is. Could there be an agenda by the Ivy League establishment to incorporate a monopoly of know-how in intelligence? Are they afraid of everyone scoring one hundred percent on exam day? If so, there would be no curve. If so, there would be no disparity between A's credentials versus B's credentials. How does this propel society to intellectual advancement?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Good","review":"I enjoyed using this camera.

I expected to find a detailed history of Thoreau's famous pond but instead found more gossipy stories than serious history. Thoreau deserved better. I hope Walden gets a serious history in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Money - Do Not Buy!","review":"Buyer beware! Do not buy this DVD, as some players won't even play the sound. If you do get the sound to work, it will play at twice the correct speed, and it's like watching it FF (fast forward) with the sound on. In other words, you'll hear the Concerto being played twice as fast. I cannot understand how EMI could even put this on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play the whole night away with this one!!","review":"This brilliant laid back ... romantic.... smokey music is heaven. I purchased this as my first Mark Whitfield CD and despite having a collection of over 4000 CD's this one keeps making it to the 5 disc selection without fail.So sultry are the renditions of every song... and especially #7 \\"Early Autumn\\" with Diana Krall's earthy tones that it is simply a must have, if you simply want to listen to easy ..... glide over your skin ..... magic music.My husband loves the Benson/Klugh sound of the Gibson.... as we romanced to those two back in late 70's and 80's... so it strikes a cord!Great way to spend a special dinner and the continuity of pace is what I like... no stand out loud over eager song to wreck the experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent but corny","review":"Dull and uninspired, this is precisely the type of music true jazz fans will want to stay away from, although more general audience might fall for it.If you like Diana Krall, she is a guest on this CD (surprise, surprise!), singing on two songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst and most unfair, frustrating game.","review":"I was so surprised to see this game have such a high rating. This game is boring and EXTREMELY unfair. It gives the enemy all of the moves to where it makes it unbearable and frustrating to play. It made me break my ds because i got so frustrated and threw it at the wall. I really really do NOT reccomend this game to ANYONE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do programmers have to do that?","review":"Got this game for my game boy and it is the worst one to date about cheating. There is nothing random about the games random number generator. You have heros that have different number of moves they can make (0-4) which depends on the hero in question. I was so impressed with the one sided nature of the number gen that I had to collect some data and crunch the numbers. The game average for the enemy is ~70%. The average for the player is ~25%. Game programmers need to get off the crutch of cheating with there numbers to make a game interesting. That is the lazy way to do it. I cannot recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent sample of Bill Evans live!!","review":"I am a huge Bill Evans fan (he is my favorite piano player from a group of incredible piano players I admire)! This was my second Bill Evans \\"album\\" and you can't go wrong with it. It doesn't have all of the classics, but it certainly has enough and is a fantastic sampling of Bill's greatness, particularly as an introduction to him. This is the best collection of his live stuff on Verve that I have heard, but I haven't heard all of it. \\"Emily\\" and \\"I Love You , Porgy\\" are highlights that put you in that smoky club, leaning back, and listening as you sit a few feet from Bill's piano if you close your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"I looked at this book in the library (glad I didn't spend the money on it!) and learned little from it. It is full of non-specifics, and provides little in the realm of useful info. Why the publisher thought this was worthy of a book is beyond me. It looks as if the author had to pad the book in order to make it lengthy---and this padding is clearly evident. If you want to learn how to implement Baldrige, there are a TON of other books available (most FREE) that can help you do it. Save the money you would have spent on this, and take your kids out for ice cream. You'll end up with a wiser investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not what I looking for","review":"I was actually looking for something along the lines of executive protection detail driving.

It is not only easy to read but pulls you into the author's no nonsense, straightforward, non-wordy communication of essential knowledge and skills to operate a motor vehicle in our sometimes crowded and busy streets and highways. The Driver's Education Teacher's Guide and PowerPoint Presentation are the frosting and filling for this excellent cake!

It often seemed to me to be a recitation of facts collected elsewhere and while the authors warnings and recommendations are extraordinary considering when the book was written. It comes off flat and uninteresting.For those less informed on the subject it's highly recommened for those looking for even deeper information I don't recommend it.Additionally the book does little to actually discuss the origins of terrorism as the title indicates. It is more about the possabilities today and the cross breeding of narco-crime and terrorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"An increasingly relevant warning of the dangers to come","review":"A Faceless Enemy first appeared in 1998, predicting high-impact terrorist attacks on America in the near future and even pinpointing the potentials of anthrax as a mail device.

A simple sentence is included on each page describing the photo or explaining something about pilots. My almost-4-year-old found this book in the store and asked for it. We read it every night now.I like the fact that female pilots are shown. The photos show current aircraft and include commercial jets, fighter jets, helicopters, sea planes, and more.

But if you are expecting a CD with 24 different songs, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Combination..","review":"Great Bebop combination..Everybody knows how incredible Charlie Parker sounds in his solo album, and how Dizzy Gilespie sounds in his album.

The CD runs about 45 minutes, but only the first six songs are the complete studio recording as it was meant to be heard. On song seven (as you can see), you begin to hear different variations of the first six songs. Songs seven through thirteen are complete, and then the remainder are just second-long blips -- false starts, some conversation (which can be interesting), and various beginnings that they experimented with. The longest of these is about 50 seconds, and many are only 12 to 14 seconds -- the majority of the CD is, of course, the first 13 complete songs. So, the CD has a very complete feeling from the start, yes, but be aware how it trails off. You buy the CD for the first six songs and the next variations on those songs, though. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GREATEST BOOK OF ALL TIME!!!!!!","review":"Now that I've got your attention.Alan Paton's view on the world is so completely unrealistic that the plot of this so called \\"classic\\" is totally unbelievable. The characters are cold and you really don't care what happens to them. The lead character, Pieter van Vlanderan, is nothing but a stereotype. The big strong football player, smart, handsome, everybody likes him, but when he makes one mistake the entire world turns on him. Right! I can't believe anyone in their right mind could actually pick up this book and read it of their own accord. I understand that it is a critcal piece on the injustice of aparthide, but other than that the book has absolutely no merit. The only reason to read it is as a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energy some, weight loss? UNLIKELY.

It was very difficult to force myself to swallow the half dose I started with (from experience I know to start with half or LESS of any diet supplement because I am very sensitive to their contents and have actually stayed up 24 hours straight and cleaned the house at warp speed) and to be honest I didn't feel anything much other than a little \\"loopy\\" or airheaded/forgetful/oblivious in an upbeat way...

However, the spirals are awful and I will never order them again. They just plain fall apart, no matter how they are cooked.

Phoenix does an above average job as Jack, a rookie fireman in Baltimore. His girfriend, wife and mother of his kids is underplayed and I thought that Jacinda Barrett could have been given more to work with. Yet this is a post 911 paean to those men and women who rush into burning buildings to save our butts and in that regard, not much else is needed.Travolta does an as usual excellent job, knowing his place. Like Gere in 'Unfaithful' the story is not about him and he never oversteps his bounds. He's like an ancient soothsayer, making sense of all the chaos.I especially like the \\"For the Love of The Game\\" style of telling a present tense story with fairly (when done well) seamless flashbacks.

Ater 9/11, I honestly thought the director would try to gloss up firefighting and veer away from the hard realities, sacrifices and sheer courage required by those men who choose to stay the course, day in and day out.Instead, this movie had integrity, heart and, just as importantly, a riveting story. Told from the perspective of a rookie firefigher and his captain, it careened from one exciting moment to the next but also showed the toll firefighting can take on marriages and personal lives. I was often moved to tears and the teenagers who saw it with me were riveted and inspired. We need more movies like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful!","review":"Loved it! Loved it!

What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Go-To","review":"Now, I'm not a New York Times best-selling author (the only thing I've written that approximated publication quality was a master's thesis), but every time I start a fiction piece, I consult Lukeman. To put in bluntly, he tells aspiring writers how not to stink at their craft. The book does assume that you have at least written something that you can apply his principles to, so the first thing to do would be to put pen to paper; even so, some of the ideas can inspire you to get writing again--or to keep going. Lukeman has evidently edited for some high-power literary authors, and has also watched a lot of movies and read a lot of books. Most of his references will at least be familiar to readers. Anyway, even if they're not, you can easily get the point. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife's sister-in-law, who enjoys writing. That's how much I believe in it: I put my money where my mouth is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I got so caught up in Lukeman's exercises for Inner and Outer Characterizations that I had to actually force myself to put the book (and my rather extensive but still unfinished profile for a protagonist in my story) and WRITE.Even though I'm writing a \\"fan-fiction\\" based on a TV show, the story I am crafting puts the character in a far more complicated situation than the show had really allowed for. As such, I found I needed to delve deeper, deducing some character traits from what was presented in the show, and creating the rest in harmony with that.I had no idea how to do that, or how deeply some traits would matter, until I came across this book as a resource listed on Suite101.com's online class for writing mysteries.As a result, if I ever finish this story, my protagonists will be richly dealt with. Thank you, Noah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Plot Thickens, the writing improves","review":"Lukeman promises in the introduction that by the end of the book, readers (writers) will take away plenty of new ideas and inspiration. At first I was skeptical, but ultimately he's right. The topics he covers are themselves nothing new, for they are basic fundamentals, but the depth to which Lukeman plunges into each area makes the book an excellent reference. The amount of questions he compels you to ask of your own work is astounding, which leads you to deepen and broaden your writing. If you are well into your own project, it would be wise to stop and explore your work through the exercises he offers at the end of each chapter. The chapters on Characterization are especially good. If you don't have much material written, don't worry... this knowledge can be used going forward, so that you are saved some revising time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Advice For the Brave and Hardworking","review":"First of all, disregard all the whiners. Getting published in this era is immensely difficult when you learn that agents reject 98% of the completed novels they encounter. To succeed as a writer, you will need--in my opinion:The First Five Pagesthis one\\"Techniques of the Selling Writer\\" by Dwight Swainand a dozen others. You will need to remove any reason an agent or publisher has to reject your work--and this book will help you achieve that goal.Some of the suspense stuff I have never seen gathered in one place. Another great resource is the books that accompany the \\"Dramatica\\" series (Dramatica.com). In short, there is no magic bullet but anybody who discounts this or any other book is oversimplifying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for writers no matter where you are in the process","review":"Good for beginning a story or editing it after you've finished writing it. There is a strong focus on developing characters even though the book title implies it would be plot. The author tends to jump from using techniques that you might use before even starting to write to something you might use after you've finished and are editing to something you'd use to move along as you're writing. Thus you can't use it as a straight follow the steps kind of book but it does give the book flexibility. I'm adding this one to my personal library. Overall I give it gets an A from the StuPage Reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a good thing?","review":"I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners Only","review":"If you have written anything at all, indeed, if you have read anything at all, this book will not make you a better, more knowledgeable fiction writer. The author certainly seems to assume the reader has almost no knowledge of fiction as most of his references are to films. Likewise, his discussions of fictional technique are shallow: in a discussion of the need for a character to change, he offers as an example \\"the rebellious son realizes his mother has always been good and kind to him.\\" He assumes that a reader of fiction won't sit still for an unreliable narrator (and uses as analogy the refusal of a movie viewer to tolerate an out of focus shot).Perhaps if you are absolutely new to fiction writing, the lists of characteristics in the first chapters will assist you. Otherwise, buy James Wood's How Fiction Works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chauvenist's plot tips","review":"I'm only on page 24 and I'm put off by the guy's misogynist attitude. \\"I use 'he' predominantly and 'she' in instances where the facet is particular to a woman.\\" Okay, so I'll just pretend most fictional characters are male...? So then he reverts to \\"she\\" when he discusses a character's \\"grooming\\" and \\"body language\\". Or \\"Romance: Does the ex-wife want to get back at her former husband?... Is she a prostitute trying to change her ways?\\" Boy, female characters sure are pathetic. It's subtle, but I can't help feeling he doesn't think highly of women, fictional or otherwise. I do like his idea that character begets plot, so I'll finish the book, but I'm disgusted and skimming it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust spots after first wash!

These were washed in a two year old Fisher & Paykel dishwasher with powder detergent arranged as specified in the manufacturer's care instructions. I spent over an hour using stainless polish to try to remove the spots (it is impossible to remove them completely) and then rewashed only to have the exact same result. These went back pronto!

For example, he demonstrates the Carpa, the tent, in which both partners lean against each other, in a 40 degree angle. This is very difficult for most tango dancers, as the preferred method is for the male to support the female, as she leans forward. \\"The Sandwich\\" is another example of a very difficult way to do a simple step.

I would buy from this seller again --thanks !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Felt Cheated","review":"I waited so long for this book to be released. Called the local Christian bookstore on the day of its release (October 20 -- even wrote it on my calendar!) Did something I never do -- paid FULL PRICE. Brought it home, opened it, and almost fell over. I had paid nearly $27 for a book that had 4-inch margins, and was quadruple-spaced.This isn't a full-length book -- and to charge that amount for such a padded effort is, well, sinful! Like the other reviewers, I love Mitford, but I don't love such chicanery. Shame on you, Jan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And they'll abide a little longer if it's a book they await","review":"Karon's latest book achieves the length of a novel only through the grace of wide margins and generous line spacing; its content would barely sustain a short story. A long-time Mitford series fan, I was severely disappointed in this latest installment: Karon presents us with nothing more than a vague, breezy update on some of the village's inhabitants - no depth of character or emotion; no real turmoil or triumph; no spiritual insight or inspiration. And precious little plot to boot. The book gives new meaning to the phrase \\"painted with a broad brush;\\" indeed, Karon seems to have employed a roller. If you're a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kind of book that makes you say \\"wow!\\"","review":"I listened to this book in April when skies were clear and the California temperatures were mild. Shepherds Abiding took me right into cold and frosty Mitford, smack into the lives of the flawed and fabulous people who live there. The image of the rugged Mitford males having lunch at the local tea shop was hilarious. My favorite part was Uncle Billy's relationship with his difficult wife Rose as she waited for her \\"Santy Claus\\" to visit. I laughed, I teared up and most of all, I felt lifted up by this lovely work. It doesn't have to be Christmas to appreciate Jan Karon's wonderful gift in Shepherds Abiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The first review described my feelings exactly. There is no plot in this book and very little substance. And I was very very bored by the end. Painting shepherds is not a compelling enough plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 and 1/2 stars. A better story than I first gave it credit for.","review":"I am editing this as of 12/26/08 & could not manage to change the stars to reflect it but my first impression has changed. In a couple of Ms. Karon's other efforts she has produced small short stories and sold them as such to those who will buy anything with the word MITFORD on it. And so when this came out I was quick to cry foul as it runs far shorter than I would have liked. As I love recorded books I got it from the library as an audio and as always John McDonough did an outstanding job. Now that time has passed I listened agian and the story was more satisfying. And the part with Fr. Tim & Co. in The Tea Shop ordering lunch was a howl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shortchanged","review":"Shepherds Abiding is a short story masquerading as a full-lengthnovel. Jan Karon seems to have already said all she has to say in her previous Mitford books, and is now just trying to satisfy her publisher by filling a niche in the Christmas market."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh","review":"Wholesome, sure.

Thanks, Jan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitford book #8 disappointing","review":"Loved the first seven Mitford books, but this one did not have much substance. Almost seemed like Karon threw this one together in a hurry. She is usually a wonderful writer but this one was different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Uplifting Christmas Story","review":"Charming, uplifting tale that centers life in a small town around the true Christmas story - the manifestations of God's gift of love and giving. No magic cats, no tacky love story, no shopping 'til you drop - just the simplicity of the real thing. If you want that, you'll love this book!! An old, seemingly hopeless nativity set is restored and in the process, Father Tim discovers the creativity he never thought he had. BTW reading the book is wonderful, but there is something 'extra' that happens when you listen to it! Have no fear, the audio version includes Esther's recipe as well as a few inspirational snippets of Christmas music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Wonderful","review":"Again Jan Karon does a terrific job. I probably enjoyed this book even more than the others and that is hard to believe. They bring me peace and comfort. I have read all of them over and over and try hard to pattern my life and my thoughts after Father Tim & Cynthia. I really hope that she will write more on Father Tim instead of what I hear is the last of the series coming out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, and \\"meatier\\" than I had expected","review":"I had feared that this latest addition to the Mitford series would be another lightweight story like \\"A Common Life\\" (which I enjoyed, but which was really little more than a lengthy short story about Father Tim's & Cythia's wedding.)Although this book isn't the eagerly-awaited next full-length novel in the series, it is more than just a one-note Christmas story like \\"Esther's Gift.\\" Several of the secondary characters like Hope Winchester and Lew Boyd have their stories fleshed out and carried forward quite a bit. There are also some other subplots involving beloved characters like the Moseleys and Uncle Billy, so that the primary story of Father Tim and his nativity set isn't the only thing going on. All in all, although I'm still anxiously awaiting the next \\"real\\" novel in the series, this was a pleasant surprise and worth the price (especially at the discounted rate!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Quick Mitford Boost","review":"This was shorter than I would have liked but the familiar characters and warm Christmas feeling left by this book was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and uplifting story","review":"This was easy reading and enjoyable, but there really wasn't a story plot. Would have liked to know who made the manger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Love","review":"The Mitford series offer the reader an opportunity to learn what love can be like, especially important to those who came from dysfunctional families. Karon offers suggestions to women in the character of Cynthia; and a reality glimpse to men of possible relationship between man and woman.These are the books one can read over and over, and still learn something, while being entertained simultaneously! What a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go to Mitford","review":"This Christmas story doesn't really advance the story lines in the Mitford books much, but is instead a quiet side trip for the holidays. I love the characters in this series and their quirky adventures, and this book showcases the quiet way they love and serve each other and make Christmas a special time. Father Tim finds an antique Nativity set and decides to restore it as a surprise for Cynthia. The book recounts his journey as he learns to do the restoration work and then learns the joy of creativity and working with his hands. A nice time-out in the Christmas season to remember the reason for the holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novelist","review":"I have enjoyed all the writings of Jan Karon. Very inspiring writer and beautifully illustrated works. I will probably purchase more of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK story but the style could use some work","review":"This story jumps around telling spurts of different people's lives. All of these people live in the same town, but there are so many people that it's difficult to keep track of all of them. Often when a scene changes, the author starts with \\"He\\" or \\"She\\" so the reader doesn't know which one of the many characters is being presented. The author also likes to start these scene changes other ways that are kind of secretive. Although this method is a tactic that can be used to add mystery, intrigue and to draw the reader in, when it is used so frequently throughout a story, it instead is apt to cause confusion and make the reader feel off balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"chalk another one up for Jan karon","review":"All of Jan Karon's books are great!

Happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TREAT!!","review":"As a Jan Karon fan, I was delighted by this bonus of a book since I had heard there was to be just one more book in the series. It is longer than the previous Christmas books and shorter than some of the earlier books in the series. There illustrations on the insides of the covers are lovely.The book does assume that you know most of the characters from previous books, but it is a heart-warming story with a surprising addition to Father Tiom's usual activites. Certainly, we would be challenged & improved by trying such a complicated project in later life.A great story to read with holiday music in the background after a chaleenging day of Christmas chores. It is a great way to center on the real message of Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visit with a favorite set of characters and fictional town","review":"There is no way to compare this latest Karon trip to Mitford to her earlier series. Although of a rather nice size, this is strictly a visit with the beloved retired rector and his wife and the aging community that is so familiar to Mitford fans. I did not expect this volume to end up making a startling set of plot outcomes, and it didn't, but I found the whole read comforting. It was good to go back home to Mitford and follow the seasonal advance on Christmas with surprise presents being prepared for giving.I am glad that I bought this volume: a relaxing, restful, reassuring interval in other reading. I recommend it to those devoted to Karon's wonderful characters. You will certainly laugh and smile and rejoice in the down-to-earth experiences with all the good folk in Karon's fictional town.This book is Karon's Christmas card to her fans. So lovely and happily received!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best book...","review":"I have loved all of Jan Karon's previous books. Have read some twice even. I looked forward to meeting my favorite characters again. I am not sure how to describe this very short book. I always have told my kids the teacher will notice huge fonts and generous double spacing. We have noticed Jan! Also, I never did get a feel for the story even though it started out in a familiar way, then boom! on to the next story. Please for the new readers, do not start with this book. It will not make any sense to you. Read the series from the start. Buy the series even, but borrow this from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am terribly disappointed by Shepherds Abiding. Maybe my expectations were too high. I was expecting a novel in the series and got another like The Common Life. But even more so, the writing was not at all up to Ms Karon's standards. There were throwaway references to the usual cast of characters. The description of a big event in the lives of two of the minor characters had no life to it, and Percy and Velma's retirement seemed flat. There was no verve to this book, and I'm surprised at Ms Karon. I wish I hadn't bougtht the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed that this was disappointing!","review":"I love Mitford.I love Jan Karon's writing. I love every one of the characters in the town she has created. But I didn't love this book - and that's disappointing. I was looking forward to another few hours in the company of Mitford happenings, and found, instead, a brief coffee break. For true Mitford fans, that just isn't enough. I hope that the last book in the series will be full, and complete, and engrwossing, and satisfying. Anything less than that just doesn't do the town - or the characters - justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short story dressed up like a novel","review":"As with most of the other reviewers, I LOVE the Mitford series! This one, however, felt like a shoddy attempt at getting a product on the market in time for the holidays. The publishers should have removed the excessive white space (wide margins and large line spacing) and sold it as a short story.Were it sold as a short story, I would have given it four stars instead of one. As it is, I was left feeling cheated and disappointed.I can't wait for Jan Karon's next real novel. I trust that the next one will feel like the earlier books in the series, and will wrap up the story for us. Hopefully she will give her readers what they are so hungry for.... character development, a rich plot, and information on what Dooley and Lace make of their lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something bad has happened to this once-good series","review":"I came across this and thought, \\"Finally! A new Mitford book.\\" And I wondered how I'd missed it. Once I got the book in hand, I realized I had not missed anything. This is not a new Mitford novel but a little story with some other previously published stuff thrown in. It's a big disappointment. I was so annoyed to realize that I'd paid a book price for a little story that I didn't even enjoy the story itself. It isn't the money, actually. It's that I was all set to relax and be drawn into Mitford again for a nice long visit. This short story sent me packing far too soon. Someone needs to let this author know that her readers are waiting for another REAL Mitford book.

The navy color is nice and the tan stitching prevents it from just looking like a blob of color on my head. However, after owning the hat for a month or so, the color is fading horribly and unevenly. There is a big blog of faded color on the font to where it almost looks like something spilled on it. I can guarantee you that I spilled nothing on it. Other parts of it are fading as well. For the price of this hat, the color should have held up longer than a month. It the color didn't fade in such a blotchy way, I would definitely rate this hat higher. But as it is now, I'll probably only wear it while doing chores in the yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Good Hat","review":"It's a hat. You put it on your head to cover up your hair, block the sun, keep the rain out of your eyes, or just wear cause it looks good. That's what this hat does. Since it does those thing quite well, I am very satisfied with this product. It fits nicely and I like the color scheme (\\"used\\" black/ some kind of beige/gray).

Theimportant thing is what 47 times 83 is good for, such as the area of arectangle 47 cm by 83 cm, the cost of 47 items that cost $83 each, andso on. Calculation is by far the LEAST important part of mathematics.When this book was written we didn't have calculators, so maybe it wasmore important then for people to be able to do complicatedcomputations like this accurately in their head or with paper andpencil.

Anesthesia has also changed a lot in the past 8 years since this book was published.

Henci Goer summarizes current literature in an easy-to-understand manner, presents the options with pros and cons on both sides.I did not find the book biased - but it does assume that you are willing to take an active role in making your birth decisions.

I went to the library looking to find an unbiased guide of what to expect during the birth of my child, and instead came back with a very anti-medical diatribe that tells women why they should NOT have certain procedures. I wanted to be able to read about what to expect, and then MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF. I question why this book was titled \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide\\" now, as it really gives you nothing to think about as much as it bestows guilt.Goer fails to play devil's advocate on the side of obstetrics, again and again stating that there are no \\"pros\\" to some procedures and tests. Oddly enough, the blurb on the book's back cover reads \\"But when it comes to one of the most important decisions of your life - how you will give birth - it is hard to garther accurate, unbiased information.\\" Interesting how Goer falls into the trap of bias herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, negative tone","review":"I didn't enjoy this book at all. I thought it had great information, but it was conveyed in such a negative light.

The information provided will help you make informed decisions in the labor and delivery suite, helping you feel more in control.This is NOT a basic \\"What to Expect at Your Baby's Birth\\" book. This book is for you if you want to have as natural a birth as possible, and don't want potentially unnecessary interventions done by the OB staff in the hospital. The information could be overwhelming (there are so many things that can happen) to someone terrified of the whole birth experience, and this book is not a good first book about delivery. If you're fairly comfortable in medical situations and want to be informed, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must have for any woman planning a pregnancy!","review":"This book is extremely informative in all aspects of pregnancy and delivery. The book is based on research, rather than mainstream \\"doctor\\" culture, as most others are (i.e., What to Expect When You're Expecting) and will give you straight facts about various procedures and how to best equip yourself for a safe birth. It has information in there that doctors won't tell you- risks of various procedures in particular. When I read this book after having a primary cesarian, I was disgusted at how my doctor had totally glossed over the risks associated with cesarian births, and had not even hinted at some of the risks that could affect my body for future pregnancies. It is the job of every woman to be informed when making choices for her own body and baby, and this book is a wonderful comprehensive guide to start a woman on the path of the informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Years Out of Date!","review":"This book touts being up to date with research and current information regarding the issues facing those of us delivering in today's hospitals or other settings.

She clearly explains why some of the most commonly practiced interventions in childbirth are not based in research.Henci Goer has also written a great book for birth professionals, and the best part of both books is that, including her own opinions, she puts her research skills where her mouth is. You don't have to be a medical researcher to get through this book because she has put the information into convenient summaries. You can hear a bit of frustration in her tone while reading the book, but that is because so many OB practitioners keep practicing in ways that are clearly opposite to what the medical researchers have shown is beneficial to pregnant and laboring women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Anti-Hospital Agenda","review":"I had been recommended this book to educate myself on what type of practices I might expect at the hospital. I think most pregnant women already hope to minimize the amount of intervention during labor and delivery without all the scare tactics of this book.Some bits of information were indeed helpful, and will arm the reader with questions for their medical provider on why certain options should or should not be employed (episiotomy, epidural, etc.) However, the tone is the book is so shrill and stridently anti-hospital that you come away with the impression that if the only safe and \\"right\\" way pregnant woman should give birth is to do a home delivery with a midwife. Frankly, that's limiting a woman's choices rather than empowering her to make decisions.Instead, I recommend people read Birthing From Within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one point of view","review":"With a title like \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide\\" I was expecting a balanced discussion about the pros and cons of typical medical ans non-medical interventions during childbirth. Instead it was a completely one sided criticism of all medical interventions. The basic message is all medical intervention is bad and you should fight with your OB/GYN to not have an IV, pain medication, ultrasounds or any medical testing since they are all dangerous and your OB is only performing these tests to make money, avoid litigation and because they are part of medical dogma.I was very dissapointed and I hope her point of view is a minority among doulas. I agree there are unnessesary medical interventions and that childbirth is a natural event, not a medical one, but I have a hard time believing that basically all OB/GYNs number one priority is making money and following trends rather than making sound, evidence based and safe decisions for a woman and her baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extreem portrait of American doctors","review":"While the facts maybe true, I felt there is no need to portray the situation in black-and-white (Doctors are bad, home birth is good).

The author is much too eager to heap blame and criticism upon the medical profession. (For those curious: I am neither a doctor nor a man. I am a woman outside the medical profession, expecting my second child.) Although I read this book for the alternate viewpoint, it ultimately served to confirm my instinctive suspicions about today's birthing crusaders and the use of doulas. I had a positive experience birthing my first child in a hospital with my husband at my side and without a bunch of extraordinary demands and conditions, and look forward to a similiarly positive experience with my second child. My doctor (a male who graduated medical school in the '60s, for anyone wondering) is sensitive to my concerns, is aware of and makes use of the most modern approaches to childbirth, and is someone with whom I feel comfortable and whom I would trust with my life.

I still don't feel that I can totally explain the \\"why\\" behind my choice.That said, it was still a very good book. I thought it did do a good job of laying out the case for why the doctors and hospitals respond they way they do.The book brought up many techniques routinely used in hospitals that I hadn't thought of our encountered in other reading as well.I thought this book was also very helpful for me in preparing to talk to my doctor.

This author considers a \\"thinking woman\\" to be one that wants a natural, unmedicated childbirth, attended by a midwife, at a birthing center or at home. If this is you, you can be assured that this book backs your stance and provides scary statistics to make you believe that birthing in a hospital with an OB is an irresponsible and dangerous choice at best. Although my plan for my birth experience was an \\"all natural\\" one and I can agree with this author's bias, I find the way she wrote this book, that I can't take it seriously and have actually returned it.

At the end of the day, I have to be open to the possibility of cesarean if it is required and would like to remain positive about that. Reading this book left me disappointed if I was to have a C Section. Don't waste your money or time with this book.

Her opening argument that obstetrician-gynecologists are \\"trained to view pregnant and laboring women as a series of potential problems\\" is frankly BS. She lost all credibility in her opening paragraphs. Her supposed knowledge about the medical literature is laughable.

Also, the author, while passionate, is really quite biased against established hospital proceedures. I agreed with her almost unilaterally, but found myself dismissing her more radical opinions as I would those of an unyielding aunt. I recommend this book nevertheless.

I don't believe doctors tell women in enough detail what the risks or benefits are of any procedure or intervention.

Being an unabashed Dick Francis fan, and having read all his novels, I haven't come across a better description of a race than this. In the opening pages where Admiral comes close to winning the race but comes a cropper with his owner and rider getting killed is simply incredible: the thundering horses, the challenges of the course itself, and the early morning mist, with the tension and the atmosphere, with the climax hitting you with the impact of a sledgehammer all make this my favorite passage in all of Dick Francis.

It's a lot less hokey than you might expect, mostly due to Paul Douglas' performance as the crusty manager, who'd just as soon stay crusty -- until he gets hit upside the head by an angel with an attitude. Janet Leigh does her usual excellent job -- she's a cute and feisty \\"Hints from Heloise\\" type reporter who wanders into the all-male world of 1950s baseball reporting. The little girl who sees the angels is somehow really endearing without being over the top (maybe because Disney didn't make this version - the old MGM did). It's an enjoyable little story with more than a few laughs -- and probably a must see for true lovers of baseball."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth wathing or renting","review":"a movie that trumps todays movies.

It's... cute (for the lack of a better word). One thing I really liked about it, was that it came with the patch cables and the power supply.

Going back to the original Star Trek game for the Nintendo 1!This is by far the stupidest game ever designed. The training course alone is enough to drive you insane.The visuals are not stunning. The game play is pretty lame. And you can't even skip the cut scenes! Almost 90% of PS2 games allow you to skip cut scenes if you want to go on with the game. Plus it takes like two minutes to load the Main menu! Its billed as shoot em up, but you view it from a semi bird's eye view.My purchase was an impulse buy. If you are reading this stay the hell away from this game.I think that the design company went extremely cheap with this game as if though it was designed by 15 year old high school students or something.

Which the basic concept of the game is a good one, the implementation is just so poor that it isn't even worth $15.

My PS2 will not read the disc at all, but reads all other blue CD's just fine. Many others have had the same problem. Bethesda tech support tells you to turn your PS2 on its side, or upside down to get it to work. If that fails, they tell you to keep swapping the game out until you get one to work. Don't take my word for it though, check out their forums: [....]All this is not worth it for the horrible reviews the game gets when it does work.

You will have to suffer through the missions to do so, however. Most of them are far from fun. In particular, the first series of missions is extermely unfun. Finishing the missions is very unrewarding.

You start from the enterprise era, and work your way through the show, and at the very end you play the sovereign era. For 2 player, you can do head to head, battlefest, which you select 3 ships from a pre-arranged group and select the enemies ships, then battle it out through all three ships. You can also do an onslaught where you face off against all the ships in the game in increasing waves. For arenas, it was very colorful, and had a wide variety of planets and nebulas. The ship combat was very well designed, you can play a huge variety of federation, klingon, romulan, xindi, dominion, cardassian, and even borg ships in two player. The narration by william shatner (captain kirk) was a nice bonus to the gameplay. All together, it was a very well put together game, and even though it was a arcade style shoot em' up, it gave a nice storyline with a great finsish at the last mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be good if I could play this","review":"I actually purchased this twice and had to return it twice.

My first impressions are pretty good. The graphics are good for a PS2 game. The music is very well done and gives you the Star Trek feel. The game spans the 40 years of Star Trek and it includes all the TV shows of Trek. The game is narrated by non other than William Shatner. The episode mode starts off in the Enterprise era where you have to take the ship on training missions before you proceed in the game. The further you go along in the game, the more ships and arenas (ie DS9 backdrop, Jupiter Station scene) from other shows you unlock. There is also a skirmish mode where you can fight one on one with the computer or another player. This is an arcade style shoot em up game which can be challenging at times.

The sound is heavily compressed, with very little dynamic contrast. The picture quality is poor (barely TV-broadcast quality) and betrays its age. Camera-work is directed by Karajan himself, and is distracting in its choice of how much of the orchestra to reveal at a given time, and also makes use of odd, changing-color backlighting. The performance is stodgy, and too heavy for its own good, and the orchestral playing is sluggish and uninspired. Because the production centers around trying to emphasize Karajan's mastery in a mock-heroic way, the juxtaposition between the posturing and the performance is laughable. Truly a waste of my money for this contrived performance of Berlioz. I will stick to my audio recording of the Cleveland Orchestra with Boulez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Moon...

Also from my Japanese motorcycle experience NGK was always far superior in performance and durability to any other brand I attempted to use. In reading about NGK spark plugs in Mazda vehicles like mine and using NGK in the past, my opinion is the G power NGK spark plug line seems the best balance of performance-quality for the least amount of money that NGK offers as of 2007. Finally shipping thru Amazon was NOT as prompt as other online retailers I have used for parts, arrived 3 days latter than another online parts retailer I have used, the shipping was \\"ground 3-5 days\\".

I first showed her how to field dress a deer with this knife. It worked so well that I bought two more - one for myself and one as a spare in case something happens to one of ours. I have field dressed many deer and this knife far outperforms any other knife I have ever used. It comes from the factory extremely sharp and stays sharp. The molded non slip handle fits your hand well and will not slip when wet. I would highly recommend this knife to anyone that would like to use the finest hunting knife made.

Coleman Hawkins, the father of the tenor, steps up to the mike on 'It Never Entered my Mind' and outplays the greatest balladeer in jazz history. It's a thrilling solo. Ben is, of course, glorious, the rhythm section is blue-chip (the Peterson trio plus drums), and the interplay between the two horns (especially the gorgeous unison melody playing on 'La Rosita') is breathtaking. Mainstream jazz at its finest, and an essential purchase for any jazz -- any music -- lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of jazz's rare moments","review":"This record is magnificent, it has something which most contemporary jazz lacks heavily - an atmosphere. It captures the distinction between possesing a virtuous technique(which several master) and possessing a virtuous ability to play an instrument in an intimate way(which is for the few). Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins had that gift, they felt the joy, the endearment, the pain and the wonder of life, and they let it out through their music. This was the first Jazz record I simply had to get. I have had many beautiful moments in company with it since, and many more sure is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Received my product in less than a week.

I'm a new puppy owner, and found much in here frustrating -- she doesn't talk much about crate training, for instance, because it makes her cry to see a dog in a cage, so she suggests you just tie your pup to yourself all day. Do yourself a favor: the information in How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live With is far more helpful and complete, and the writing in The Art of Raising a Puppy is far more readable and enlightening. I can't vouch for the other puppy books, but the two books I mentioned are worth your time and money; this one is, well, for dummies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"I always approach the 'Dummies' series of books with some trepidation since I always expect them to be shallow and short on detail.

The most useful part is certainly about housetraining and then the stuff about properly looking after it so that it doesn't get instilled in bad habits.I'm sure there are many other books on how to look after puppies.

You know... maybe some effective tips that will allow me more sleep at night without sacrificing the puppy's bladder or my carpet.Unfortunately, there's nothing helpful or successful that I can report to you on any of those three topics.

Where has this singer been?? Her singing is superb and soothing -- just perfect for that candlelight dinner or that snuggle-up-to-me type moment. Legrand never ceases to amaze, and his earlier works with Lena Horne, Nancy Wilson (live!), and Stephan Grappelli are knockout performances.

I never seems to loose it balance and texture. I guess you could say that she has the voice of an ANGEL. It is one that will please most music fans.The only draw back to this cd was the song selection.

Why? Because he is the ONLYother person there except Shaggy, Fred, Wilma and Daphne!Just like in this movie. Three principal suspects just makesthis movie an episode of Scooby Doo - albeit with some swearing,blood and naked people.Cate is wonderful, but the film is wholly lacking in suspenseof any kind.

The real reson I wanted to see this was because of the way Keanu Reeves looked in it. When I watched it in the theaters I was so suprised to see Keanu do this. He plays an abusive husband in it, and is one of his best performances I've ever seen. The thing that strikes me as \\"odd\\" is that all the husbands and fathers are all abusive to they're children or wife. it's actually kind of stupid. But it is creepy and well done. Billy Bob Thornton could have done a better job in writing it though. Over all, you'd want to see this one and it is well done in several ways. My real high rating goes to Keanu Reeves's acting. No film has him acting as good as this. I'd guess that people who like well told and creepy stories would want to buy this one. Hats off to Keanu Reeves!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I own this disc for one reason....Cate!!!","review":"Im in love w/Cate Blanchett..their I said it. So thats why im foolish enough to purchase a film Im really not that fond of. She is gorgous in it and gives an amazing preformance. Those two things are about the only good things that can be said about this mediocre film.One look at the discs cover art(wich by the way isnt nearly as good as the films theatrical poster)and you are bombarded with images of a stellar cast. But unfortunately even a cast of this callaber cant overcome a prredictable plot, and heavy handed uninspired direction. Good preformances all around (especialy Keanu and Giavani) make the film bearable.

I didn't think he could pull off a villian role (even in \\"The Watcher\\" he never eally showed much of an evil side) but the first little...outburst effectively freaked me out.

It was suspensful and thrilling, and the horror angle to it was kept classy while it still managed to have me screaming.I saw this movie long before I knew who Giovanni Ribisi was, but as soon as I realized he was in it, I rewatched it and was amazed. Buddy Cole (played by Giovanni) is so well done that I couldn't think of him in any other role. It was amazing - as was Cate Blanchett's Annie, and, though I don't really like her, Hillary Swank's character.I can't believe this movie didn't gain millions of awards. It is so classy and well done, and the characters are so well developed! Shame on the Academy Awards for not devoting their lives to this movie! ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clairvoyance clue's","review":"I liked this movie alot, I've enjoyed Cate Blanchett in many movies, but this has to be my favorite movie with her. I could've done without Katie Holmes, and her less than accurate acting skills. Even though her part was small, she still managed to annoy me. It was a great streach for Keanu Reeves. He was surprisingly good for his role, his \\"hey bill, I am the one\\" bland facial expressions he always seems to use never showed. He had alot of charisma in this. My greatest surprise was of all was Giovanni Ribisi, arguably the star of the film. Even, Greg Kinnear in his twisted romantic role was great.

But it still has an original plot, and the cast is real good. Like I said above, look out for that fiddler scene. I really dont like this 5 star rating system, 4 is much better in my opinion where you can use 3 1/2 because that is how many I would give it out of 4.

Yes, The Gift was creepy, but it started slowly and took a hell of a time to get going. Maybe this was to build up the suspense, but it just made the movie drag and go on forever!In spite of this, all performances were good. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress, as is Katie Holmes who is finally breaking away from her Dawson's creek image. The real star of this movie though had to be Keanu Reeves. Granted he didn't have much screen time, but the time he did have he made good use of, giving one of his best and most realistic performances to date.However, even the performances by all the actors in this movie could not save it! Aside from a few creepy (not scary!) moments, it dragged and to be perfectly honest I was glad to get out of the cinema!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I really liked this movie and think is too underrated.

This album just confirms that assessment -- a crashing bore from note one. It's dull, pedantic, and extremely repetitive. A mismosh of wandering noodling that some may find sublime but I find aimless, trite and tedious. As for Charlie Haden -- maybe it's me, but I just don't see what's so great about this guy. He strikes me as a very average player. This isn't BAD music, it's just weak. Two over-rated musicians sleepwalking through uninspired compositions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low point","review":"Make no mistake - this is a dull album - both in terms of compositions and sound quality. I suppose all artists / musicians are prone to periods of creative inertia - and for Pat Metheny this is it. For Haden perhaps he has nothing to be excited about. Whatever the reasons, here we have 2 potentially good musician playing at being boring old men. Even live they failed to inspire. Sorry to all you rock solid fans. Personally, I have chosen to just by-pass this embarassment and get onto the next good album, which Matheny has delivered, thankfully - as the trio album. Now that IS a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This is an overall incredible album...

I just read Chapter 10 that has no less than sixteen examples of imagery intimating that black is evil - and oh, by the way, the one time white is used, it conveys a divine presence. One of the lines actually reads, \\"You are as ugly as your dark soul.\\" I guess that's why the film, Dress Code, satirically quipped, \\"What's wrong with a black soul?\\" I combed and combed to find any hint of satire or veiled social commentary, but there was none.

I went to my book club meeting anyway in hopes I would discover what I missed but still didn't find the book something I would not to others..

But it is an excellent read for teens as it deals so much with the social pressures children face and what that means to them as individuals. The relationship between the mother and father and the two different worlds they come from was the most interesting part of the story. And to see the way this affected the children.

I skipped through much of the cursing dialogue of the young boys he knew, but found it authentic compared to my own upbringing in rural Missouri and it revealed how different the regular mainstream \\"religious\\" kids were in contrast to the non-believers or those who had other religions.

The dialogue between the young boys in this novel is also good for some side-splitting laughs too! This is a great story about family ties, coming of age, and good versus evil steeped in the magic and folklore of the southwest. Any fans of Gabriel Garcia Marquez will love this one.

I think that since I live in New Mexico, and Rudolfo Anaya is a really acclaimed author of the state, we should \\"appreciate\\" this book.I'm sorry. I just can't do it. I can't see why this is a classic. I guess it was an okay book, but even so, I hated it. Not because it was necessarily bad.

Why anyone would want to read about a stupid little boy who follows an old con artist around 'curing' people with 'curses' that are probably nothing more than the flu is beyond me.

The rich descriptions and beautiful stories are what attracted me to the novel. Though I am unfamiliar with spanish, I did not find that to be distracting to the novel, but enhanced the culture that the novel was centered around. Antonio being torn between two worlds and wanting to make both of his parents happy was a theme that I thought many people could relate to. Several people have had to go through an experience of choosing between living their life as they want, or following the wishes and demands of their parents. Ultima became a great role model to not only Antonio, but any reader who might have gone through or going through an experience like that. But it was the myths and legends throughout the novel that proved to be my favorite part of the novel. These stories not only allowed me to look closely at a culture that I was unfamiliar with before, but also showed the richness of Anaya's descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Love his stories involving New Mexico history.

With influence from Ultima, who from the first time that they met, made a huge impact on Tony.

With heart thumping violence a tear jerking psychological battle between right and wrong, Tony becomes a MAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bless Me Altima","review":"I recommened this book for the reason that, it is about a little boy named Antonio Marez and he is six years old. The book is about how he struggles in life and his beleifes in God. For example, most of the people that he finaly gets close to ends up either leaving or dieing.

Rudolfo Anaya's portrayal of a young boy trying to choose the right path in life is quite amusing. I can honestly say that there are not many seven year old boys who are seriously thinking about choosing to be what their mother wants them to be, or choosing to be what their father wants them to be. Children think about playing in trees or in the dirt; not becoming a priest or a vaquero.The dreams that young Antonio experiences are closer to visions of the future, than real dreams. He sees himself and his brothers near the river. He also sees himself going with his brothers to a whore house. The boring and meaningless dreams get longer and longer as the book progresses.The action actually picks up in the book about fifteen pages from the end. This pointless book carries on for chapters at a time and I do not suggest reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very deep","review":"Bless me, Ultima is the story of a young boy who grows up in new Mexico and his experiences as told by him in first person.Antonio is the product of two contrasting families, the Lunas and the Marez.

The tale chronicles his experiances through school church and some difficult subjects that can be only taught by life.On the surface the book is has a great plot and array of characters, but this book is so much more than that. It conveys many ideas through hinting and Antonio's experiences. It touches on war, religion, westward expansion and many others.Get this book if you just wnat a good read or if you would like to probe a little deeper, either way you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"The waste of trees, \\"Bless Me Ultima\\"","review":"I read this book for school, and it totally (...). The plot was boring, and the book was full of death and despair. From the way that the author wrote the book, it sounded like he hated children. He gave them too complicated lives, and thoughts too profound for children. Although, this book did have some funny parts, they were very inapproiate. I would not recommend this book to anyone.The book involves Antonio's life from when Ultima comes to live with them, and ends when she dies.

It's the first book in about a year that has actually put tears in my eyes. True, at some points the narrative lags and one wonders why the scene is included, but as a large whole, the book has an amazing current of thought about religion and how certain goodness can just cut across it all, neither religious nor unreligious.

In truth, the involvement of the FBI is kind of irrelevant (you'll get a feeling it's just added upon).The real star here is Tony Leung (the other one, not the Infernal Affairs/Hero Tony Leung). His portrayal of a troubled Foreign Services officer is compelling, and his tortured performance really drives the movie.It's basically X-Files, mixed with an Eastern-style Seven and a temple massacre that predated Kill Bill, Double Vision is an enjoyable thriller with moody cinematography and excellent production values.The deliberate pacing is perfect for this type of genre. It builds up the creepiness factor, while fully realizing the conflicts of Tony Leung's character.Although the end is not as tight as the first 3/4s of the movie, Double Vision is a thriller worthy of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"good thing I had no expectations going in....","review":"So I bought this film soley on the fact that David Morse was involved. And though my love for David is great it was not enough to overcome the fact that this film is horrible. I found it slow and for a horror, I must have blinked when the scares were taking place for there were no chills to be had. The best scare was the worst moment in the film but I don't want to give anything away to those who might want to give it a try.

Adult or child? \\"Do you like being dead?\\" It's rather insulting and disrespectful to any Spirit. It's just plain a stupid remark to make.

I think I have more of a problem the way it was filmed more than anything. I think they could have just filmed it like a straight documentary instead of the Booth brothers trying to show what cool editors they were and putting in rock music and child actors that were for effect only. And I really could not take those two guys with the berets seriously at all. I mean, what was that all about? It was laughable. The actual video, audio, and photo evidence that they had really was only about 20 minutes' worth. The rest was filler. In a nutshell, I was not impressed. The photo evidence and EVP's were cool, the sequence in the tunnel in the basement was awesome, but there just wasn't enough of this type of footage.

The instructions make it sound as if any pet store would have a leopard frog tadpole and this is not the case. Finding one at an exotic pet store,we bought one and have enjoyed it for about 2 weeks. One night, \\"Polly\\" jumped out and got stuck between the habitat and the cover. The boys were crushed. In addition to our questioning how a full sized leopard frog would be content living in this habitat, the full extent of what we were getting into was a surprise as well. The frog feeding and life expectancy require more research than indicated. Our habitat also \\"leaked\\" if you got water between the insert and base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible experience","review":"We had problems with this habitat from the moment we started using it. It is flimsy, leaky, and it has a major design flaw--there is a gap between the plastic cover and the fake \\"terrain\\" the frog is supposed to crawl on. Initially this was just an inconvenience as the crickets we fed the frog fell in the gap. Then one morning my son was crushed to find his beloved frog, Hot Sauce, had fallen in the gap and was literally smashed flat.

It is realistic, surprising and sometimes shocking in its revelations of the inner feelings of the players during the early years of the Dallas Cowboys. It is written without taking sides; relating the men, their emotions and their relationships with fellow players in factual, graphic terms. You cannot read this and feel the same way you did before about America's Team. The only parts missing are the Cowboys who didn't want to tell their side such as \\"Dandy Don\\". These missing voices create a silence in the telling of the whole story. Still, one can relate to the events and emotions that shaped the Cowboys and that generation of Americans. 4.5 STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real North Dallas Forty","review":"This is the real story of North Dallas Forty.

It is not used as a platform for an egomaniacal sports critic to spout opinion. The story is told by the people that were there, in their own words.

Restored? No!","review":"I'm among those who find it a joy to watch enhanced cleaned up episodes of Trek on DVD. The question is: does anthing ever get overlooked in a 'restoration'? \\"The Menagerie Part I\\" proves that it does - though it might take a trekker to spot it.Recall the scene on Talos IV when Spock finds those blue musical wind leaves and tests them out by holding them? In the original version, you hear the sharp contrast as the loudest of the eerie vibrations disappear abruptly, and then come back (in synch with Spock clasping and releasing the leaves).All that is lost in the transfer to DVD. The \\"musical leaf\\" sound track has been beautifully dubbed on in full Dolby Surround - but with no break! Spock plays with the leaves to no effect; and the whole point of that little scene has been remastered out of existence!Did anyone else notice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor follow up to the Cage","review":"The idea of enveloping the first, unused Star Trek pilot \\"The Cage\\" with new footage (having the pilot act as a \\"flashback\\") was an interesting, but it did not work out well. The Cage was an excellent telefilm, needing no enveloping really, but the producers obviously felt otherwise. The enveloping story is full of plot holes and, quite plainly, not very good. Spock acts illogically and irrationally for a reason that just doesn't cut it (surely he could have found another way to help his Captain without mutiny). This is a bad episode. The episode it trys to present, \\"The Cage\\", is alot stronger when presented without the enveloping scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek-The Original Series, Vol. 8,Episode 16: The Menage","review":"So far the only things I have found lacking in these DVD's is the lack of extras to include Spanish/French subtitles and dubbing as well as extra info about the shooting of the individual episodes such as unseen footage etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look into The Secret Service of the Confederate States in Europe","review":"This book takes us on a journey into an almost unknown side of the American Civil War. While historians have argued over which great land battle was the so called \\"high water mark of the Confederacy\\", the author makes it obvious that events taking place on the high seas and in the halls of European power had a greater impact on the outcome of America's bloodiest war.The late historian Shelby Foote stated that you can't understand American history without understanding the Civil War. I would add that you can't understand the Civil War without understanding the naval and international aspects of that conflict. This book is the best on that subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good contemporary suspense book","review":"A missing husband, honor among friends, and a romance on the side. This is what you'll find when you pick up Blind Faith. Kelly Robolo, a journalist, helps her friend Victoria try to find her missing husband. Nick McBride, a cop and acquaintance of Kelly's, gets involved also. Shady characters are present and you don't know who to believe is telling the truth.Among other things, I enjoyed this book because Kelly is strong, independent and thought for herself. It is a little slow in some areas but don't be deterred, you'll enjoy the book if you like a contemporary suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed!!","review":"I love reading novels by Christiane Heggan. Ms. Heggan is a very creative/wonderful writer and I've read nearly all of her novels which are each filled with a lot of mystery, suspense and intrigue. Blind Faith was a good reading experience and one I don't think you'd want to miss. There's a lot of action and suspense and you'll be guessing until the end whodunit. The characters are simply excellent. Investigative reporter Kelly Robolo and Detective Nick McBride do set the pages ablaze as the plot untangles. The story is enjoyable and I think you'll catch the feeling of excitement as I did. If you haven't read one of Ms. Heggan's novels, try one - you just might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration PLUS!","review":"I got this book for my birthday nearly three years ago.

The book features not only the authors work so it appeals to many tastes. This isn't just a great starter it's good even when you know what you're doing - you can refer back to it all the time or just look at if for insipration.

We even had to use some tape on it to hold it together as the glass otherwise kept coming out of the frame. The concept is fine. It looks very good up on the wall with my own art work in it. The floating aspect and the black of the frame are very dramatic. But this design needs to go back to the manufacturer's drawing board for modification. Hubby, the mechanical one in this family, even had trouble putting the art inside and then putting it together. That is virtually unheard of in our house. Other manufacturers ready made frames sold on the internet as a whole generally have a better craftsmanship level.

The ridiculous story line has little to do with Stephen Foster's actual life and depicts him as a dull-witted, love-smitten nincompoop. Moreover, given the culture of today, the minstrel show sequences should make most viewers feel uncomfortable. However, the Stephen Foster music is great and Ray Middleton carries the movie.

It kind of The Bad Seed times three, but made cheaper than a Roger Corman movie. These kids were no more blood thirsty than what you would find at your local young Republican meeting. The only moment the film delivered even the slightest amount of a chill is when the film's heroine sharpens hedge shears on bench grinder without wearing safety glasses. Not that the whole film was a bore, there was Julie Brown in her prime performing an entertaining striptease.

Not impressed, it's not scary and it's not funny, it's stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring -- NOT a horror film","review":"How is this a horror film? Some evil kids kill people. That could be suspense or crime drama, but not necessarily horror.There's no gore. No enigmatic super-psycho, like Michael Myers. We see the kids from the start, and they're not too impressive. They're bland in their demeanor. Uninteresting.The film is slow-moving. One kid locks another in a refrigerator. He later shoots a teacher. It's a surprisingly dull movie for such events. I'm not sure why, but it bored me.The DVD says widescreen, but I'm not sure. It looks just barely widescreen, in that there's a thin black line along the top and bottom of the screen. It looks as if someone cropped a full screen image to create a bogus widescreen look. Maybe not, but maybe yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Birthday Review","review":"Saw this on TCM late at night. They actually show boobies in one quick scene.

Fun movie for Haloween, if your kids are old enough to not be shocked at seeing one quick boobies scene. What scarey movie doesn't show Boobies anymore? It's a staple of the genre.

This one is a cult classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay far,far away","review":"This movie is so boring.i cant stress that enough.despite the name there isnt much blood or gore.the only interesting thing is the story,the whole idea of the killer kids.but then its not fully explained as to why they act the way they do.i got this dvd for about 43 and i still feel ripped off.all i can say if your looking for a horror with action,blood,guts or a good story then look elsewhere cause you will find none of that in this crappy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compact and useful","review":"This is a very-very compact guide, just the way it suposed to be for a mountain trip guide.

Needleman provides new evidence that black leaders were instrumental in breaking down barriers of racial discrimination. In this work, Needleman deftly examines how African Americans took on powerful labor leaders and built autonomous African American organizations to encourage desegregation and the development of inter-racial alliances. The writer is clearly among the leading ethnographers in the field, and this book makes a solid contribution to understanding the movement for racial justice in America. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crossword Puzzle Enthusiast","review":"I love Langenscheidt's Pocket Crossword Puzzle Dictionary. It is useful for solving crossword puzzles, plus it is a great reference tool. I particularly like that each entry is arranged with actual numbers designating the number of letters in words, rather than having to count the number of letters myself, like in some crossword puzzle dictionaries. Also, the large entries (like animal, composer, and river) have subcategories. If you want to find, for example, the name of a Russian composer, first look under composer, then under the subcategory, Russian.Another big plus is that this book is small enough to fit conveniently into a purse or brief case or backpack.I have used Langenscheidt's Pocket Crossword Puzzle Dictionary for about 8 years and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insightful Resource","review":"The book is extremely insightful. Littauer is well known for her analysis of personality types using the Greek \\"humors\\" of pleghmatic, sanguine, choloric and melancholy. Her insights into both motivators and stressors are useful for any parent, or anyone struggling with a relationship. The approach she uses is to mix fact with stories and examples. I would have prefered that she tone down the elements related to her own family, but the example itself is valid (if lengthy). Also, Littauer is unabashedly a Christian woman, and her writing strongly reflect this - with numerous Bible quotes and a very strong emphasis on Jesus and Christian principles.

It survived the bumps and bruises of scrambbling up narrow stairways and took great photos even in the damp, foggy climate of some of the English towns. I even took some spectacular photos of the Eiffel Tower with the panoramic format - they rival any postcards I saw in the gift shop!The only warning I will offer is that APS film can be slightly more expensive, but I find the multiple formats well worth the extra money for the film.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a good, reliable, durable, easy to use camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown Lines","review":"I have purchased two of these monitors and they will go in the trash bin.

The album suffers from the lack of a good producer - someone to say \\"Ah...guys, lets try that one again,\\" and \\"Do you really want to sing Winter Wonderland?\\" There are sloppy entrances, one or two flat notes, and some really bad song choices. With all the great Christmas music available, why did anyone think that it was a good idea for these particular singers to sing \\"Sleigh Ride?\\" However, as another reviewer noted, their rendition is good for a giggle or two.

Hey, maybe we should call them up and have them do it!Anyway, there are times the singers rush the orchestra, they time cutoffs poorly, they aren't synchronized, they mess up the tempo, etc. Not the orchestra - the singers. It sounds like an impromptu concert where they are holding the sheet music in front of their eyes for the first time and are recording it in one take. And it's true, to hear an American folk song sung in an operetic voice just sounds wrong - and it is wrong. I bought this for myself and now I'm using it for a White Elephant gift at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's rehearse","review":"One of the lousiest I've heard in years.

My first impression when I first listened to this CD was that it must be playing backwards! This music sounded completely out of tune and honestly like a big joke!

So I thought I'd try out \\"The Three Tenors\\" and see what their Christmas album had to offer.There are some problems with the music - Pavorotti seems to have some difficulty with English, but on the whole I did enjoy this album - and I'm not a fan of \\"The Three Tenors\\". I would have picked some other music for them to do - the John Lennon composition \\"Happy Christmas / War is Over\\" doesn't seem to work wel in this particular format, but it's entirely possible that I am too used to the Lennon/Ono performance.So try something new for the Christmas season and listen to this cd.

What I got was obvious advice, drizzled on at the end of 100 pages of fluff. I say 100 pages, because the first 100 pages are dedicated to explaining why likeability is helpful to you, me, and everyone else in society. If we didn't already know this, we wouldn't be interested in the book, now would we? The next 100 pages essentially says be friendly, revelant, and that brings about 'realness.' The only 'realness' I see here is that there is the lack of intriguing insight.The bottom line is if you're a rude social outkast, then this book might be for you. If you're looking to actually learn something beyond the rudimentary, basic, advice of 'be friendly,' will not find it in 'The Likeability Factor,' which ironically is only mildly likeable as a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Follow-Up","review":"\\"The Likeability Factor\\" is a solid follow-up to Tim Sanders' \\"Love Is The Killer App,\\" which is one of my all-time favorite business books.While Tim's first book provides a great philosophical context for living your business life, \\"The L-Factor\\" provides you with advice for becoming more self-aware inside and outside the workplace.Loaded with data and how-to advice, this quick-and-easy read will first convince you that nice people can indeed finish first and then give you some practical exercises for improving your likability.But be warned: Don't try this at home unless you're truly committed to becoming more likeable.

I found the CD to be very basic and the examples quite superficial, to the point of boring and useless. The author recorded in his own voice which didn't make it any better.

It is a step down from the previous work of hers, \\"Beware of the Bonquet\\". This novel follows a young wife, who is recovering psycologically from her amnesia following the tragic death of her three-year old child. Her family is full of malice, and doesn't wish for her to recover. The woman then finds herself increasly drawn into a plot by a Eastern European emigree to keep his life private at all costs. Aiken does confuse us slightly with his name. Is it Harry Lupac, or Hari Lupac? Anyway, the writing seems to be slowed down by the overall mood of despair and rotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most excellent album.","review":"I've seen the movie scores of times, but I've far eclipsed that with the number of times I've listened to the soundtrack.

I can't get enough of \\"Father Time\\", \\"I can't break away\\" and \\"In Time\\" and \\"Play with me\\" has to be the most entertaining head-banger song in the world. The only track I skip is \\"Dancing with a Gypsy\\" which I know others have loved, but runs too metal for my tastes.

It is a chance to hear them all in a different light, or in their true light. This album is worth every penny and more because of the mix of music, and the artists found on it.

This is unfortunate because \\"The Republic\\" is a compelling and enduring philosophy of how life should be lived, how justice should be approached, and how leaders should lead.What recommends this book, really, is the bargain price: under five bucks. As one of those college instructors who makes their students read this, I always recommend this edition. Sterling and Scott's translation is as good as anyone else's, so why not save my students a few bucks?

The translation wasn't a very difficult read and there are a lot of valid ideas that are still meaningful today. The wide scope of topics prevents boredom and the read is quick. I was interested in the opening questions- what is Justice and why should we be just? If one can gain material things and social prominence not being just and moreover being unjust, why do it?

Needless to say it is a hassle to have to go through all this work. Finally I got a few songs onto the player, but then I had trouble getting the USB to pop out when I moved the slider.

The sliding cover is difficult to control, since it acts as part of the charging, playback and hold options. The Bean design is to hold in your hand palm between fingers. If you put it in your pocket, there goes that sliding cover. So one should walk around holding the bean in their hand.

Finally after putting up with having to use it, it broke where the wire meets the battery compartment. Also, the idea of it having its own batteries is really stupid, just more batteries for you to buy. I think it's better to have one that runs on your game boy's battery.

Indeed, listening to Terry Callier is a healing experience.Callier creates a unique soul music, combining his own acoustic guitar and pliant vocals with more traditional jazz-based instrumentation. My favorite cut is Java Sparrow, an extended metaphor about the spiritual nature of human life, and the yearning for freedom from this material world.

Basically it tells you what to expect, the ups and downs. The problem is that it seriously lacks in details and good insights. It reads like a beginner REI book written by a beginner. Another tip-off is the author keeps mentioning Carton Sheets (Mr. Get Rich Infomercial) and Robert Kiyosaki (author of the vapid \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" book series) two scam artist that give real estate investing a black eye.

The basic functions are easy to use, but DVD recording is a little new to me and I needed to learn some of the lingo like VR and VM modes or differences between a DVD RW or RAM disc.I think VHS tapes are going the way of the phonograph and this unit is excellent for converting them to DVDs as well as for day to day recording. The video and sound quality of the recorded DVDs are great so far and look better than the original VHS tapes. It is also a nice looking machine at a reasonable price.

I tested it with Matrix and it pixilated frequently during action scenes and hung up for several seconds at the layer change. Then it froze frequently until the end.

I get the same thing with my already recorded tapes. It appears to have a tracking problem. It went back to Samsung for repairs, but it still doesn't work properly. Only the 'automatic' recording feature wll produce a viewable tape, and I still can't watch any of my previously recorded.I purchased this unit so I could convert my tapes to DVD and feel as though I've wasted my money on this unit.

This is a written word version of all those horrific youtube videos where some guy (it's always a guy) races his bike/car/sled straight into a wall... and then does it again! Some people just like to live on the edge of the razor blade. Ken Bruen's characters in this book certainly do.

And you'll be glad you didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Day Jim Thompson","review":"Ken Bruen's book is very reminiscent of the late great Jim Thompson in the descent into madness that the main character goes through and the characters that fill this novel with one major difference - Jim Thompson had the tendency to write passages of his books in a manner that was quite incomprehensible while Bruen writes quite masterfully.This novel involves a bouncer who meets a black girl and starts a torrid affair with her while dealing with his no good but amiable friend Dex. Together they plan the kidnapping of a businessman for ransom.The book is not long (about 145 pages) and reads quite briskly but it has some disquietening moments throughout and demonstrates quite clearly that Bruen is a writer to read.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre noir.","review":"This is a rather weak example of noir writing. Bruen uses the short, choppy style, but his sentences seem empty of the toughness that characterizes the best noir (I'm thinking of Ellroy or Thompson). He also has some very annoying (and frequently used) stylistic devices which detract. Throw in some high and low culture references which aren't even necessary, weak characterizations, and an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusions, and you've got \\"Rilke on Black\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"Very short basic kidnapping story revolving around an aging bouncer type, a sexy young woman and their dodgy partner in crime. Of course since this is noir, they can't trust each other one bit as they run around South London and nasty things happen. Lots of sex and killing, pretty ho-hum stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you're getting","review":"If you are looking for books by Allison Lane the romance author then be warned that this is a completely different author as far as I can tell and a disappointing book. As there isn't much information on Amazon I'll give you the description from the back which gives a fairly accurate idea of the story line:\\"There are three prophecies leading to the day of judgment, two fulfilled in our lifetime. Now, American archeologist Breezy McKenna, drawn to the mysteries of Jerusalem's buried past, becomes an innocent pawn in a plot to unleash the final fury\\"There is a slight element of romance between the heroine and two men she has to contend with, the first is an Israeli Intelligence Officer and the second is a half Arab, half Christian who assists her.

They opt for a more thrash metal sound now, but with keyboards. Several of these songs (and there is only 9, so i guess about half) sound very similar to clasic Bodom. I heard that Alex said in some interivew that from now on, each CoB album will be heavier and heavier. Well, this one is def. their heaviest and their fatest. The songs are entergetic, heavy, and fast. Yeah, it's not hatebreeder, but..honestly, what IS? If you want to hear hatebreeder, then go hear hatebreeder. It's not like that dumb down their music (in flames cough cough), they just changed their style of metal. There is a difference, folks.Tracks 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9 are some of the best they have written thus far in their career. So, give this album a chance. What does it matter what it sounds like, if it's good?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not-so-hatecrew but still have the fire","review":"Well I've been a Bodom fan for years now but this album has significantly changed in terms of sound but its still pretty good. Purists will argue that EVERY album must sound LIKE THE LAST, but as a band grows its music evolves. People who can listen to the same style of music without being bored or looking for a change just isn't normal. Just for example my fav's are C.O.B., Iron Maiden, Manowar, Hammerfall, Dimmu Borgir, Rhapsody, Nightwish, Slipknot, and System of a Down. This change was inevitable since they lost founding guitarist Alexander Kuoppala, or so it say's on their official web site. Like Disturbed, and Slipknot the change will happen but its not for the worst. As always this is my opinion and find someone who has the album to listen to it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT","review":"If your expecting a black metal/death metal record....you'll probably be dissapointed.

This is an album for people who still have plenty of fun while remaining perfectly evil in the eyes of a conservative narrow minded world. My only complaint with this album is that the lyrics are not included in the CD booklit. Nevertheless, This is an original band. Just buy the damm thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing they could have done...they needed re-invention, and did it right!!!","review":"The first two COB albums were two of the greatest albums I have ever herd (with Hatebreeder being my favorite). Even their live album, Toyko Warheart was great. Their last two albums have been stale. They seemed forced as a result of fan expectations but musically uninspired.Are You Dead Yet? is a perfect re-invention of COB. They still have the same sound, but play a little bit of a different style. There is a little industrial sound in it, mixed with the essential heavy and catchy riffs that COB does best!If you think you are going to buy another Something Wild, forget it, this album is a great piece of music that is new. Those of you who are open to something a little different once in a while, but still love COB at their core will dig this album. Those of you who are conservative metal heads that only like certain sounds and certain hair lengths may want to look past this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great release","review":"I don't see what everyone is talking about. Children of Bodom is not selling out. There is shredding, keyboards, and hard pounding riffs all over this album! What do people want for crying out loud. I've been listening to COB since the release of Something Wild, and I honestly can't tell a big difference. Its still great, its COB, and its refreshing, not recycled.

Besides Octavarium this was the album I was looking forward to the most, but now I can put this up there as my biggest dissapointment of the year. These guys used to be so good, I mean, pop in Hatebreeder and you'll see what I mean. I read in several interviews that this album had heavy industrial influences. Well then where the hell are they. Plus with a band with such a huge fan base, you wouldn't put a thought or worry with what the production will be like, but Something Wild, they're very first release had better production than this. Alexi's voice is also somewhat in question, it's obvious that he is losing it, and it is extremley aparent that he has several studio effects to it. The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because the Jani Warmen still shines on it.

Long gone are the high-speed melodic riffs that so pleased us to listen to. I regret purchasing this album, for it signifies the death of a once great band. The grace shot, of course, was greed. Mr. Laiho apparently has become lazy and uncaring for his art, all because music executives have convinced him that his financial future is secure as long as he keeps rolling out songs, regardless of effort and musicianship.

After hearing the first single \\"In Your Face\\", I was expecting an album at the very least on par with Hatecrew Deathroll, but not near Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper. Those two albums are two of the best albums of all time. Now where this new effort fails is the overall song structure, lack of original sounding riffs, and the brakes that have been put on Alexi and Janne's soloing. After first hearing the begining to \\"Bastards of Bodom\\" I got a sick feeling in my stomach and instantly knew there might not ever be a return to the fantastic styles of albums past. Don't get me wrong, there are glimmers of hope. \\"We're Not Gunna Fall\\" and \\"Trashed Lost, and Strungout\\" are the shining stars of this album. That does not mean I am satisfied. Alexi needs to seriously reconsider the style of music that they are playing, because this is simply not the Bodom that I, and many hardcore fans love."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would","review":"I bought around 6 books to study for the GMAT. This book was definitely one of the worst ones, if not the worst. The examples in the book were OK, but there is nothing new or above and beyond the Princeton Review or Kaplan books (both of which were much better than this book). Also, the CD did NOT work at all. When I called the helpline, I was always given some bogus excuse as to why nobody could help me. The CD would get to question 2 and cause a computer error. It was extremely irritating. My irritation was compounded by the fact that the person answering the phone at the supposed support line was totally unable to help me whenever I called. I was able to get a high score, but through using the Kaplan book and taking practive exams on paper. This book is a huge waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for today's battles","review":"With so many self-help books on the market today, it's easy to forget that perhaps the greatest lessons come not from today's hottest new talkshow guest, but from those who have weathered history's darkest times. Frederick Talbott has captured the essence of one of history's greatest speakers simply by letting him speak for himself. Winston Churchill's words, spoken in the most trying of times, can give a person a great deal of courage and motivation to cope with today's daily battles.Talbott gives a brief background with each quotation to put the words into context. And that is enough. The beauty and power of Churchill's words and character come through without any additional analysis or insight. And that is the beauty of this book.A must for any Churchill fan or anyone whose daily battles sometimes seem too harsh to bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vocals","review":"This is a fantastic album. Her vocals are AMAZING. If you appreciate great voices, you've got to have this CD. Favorite Track: Durme."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best New Progressive Out There","review":"This is a must if you are looking for any progressive, with more than one re-mix. It is like you are at the clubs with out being there. Hard hitting and nonstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A leisurely read","review":"I bought this book a while back, and never got around to reading it. So one day I decided to take a relaxing day to go through this book. It was a very fast read for me, and my mother as well. I finished it in one day.Yes, it is typical of the time period of the early 1900s.I find it an enjoyable thing to read from the past--to get a glimpse into the minds of a previous era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for a while. Then, it ceased to turn on.","review":"Everything worked fine for a while. I installed the software and transferred all of my music to the drive. It worked great for a few months. Then, the power light started to flicker. Soon after, it wouldn't even turn on. It was useless. I contacted the manufacturer. They sent a new power supply that didn't fix it. I tried everything. It wouldn't work on any PC, or plugged into any outlet. By this time the warranty was expired. I found out it costs $1700.00 to recover the data! I took it apart, and put the harddrive in a harddrive enclosure. Thank goodness I have not lost my data. This external drive was a nightmare! Seems like its made to stop working right when the warranty runs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after only 9 months","review":"I've bought this hard drive in January 2007. It worked OK until September 07, when it just died. It was not on most of the time, I've switched it on for few minutes once every few weeks when I had new digital photos, so overall it probably did not work more than a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"Honestly...I really have no hardcore complaints about my Maxtor 300 GB drive..... I don't know why all y'all are having problems but mine's been working great for about 2 years now and I have absolutely no complaints. I trust it with all of my media files and backup files. I even have my own portable OS running from it when i travel.My only complaints are that it's not very portable with all the bulky cords and the LEDs are a little annoying (living in a dorm room so the blinking is in my room, not the office)I shouldn't really have to travel with it and i just covered up the LEDs with post-its. No issues after that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Ripped Off by Seagate","review":"I bought this drive and within a week it began making seriously abnormal startup sounds (grating like the spindle was off balance or something). I contacted Seagate and they replaced this unit with a REFURBISHED unit - I BOUGHT a NEW units!!! About three months later this refurbished replacement started to do the very same thing. Now, my warranty is past and Seagate won't make good on their responsibility to replace a defective drive with a NON-defective drive. Just waiting for the inevitable crash and/or total startup failure and will NEVER buy from Seagate again. They should be sued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for 18 months - unfortunately, only a 1 year warantee","review":"I was happy with this drive while it worked. Unfortunately, after 18 months of using it for weekly backups of my desktop PC, my computer no longer recognized it. Tried it with my laptop - same thing. Called customer service and tried their suggestions. It was concluded that the drive was bad, and was not freely replacable, as it was no longer under warantee. Lost some files that were too large to store on DVD. Also, am currently without a backup device. Just ordered an external hard drive from another manufacturer that offers a five year warantee. Lesson learned: be wary of manufacturers who don't have ample faith in their product to offer more than a 1 year warantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"Not only does my drive not work (after one big whopping use), but their tech support is worthless. I have NEVER felt so rushed off the phone. I plan on staying away from this company from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxtor...I mean Seagate is worthless!!!","review":"I purchased the 500GB one touch III about six weeks ago, and 2 days ago it produced the same problem everyone else is talking about. The only difference being that I can't even get the drive to power up now. I have purchased another drive of the same model, but to no avail so I returned it. The only options I have left are to send it back to Maxtor for one of their replacement drives and pay $1700 to have the files recovered, or I can crack the case and buy an external casing to put the SATA drive in. Obviously I am going to try the second option, but that means I run the risk of producing futher damge, and also void any warranty. This seems like a horrible place to be, and Seagate is in now way taking responsiblity for this obvious manufacturing defect. BTW, if anyone has suggestions on how to safely transfer a drive let me know....."},{"rating":"1","title":"What best sums up this book...","review":"...is one sentence in an early chapter, talking about ballooning budgets. While he could make a good case about how we are spending our money as a society, he instead contradicts his own points, shows a lack of insight into the reality of the industry(ie things cost money), and a line about James Camerons upcoming disaster film costing almost 250 illion to make. In response to this he exclaimes, \\"this would have to be almost the highest grossing film of all time to earn its money back.\\" Perhaps before taking bold potshots at one of the most successful and consistant directors of all time, he should have waited to see how the movie would pan out first. This is typical of the book, which is angry, foolish, rambling, and now painfully out of date."},{"rating":"1","title":"A non-book","review":"I'm flabbergasted to learn that some readers actually enjoyed this pointless bit of piffle. Truly, there's no accounting for tastes. Here's the deal: this Ian Grey guy was briefly, peripherally involved in screenwriting. He's been in the same room with a few third-tier celebrities. He doesn't like think very highly of the movie business. Oddly, Grey seems to believe that this all adds up to some sort of sensational now-it-can-be-told muckraking extravaganza. It's a bit like a meter maid writing a tell-all account of the inner workings of the justice system. How these aimless drivelings ever found a publisher is a complete mystery. If you feel like rolling around in some real insider sleaze, read Charles Fleming's \\"High Concept\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"one word - refreshing","review":"How this book managed to slip past the publishing industry amazes me. This book reinforces the sanities that I find being pressed, everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I enjoyed this book. It exposed the dark underbelly of the entertainment industry. My only problem with it was the author seemed to focus on Horror flicks more than other genres. Also, it doesn't really conclude it just ends. But the focus of the book was clear, and I will not look at a summer 'blockbuster' the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming, funny and insightful","review":"These narrative tales and interviews with movie industry insiders comprise an intriguing and intelligent work. It is full of moments that put you right there with the actors and their staff. There are lots of clever and charming stories that are well written and fun. It also reveals things about 'the biz' that you could never know otherwise. Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Sound and Fury, telling Nothing","review":"Ian Grey starts off \\"Sex, Stupidity and Greed\\" with a bang and quickly fades to a whimper. Instead of giving us the inside scoop on Hollywood, how it works, how it thinks, who's who in the zoo, he takes every opportunity to take a potshot at the Reagan-Bush years, parroting the liberal screed we've all heard ad nauseam,(and believed to be true until the advent of the nineties when suddenly the \\"greed\\" of the eighties became the \\"wonderful economy\\" of Bill Clinton).Pa-leeze. When we buy books about Hollywood, we want to read about Hollywood. If we want to hear what a rotten job Ronald Reagan did twenty years ago, we'll buy political books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"Ah, would that this type of music was still being produced today. Many Cole Porter classics in this one, sung by the inimitable Ella Fitzgerald.

Her rendition of \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\", to her light and fun\\"Let's Do It\\" is a real treat and not too be missed.This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone's music library, and too be enjoyed again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Combo","review":"In my mind, the talents of Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter individually are without equal. Together, they are magic. This is my favorite album of all time and one with which I would not part. Porter's sophisticated lyrics and the range of his melodies make for fascinating listening and Ella's velvet voice does them justice. The only negative for me are the one or two songs which I wish she had interpreted less and kept more closely to the original melody. I'm disappointed that the album does not include \\"I Love You\\" which is my favorite of his all of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter","review":"Fabulous songs by Cole Porter (he was definitely a genius) and great renditions by Ella Fitzgerald.

This is an amazing CD. Any jazz lover will adore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ella fitzgerald sings the cole proter songbook","review":"Not only are Cole Porter's songs wonderful, but Ella's interpretation of them gives them life. No one does it like she does. I had this as a record album and couldn't live without purchasing the CD. I can't stop listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Female Vocalist","review":"She is the best female vocalist of all time. I have been listening to her since I was a child in the 1970s. When she passed on in the mid 1990s, I was saddened. All the songs in this album is the best of all her song books and other singer's songbooks. Her voice is so marvelous, natural and smooth. She is simply the best and no other vocalists can beat her."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL THE BEST TRIBUTE TO PORTER","review":"While ANITA O'DAY'S tribute album with BILLY MAY is an excellent alternative,those who want to buy one collection still have to go with ELLA and BUDDY BERGMAN who collaborated for the first time here.They hit a homerun right from the start.ELLA is in top shape with the ballads and also the uptempo numbers.Hear how ELLA gets through IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT a difficult song to sing;LOVE FOR SALE a song better suited for DINAH WASHINGTON but again ELLA manages to take a hold on it with her own way;i personnaly like the gorgeous treatment giving to EASY TO LOVE,SO IN LOVE AND EVERYTIME WE SAY GOODBYE.Amazingly i should say, because the most famous PORTER songs are usually the uptempo numbers.The classics ANYTHING GOES,ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT,NIGHT AND DAY AND WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE are just as good as their reputation.While buying it,have a thought for ANITA O'DAY who is still singing today.Catch her live if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful package","review":"It goes without saying that the music is top-notch. The surprise is that she covered a few Cole Porter tunes I actually did'nt know.What does NOT go without saying is that the whole package is a nice experience. The sound engineering is well done. The box reproduces the classic original liner faithfully and charmingly, albeit in a small CD jewel box. It was a pleasure just flipping it open, even before I put it in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"If you are looking for a definitive book on the history of British Railway Companies, this is it, but watch out for errors.

The amazon paperwork said no returns accepted after Dec. 1st. I ordered this and the set of 2 candle mantle hooks on Dec. 4th. I wish I had known the Dec. 1st deadline before I placed my order because now I'm stuck with 6 pieces of very tarnished brass with gross impecfections. One of the pieces looks like they left extra solder splayed across it's front. It can be seen from 30 feet away. Also the bulbs are not standard bulbs. They have an extra plastic piece on the bottom used to screw them into the candle base. This means when the bulb burns out it can't be replaced with a store bought bulb. I'll never buy from Christmas Central again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Let's just put it this way.

If you don't care about gender, go buy Slipknot or Skinlab. Regardless, stay far away from Kittie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I listened to the single on the radio and thought this band would introduce a fresh twist to hard rock. Unfortunately, \\"Brackish\\" is the only good song on the CD. The rest are frantic, repetitive, and uninspiring. I felt like I was hearing the same song over and over, with a slight change in the arrangement. I wanted to like this band from the start, but they couldn't hold me. They are a garage band with promise, but not ready for the big leagues. Save your money and see if they improve on their next offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musicly strong but they are in need of a good lyrics writer","review":"I'll admit that the girls of Kittie are strong musicians and hold their ground to almost any guy (excluding the guys of Korn)and they WILL pave the way for other girl rockers (it's about time). But i gave them 4 stars because lyricly they aren't the most original, and at times they can seem a bit childish. But if they just work on that a bit more there will be no stopping them. A personal message to the members of Kitte- Keep doing what you are doing, you are proving that girls do belong in the rock music scene. You have all my respect. you are so much better than britney spears!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is my first Kittie album.These women are a very good at heavy metal music.Their alot better than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad i don't own this CD...","review":"When I first heard of Kittie, I though \\"cool, a girl heavy-metal band.\\" What I got was a bunch of whiny screaming .... ....

The gal on lead vocals sounds funny more than she sounds serious. Every time she tries to SCREAM, it just tickles me. Her normal singing voice isn't that bad, see \\"Charlotte\\", but she should can the not-right sounding growls on the next? CD. The music isn't half bad. But I don't know how they can talk about Britney Spears' clothing. I've heard people comparing Kittie to old Metallica. I happen to think that such a comment is an insult to James, Jason, Lars, and Kirk.

If they weren't the only all-female band in the scene, they would never have gotten a record contract in the first place. The vocals are hoarse and abrasive, they just give me goosebumps listening to those out-of-tune, pathetic shrieks whining/growling out pathetic lyrics behind the same awful, SLOW guitars, with the same gritty, awful tone every track. If the music were more fast-paced, it might get another star from me, but it just grinds on so agonizingly sowly between chords that it only adds to my distaste for Kittie. And don't even get me started on the drummer, she couldn't keep a beat if the fate of the world depended on it. Maybe that's why they go so slowly, so she can keep up. For whatever reason, I am forced to put in my negative opinion on this truly god awful band.

Sorry, but it stinks like old KITTY LITTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kittie is absolutely no talent trash. TERRIBLE!","review":"It is obvious that Kittie is terrible. Every single song is a monotonous gothic feminist moaning session. It takes no talent to bury yourself in grey and black makeup or scream louder and longer than james Brown or Steven Tyler. I am pissed off with Kittie's obsession with the terrible male gender. The music frankly sucks. It is not fun to listen to. Terrible band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meow gone mad","review":"Maybe the reason for the band name is that the band had their cats play all of the instruments and randomly scratch shapes into the litterbox that they could convert into lyrics.

Plus who made up the song names anyways? Doesn't Suck, Choke, and Spit sound a little like someone who has choked on something and someone is giving him the hymlick (can't spell it but you know what I'm saying!) maneuver. Every song sounds the same, or atleast ends up to be. Scream a word here, scream another word there.
