The Most Slepted on LP in the last 10 years, easily","review":"Big Pooh dropped a beautiful LP here. And like that proverbial tree in the forest, nobody seems to know about it. If you're new to Little Brother, my advice for you is to listen to this LP, and compare it to the mainstream efforts out right now. I'm betting you'll be kicking yourself afterwards. Don't worry, there's more folk out there that had no idea either. So do them a favor and wake them up before it's too late.Looking for weak songs? Look elsewhere, 9th's prodcution is already legendary. Weak lyrics? You won't find them here either. Pooh does more than give you that hot ish, he makes sense as well. If there is an equal to any of Little Brother's projects (\\"The Listening\\" and \\"The Minstrel Show\\") It's this one.The only problem with this LP, is.... it's over too quick, or so it seems. The \\"quickiest 45 mins you'll ever have in your life\\", no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD coming from the Justus League","review":"Big Pooh is the forgotten member of the hip-hop trio Little Brother. Phonte is the more distinguished MC and the producer 9th Wonder gained national attention for producing a song on Jay-Z's Black Album. That being said, Big Pooh can more than handle his own on his solo joint Sleepers. From the jump-off this CD is quality. The bulk of the production is handled by Krysis and 9th Wonder both of whom lace Sleepers with soulful and head-nodding beats. Pooh touches on subjects from the harsh reality of low income living in \\"Heart of the City\\" to his strained relationship with his brother in \\"Live Life\\" and that is Pooh's strong point. He can rap about all types of scenario's from light hearted to deep and always keep his polished flow. Also, the beats are SOLID. Track #11 could easily be track #1, the whole disc is great from beginning to end and I think that is what is really lacking in rap today. Anyone who picks this up won't be disappointed, a near classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short Review Because ...............","review":"I wrote a long one before the power flashed off.

The songs are very flat as if he's composing on reserve fuel. It has a really generic funk/soul thing going on which sounds like Sly Stone on an off-off-off day, or the last line of filler that stands between the artist and the completely unusable material.

The noise canceller ups the bass quite a bit (if you happen to like that kind of thing) and muffles out all surrounding conversations. My only problem with them is the design of the noise canceller. The switch is hard to use and the cord is barely long enough for the canceller to make it to my belt loop. Also, I dunno what you guys have been saying, but I have always been able to use the headphones with or without a battery in the canceller.

Do not buy these!!!","review":"I made the mistake of buying these at Best Buy without referring to Amazon.com first. I won't do that ever again. The other reviewers are right, these are probably the most overpriced, the most uncomfortable, and the poorest sounding headphones you can buy. The only thing that is decent about these headphones is that it does an adaquate job of canceling out noise, but that's it... so I gave it 2 stars (since 1 star is the lowest rating and they're still good for canceling out noise). I returned these and bought the Sony MDR-NC6, which I absolutely love... they do a decent job of canceling out noise, they sound great, and they are very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought these headphones in a hurry withoud much consideration or research, and I deeply regret it. While the sound is all right most of the time, the bass becomes a buzzing sound when the noise-cancelling mechanism is enabled (which just creates a fuzzy backround sound that does next to nothing). In addition, they're quite uncomfortable, being to tight, and you can't lean your head back without pushing them off your ears unless whatever you are sitting in has a protruding headrest. The one thing I did like particularily about them is the headphone cord length. Not too long, not too short, but with that obnoxious little box that stores the battery for noise-cancellation and the switch, it gets annoying.SOUND QUALITY: 6/10 w/ out noise-cancelling, 2/10 w/ noise- cancellingCOMFORT: 5/10VALUE: 4/10OVERALL: 2/10DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible headphones!!","review":"I just bought these cheap headphones!!

I couldn't stand to wear them for any longer then 5 minutes. It's just awful that these were even allowed to be produced. The sound reduction (when I could focus on anything other then the pain) wasn't hardly noticeable at all. Plus, the cord was just short enough that you can almost always be sure you're going to have your head jerked or your C.D player pulled into the floor when you move. These headphones have really turned me off from ever wanting to buy anything made by Philips ever again. It's sad because they actually sounded pretty good.

Add on top of that the already poor sound quality that exists even when there's no noise to cancel. It's also made for small heads - not even medium-small heads, small.

The noise cancelling feature may be a good marketing objective, but what it produces it a good bit of white noise that can be more annoying than beneficial. The worst feature of this headphones was alluded above. The noise cancelling battery pack is heavy. Everytime it hangs it feels uncomfortable and puts unecessary strain on the cords.You eventually have headphones that are unusable because the cord mangles, severs...you pick your own verb...the wires within the cords cabling.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds ok - design bad","review":"I don't retun many things, but these had to go.The design is awful:- Pinches the tops of your ears- The battery box has a clip for your belt, but the wire is too short to reach my belt (I'm 6' tall) - so when walking it would rip off my head when attached my belt.- When not attached to my belt, it would swing around like other users have said and rip it off my head - same effect - but I looked like a major idiot.- Didn't fold for storage.They sound OK, N/C was adequate on a plane.

Sound is all right until you turn on the noise cancelling. First of all, it doesn't block all that much noise. Second, it kills the sound quality: the treble becomes real harsh; cymbals and \\"t\\"s and \\"s\\"s, etc in vocals become painful to listen to. Also, there is no shock protection: if you're in a car, for example, and it's a bumpy ride, you'll find that the sound skips often. If you're looking for good noise reduction, I would strongly recommend getting a pair of earbuds that seal off the noise, such as Shure's E series or Etymotic Research's ER6i's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound. Horrible design. Noise cancel is useless.","review":"I bought these to replace my Aiwa HP-CN5 headphones. The HP-CN5 isn't great but the Philips HN050 is flat-out terrible.The noise cancelation is really weak and adds a lot of hiss. It's like you're listening to an old cassette tape.The worse than the useless noise canceling is the design. There's an annoying behind-the-head band that means you can't put your head back on an airline seat or wear these headphones at the same time that you have a shirt with a collar on. And then there's this huge switchbox halfway down the cord which seriously gets in the way at the gym.If you're only paying $50 for a pair of headphones, you shouldn't expect too much but, even so, this thing is a total piece of cr@p. Ridiculously bad. Insanely horribly bad. The only way that these could be any worse was if they electrocuted you while you wear them or they caused brain damage or something. Truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"stunned","review":"I was stunned when I opened these headphones up and used them for my MP3 player. All I can say is they were terrible. My ear buds that came with my MP3 player sounded better than these headphones. The Philips HN050 is not worth the money. I will be returning these immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, good sound and mine broke soon","review":"The design is terrible: the neckband is uncomfortable if you are sitting in a high-backed chair, such as an airplane seat. The position of the noise-canceling switch is awkward, at least for jogging on a treadmill. Until my iPod ear buds broke, I used those while running. The Philips' noise canceller is right in the middle of the cord so if you clip it to your shirt, you have about two feet of cord and have to stick close to the treadmill or you'll get your mp3 player pulled from the shelf.The quality of sound was excellent but I enjoyed it only for a few weeks until they broke. One of the wires broke somewhere in the headphone cord and I guess it's because of the switch placing stress on the cord while running. My recommendation is to get these only if you won't be using them on an airplane. If so, go with noise-canceling headphones with the battery in the earpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna blow 50 bucks on an inferior product?!","review":"For the most part these headphones do what they are advertised to do - cancel noise.

Buyer beware and all that.I too found the noise canceling nonexistent. Apparently it works for some units in some instances and not in others.The neckband was in no way adjustable. This was not a major problem for me, but it was inconvenient.The noise canceling unit was mounted in a very inconvenient location. Ultimately, that is what ruined my unit--I was pulling it out of a bag and the noise canceling unit snagged on something and I pulled the wire just enough to cause a short. A better-designed device would not have suffered this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely needs some improvement...","review":"There isn't any way to adjust the neckband for better comfort. They will definitely slide off your ear if you put the back of your head against anything. There also isn't a means of adjusting the earpieces to fit them better to your ears. I am not real happy with the amount of buzzing/white noise in the background when I have them on. The noise gets even louder when you turn on the noise cancelling feature. The cord is also very short (3'9\\") which has caused problems for me when I use them. It would also be better if the noise cancelling unit was higher up on the cord. Its about exactly half way between the earphones and the jack. There is a clip on it but I can't seem to find much use for it. It does reduce noise a little but I don't think it does that good of a job for the price. I'd definitely suggest getting a better fitting pair of earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The sound quality is pretty good -- about the same a earbuds that cost half as much.The headband comfort is not bad, but takes a little getting use to.The ear phones move off of your ear if rest your head on the back of a chair (or airplane seat).If you are looking for noise cancelation you will be very disappointed.

A flamenco riff on electric guitar opens a journey of instrumental superlatives and a tremendous jazzy session, including bass solo, to calm down with the same guitar opening.

Given the almost certain fact that Jefferson really did have children with Sally Hemings, this premise might have made an interesting and insightful movie.

To make up for the lack of a drummer, every tune is built around an implied, toe-tapping rhythm, with Catherine switching back and forth between acoustic and electric and using every style of rhythm playing from a Freddie Green strum to 1970s funk to keep things lively and textured, the bass walking a reliable backbeat. Above this clever tapestry, Wilen plays with that cool, claret-like tone of his later years.

Fixed-frequency output","review":"Although the seller neglects to mention it in the item description, this is a fixed-frequency oscillator (about 1kHz). Don't be misled (as I was) by reviewer \\"SO-GLAD\\"'s comment about adding a multiturn pot to increase the frequency stability--what s/he is referring to is not for frequency selection.So, this product is useless for my purposes, which require variable frequency. However, that is not the fault of the product (only the seller), so I have not reduced my rating because of it. Yes, I could have searched online for more details about the kit, but the item description should have been better.Also, this circuit is based on a relaxation oscillator (555 timer), and not well filtered, so the sine wave output is rather distorted.

This is both his greatest asset and his greatest debit. True Civil War buffs (the kind that visit battlefield sites for their vacations, and model them to scale in their basements)will absolutely love all the incredible detail Tsouras packs into this novel (for THEM the book gets a resounding 10, the 3 is for the rest of us). They will lick their lips in anticipation as they recognize a deviation from the \\"real\\" history and anticipate where it may lead. Everyone else will hate it because you will be completely lost within 10 pages unless you happen to be remember every last regimental and brigade commander involved in the battle.

I thought the author was going to analyze what might have happened at Gettysburg if the facts were tweaked. For example, if Stuart had come onto the battlefield on day 1 instead of day 3, what might have Lee done differently and what would have been the possible outcomes? This sort of speculation would have been interesting from a writer of talent such as Mr. Tsouras.Instead, what the author has produced is a speculative novel, in which fiction is woven seamlessly in with fact and it is left to the reader to determine which is which. I became impatient with trying to sort out what was fact and what was fiction and gave up. In his quest to confuse the reader, the author has even included fictional footnotes from fictional books.Some who enjoy speculative fiction might like this book. I think I prefer to stick with the facts. Coddington's book on Gettysburg indulges in some speculation that is far more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be labeled \\"unbelieveable fiction.\\"","review":"While \\"What if\\" questions in history are intriguing, book length treatments of \\"alternate histories\\" should be classified as fiction, not \\"history.\\" Distrubingly, the author attempts to pass this book off as a \\"history,\\" to the point of mixing fictional sources in with real sources in his \\"footnotes.\\" Thus a reader with limited knowledge on the battle would have no idea what is \\"real\\" and what is \\"fiction.\\" Footnotes in this type of book are unnessary and misleading.Just as bad is the fact that the scenario layed out in the book is completely unbelieveable. The strageties of the opposing commanders and subsequent movements of the troops are ludicrous. It would almost be funny, if not for the fact that many readers (who only have a casual interest in Gettysburg) will be fooled into believing this \\"history\\" was actually possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"I read this book for my senior seminar while studying abroad in Rome. I can safely say that it is the worst book I have ever had to read for a class. Not only are the essays obtuse, but the book is horribly edited and translated. The book suffers from schizophrenia (as I'm sure the conference it was taken from does as well); it is not sure whether it wants to be a philosophy text, a history text, an anthropology text, or something else. These fields of study are all related, but there is no central theme in this book (despite what you might expect from the title).

I owned this Steppenwolf album before on cassette and it sounded great. But this CD is really badly remixed! In particular the v o i c e s are hardly hearable on many occasions. For a decent recording I would easily give 5 stars. Who ever produced this CD, please try again (or let somebody else do the job) and then send all disappointed customers a free copy !!!

In fact, it is the only one I kept when it was time to move and I needed to lighten the load. It is just so darn entertaining- and you find something new every time you pick it up. That is why I bought it in the first place, instead of being a rehashing of stuff that I already knew about for years, I actually learned some significant new things. If you are jaded and think that there is \\"nothing new under the sun\\" try reading this, it will expand your horizons. It covers everything from crop circles, synchronicity, the crystal skull, ancient high tech, space/time anomalies, alternate dimensions, alien abduction, death of the 5th sun, etc., etc., etc....And it is all tied together in a humorous way by the character of Charles Fort (The Book of the Damned.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other books in the series","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the other books I've read in this series, especially The Big Book Of Death, which have always proven to be fun and interesting. This book has the same problem that nearly all books about the paranormal have, which is a total lack of any rigor or skepticism. Every goofy paranormal claim is treated seriously, no matter how many times it's been debunked. I know this book isn't exactly a serious discussion of the subject matter, but it would be nice to see a little more fostering of healthy skepticism and a little less passionate embrace of phony mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't explain this book","review":"OK, I can. :-) Yet another \\"big book.\\" This not my favorite in the series, mostly because it's not historical, but more the cartooning of the hysterical. Bigfoot, UFO's, ghost sightings, etc. That's not my cup of tea. If you like the Factoid Books and like this sort of things, by all means, this deserves a spot on your bookshelf. However, if you're considering a \\"Big Book of...\\" try one of the others first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt to deal with the strange and unknown","review":"As in other books in this series, the use of different artists causes the quality to vary to extremes.

Hull makes the point that most books were written by men, and few enough women could read. That means the sources she has focussed on - 'lifestyle guides' as we might call them now, dealing with issues such as health, rules for wives and daughters, sex, child care, and cooking - are of limited help in telling us what women's lives were really like. At times the book reads like a study in misogyny, with women being derided, scolded, and lectured by the male authors of the period. While the extracts make interesting reading, I found the author's voice intrusive, as she makes anachronistic comments about the advice given in the books. Overall I would have preferred more direct extracts and less comment. However it is a useful collection of sources for the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd will put a smile on your face, maybe.....","review":"I am gald to say that i have all the solo piano cds by Sally.

What a shame it is to not have more dymanic songs by Sally.I can say that i have never bought a cd by Sally that had not songs that i didn't like.It seems Sallys' focus is on the fairly new songs.

I almost couldn't finish the book because of the haphazard narrative style; the tenses shift from past to present without warning -- or without reason, and that habit the author has of interjecting dialogue without cues is absolutely maddening. I have never seen anything like that before: Jake blah blah blah and \\"Suddenly says something.\\" That particular device was so irritating I almost couldn't focus on the plot.It was a good story but I really wish it had been told in a more straightforward manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Not What I Expected","review":"My lack of interest in this book stems from the fact that nothing really happens. The character of Luella is a nagging witch who constantly gets pissed at Jake because he doesn't act or respond to her the way she would like him to. Ten years after losing his wife, Jake is a quiet, reserved man still in mourning, and Luella is always screaming at him to let go of the past (not exactly an endearing character you want to relate to). I reluctantly finished the book just to see how it would end. Maybe some people can dig enough to find a deeper meaning to this book, but to me it is just what it seems on the surface--a novel about insurance fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic and ponderous","review":"I had such high hopes for this book and its subject matter. Unfortunately, when you combine an authoritarian certainty with a lack of imagination (if not rigor), the results are very disappointing. Phenomenology this is not, although the title entices. Fairly early on, when the author excludes the sensory reality of synesthesia by stating dogmatically that the physical senses are isolated and discrete, I'd had about enough. Like some other religious \\"thinkers\\" I have encountered (and studied under, to my regret), Gaffney cannot avoid the Luciferian temptation to flog his readers with unquestioned pet ideas that I trust would make his hero Aquinas redden with embarassment.

Being pumped up with the ideas from the beginning of the book, I was more inclined to think that we are eons away from getting that Humpty-Dumpty back into one piece again. But my hopes are greater than my worries..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Chronicle of Self-Discovery","review":"Peter Matthiessen spellbinds the reader with his poetic style and uncanny insight, as he invites us into his (rigorously and minutely) examined life. For those who are confused by his Zen philosophy and symbolism, I recommend reading his \\"Nine-Headed Dragon River\\" first. In it, Matthiessen narrates how he came to be a follower of Zen Buddhism, and what motivated him to take this journey into the Himalayan mountains. Personally, I find Matthiessen to be the most astonishing and fascinating author alive today."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Matthiessen's Classics","review":"I won't try to summarize this modern classic. It's something I first read many years ago, and re-read once a year or so, and each time through, I come away from it with different things.I will say that it's easily the best Buddhist writing I've encountered from a Western writer, and one of the definitive classics of contemporary literature. Matthiessen's writing is both modest and graceful, and has a smart rhythm that suits his subject matter well - what at first seems to be fairly straightforward - a journal, or a travel narrative, a document of a spiritual trajectory, or a biological study - turns into a rich, deceptively complex creation that is all of the above, and more. Sophisticated, powerful and very highly recommended.-David Alston"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seeker's Bible","review":"Peter Matthiessen is truly an American treasure, one of those rare writers who balances both erudition and accesibility. You want to read his books but you'd also like to hang out with him over a cup of green tea some cloudy afternoon.Of his many books, fiction and non-, the Snow Leopard is by far the best -- an outstanding anthropological journey but also a moving journey of the soul. What has always stuck me about his search for the elusive snow leopard was not the result but the cause. After his wife dies of cancer, Matthissen is clearly searching for something - forgiveness? penance? peace? His ultimate lesson is that he climbs the great peaks and finds nothing but the wonder joy of the search itself. What a tremendous insight. Read this book and go on the journey, then read it again -- it is like a bible to the seeker."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Beauty","review":"In one word, this book is beautiful. From the first page, it is clear the Matthiessen is a talented writer. Each sentence is poetic, its words bringing to life this journey. While the writing is enjoyable, the content makes this book incredible. Matthiessen brings to life the beauty of Nepal, with its vast mountain ranges as well as the animals that inhabit the country. This book of exploration and nature has a philisophical side in which Matthiessen experiences Nepal in a spiritual way. This too is describe in a beautriful writing style. This book is a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtual reality, an oral kaleidoscope of one man's thought","review":"A visual journey of a personal search that asks questions that perhaps have no answers.

Matthiessen demeans his Sherpas while intimating some sense of loss at leaving his 8-year-old son at home one year after his wife died while he treks around Tibet for two months, inexcusable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated!","review":"This book got such glowing reviews that I had to purchase it. A high standard was set by these reviews, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Another reviewer mentioned that they couldn't get past the \\"Zen stuff\\", and I agree. There were sections that were so detailed on historical Zen philosophy that I had to skip the chapter before falling asleep. Maybe I'm looking for more \\"action\\", but I can tell you this book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could get past all the Zen talk","review":"Tried to read this book after many people's high reviews, but I could not get past all his talk of Zen and Buddhism. I kept getting confused by all the religious talk when all I wanted to know about was the physical journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we care about Buddhism?","review":"Don't waste your time reading this book. He spends 300 pages discussing Zen and Buddhism and meditation and prayers. He had the potential for a really good book, the plot is good, the problem is that he doesnt talk about the plot. He doesnt care about the physical journey or the action, just his spiritual journey. total lackage of juice in the book, just fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for reading by the campfire","review":"I had this book on my shelf for ~ 15 years before I read it (it was a gift from a friend). I must've started reading the book about a dozen times without getting further than 20 pages into the story before putting it down. Then, I just recently went on a week-long camping trip in a quiet corner of the Rocky Mountains. At the start of the trip, I happened to grab \\"The Snow Leopard\\" on my way out the door (I knew I'd need reading material, and it just happened to be the first book at hand in my \\"not-yet-read\\" bookshelf). In the rustic and remote setting of the Rocky Mountains, this book was transformed from a self-serving exposition of sentimentality to a very thought-provoking and entertaining travelogue, in which the external terrain encountered by the author becomes a catalyst for exploring the internal world inside our minds. I would recommend finding a quiet spot somewhere outside as the perfect place to read \\"The Snow Leopard.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"History of stupas problem","review":"The book involved so much history, so many roshis, so many words on the \\"path\\", that I never knew if I needed to remember it all. Would it be a platform that I needed in order to jump into the next chapter?The south Florida trilogy, Killing Mr. Watson (et al) was my only known Peter Matthiessen. I am in awe of his versatility. Same feeling for his poetic language, tumbling hard and clear and endlessly as the high mountain streams. I appreciated his honesty regarding leaving young children for a dangerous trip. And even more in assessing where he was on his spiritual journey: almost nowhere, and it was fine. Honesty opens the way for reciprocal honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic of a Spiritual Odysey","review":"I have lost count of the number of times I have re-read parts of this book. I have read it from cover to cover at least 4 times over ten years and it speaks new words each time. It is a spiritual journey just reading it; to say nothing of the description of Peter's own inner odyssey. Please read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment as elusive as the Snow Leopard","review":"There is not much more I can add to this review that others have not covered. I am not a student of Zen Buddhism, but the author's explanations of the origins, myths, and whatnot of several types of Buddhism is very interesting to read. This book works on several levels, as a spiritual text, travelogue, and naturalist text. I would highly recommend it.The book did lose one star for it's very wordy descriptions of the Himalayan environment. I suppose the author had a lot of time to minutely explore his surroundings, but it does not make for good reading, especially since he doesn't do a very good job of painting a detailed picture. However, don't let that stop you from reading what is one of the best travel books ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more reality, less zen","review":"This book is 1/3 hiking, 1/3 animals, and 1/3 extentialism that bogs it down with boredom. The intro is so boring you cannot help but wonder when it will end. And the first 60-80 pages are a snoozer about religion and drug use. It gets better during the trek, and the animal sightings.I found it odd that he ended the book without talking about getting home and seeing his kids...but then again, how much could he care about them if he was willing to go on an expedition 2 mo's after his wife dies...leaving his kids to deal with their mothers death without him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read it...Then I saw it !","review":"Maybe you can't believe it, but I have read it during a trekking in Dolpa.

Boy am I impressed! Unexplicably, its become one of my favorite albums. Its got a loose, shambling quality that is endearing. I love the slow \\"heavy\\" groove of all the tracks. They somehow managed to \\"outweird\\" Joe Cocker on their cover of the Cocker tune. I especially like \\"Nobody There At All\\"; it has such great songwriting and soulful playing I surprised myself by getting a little verklempt. Buy this album for an example of an overlooked heavy late-60s rock 'n roll classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seminal Work","review":"This is one of the great blues/rock albums. I want to echo a previous reviewer that three of the original members remained but, most importantly, Gary Wright had left. Chris Stainton, who guided Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishman tour, fills in. Alan Spenner on bass eventually would turn up on Roxy Music's Avalon album. This album combines an emotional wail with searing guitar passages that send shivers up my spine.

In terms of its genre it ranks with Beggars Banquet and The Byrds Untitled."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Rock Band / Very Good Album","review":"Great music just follows Scott Wenzel around, no matter who his fellow band members are.

And of course , the constant variable in all the albums is founder and lead singer, Scott Wenzel... who has the perfect voice for conveying God's message in all it's rock & roll glory !

It was supposed to be a holiday read, a book that would last me a long weekend in Paris. In fact, I'd read the whole thing before the Eurostar even reached the suburbs. I don't know what happened--I think I got sucked in.Before I read COVER THE BUTTER the title intrigued me. Now I understand where the phrase comes from (but I'm not going to tell you), and it seems an apt metaphor for Kate's life before she breaks free--everything unpleasant hidden, tucked away, ignored. My favourite scenes were the ones where Kate's mother Biddy appears. She's truly wonderful, but a character so acidic she makes you wince.Take this book on holiday but make sure you bring other books, too. You'll probably finish BUTTER before you even get off your plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable novel, though not very Welsh","review":"I agree with other reviewers -- enjoyable, small-scale novel, especially good in creating a sense of the expectations faced by a middle-class British woman born in the early 1950s.However, the editorial description of the book is misleading. (Not the author's fault, I suspect.) The book isn't really \\"set in Wales\\" in any sense that matters. Yes, the Welsh grandparents come into the story occasionally, complete with bits of Welsh language, and the main character moves to Cardiff -- but there's basically no local color or sense of place, so if you're looking for a novel \\"about\\" or \\"set in\\" Wales, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love the Duke, you'll hate this","review":"The Duke is rolling over in his grave.

Liner notes are almost non-existent -- you have no idea who the vocalists or musicians are, or when the track was recorded. Silver Bells is really awful, especially the person who is singing the little bit of echo completely flat. Ouch. Auld Lang Syne is played Dixieland style, which is somewhat odd for an Ellington recording.

McClean is in fine form, mixing straight playing with intense out-weaving clusters, as does the rest of the bandIt all works brilliantly, and if Destination Out's tracks are laid out to challenge the players by context, Right Now provides a wider format where the players can challenge themselves--And come up roses every time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Worthwhile!!","review":"It's more of the same from the first movie, but it is worthy.

It did not look exactly as pictured yet was enough for me. I only needed something to carry my player to the gym and back. Just yesterday though the case ripped. The case is made out of some soft plastic(maybe silicone). The problem lies with the design of the case. The holes that the armband pass though are large and travel laterally up the back of the case. These holes expose some of the case to thin and thus weak points. These weak points handle all the stress and force when the player is tugged or shifted on you arm. Well the thin areas spilt and caused a catastrophic failure of the case. So like I said poor design. In my opinion try another brand or company or try a universal one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last as long as you think","review":"Since the product is made for working out I used it almost daily.

There's no way to put the Micro in the case except by squeezing it into the stretchy silicon material like pulling on a tight sweater. It was fine for awhile, though I had to take the belt clip off. Then I needed to get at the battery in the Micro, and as I was attempting to (gently and carefully) remove it from the case, the case just ripped like it was made out of Jello.

Besides that, \\"Yellow Sun\\" is a fairly decent, laid-back number, but it's sabotaged by weak, first-draft lyrics (anyone who ends two \\"rhyming\\" lines with the same word really needs to try harder). \\"Summer Is Fading\\" blows its potential by staying stuck in a 2-chord progression (for 8.5 minutes).

The book basically is an in-depth study of rural Texas schools around 1900-1930. The key word here is detail. You really get to understand all aspects of the old one and two room schoolhouses- curriculum, construction, politics behind the locations of the schools, etc. As with all of this author's works, the best parts are the little human details- pranks the students played on each other, the food they ate, funny things that happened at recess, games the students played, and the pride the community took in the school's success. The end of the book, where everything is consolidated and the small community schools are closed down, is downright sad. I'd highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh how I like it","review":"I used to think there was no Jim Capaldi CD/Album but 'Whale Meat Again'. How wrong I was. I still believe in 'WMA' but Oh How We Danced! Starting with Eve each song is a surprise. First horns, next strings, now it's searing guitar all with an early 70's sensibility that still seems fresh today. And always there is Capaldi's singing! I love Traffic's jazz influences and of course those influences are here too. Possibly the weakest link in this wonderful chain of songs is Open Your Heart. But save yourself for the last and title track. It is worth the wait! Similar artists?

After only three days, however, I am determined to exchange it at the church bookstore for a title that is more fitting the solemnity and introspection of the season.It is simply mond-boggling that someone, particularly an Anglican scholar or priest, feels called to edit Donne in the way. One of the glories of the Anglican tradition is an acute sensitivity to ritual, language, and the spiritual life of the intellectual, and unfortunately, this book seems to respect none of these. It's such a disappointment. Who better to read on the 40 days of Lent than John Donne?

End result: very sore ears and earbuds in the garbage. I could never get them to stay in place more than a minute, and any attempt to get them to sit in the ear canal resulted in pain. I felt like a mutant-eared freak until I read some of the other reviews here. Shoulda done my research instead of making a blind purchase.I can't really evaluate their sound quality since the earbuds didn't fit in my ears, but what I heard when I held them in place wasn't significantly better than my original iPod earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely worth your twenty...","review":"I have an apple ipod, and the little earbuds that came with them broke so I set off to find a pair at Target. However, they do not carry the original buds in stores, and my Target was out of the in the ear-bud ipod headphones. So I decided to try these. I wasn't very pleased. Their sound seems very distant and doesn't block out activity around me. Also, they don't have good volume. I liked the bass, but I just felt it sounded like I was in a large room and the music sounded distant. Overall, I would spend the extra 20 for the apple in the ear-bud headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I ordered a pair of Phillips surroud sound headphones at the Target website. The first thing that dissapointed me was the shipping price. Seven dollars for a light package package that would fit in my mail box. Once I opened them I was very dissapointed. The ear buds that came with my mp3 (which probbably costed five dollars) had deeper richer sound. They are not even comftorable. It's like when the doctor looks in your ears. They might have \\"surround sound\\" but they are not special, not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"they're useless","review":"iv tried these earbuds multiple times hoping they'd work. everytime i put them in my ears, they fall out. theyre useless. waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comfortable little earbuds","review":"Overall I think these are some of the nicest earbuds I've found for this price. I've seen far more expensive ones and have never been able to justify paying $50 for a pair that don't even sound that great. These are comfy and they stay put even when I'm running. Sound quality is good and the bass response is noticeable too, something I don't always find when listening to mp3s on other headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I have not owned that many ear buds but I enjoy what I get from these. I have always had issues with the ear bud covers falling out and what not but with these it is almost impossible. The sound quality suits my need and the price I paid $9.95 was even a better deal. The case it comes with is kinda silly but whatever. You get what you pay for they may not be for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the reviews first...","review":"Grabbed these to replace my iPod earbuds since they were cheaper and were supposed to sound good.They do sound very good, and the technology for what Phillips is trying to do is a great innovation for earbuds.The problem is that they won't stay in your ear, at all, and I suspect that about 95% of the people that try them will have the same issue. The poor design makes any other plus these earbuds have completely irrelevant; for exercise they'd be impossible to use, and they're only usable for sitting and using after frustratingly adjusting them constantly for the entire time you have them in.If you have a pair to try and they fit without falling out, they're great. For most people, though, there are far better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but poorly engineered for the ear.","review":"I bought this product, based on the impressive display and characteristics the container boasted. While the product does deliver great surround sound other impressive characteristics, this product's good characteristics are quickly outweighed by its one most problematic circumstance-They fall out very quickly usually 2-3 minutes after applying them. To ensure that the earbuds sustain themselves in your ear, you basically have to thrust them into your ear, an deep within them to the point it hurts at that. I would not recommend this product at all, not because its has horrible sound quality, but because its tendency to repeatedly fall from your ears disallows you to efficiently listen to and keep comfort with your music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound quality, no replacement parts","review":"These are by far the best earbuds I've used to date. They have a good sound quality and I've not had any problems with them falling out.My only complaint is that I've contacted Philips to get replacement tips with out any luck. These are something they do not stock as a replacement part. I bought them at Walmart for around $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration in a little package","review":"I bought these earphones because I needed to replace the stock earbuds that came with my iPod and didn't want to spend $50+. First, I have to say that other than these and the stock earbuds, I haven't had too much experience with headphones. These did sound quite a bit better than the stock earbuds. What I could not stand about them is that they KEPT FALLING OUT OF MY EARS unless I was sitting completely still - be careful not to turn your head either; they'll fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was looking for a tight seal in my ear but these anoying buds keep popping out. Unless you have gigantic ear holes stay away from these. The hard plastic part that is supposed to fit in your ear canal is 10mm wide and on top of that there is a soft rubber sleave that adds a couple of mm. If Philips had just made the round piece a few mm smaller I think they would have been okay. As is I can't use these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who did they make these for?","review":"They barely want to stay in your ears with either of the rubber pieces included. Feel like jogging? Not with these! I don't know who they made these things for but its someone with abnormal ears. They don't stay in hardly at all. Sound is fairly good but what good is that if you can't keep them in. A bad purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound/Nonfunctional Design","review":"The sound on these headphones is AWESOME--for the 30 seconds you're able to keep them in your ears. Users will find that the earbuds' conical-shape, combined with the rubber covers (you can't use the earbuds without these covers, because the metal will scratch your inner ear), allows these earbuds to constantly slip out of your ears. During a 30-minute walk, at least one of the buds (most often the left one, because of the asymmetric cabling system) must have slipped out of my ear every half-block. And the problem isn't just limited to wearing them during a workout, because they even slipped out of my ears while I was sitting at my desk. These are definitely going back to the store. (Same product as the HE592, just a different color)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earbuds","review":"These earbuds are really not as great as they look. Please, please, please don't waste your money on them. I bought a pair and they hurt like no other! I am not one of those people that just hates earbuds alltogether.

Also, they don't stay put very well and the rubber ear piece tears very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"no these are horrible. no bass and flat treble. for the money i expected a WHOLE lot more than this. ive literally bought headphones in the ten dollar range that sounded better. they dont even stay in your ear they keep falling out. what a piece of overpriced garbage. if they were like ten bucks i wouldnt be complaining but twenty is too much money to be blown away in the wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for BASS or Dance music","review":"What a great price. I normally spend 40-50 on Sony or even more on BOSE headphones and the surround sound idea seemed cool.They seem, as other reviews said, very tough and well made.Sadly, they sound like a surround system on HALL setting, like an echo is going on.Perhaps this works for celine dion or orchestral works but for Bass and dance type sounds it is severely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"These earbuds are clunky and uncomfortable, but that's far from the only problem: the sound can be best described as tinny. If you listen to rock or metal or any music with strong bass you will be especially disappointed as the bass is very weak on these. Lower-priced Sony earbuds are a better bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elephant Ears","review":"These earbuds are superior in sound to the competition. I own these and the Sony MDR-EX51LP earbuds, and the philips earbuds sound 40 to 50% better. HOWEVER, unless you have ears the size of an elephant, they will not fit. If you can fit something similar in size to an AA battery or tube of chapstick into your ear, then these will work. Otherwise, know from the beginning that they are WAY to big for the average person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound for price, TERRIBLY uncomfortable","review":"The sound quality on these earphones is quite good. It rivals even the $50 Sony ear buds. The Best Buy representative said that this was because it is designed more similarly to the $100 Bose earphones. You will hear the variety of the sounds, making your musical experience as good as it gets for $24.00.HOWEVER, the design on these is horrific.First, one of the earphones is shorter than the other, so when you put in the iPod, you end up having a baby bib look. Not attractive. Further, it makes it easier for them to pop out and tangle. Third, even though there are two additional hollow canal type attachments, none of these worked for my ear canal. The open sound essentially allows the surround sound to flow, giving a great sound. However, when I could get the ear buds to stay in, I got a headache and ear ache because it was so unbearably uncomfortable.In short, I can't recommend these ear buds if you value a comfortable listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting money","review":"I can't even walk down the street in these without them falling out of my ears.

Compare this to John 1:1, John 1:18, Numbers 23:19, and then to 2 Cor 11:14.I would guess that Ms. Fenimore has had an intense hallucination (seriously, though, she did take a lot of pills), and it would not be a stretch to think that she has been mislead by something or someone appearing as \\"an angel of light.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"I read the whole book, and if what she narrates is close to the truth, She was never dead.

Would you say the same if someone YOU loved committed suicide? Probably not. You know nothing about mental illness and suicide. Many people who commit suicide are mentally ill and have been for many years. It's an illness no different than cancer except that it is mental instead of physical. It's no different than saying someone with cancer who chooses not to go through the pain of chemo even though they know they will die if they don't will go to hell also. Suicide is not a choice for many but a way to end a pain that you will never understand. Grieving over the death of a loved one's suicide is painful enough without having to come across people like you who know nothing about the person I love who committed suicide. Yet you feel qualified to judge them. You should be ashamed of yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary departure from the truth","review":"I was astonished at how Fenimore could foist such neurotic poison upon society. To claim to be dead when no life-support or hospitalization was needed is ridiculous. I commend her writing skills, as she is clearly a literary artist. However, her material is wrought with ignorance, mysticism, pretensions, and utter self-centric neurosis. Beyond the Darkness is a blatant forgery crafted by Fenimore in a feeble attempt to not only rationalize the profound confusion in her life, but to acquit and expiate herself of the selfish mistakes she has made with her husband and children. Beyond the Darkness is worth exploring simply because of the number of near-death experiences people claim to have. However, it should be approached with a great deal of skepticism, common sense, and reasoning to discern the true underlying sources and reasons to her claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it hell that burns?","review":"It is amazing to me that in the light of such extraordinary information we continue manipulating our perceptions according to a hackneyed Christian outlook. Do the author's experiences really give her, or us, the right to assert that such places as heaven and hell are real? How much of this understanding is attributable to the experience and how much is post-experiential rationalisation - in other words, sheer fiction? The time is coming when we will have to treat such experiences seriously, instead of docketing them into codes. Christianity, hmm. South American shamans spoke of an interim region between this world and the next, where souls could get stuck in the transition, whereupon they would scream out for help to practically anyone who passed, including the shaman.

Why should the author's experience confirm the Christian worldview instead of this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"just another fanatic...","review":"I totally agree with Missskittti from May of this year. What gives this idiotic fanantic the right to even hint that people who are disturbed enough to commit suicide will go to hell. The truth is.... hell does not exist. Organized religions who want to control you will tell you it does. Does the theory of hell even make any sense to the sane mind? God loves us, do you really believe that he'd condemn someone to hell for all eternity because they were so depressed that they killed themself? Everyone will go through a review when they pass into spirit. But you self-righteous religious fanatics will see first hand at how evil your playing God and condemning people to a place that doesn't even exist except in your warped mind is.

Neither are the stories about what happens there. But for a few of us, death is not such a wonderful experience. While many authors tell of the delights of heaven, few talk about the loneliness of hell that, unfortunatly, is just as real. For some of us, a loving pat, saying \\"it isn't your time.\\" is not enough. But the harsh image of eternal loneliness is a clear sign that death isn't always an escape, but a beginning of something even worse than the pain of living. Angie Fenimore makes this quite clear with her vivid descriptions an stark imagery that outlines a very dark future for those who die by there own hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked perfectly!","review":"I was a little concerned about the 87' and up.

Better to pass !"},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes not realized.","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it was missing all of the rich imagery and storytelling that made the \\"Outlander\\" series so appealing. It reminded me of the feeling I had reading Michael Crichton's \\"The Lost World\\": Like the author had some research leftover from a previous book and just slapped a new novel together to please readers. It was an interesting adventure, but not in the least bit engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Disappointing. It was interesting to read about Grey, but the book as a whole reminded me of a cheesy dective mystery on old T.V. You know the one. Where there is no way to possibly guess the ending because absolutely nothing connects, then the bad guy takes the last 30 pages of the book explaining the whole plan. All the characters say, oh, so that's why. Only the reader is left dumbfounded. Normally, I reread to make sure I understand the story, but, well, I just couldn't make myself go through the story one more time. I barely got through the first time.I gave it two stars only because Garbaldon did a fine job handling the homosexuality. It was honest, but not offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I eagerly devoured the Outlander series and consider Diana Gabaldon a writer who writes an enthralling, well researched book.

I LOVE the Outlander stories and have devoured every one printed since a friend suggested the series last November. Being out of Gabaldon reading material for the first time in 10 months and headed for vacation, I ordered the first two in this series and was just really dissapointed in this one. I had to make myself finish it and that is just not usually the case with her stories. I will read the second one and see if it works any better for me.

Like that reviewer wrote, there ARE very few men & women who would turn down a chance to be with the person they love. That said, I felt a bit sorry for Lord John. The first man he dearly loved, Hector, died in battle, and the second, Jamie Fraser, who was actually quite fond of John, could never return the kind of love that John needed. John was a nice guy so it was unfair that he lost twice in the name of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am disappointed in Lord John PM, It does not seem to be written by the author of the Outlander Series.

I look forward to the next Jamie and Claire Novel, hoping that Diane has not burned out as an author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Your Nose Cauterized First","review":"I was a little leery of this Gabaldon offering, having been so thoroughly bored by The Fiery Cross, but she does know what a plot is, after all. Apparently, she was saving all her plot ideas for Lord John. It is a good, engaging mystery; but I was nauseated by the descriptions of 18th century London. I have a keen sense of smell, so all the mentions of asparagus pee, turds floating in the harbor, filth strewn streets, decomposing bodies, etc, etc. would keep me from reading any more books in this series. I'm sure it's very historically accurate, but I don't want to read about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it!","review":"I liked this book so much i went back and read Outlander.

A very interesting story of what it meant to be closeted in this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Lord John?","review":"I have enjoyed the Oulander series immensely and anxiously awaited the newest Diana Gabaldon book. As I read the Lord John book I kept wondering what it was that I missed about this character previously. Unless my memory fails me, Lord John raped both Jamie and Claire. I find it hard to understand how other reviewers find this character likeable or appealing. The historical aspects were, as always in Gabaldon books, interesting and engaging. I would have found the book more enjoyable had Ms. Gabaldon chosen a new character for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord John Gray and the Private Matter","review":"As an avid Diana Gabaldon fan, I have all of her books, and I grabbed this book the moment it was available. Unfortunately, for me, it was a huge let down. The book is defintely not a romance but a mystery, but in my opinion the mystery was pretty weak and I just could'nt get into the story at all. Because I have loved Diana's Outlander series, I was willing to try something different by this amazingly talented author, but after reading Lord John & the Private Matter, I have to say that I'll stick with the Outlander books from now on and pass on the mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh-still unfinished","review":"I started this book months and months ago and still have not finished it.It's so boring!

Lord John has SO much more to offer than this! I was very disappointed in the story and even more so by the length of the book. You said it \\"started out to be a short story\\". Make no mistake, this IS a short story! A mere chapter by your own standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series I was very disappointed in this book. The Outlander stories grip you from the beginning and keep you wanting more. I never wanted to put those books down.The characters in this book were flat and I just couldn't get into it. Miss Gabaldon's writing in this book is just not of the same quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not \\"Outlander\\"","review":"I bought this book hoping for a new Gabaldon sequel to rival \\"The Outlander\\" series. This was not that. First off the book is short, so if you're hoping for a good long, romantic, historical read--you won't get it here. While Lord John became somewhat appealing, it was short, not much of a mystery, and just generally not at the quality of writing I was used to with Outlander. I thought it a huge waste of money buying it in hardbook and would not recommend it to anyone. It is not a heterosexual love story, so be prepared. Not that that bothers me, but it was not what I expected to be reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wast of Time","review":"I did not care what happened to any of the characters. Forced myself to keep reading in case it came alive. Alas, no.

I've read and enjoyed everything from Kafka to comic books with an open mind, and it is rare to see a book with this level of plotless pondering and pox-ridden inaction. My only comfort is that I only spent $2 for this book, though it was $2 too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing; so-so plot.","review":"I was planning to like this book because I loved the Outlander series and think Gabaldon is an excellent writer. True to form, she delivers good writing again, but frankly the plot just never \\"took off\\" for me. The word \\"insipid\\" kept coming to mind. The central problems were unexciting, and even the characters seemed to think so. Too much happens inside Lord John's head, whereas I wanted to get to know him better through the eyes of others and more in-depth interactions. We readers are deprived of the thrill of discovering things for ourselves, because too much of the mystery is either disappointingly predictable; or transparent because it's spelled out either in Lord John's (revealed) thoughts, or in the tell-all discussion among several characters at the end of the book. It's a decent read, but not a page-turner by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great and unique writing from Diana Gabaldon","review":"First, I must point out that some people are obviously confusing Lord John Grey with Black Jack (Jonathan) Randall. They are two completely different characters!I really enjoyed this book and I appreciate it for what it is: a short mystery story with a really admirable and interesting main character. I get the feeling that some may be turned off by the fact that Lord John Grey is gay, but I applaud Diana Gabaldon for giving Lord John his own series of books - he deserves it! The mystery kept me engaged and, as usual, the descriptive writing and dialogue are first-rate. It is not a continuation of the Jamie and Claire books, but that is fine with me. With writing this good, I hope Diana Gabaldon continues to write more of the Outlander series, as well as other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord John and the Private Matter","review":"Being a big Diana Gabaldon fan, having read the Outlander series, some of the book twice, Lord John and the Private Matters was a total waste of time and money. I liked Lord John Gray in the other books but he was as unnecessary to the plot (but I give the book too much credit by suggesting that there actually was a plot) in Private Matters as the rest of the charcters, and I doubt anyone reading the story felt the least pang of regret that the two murder victims no longer inhabitated their world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It ain't Outlander, people","review":"Which of course Diana makes clear in her introduction.As a huge Lord John fan, I was very happy to see this book. I'm not a mystery fan at all, but I relished the chance to see my second-favorite Gabaldon character (after Himself) in action.It's a fun, light read, and great for those of us who relish historical novels as Gabaldon (as usual) has done her research.The story isn't a strong one, but I found that didn't matter. What I wanted was a chance to revisit John and get involved in the atmosphere of the world he lived in. And this book delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was a big fan of the Outlander series, but it seems as if DG has lost her way. This book is way too complicated. It has too many characters with too little development. It also has a very complicated plot, made more baffling by DG's desire to keep us in suspense, and holding back explanations for events, which you are supposed to remember and be able to stitch back together as more is slowly revealed. Maybe I just wasn't concentrating enough but I found it all quite torturous and sluggish. The whole gay underworld angle, and generally the sexual side of things, come off as salacious and sensational rather than the refreshingly open and natural effect achieved in the Outlander books. I think that's because there is very little true romance or connection between the characters. All in all very disappointing. And I love the Lord John character. <sigh>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, read that...","review":"Take one part Anne Perry and one part Amanda Quick and it turns out like this book. While reading \\"Lord John and the Private Matter\\" I was struck with a sense of deja vu and that was because similar themes have been covered in Anne Perry's \\"Pitt\\" and \\"Monk\\" series, namely the mention of the Hellfire Club which I've already overdosed on by Perry mentioning its doppleganger in every single Pitt book, it seems, and the general \\"look at these shocking mid-18th C e-vents\\".). The romantic elements, mainly the preparations for the wedding and descriptions of day-to-day family doings reminded me of Amanda Quick (aka Jayne Ann Krentz) although there wasn't a sympathetic well-drawn female in the book, at least for the first 250 pages. Over-all, it felt somewhat half-arsed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"After the love affair I have had with the Jamie/Claire books this was an anticipated delight that was dissapointing to say the least!

HO HUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I anxiously await each and every book in the Outlander series. Even though the story has become so drawn out and cumbersome, I just can't wait to find out what will happen to Jamie and Claire. So I bought this book in hopes that it would continue the saga somewhat. What a disappointment. This book is solely about Lord John Grey, a character in the Outlander series that is actually one of my least favorite. The story line is okay, but what makes the Outlander series so wonderful is that you care so much about the main characters. This main character does not interest me as Jamie and Claire do. And I was SO disappointed to learn that this is the first book of a TRILOGY! Does that mean that Ms. Gabaldon will now be spending her time writing more about Lord John and not finishing the Outlander series? Please, Ms. Gabaldon, bring back our favorite characters and let us know how that story ends before you start on another tangent with Lord John."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have read in ages","review":"I was puzzled at the assertion that Lord John was a \\"beloved\\" character from the Outlander stories. Frankly, I didn't feel that way. But this book is a total disappointment. It meanders around without actually telling a decent story and simply left me aggravated and disgusted and determined to not read anymore Lord John books.The Outlander stories are brilliant, beautifully written, and have developed characters, intricate plots, and historically accurate depictions. This first Lord John book must be something Diana Gabaldon got stuck in when she was tired of writing Jamie and Claire stories....and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord John and the Private Matter","review":"I had loved the Outlander books and I felt a sense of loss when I finished them. Natually, the next step was to get the Lord John book. Even though it's unrelated to the Outlander books, I thought it would be just as engrossing and entertaining. I was very dissappointed. The story was not that interesting and the characters were not very well developed or likable. I read the book to the end, but I really couldn't care less how it ended or what happened to these people. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord John and the Private Matter","review":"I was disappointed in this story by Diana Gabaldon. I love the Outlander novels and was curious about this one. It wasn't as well written as the Outlander series even though he is a character from the books. It actually didn't flow at all from the stories. Kind of like taking and ingredient from your favorite cake recipe and putting it in a meatloaf. Just didn't work. I do like Diana Gabaldon and hope she continues to entertain us with her delightful stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.........................","review":"I have tried to read this book twice and because I am a true Jamie & Claire fan, I finally pushed myself into reading and finishing it. DO NOT BOTHER... it was all out disappointment. There was no adventure, no thrill, nothing worth reading. Please Ms. Gabaldon, you have a huge number of fans that are Jamie & Claire fans, please write for them. Sir John is rather dull in the Outlander series, let alone give the man a whole book. If there were 0 stars, I would have put that down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not writing, this is typing","review":"I loved Outlander, though the rest of the series fell flat for me. As for this novel, it meanders through a bunch of intrigue among people that have not even been introduced (at least not in this book). There's no suspense, no character development, no action, little humor, just a lot of people blabbing at each other in various Ren Faire accents, drinking ale and eating eel pie and that sort of thing. The central character is boring. Even the plot seems like a T.V. show plot dressed in a jerkin. Except for the Ren Faire dialogue, which is of questionable historical merit, there's no flavor of the times, nothing new to learn. Too bad, Gabaldon can write like a master. But this book is like that e-mail that you get from somebody who can really type fast. The e-mail that stretches down your screen like a highway across the desert, and your eyes glaze over and you feel punished by someone you thought you liked. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Eye-Roller","review":"This story wasn't just told once. It wasn't. First we read what happened. Then we had to read the main character mentally re-capping what had just happened. Then we had to read the character justifying his next steps and analyzing his feelings about what had just happened (and this, too, felt a lot like the previous re-capping). It was just all too much! And Lord John did some really dumb things and made some very silly decisions in this book which just didn't make sense because he IS a smart guy (er, character). And my final complaint is how much I had to read about people lowering and raising their brows. Sometimes five or six times a page all these different characters were just going overboard with the quirking a brow and the furrowing a brow and the raising a brow and then... enough! Uncle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It's been a while since I read this, but I do remember being very disappointed that it didn't have more flavor to it and that it wasn't more interesting.I was so put off by this book that I haven't read another even though I really like Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.**Spoiler**The \\"private matter\\" is VD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Being used to action and plot from Gabaldon's previous novels, I have been quite disapointed in this book. It almost looks like she cannot write short stories... Too much was missing. She touched many subject on the surface and the private matter was not all that exciting. I love Lord John's character but this novell did nothing good to it. And when you get to the end expecting maybe something good... you are even more disapointed. It's just blahhh! Of course, I will most certainly read the next one of this trilogy, but I will not buy it. I'll borrow it from a friend or the library. It's not worth paying for. Too bad. I really look forward to the next book on Jamie and Claire though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The matter should have been left private!","review":"A long-time fan of Gabaldon, I pre-ordered the book before it was available on-line. What I got for my money (and much was spent) was a very different book from what I was expecting. To come from the well developped characters and plots of her previous novels and get handed a poorly developed mystery novel that takes advantage of Outlander readers by prostituting John Gray as a main character, was a huge let down. For those of you expecting an extension of the Outlander character - this book is not for you. Am not a huge mystery fan, and this one isn't even a good one. Diana - what were you thinking?? Please, back to the civil war and Jamie and Clare!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish this one.....","review":"This was definitely not what I expected from Diana Gabaldon. I kept thinking it would get better but it did not. I finally gave up. There are too many good books to read to waste time on one that is simply not worth it. I will always try another of her books.

At one moment after another, the characters jumped up and yelled, \\"Aha! Now we know!\\" while I was left thinking \\"Huh?\\" One clue does not logically connect to the next. The characters' thought processes are beyond fathoming. As far as I can tell, though the large outline of the plot seems solid, none of the little bits add up.Perhaps it will make sense to other readers, but I wouldn't bet on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not typical Diana Gabaldon","review":"I had to force myself to give this book two stars; I was tempted to give it none. But to be fair, the book is beautifully written - as is typical for Diana Gabladon. It's the story I found lacking. Gabaldon fans beware: this is a murder mystery, not a romance. And this mystery, with its convoluted plot and lack of affection-worthy characters (besides John Grey, of course) didn't hold my interest.

It's hard to follow and harder to care about the characters. Doesn't even hold a candle to \\"Outlander\\" and was a chore to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT????","review":"Blah! I wish I could have given this one a negative star. Good grief what a departure from the Outlander Series. An Echo in the Bone was terrible but I waited so long for it and was so completely disappointed I hoped maybe Diana had just taken temporary leave of her abilities. Upon discovering the Lord John Series, I gave it a try. Honestly wish I hadn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect another Outlander","review":"I greatly enjoyed Ms. Gabaldon's books about the life and times of Jamie and Claire Fraser. Never have I ventured into the \\"romance\\" section of a bookstore but did so to find the subsquent novels to Outlander. I find her books are like chocolate, you finish one, you want another. That is how I felt after finishing the Fiery Cross.Lord John and the Private Matter is another story. The book is not the same page-turner that you may have come to expect from Ms. Gabaldon's books. This is a quick read for a lazy afternoon. In my view, it fits in with the \\"dime-a-dozen\\" mystery novels that are out there. You will not miss anything about the story of the Frasers if you skip this one.I still remain a fan of Ms. Gabaldon's but will probably not pursue any further stories about Lord John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord John and the Private Matter","review":"This book was good, the same quality of work as Diana Gabaldon usually produces. I was pleased that she finally wrote a book with Lord John in it. He plays a critical role in how the main characters interact throughout the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It would be an understatement to say that I was disappointed with this book. The whole style of this manual is like something that you would get handed at a seminar. This book supposedly shows how to build a Mook Jong dummy for cheaper than those available. However the details are very sparse. In addition I would question the usability of the dummy constructed...This is the first one that I have seen with the arms constructed of steel pipes. There are much better plans available for free on the web, my advise therefore is save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good place to start","review":"Definitely a good place to start if you're looking for help on building your own dummy. It has a good foundation, but unfortunately, that's about it. The layout is pretty bad- the step will reference a picture that's about 3 pages over. Pictures are adequate (in number) and good quailty, but are B&W. The book's price is also on the high side. The last section was unique in that it illustrates how to build a 'human response' dummy- a dummy that has moving arms and life-like response. A solid 2.5 stars- a good foundation with detailed steps, but not much else. If you're looking for a beginner's guide to building book, pick this one up for reference. Supplement this book with free mook jong plans found on the internet. Don't have time to build your own dummy- check out www.mookjong.20m.com JG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Man's Dummy","review":"Although innovative in many ways, this guide to making cheap muk jongs is not worth the price asked. If it were priced at $9.95, it might be worth a look, but at $16 plus shipping it lacks enough in content to make it not worth the more expensive price.Having said that, it should be noted that this book explains how to make a cheap man's version of a wooden man---NOT a traditional Wing Chun dummy. Keep in mind, the title of the book is \\"The Mook Jong Construction Manual\\" not \\"How to Make Your Own Traditional Wing Chun Dummy.\\" It is a guide to making an economical muk jong which mimics the Wing Chun wooden dummy, but lacks the beauty and finesse of the real thing. Contrary to what's stated, you will need some carpentry skills, tools, and an abundant amount of time before it's finished.Finally, the details in the construction procedures and b/w pictures shown were good enough for a novice to contruct a dummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It seems that the author completly missed the point. Traditional wooden dummy measures are mostly wrong, since they are based on false assumptions. Look for correct measures at the internet, for free. Woodwork techniques descriptions are fine and the mounting system description may be useful, but again, there are better ones available for free at the internet. Its \\"human response\\" dummy still has to prove its usefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The arms and legs and body of the dummies that this man is making aren't even close to the traditional sizes. If you are looking for an idea or drafting plan on how to make a real traditional dummy don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I saw his product it ruined my day","review":"Waste of time and money unless you want to build an unorthodox-ed dummy. Part of the title says traditional, but there was nothing traditional about his traditional dummy. Bad Dobi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Quality Construction Dummies","review":"This manual is only for individuals that don't care about the quality of their wooden dummy construction. I really feel that people can do better than this - even without construction experience. Spend some time when making your dummy. Research the internet for dummy plans. There are quality plans out there. Trust me. You don't want to have a cheap dummy. Its something that you can have your entire life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my stuff?","review":"I bought this book about four months ago and it never arrived, beware if you buy this book, you could get scammed just like i was..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers to any woman's questions about all aspects of life","review":"This book offers concise, scriptural advice to women regarding many areas that are often undefined and unclear, e.g., teenagers, aging parents, dating, divorce, marital conflict, communication, etc. The answers are brief, yet helpful.

It shipped quickly and it came in great condition and I have been enjoying it since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is one of the my favorite orchestral CDs. Do not be mislead - John Williams is the conductor, not the composer of all these pieces. Itzhak Perlman, the greatest violinist alive (imho), is instantly recognizable. This album...is worth the money just to hear the Tango from \\"Scent of A Woman.\\" But just in case you are not satisfied by that, there's the stirring Papa, Can You Hear Me? from \\"Yentl\\" - the violin being so expressive you wonder if words were ever necessary. The evocative Manha de Carnaval from \\"Black Orpheus\\" (with its gorgeous guitar), the theme from \\"Schindler's List\\" and the romantic I Will Wait for You from \\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\\" are also must-hears. I did not care for The Age of Innocence theme, and a few of the pieces in the middle are not too distinctive (e.g. Sabrina), but I still give this four stars. I like to listen to it on rainy days or evenings; it is very conducive to daydreaming. Overall, a very beautiful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good flick, Bootleg DVD","review":"The film is solid entertainment. Thanks to it's overall silliness, nifty mutant cat puppets, and classic horrible dialogue, it never approaches boring. It's well worth a purchase for b-movie fans, despite the vhs quality picture, lack of extras, and extremely shoddy cover (mine looked like it was printed on a home printer that was running out of color ink). The whole package feels like a bootleg."},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad it's freakin awesome.","review":"I took me forever to find out the name of this film. I saw when I was a kid late one night on TV and it stuck with me. When I saw it was coming to DVD I pre-ordered it. Everything about this movie is terrible yet great at the same time. When I got it in the mail, I bought 2 six packs and invited a few friends over to watch it. We had a great time watching it and making fun of it. My friends still bring it up from time to time in idle conversation.I'd give the film 5 stars if they would have kept the original VHS cover art. The cover on the DVD is generic and the cat displayed looks nothing like the one in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Book to Inspire Gold Rush Fever Nostalgia!","review":"This book gives a journalist's view of the Yukon Gold Rush of 1896 (and beyond) in a most enjoyable way. It's particularly excellent reading if you've been recently inspired with that topic by a visit to the area, which includes Skagway, AK - a common cruise ship stop. (Which I recently thoroughly enjoyed.) Expect little, and be surprised by how much grows out of the little insights your newsman (the author) keeps feeding you regarding the people of that unique era!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful first-hand account of the Klondike Gold Rush","review":"A collection of turn-of-the-century newspaper columns byStroller White, \\"Klondike Newsman\\" vividly recaptures whatit was like to be in bustling Northern towns like Skagway and Dawson City around the time of the Gold Rush. White's columns are both funny and historically valuable. A real treat and a pleasant surprise. The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is because the editors do not do a good enough job of placing White and his writings in historical perspective. All in all, though, I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, spacious, neat looking","review":"I bought this to carry my macbook air (in its sleeve) and other books and file folders. It accommodates all these very easily. It has a strong lining that protects the contents. The base is flat and rectangular and helps the bag stand on its own. The side pocket has many compartments that I haven't even populated. I slip my iPhone into the outer side pocket (probably meant for a bottle) and it is safe there, and easily accessible. Good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Port Authority Tote Bag","review":"I was looking for a tote with a zipper to protect my belongings from the weather and also keep them from falling out while in transit. This bag exceeded my expectations. It has so many pockets both inside and out. There are two on each outside end that are deep enough to keep my water bottle from falling out. There are also two pockets on each side, one has a velcro flap and the other doesn't have a flap but does close with velcro. The heavy duty straps are adjustable and the material is very strong yet easy care. I am extremely satisfied with this bag. No online sales regret here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag","review":"At first I had reservations about ordering a microfiber bag, but when I got it, I was pleased! My IPad fits perfectly in the from pocket along with the charger! It's not too big but big enough to hold all of my things which is important bd sues I'm in the insurance business! It doesn't look cheap at all! Get this bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this bag","review":"I wanted a large bag to more carefully carry my Iphone - but it had to hold all my other stuff too; every woman knows what that means. This bag is lovely - but more of a shopping bag. It has so many pockets, zippered, snapped and otherwise that I actually couldn't find my Iphone one day. Go figure! But, I've got all the different places memorized now and the bag works well for me. I could probably carry a lot more - and will probably do so. It's very attractive and I like the microfiber as it cleans up nicely and works well in the remote Michigan climate I live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professors thoughtful investigation","review":"I have read this book several times, and I have found it an accurate and thoughtful description of my church.

They all played a role in a real-life passion play and I enjoyed every word. It was written with a wonderfully personal point of view and told with an honesty and memory that was jaw-dropping. Thank you and congratulations for all the people you will touch with this account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"It takes a lot of guts to do what Brett Hartman has done, tell the world about a very personal experience that many people would feel shamed by. He has written a book not only about persistence, but how the power of family, friends and inner strength can be used to turn what for most would be a negative experience into a foundation for which he has built his professional career. The book is funny, sad, hopeful and certainly a wake up call for the psychiatric community. It should be a \\"must-read\\" for all students entering the fields of psychiatry and clinical psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book!!!","review":"A friend told me to read this book because she said it was better than works by James Frey and Frank McCourt (and definitely better than Brooke Shields) -- without the hype. After completing it, I agree. This memoir was so rich and so alive that I couldn't let it go. From start to finish, it gripped me. And it did so in different ways. At times it was painfully sad, especially the struggle for sanity in the face of psychiatric oppression. But then, inevitably, it shifted into something so funny I would bust into laughter. And, even more, it was educational. It taught me about a crisis in mental health that affects millions of people. I can't say enough positives about it. Read this book. Treat yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured.","review":"The owl head lays much flatter to the head than in the picture.

But the quality is absolutely terrible. Cramming two movies onto each side of a DVD results in a poor watching experience. And there are a lot of video and audio dropouts. This is worse than watching UHF on a B&W; TV in the 70's when you are just barely able to pick up a signal.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good movies but poor quality","review":"At the time of this review this product is $17.99.Considering the availability of some of these movies, I would say it is worth it. But as some have said here, the quality of both audio and video is bad.Most of the time it is not both with one movie.For instance, Viva Django, good picture-bad audio.Trinity and Bambino, bad picture-ok audio.But, if you want these for your collection, $17.99 is not a bad price for 10 movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"To say that the Spaghetti Western Bible Vol. 1 was a good idea that Grindhouse poorly executed is a statement of kindness for they truly bungled everything but the packaging of this DVD release.

Not really the laid back smoothness of the Killers, except when the album loses some steam at the end. Perhaps this is why the album is unfortunately only 36 minutes.My favorite song so far is \\"Can't Lose.\\" The transition to the Chorus is simple, yet so pleasing. And like many of these songs, many people can relate to the song's lyrics.If you like straight-forward rock-pop with just enough everyday meaning, give this album a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bands are destined to remain opening acts","review":"And this is one of them.

This is definitely making it into my movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie...","review":"I live in Seattle, so I know that this movie was shot mostly in Canada. They're not on Orcas Island, they're at the Sooke Harbour House on Victoria Island, and the high tea is at the Empress Hotel, but I was so wrapped up in the plot that I thought it more amusing than annoying.The story is wonderful. I could definitely relate to Amy (Kimberly Williams Paisley)...and absolutely fell in love with Peter. (Patrick Dempsey) Sometimes I just replay scenes with Peter's monologues.

Her character Dana is compared to The OC's Summer Roberts and Angel's Cordelia Chase. I bet on high school, Kimberly Williams was a popular in-crowd girl or an goody two shoes over acheiver.

The plot is about a young man who is struggling to figure out what to do with his sexual urges, and his life as a gay person attempting to be straight is complicated by the fact that he lives in a 1960's Southern town full of religious bigots on the order of the vicious Ku Klux Klan. In this setting, the religious people of the town are easily fooled at best, and at worst, completely racist and full of murderous hatred toward blacks and gays. Fathers in this novel are illiterate, disabled, or arrogantly hateful toward both blacks and gays. I found it kind of sad that the gay men in the story did not have intelligent, strong fathers to help them through the most vulnerable times of their lives. The author's message seems to be that accepting ones' own homosexual orientation is therapeutic, definitely not something everyone would agree with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HAIR MIRACLE - DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS!","review":"I've tried a lot of high end shampoos and masks and while I'm generally pleased with most I've tried, I SIMPLY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE how this makes ny hair feel.

I have fragile, dry, porous, relaxed (African American)hair that breaks easily but this masks makes every strand feel so STRONG ...almost like the elasticity is restored to my hair. LOVE it!

The clarinet-paying is not only virtous ,also very melodic. The Composer was an clarinet player.-st.(I have nearly all cds with Clarinet Concertos of the Classical Era )These concertos by Lefevre 1763-1829 are with the concerto by Franz Krommer Op.36 and the Concerto by Joseph Eybler my favourite out of the very large collection of Clarinet Concertos.This is an outstanding CD , witch brings a lot of pleasure . Charming Rondos in the final Movements with a dizziness Virtuosity.

I used wooden or silicon utensils to prevent scratches but the non-stick did start to peel off - had to trash it since once it does that it's toxic. I always used low heat when cooking and was very careful not to scratch the surface.

I am also a fan of films, documentaries, and films about music. I am also a fan of DIY productions. The quality of this DVD falls short. The only positive thing that stood out to me was that the audio quality was much better than I would have anticipated. But with that said, almost none of this DVD is actually Castanets! WTF!! This DVD should have been included with a Castanets album in my opinion. Or better yet, they should have waited until they actually had a film to release.

However, I found the plot to be all right, but did not end up sharing the opinion that this author deserves such praise. His protagonist seems rather slow to realize what is happening to his life. I never understood who the jazz man was, or why he took an interest. I finished the book, still not with any sense of satisfaction. I found the statements describing the sex act to be ridiculous. Very juvenile \\"tube steak??\\" Come on.Pleased that 5 of you liked it, but I will bypass this author. I am an admirer of Deaver, DeMille, M.

I decided that with a newer version I would take advantage of the on-line features offered. I ran into trouble when I tried to register the product. I finally called the telephone number provided for support and found that the company that bought Broderbund does not provide support for this version, only the new versions. They did not want to talk to me once they found I was using a brand new copy of Version 11. Because I could not even register the product, I cannot use any of the on-line features. It works just fine for building a family tree, but I thought I paid for more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I bought these speakers to go with my new iPod nano, and they worked OK for about 2 weeks, except that their sound isn't incredibly powerful.

But I have listened to \\"These are The Days\\" and \\"From The Damage\\", and I really love both of those songs. I think O-Town has grown a lot since their last album. I did enjoy their last album, but it was too \\"boy-bandish\\". They've really grown since then, and it's refreshing to see a band that can grow musically and come out the better for it. The only problem I have with this album is their knock-off of \\"Careless Whisper\\" by Wham, in their song \\"I Only Dance With You\\". That was a good song, and no offense, but their version of it (or whatever that is) is not so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sophomore Jinx strikes again","review":"O2 is a collection of what??

With this one, I don't even know where to begin. They tried to take their music in a completely different direction, and if you ask me, totally failed. They were really good, and now I can't stand them. It seemed as though they were forced to write music, and tried way too hard. My sincere advice to the consumer reading this is buy the Justin Timberlake album instead, you'll be much more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring CD","review":"I love O-Town, don't get me wrong but in comparison to their first album this one is BORING! The only song that held my interest is \\"I Only Dance With You\\". It seems as though they tried harder on their first album than on this one.

The great thing was I just turned it on and there it was, a level line that was easily movable when I needed it. It was also much easier not to have to hold a level with one hand and try to drive nails or screws with the other. Although initially it may seem the price is high, I would have to say that my PLS2 almost paid for itself on one job because of time saved. A couple of notes: one set of batteries lasted the whole basement job, and I probably had it on twice as much as i needed to, also, I tested it outside and found that with the detector I could use it up to about 300 feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feel to these clubs","review":"I bought these clubs for my son's birthday.

I then thought I should try a non Pitt novel, and after reading the reviews here chose Dark Watch. Sorry, but this book is real crap. The writing was not nearly as good, the plot twists are crazier than normal, and there is so much description of weapons, and how much repairs cost, and the international banking system that I started turning pages looking for some action or dialogue to keep me going.

Nothing here really coalesces, this is not a very strongly plotted book for all of the things \\"that happen\\", as is often the case with Wallace's weaker efforts it feels like a drunken story that more peters out than finishes.

The movie, \\"Cannery Row\\", which is excellent, by the way, actually incorporates events from both books. I have read all of Steinbeck's books. I bought this one for my brother, as a present. He enjoyed it thoroughly. This is a good read for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaleidoscope were brilliant","review":"Brilliant musicians who wrote and recorded brilliant songs.

It almost seems like he was running out of ideas and decided that enough time had elapsed that he could get away with redoing old stuff. Still, there's some great original stuff. There's also a lot of Hill's Angels dancing. While I enjoyed this as an adolescent, now it seems more like filler fluff. I still watch it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Rock Climb!","review":"I thought this was a very good book but didn't cover the aspesctets of in door or plastic climbing.

There is no doubt at all that God would not approve of any marriage built on such lies.The author has decided to stay for her own reasons, but she cannot justly claim that God directed her to live such a marriage.I, for one, will never read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"better to make your own","review":"I'm a fan of old school editions of Latin texts, especially when they're out of copyright and I can assign them to my classes without bankrupting my students. This edition, however, is very dodgy. I knew it was just going to be a scan of an older edition, but it includes underlining and marks on some of the pages, and my copy, at least, skips from p. 43 to p. 83, thus eliminating most of De Clementia and several letters. It does include the commentary for these texts, so ... Also, the pages being considerably larger than the original edition, the text has been enlarged accordingly, a large-print edition, so to speak. Instead of buying this edition, it is much more worth your while (and just as legal) to simply xerox a library copy and ask a copyshop to bind it up nicely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Earth-Resources College-Level Textbook","review":"This is a well-done, profusely illustrated,introduction to mining and mineral resources"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Publisher","review":"\\"Greeting cards by Sergio Cruz . . . 12 full-color 4 3/4 x 4 3/4\\" square blank greeting cards with envelopes and decorative box.

Episodes 27 and 28 build up to the fight in episodes 29 and 30. The last two episodes of this volume are quite possibly two of the most emotional episodes I have ever seen in any anime series. All of the young pilots go into battle again and the onslaught of emotions causes the loss of several main characters. This volume really shows the down-side of war and is a masterpiece in capturing the hearts of the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lost Album","review":"I just finished some extensive research on this album.

I have the vinyl burned onto CD and couldn't find any information on it on the web anywhere. So if you are reading this in desperation about where \\"Austin Texas\\" fell off the earth- fret no more. By the way- This is an excellent album and I highly recommend it if you are even remotely into dirty rock and blues. His riffs are amazing. When I put in the the cd player it stays for weeks at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or fiction?","review":"I question how much of this book really happened. I'm sure there was a relationship between the author and Jane, and I don't doubt Jane took advantage of their friendship. Still, I find it difficult to believe the author was so mesmerized that she gave Jane complete control of her life. She is a seemingly intelligent woman with a supportive family - why did she stay?

This is just a self-pitying GenXer making her mistakes someone else's and calling it \\"art\\". That she sold her story reflects publishing's hunger for a post-Dave Eggers line of dead mother stories, not any merit on the part of this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I bought this over the summer, and as an ecologist and bird enthusiest, I wanted a good pair of binoculars with a camera built in so I can capture good shots of birds in their natural habitat. The magnification was pretty good, I could see things from a pretty far distance. However, every single one of my pictures that I took were very blurry. Being that its almost impossible to stand perfectly still or to NOT shake or move at all, these are not functional camera binoculars if you cant get a clear picture. Especially when you'rein the field and want to get a quick shot. The only way to get a clear shot is to put it on a tripod, and thats too much trouble and not possible when out in the field and you come across a great photo opportunity. By the time you set up everything, its too late! More thought needs to be put into these products before manufacturing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product.","review":"These binoculars are horrible. First off, the software is way too complex (and I am a software engineer so I know it doesn't need to be that way). My dad, who is good with computers, couldn't even get the pictures off the camera. And of course the ONLY way to get the pictures of the camera is through the Roxio software (i.e no way of browising to the pictures). But the worst thing is the picture quality. The picture my dad took of deer were all dark and blurry. I thought maybe it was him taking pictures wrong, so I took some pictures at my well-lit workplace. COMPLETE GARBAGE! So,If you buy this after reading this review then I think that you and these binoculars are a perfect match. BTW, I have the camera binoculars from Simmons, which are not that great, but at least they are functional, which is light years ahead of these Bushnell ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The camera requires an unusual battery that isn't included. So I went to Radio Shack to get the battery. The camera powered up. I inserted a 2GB SD memory card. The screen showed an error message \\"ECO\\" that wasn't in the manual. I called Bushnell and they said it can't handle bigger than a 1GB memory card. That isn't in the manual. I tried to remove the memory card but it wouldn't come out. I tried harder, got it out, and now the camera won't power up.Other complaints: the SD memory card slot isn't covered so rain or sand could get into it. The binoculars are OK but have the black shadows of a narrow exit pupil size. This is as bad as 10x20 binoculars, even though the 8x30 binoculars should have an exit pupil twice the diameter of a 10x20!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Sports!!!","review":"My wife purchased one of these for my b-day.

As for storytelling itself though, I felt the author left too much out. I could tell the author knew his characters. Unfortunately I did not; I was left hanging when, after completing the first read-through, there was no ultimate delivery. I never felt like I had any sort of real grasp of any character. While I do not mind this while reading (for example, Catch-22 is a great book for re-reading as I learn the characters more completely each time), I do appreciate more detail into the characterizations. I may be beating around the bush here... While I enjoy books that make me an active part of the story (Palahniuk, for example, requiring an active participant in the audience), I do not enjoy when I have to do 50% or more of the detail within my own imagination. This book did not fulfill my needs in supplementing the plot.

There was no plot to the story; no purpose behind any activity the \\"characters\\" went thru; even the bizarre happenings were left unexplained and contained no metaphors. Basically it's just ramblings with the same people popping up again and again. I was hoping for surrealism with a good story behind it. If that's what you're looking for too, look away from here.

Although it doesn't have as many songs as 'X 2003' (34 songs to 18, I wasn't very happy about that), but the music is still great.

The real letdown is the Blockbuster decision, two days after my purchase, to stock only BlueRay in most of its stores. I am a Blockbuster online member and will not be affected immediately, but the danger of the HD-DVD format going obsolete has certainly gone up now.This player itself does the job, however, displaying gorgerous 1080p images on a matching monitor.

I had returned an HD-A2 already, as it would hang sometimes when changing layers on dual layer SD (standard) DVDs. The A20 does sometimes have a perceptible \\"glitch\\" when changing layers, but no more than that. My impression is that the 1080p picture looks better than the A2's 1080i did, but that might just be wishful thinking. Obviously, as with and HD-DVD player, you'll get a little better (\\"lossless\\") audio if you have an HDMI-equipped receiver, but I'm happy to use optical digital cables for now and upgrade in a couple years.One thing I strongly suggest, though, is that you attach this to the internet using the ethernet port in the back.

I mainly took the plunge into HD DVD because I don't buy movies, and will not have to rebuild my library if it happens that Blu-Ray wins the format war.The Toshiba HD-A20 works great. I haven't had any issues with it. My only complaint is that it takes a while to boot up, and it cannot be controlled with any other remotes.But that's small beans.

This model does 5.1 surround but not 7.1 trueHD, not like the higher models. Updating the player through the internet is straight forward once you get your network settings right. It has the best upsampling of regular DVDs for the price. It's pretty quiet compared to my other componants (right now my HD-cable box is running loud right now).

Leaving you with the HD-DVD player and no new HD-DVD movies, while all the new movies will be release on Blu-Ray.I highly recommend investing on a Blu-Ray player instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass half full","review":"Instead of looking at the glass half empty why not look on the brighter side? This player is still priced at or under the price of similar standard DVD players. It has an excellent upconverter and if you want to invest in the firesale of HD dvd's You can get some great looking movies for the same price or lower than their standard dvd counterparts. Check out the sale right here at Amazon for some incredible deals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toshiba HD-A20 1080p HD DVD Player","review":"Does just what is claims to do. It works and works beautifully. My only negative is with the remote...small buttons, not easy to use with one hand and in odd placement. No button loghting. Overall a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful picture","review":"1080p video looks fantastic on this player. Sometimes the player says unsupported video and audio and I have to turn it on and off again. That is a pain. It must be a glitch in the software. HD DVD is far superior to regular DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding picture","review":"I have had this player for a week now connected to my Toshiba 65-hm167 on 1080p and couldn't be happier with the quality of the picture. The blacks are astounding even when upconverting from a sd-dvd without drowning the picture in black like I have seen in older players that upconverted.All around I couldn't be happier with it. My only concern, and any comments or help from others who own the player would be very helpful. I am not sure if it did it the first three times I used the player, but lately it takes a long time to initially boot up and allow me to play a movie, or eject the tray. Is this common among the model, or is there something wrong with mine.If it is my unit I will exchange, if not, is is a mild concern that does not take away from the great price, and phenominal pciture.Great HD-DvD plauer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Incredible picture and sound. My only complaint is the load times, but its a small price to pay for the picture and sound quality. Once you've seen 1080p on a Sony XBR2 LCD you will never want to watch regular DVDs again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This HD DVD player is great. Lots of features, the only thing is that it takes a minute to warm up, not a big deal. Good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great player, works fine right out of the box","review":"I took this player out of the box and connected it to my HDTV at 1080p with an HDMI cable. Works perfectly and delivers a fantastic picture. Highly recommended if you want the best pictures on your HDTV. New users should be aware that \\"boot up\\" time for a machine such as this is about a minute after you turn it on, unlike regular DVD players which are ready in a few seconds. This is just a characteristic of high-definition players, which are really special-purpose computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is nothing else out there but it is very limited","review":"1) it is not dual voltage , it only works in the US _ what if........2) it does not play many dvd-s created with computer programs it does not play PAL dvd-sin outher words if you stay put buy what they sell you (and wth the price want to subsidize the fossilized recording and film industry) and have to buy one , buy it3) for me it only worked with s-video with most lcd and plazma screens i tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Do not buy any Toshiba HD DVD players. Press releases state that they are no longer in the HD DVD business. They have quit making them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had the same experience as the previous poster. The belt is too thin to work with my buckle.

I ordered this one and found out very quickly that the canvas belt is not thick enough for the buckle to grip. It simply does not work. You put in and tighten it and it just comes loose. Get a real one, not this chinese copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but some how entertaining","review":"As most people say, this is obviously a Sy-fy original movie so it will be very mediocre. However, the cheap special effects still give me a good laugh and make the movie entertaining. You know you have found an enjoyable movie when you can talk about it for a while afterwards, whether good or bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Cooper - 'Live At The Whiskey A Go-Go' (Edsel)","review":"Just a mite similar to that of the umteen-something times released 'Live In Toronto 1969' or 'Slack Alice'(see my review),but better.Appears to have a different track listing as well for the most part.Tunes I was only too thrilled to fully experience within this vintage live recording were \\"Levity Ball\\"(sure wish he'd play this track while out on tour sometime),\\"Swing Low,Sweet Cheerio\\" and \\"Changing Arranging\\".A should-have for all Cooper fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Alice!!!!","review":"This contains early Alice Cooper tracks and frankly it isn't great but it is worth having not for any songs particularily but it is the beginning of an American institution Alice Cooper, plus trust me Alice goes on to bigger and better things. This is one only for the diehards so if you are new to Alice buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very angry.","review":"These stupid gloves ripped the second time i put them on my hands. I would only recommend then to someone who feels like wasting 30 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Album","review":"This album has little inspiration. The cowboy junkies sound to me like they're not having any fun at all. Since the group is called Cowboy Junkies I guess it makes sense that they produced on this album junk. And what on earth is that line in the song that says: \\"who gave this power to that f#cker up there.\\" I hope they're not talking about the lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the Junk I want","review":"I love Cowboy Junkies music and song writing this record was writen after the death of Townes Van Zandt a good friend and fellow preformer with the band. This record is just plain depressing and not very good. I have loved all the other records and know them in and out. I have struggled to like this record, but Just can't. The Junkies have done better before and after this.I would list the Junkies top five as1) Caution Horses (Margo is Mello Mikes best song writting)2) White Off earth (bluesy primal Junkies)3) Trinity session (Almost a religous experience)4) Pale sun Cresent moon (Junk with some rock riff that are out of this world)5) Open (More rock and roll sound harsh mid range sound they are so famous for)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have waited anxiously for this album and I am bummed! It's blah, it's boring, and it sounds like any other \\"center of the road\\" type music. This is not Cowboy Junkies--there is nothing in the words or music that grabs you, holds on to you, or haunts you. Please, Junkies, don't make us wait 2 years for more cutsie, geezing stuff again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"love their CD's but not this one","review":"They went for an obvious Pop sound on this one and I gave it away to anyone who would take it after trying for six months to like it. Every track sounds over-produced. Margo's voice track is often hidden under a lot of studio production. Really, it is dreck. Buy \\"Lay it Down\\" which is amazing. They lost me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"Not my favorite, but it grows on me every time I hear it. My faves are Darkling Days , No Birds Today and Summer of Discontent. Dunno what's the big hullaballoo about Someone Out There. Did anyone wonder if \\"that F-er out there\\" might refer to a televangelist--someone entirely deserving of that derogatory label... I'm seeing them in concert tomorrow night. Can't wait..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Junkies' Best efforts!","review":"As others have noted, this album is indeed a departure for the Cowboy Junkies from their more somber albums, to this more upbeat effort. I think the change served them well. This album takes the changes started in \\"Lay it Down\\" one GOOD step forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles from the expected...","review":"Extremely disappointing...this CD is miles from what is expected from the Cowboy Junkies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I dont have the words to explain this. You just have to listen to it. And when you have listen to it once you want to listen to it again and after that you understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"COWBOY JUNKIES MILES FROM HOME AND LOST.","review":"Being a devoted Junkies fan and anxoiusly awaiting their new cd all I can say is I feel lost. Miles From Our Home is such an apt descrption of where the junkies have gone. Gone are the days of hearing a truely unique sound: clear vocals, poetic lyrics, and oh that voice of Margo's. And replaced with what? Margo's voice being muted by grating guitar backgrounds, and melodies that can only be discribed as boring. If this is the result of growth or experimentation it was a great step backwards, no backwards is exactly where this group needs to go. For those who are new to this group check out their earlier cd's and hear true genius. They had their niche, there was no one else to compete against them. With this cd they have thrown that away and joined the mainstream, a mainstream that is littered with groups with this sound. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying!","review":"I loved the Cowboy Junkies last Cd and was anxiously awaiting this new release. After several listens, I have found this album to be a snooze fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too poppish for me","review":"I love the Junkies: I don't care for pop. This album is a foray into a pure pop sound--very disappointing. I would highly recommend finding a way to preview this album before purchasing it, especially if you have been hypnotized by the Trinity Sessions. I consider myself flexible, but the turn of style ranks in betrayal right up there with Elvis Costello's Burt Bacharach fiasco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Transition for the Junkies","review":"The sound is more layered on this CD than previous outings. HOLLOW AS A BONE just may be the song that introduces the Junkies to a wider audience. I frequently have it on repeat. Margo Timmins' sublime voice bridges the gap between melancholy musing and hard core anguish. Yet, one feels oddly hopeful at the end of a good listen. They're not just for cold gray Sunday mornings anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing follow-up to Lay it Down...","review":"After buying their Lay it Down CD I was expecting more of the same great songs. Not only did the music seem half-hearted, some of the lyrics were rather offensive. If you're of the religious persuasion you may want to skip this offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"C - R - A - P !!!","review":"This must be one the the crapiest, stupid dumb movie I've seen in decades.Story is soooo boring... no plot, no acting, nothing worth your time.This sucks big time... pass on...really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer Seemed Funny...","review":"But we didn't laugh at all during at least the half of it we watched. Seriously, this film sucks, and only 1 of the 6 girls was at all attractive. Skinny, stereotypical brain dead cheerleaders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"This movie is garbage. Don't waste your time or money watching it. It's ridiculous and has no plot whatsoever. The only reason we watched it is because we had a free credit from Amazon to purchase any movie and unfortunately this was chosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildest Slasher Movie Of The Year!","review":"Girls Gone Dead is a fun throwback to 80's slasher movies, like Slumber Party Massacre and Sorority House Massacre. It's got it all: nudity, gore, humor, and a good killer. What it lacks is originality and characters to care about. There's a ton of characters in this thing, but most of them were douchebags. Oh, well. At least we get to see them get hammered. Also, in the funniest scene of the movie we get to see Linnea Quigley sing some awful country song. I would loved to have seen her have a bigger part in this movie, but she only appeared in a couple of scenes. Girls Gone Dead is worth seeing for the slasher fan and I hope there is a sequel someday. Every successful slasher needs a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what you are expecting!","review":"This movie is exactly what you think it is. That being said, it is better than most due to production values and attractive women. When I say attractive women, I mean they did a casting call and some of the girls did not make the cut (I'm looking at you every movie by The Asylum).It also gets a bonus star for being actually scary. Not the story, or the tone or even the freaky killer. The scariest part of this movie was Beetlejuice. Seriously. That guy gives me the creeps. Worth a rental and the picture quality (streaming) was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls Gone Unfunny","review":"Don't believe the hype about this movie. They wasted the talents of Jerry Lawler and others. There is plenty of T&A; in this movie but the nudity just don't cut it. None of the gals are really that hot not that I wanted all of them to be but it is like they almost wanted to turn you off with the nudity. I have to give the movie credit as it was well lit and the sound was perfect but unfortunately the dialogue got boring and annoying. The humor was out of sync. I mean if you want to watch a really bad movie with nudity thrown in and gore go for it but I laughed all the way throughPiranha DDcompared to having fast forward parts of this trash. I found it totaly unfunny and annoying. I say avoid, the nudity isn't worth it and I found no laughs not even at the bad acting or dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"NRBQ keep rollin' along","review":"This album is proof that NRBQ are still one of the finest bar/party bands around. While the previous \\"Tokyo\\" live CD included some good tracks, this disc contains a fantastic performance by the band. The addition of the horn section fills things out with some great playing. The guys still work magic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely old and boring - Don't buy!!","review":"Don't buy this! I recently purchased this set, thank god I didn't pay full price! The videos have some real footage that makes you think about your own life, but most of the footage appears to be staged and is extremely old. Just before something happens the camera tends to looks away and comes back to show you somthing dead, but because you don't see it, it is easy to figure out that most of this is probably fake. Don't get me wrong, some of it is real and is sick, but it's not worth buying the whole set. Tape #5 & #6 contains some of the same footage from #3 and #4. Mostly shows dead animals from slaughter houses, cadavers, old police footage and is very slow. It's easy to see that many of the deaths are completely fake and were staged. Be prepared to fall asleep. It's not worth [price]! Spend your money on a something else, trust me!! Try buying one of the videos first (make sure it's not #1)and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money. FAKE","review":"Unless you want to see fake death scenes dont waste your money on these tapes. 95% of the footage in these tapes are fake.

Too late, it's in your head now and can't really be washed away.That's what you get with Faces of Death. Plus, there's a good plenty of staged scenes that are being passed off as actual footage of something gruesome. It is gruesome, but still a hoax.I saw this when I was in my early teens and guess what... those images still rattle around in my head to no good effect. Fill your mind with something that will benefit it."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"this is the most abhorrent piece of crap that has ever been filmed. never have i seen the amount of useless trash that i have in this film. it is filled with boring narration and literally NO violence and NO gore.

These films are not only entertaining, but they are a reminder of the freedom that every American possesses to rent video captured executions if he pleases. For beautiful, for spacious skies, for crimson tinted executions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use some sense here, folks.","review":"You hear the repeated clamorings. . . \\"Faces of Death\\" is REAL! SHOCKING! HORRIBLE! If it's so real, then why is it selling unbanned? The film community has a hard time getting Dario Argento's work available in America, and we KNOW it's staged. Just take a second to think about it . . . you can see this ridiculous high-school bragging right at a drive-in somewhere in America almost any weekend of the summer . . . what community in their RIGHT mind is going to show true wholesale murder and mutilation to the public? We may be on the close side of Roman, but we're not there just yet. The only snuff occurring here is your wallet . . . and any semblance of respect the makers of these films would have ever had for you.

This movie made me want to shoot myself in the face. Some of the dead bodies and stuff are real, but it's no more gruesome than that show about tornadoes I saw on Discovery the other night. Don't try to find another movie that's more realistic or w/ better death scenes, just save that money for Colt 45 and porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"We see it on tv everyday!","review":"When i first wiewed this movie i was shocked. How the hell could anyone whant to see a movie like this? These days they show on tv everyday, on the news,on \\"The worlds scariest police shootouts\\". The even showed FOD#1 on the theatre in Lund in Sweden. See it if you want, but some times the real world is worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick to the first one!","review":"The first movie was pretty cool, and as long as you don't google what parts of the video is real and what is fake, it can be hard to distinguish it at times. I liked the first narrator, the second guy that takes over the show just makes it so corny.I'd love to see this come out on DVD in better quality, or for a new more realistic one to be released.There are some real images of death in this movie, so if you think you can handle that sort of stuff, this could be the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I've seen almost all of the videos in this set and as \\"disturbing\\" as some may think that they are...it is not. The occasional seen is real but only when showing seens of animals being slaughtered and the odd suicide attempt.

It is always important to read both sides of any argument, and this book attempts to give a cogent response to Spong's theses. However, the actual execution of these articles was very poorly done. First, it was obvious that this was a series of completely independent articles that were only minimally edited, resulting in a massive amount of repetition. Second, the commentaries were mostly emotional, and rarely delved into Spong's specific arguments. There are 5-10 pages of actual rigorous criticism in the entire book (these pages do bring up 2-3 good points). Overall, this book does not successfully shoot down even a minority of Spong's theses. Buy it for your reference library, but only to demonstrate unconvincing arguments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay bashing","review":"I have read nearly every book by John Shelby Spong. I was surprized and delighted when I discovered that a Churchman offers intellectually honest Bible study which is an antidote to fundamentalist fag-bashing. (I have since learned that Spong is not alone, nor especially in the minority.) If Spong writes, as one here has charged, from \\"nineteenth century scholarship,\\" then his adversaries would cling to the Dark Ages. If Spong's ideas are old, why then are they so late in being popularized? Why doesn't everyone know that every Bible text falsely used to attack gays has an honest, Bible friendly explanation which is friendly to homosexuality as we understand it today? Does the Church owe us an explanation? I suspect it is out of their own insecurity that the writers of this book aim their attack at modern understanding. Why else would self-proclaimed Christians devote their efforts to crushing the spirits of others, of Gay men and Lesbians?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent photo book!","review":"This book has excellent reviews of 14 customized bikes from the pages of a German bike magazine.

Kierkegaard said that purity of heart is to will one thing. Through the grace of God it is a realisitc hope to purify the heart. Liturgy, Eucharist, almsgiving,etc are all means to this end. Colliander's book helps the seeker tune the inner life to the will of God though the groundwork of prayer and practical asceticism. One thing that is so winsome about it is that he doesn't hold spiritual carrots out to the reader without giving real guidance in how to grow in holiness. As with any book on such a serious topic, DO NOT read it for spiritual titulation. Take it seriously in the love of God. This is reality.Check out \\"Encountering the Depths\\" by Mother Mary Clare and \\"The Orthodox Way\\" by Bishop Kallistos Ware.

Thankfully, the chapters are brief so that you can pause and allow the truths to steep within one's heart before rushing to another gem. If you are serious and ripe for spiritual growth, if you want God to increase and your own self to decrease, this book could be for you. It is not a band-aid solution.

Very meaningful message. It was (I am guessing here) around 12\\" x 9\\" in size and included wonderful illustrations that went with the written material, and I was very taken with it, and ordered one for myself.My book arrived and was only 5 1/4\\" x 8 1/2\\" and includes only words, and not one single illustration.

Please, do NOT waste your time on 'Dreams' when there are so many really good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Little Story (and a One Day Read)","review":"\\"A Cure for Dreams\\" is the story of a mother's life, as told to her daughter. The characters are lovable and the story moves quickly. There is no actual plot or finale; it's more like a chat session between mothers and daughters.Though not as noteworthy as \\"Ellen Foster,\\" this book is enjoyable and I highly recommend it. It's a small book, and due to the interesting dialogue, most readers will keep turning pages and finish on the same day they started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"This reads like an author's first novel. Not a bad read, but certainly not as powerful as Ellen Foster, A Virtuous Woman, or Sights Unseen. Usually I'm able to associate the title of a book with the plot, or characters of the novel. I'm at a loss for the correlation here. If you happen to be between reads, and have already read Gibbons other work, then go ahead and give this a shot.

References on the pages are not consistent with the text; screenshots use more than one computer so there is no consistency to assist the reader.

He was really 'on' twice and seemed a bit uninterested the other two. This record is definitely Larry on a good night. He gets into one of his patented runs on \\"Don't Give It Up\\" that makes you think he could go on forever spitting out clean, melodic lines. And \\"Last Nite\\" has a really wild run where he seems to chase down the melody for a good 2 minutes before he finally catches it. My only complaint is the horns that were added later in the studio. It takes away from the live, spontaneous vibe of the tunes. Still, if you only know Larry Carlton from his mellow jazz period this is a great place to get acquainted with his earlier, shall we say, \\"more energetic\\" days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I received the organizer as pictured.

With a clear and personal writing style she tackles not just the easier-to-explain parts of Christianity but also give clear and compelling insights into the nature of the Trinity, the importance of Christian community and even the problem of pain. Filled with anecdotes and stories from her own life, the lives of friends and from literature, this book is a joy to read and a fine summary of her faith. She writes from her particular theological viewpoint but does it in a way that honors other Christian traditions and faith communities. This is a great book for new Christians but also for those of us who want new insights into a faith that we've held for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much More than what I'd expected","review":"I came across this book at bookstore last week, and finished it in 10 days. I am perhaps what Debra would call, the lurking- learning newcomer who's trying to understand what it is, but more importantly, WHY I should. I know I will get there not by a big leap, but many repeated running or stepping along the way.She writes with great prose and a rather quiet and elegant approach which I find it most refreshing. Not so many of the jargons or strong words that many christian books currently offer. It has certainly helped me form a good understanding of the christian spirituality, and why I should continue to explore .

They keep referring to their seminars they hold that enhance the learning yielded from this book yet there is no information provided on where to find information on these seminars.

TERRIBLE decision! I didn't think that you have to spend lots of $ to get quality headphones/earbuds, but I may have to rethink that assessment. These earbuds in no way fit into my ears and I tried multiple approaches. I even tried adding the extra silicone covers hoping that the extra bit of material could keep them in my ears, but no dice. Save taping them to my ears, there's nothing to be done with the terrible fit. Also, the \\"asymmetric cabling system for wearing convenience\\" (back of the box) was exceedingly annoying since it isn't adjustable. As a side note, the sound wasn't too bad, but since I was busy trying to grind the earbuds into my ears, I wasn't paying too much attention to it... Guess I'll be sheepishly returning to Sony..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average...until they broke","review":"I bought these at Target thinking they were a nice model for a low price. I admit the sound was pretty good. One reason they were bad thoughis that (i am not exaggerating on this) it took me SIX MONTHS to figure out how to keep them in secure. You have to sort of \\"hook them\\" into your ears from the back of your ear canal. They had good mids and the highs were great, but there was very little bass, which was important to me. Also, it reduces very little outside sound so it can get hard to hear if you are say, on a noisy airplane. And also after about 10 months, they broke. Sound stopped coming out of the left channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Construction","review":"After less than two months of use, one of the headphones stopped working, rendering the unit useless.

I can't use them for more than 20 minutes without my ears aching. That's if they manage to stay in that long - any slight movement and they fall out. The large round silver part prevents them from fitting into the ears properly. What size ears are they made for?The sound quality is mediocre, and the case is impossible to figure out!

People were pretty impressed with them for the most part. Until! one day i was pulling them out my assault pack and the cord peeled off the wire. It was all down hill from there. They dont stay in your ear unless you painfully jam them in there. You're constantly readjusting. Then finally one ear finally went out! Im not too upset cuz i only paid 15 bucks for them, but man. Now i am stuck looking for another pair, and stuck with my factory ipod buds which definately dont stay in and only sound loud.Dont buy em. Can someone point to a expensive pair that actually have good base and terrible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One cannot possibly make a decision so poor as buying these","review":"I have never felt as disconcerted over something as trivial as a pair of headphones as I do now. It would take great efforts and extensive study to find a pair equally poor as these. The slightest of movements will remove them from your ear. If one were to cough then his ears would be as bare as when he was without earbuds. They do not remain put either when one is sitting, standing or walking. I beseech you not to purchase this pair, I would not have anybody, no matter their faults, to feel even a moments exasperation of this sort of which I have felt much too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed","review":"First of all, to all those who claim these things don't stay in - that may be true at first before your personal learning curve sets in. But anyone that legitimately has problems keeping them in doesn't know their ear from a septic tank. It's as simple as inserting and twisting.Second, the quality is not impressive. For anyone that just wants to listen to music, it's fine. And the volume is good. But the low-end wasn't as pleasing as I had been led to believe and everything else seems average as well.Third, the actual reason I dislike these earbuds rather than finding them pretty cool is because of the cord. The right earbud has three times more cord than the left and is not adjustable at all. I look like a cheap rip-off of Agent Smith with these things in. I'm almost too ashamed to go to the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY BUY THESE BUDS IF...","review":"you like your headphones constantly falling out of your ears.you think that muddy/reverberated sound means \\"surround.\\"you want to constantly fumble around with different plastic ear adapters to ultimately decide that neither pair really fits.you never plan on working out or even being remotely active with these headphones in - they will fall out again, and again, again.you need volume and don't care that it is really bad sound presented loudly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adapter disappering","review":"I found these earbuds to be of a fair quality, My son and I both got a pair, however after a few months of use we had lost the plastic adapters and found that replacements are not available.

Which we will do, but not a Phillips brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a clock radio.","review":"I am a bit picky when it comes to sound quality. These headphones have overpowering highs and NO bass at all. I have to turn the bass all the way up on my EQ on my MP3 player. Then it distorts. I am taking them back. They are worthless to me. I think I could get better sound quality from the no name 5 dollar ones. If you enjoy great sound for under 20 dollars. Try Koss \\"The Plug\\" thats what I had before and what I will go back to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound...Meh...Design...Junk","review":"Sound is decent for the price.

The Sonys were by far better sounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined a good workout","review":"These are the worst headphones I have ever encountered. I would take the $5 kind that start to hurt your ears any day over these. The only way I could get them to stay in my ears was to stay still like a statue. I took them to work out and they kept falling out during my cardio. I looked like an idiot trying to stick them back in over and over until I finally gave up. I tried to talk to Philips about this problem and the guy told me that maybe I should have bought headphones that are designed for \\"more active music listening\\". Was he kidding? Shouldn't headphones be able to withstand 30 minutes on an eliptical? I wasn't on a trampoline or anything. From some of the other reviews, it seems like they will work for some people's ears, but not for everyone. Sadly, my husband and I both got a pair, so now we have double the disapointment. Steer clear of this set and get something that doen't have such mixed reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"These headphones are unusable garbage. They don't stay in your ears and the sound is hollow. They also have the annoying feature of having the right ear cord being only about 4 inches, and the left ear cord being 12 inches so they hang strangely on your head. Of course, because they don't stay in your ears, it doesn't really matter how they hang.Go with the Sony earbud headphones and avoid this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, Bad Fit!!!","review":"I purchased these thinking that like other Phillips products I have had I would be greatly satisfied. Well the sound is great, but the fit of the earpiece is awful! I have small ears, but aparently the size of your ear has nothing to do with it from the looks of the other reviews. Your ear does hurt after and during use. I would not recommend these headphones at all. Painful to use. If you can stand the pain the sound is good, but bad design. Maybe differnt sized caps would help. Hopefully this will prevent others from the same bad mistake I made!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound good but how to you wear them","review":"They dont fit in my ear right. they can hang from the bottom of your ear(i think this is the idea) but then they dont sound so good (compired to in ear). i could deal with that if the left one would not fall out because of the weight of the cable.The carry case is novel at best.I think i will return them and get a pair which i could take running. or even walking. its a nice idea phillips. hang from the bottom of your ear idea is a good one but a little more r&d required"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are supposed to go inside of your ear?","review":"I guess these headphones would be better, IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET THEM INTO YOUR EARS!!! Okay, okay... thats not fair, I can get them into my ears, after 10 minutes of pure frustration! But, when you finally squeeze these into your ears, you immediately get this burning sensation. You want to know what that burning sensation is? It's the feeling you get when the cartilage in your ear begins to tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Head Phones Suck!","review":"These headphones are awesome until u put them in your ear.They have great sound and quality but u cant fit them in your ear ok, they fall out every 30 seconds!

After a while I could'nt even put my regular earbuds in because my ears were so tender. The sound was great, but the design sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice design, but terrible sound","review":"not a big fan of this headset. it'd be better to just not have the bass instead of this low quality peaking bass that's just annoying. the sounds wavers and get distorted on certain songs too, i don't know if my headphones are just busted or if this is the way it's supposed to sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound--Comfortable Fit--Want More Bass","review":"(Oops! I meant to give this item 4 STARS!!)I lost the original pair of earbuds that came with my Rio Ce2100. I'd tried a couple of other pairs of earbuds and the sound quality was poor and the buds wouldn't stay in my ears.This pair is fantastic. I used to listen to my player on 20 I now listen to it at 8 - 10. I do notice that jazz does not sound as good as other styles of music through these buds.As other reviewers have mentioned the bass is a bit wanting. They fit well in my ears and have a larger set of cuffs for those with larger ear canals.Overall I love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I have a pair, they're not bad but one of the earbud covers broke and Philips refused to replace the $0.20 part.

Yeah, they rovide different sleeves for them, but they all still depend on your ear canals to be the size of a dime. I actually found them more comfortable without the sleeves!The only thing they have going for them is the price and a decent chord length, and both of those can be found on the Skullcandy or Sony earbuds for the exact same price and much better sound quality. Avoid these things unless you have gone deaf from sticking loose change in your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptacular Fit, Quality Sound","review":"I bought these headphones at Best Buy. When I got them home and was sitting around listening to them, I thought they were going to work for me; they sounded good and were comfortable. However, the next morning while riding the Metro to work, just the movement of the train made these fall out of my ears. I was using the smaller of the two sets of rubber ear pieces provided, but they still didn't fit well enough to stay in place. The weight of the cord alone made the left earbud fall out. All in all, I was pleased with the sound quality, but completely unhappy with the fit of these headphones. No matter how good they sound, if they won't fit, they're worthless.I wouldn't recommend these unless you get a chance to try a pair on and make sure they stay put.Also, no matter how many different ways I've tried to put the earbuds into the provided case, it never closes properly. The case also collects lint like nobody's business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone.","review":"I got a pair of these because a friend bought them and I tried them for a few seconds. They really do sound great and that was what I was focusing on. When I bought my pair and tried to wear them, I had to really push them in (too far into the ear canal can be dangerous)to get them to stay while I was just sitting. As soon as I started walking around they fell out. The IPOD originals worked fine as a fit in my ears, but I was looking for better sound. I am a small person in general so these might work for people who are more of an average size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too large for the average ear","review":"I bought these because I didn't want to spend $45 on the sony in the ear headphones. These would stay in to save your life! Even sitting, they just fall out!! Spend the extra $20 or so dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money...","review":"This is probably the most awkward, uncomfortable headphone design I've ever worked with. The earbuds barely dangle from my ears, constantly falling out. Because of the poor fit, they are nowhere near far enough in to get decent sound quality. If I try to jam the earbuds in further, my ears quickly begin to ache even if my iPod is on a low volume setting. In addition, the chord length for each bud is dramatically different, intended to be draped over the back of the neck. I find this cumbersome.The whole \\"surround sound\\" promotion is sort of a lie. Any basic set of earbuds has the same left and right channel as this one. In fact, a recent pair of Sony earbuds that I used had more of a \\"surround sound\\" audio quality, and they were modest enough to not even be marketed as such.I would suggest that if anybody has his or her original iPod headphones, he or she is better off keeping them than getting these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ow","review":"I can't get these to fit in my ear canal without genuine pain, and even if I do, they won't stay in for long. For the few moments they're connected, the sound is better than the default iPod headphones... in fact, you can spin them around backwards and get better sound than iPod earbuds, but they won't stay in that way either.I wish I'd read the reviews here before buying them off the shelf. Due to the fit issue, they're simply unusable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound..","review":"I bought these headphones because the reviews from other users were so good. I am a studio/touring musician and have professional headphones that I use for studio recordings, but I need a cheap pair that sounds almost as good for the road. I have been looking for a cheap pair of good headhphones to replace my 10 year old Sony E-808V that I got for $10. The Sony E-808V blows these headphones away in treble response, bass response, and even in surround-sound capability. The bass is non-existent, and the treble sounds like you're listening in a cardbox box. With all the great reviews, I thought these would be replacements for my Sony E-808V but I was very wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely uncomfortable","review":"I bought these to replace my Sony EX51s which had problems with the cord falling apart. I loved the Sony earphones, but the cord was very poor quality.The sound on these Philips earphones is pretty poor, but hey they cost under $20, so I didn't expect much. I did however expect that they'd fit in an average person's ear. They did not. I had to cram them in my ear. They're extremely uncomfortable and frequently slipping out of my ear. I've now ordered a pair of Shure e2c earphones due to great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I just purchased these headphone at walmart. I am currently a Music major, and needed some headphones for my metronome. I picked up these, thinking I could get double the use out of them, using them with my met and my ipod. Well, I just came back from my first practice with them. They were a bit uncomfortable, and got in the way a little bit. Sitting here I wanted to check out this \\"surround sound\\" attribute, as well as check the qaulity. I plugged them in, and threw on some jazz. These headphones were a wast of money. My ipod headphones sound so much better than these. Philips over compinsated and put too much base in them, as for the high range, there is very little. The sound has a very closed off sense to it. I'll keep the headphones because all I'll be using them for is a click for when I practice, and I don't have the time to go out and return them. Do yourself a favor, stay away from these, try the sony's, they've been making decent earbuds for a some time now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"These are terrible.

Don't waste your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"The person who made this absolutely have the lowest IQ on Earth!!!","review":"Why make an ear bud if you can't get this out of the case? They should just wrap this ear bud in a wire in a case instead of this stupid circular case. i spent countless hours cutting it open just to get it out. When I did, it sounded terrible. one star because this doesn't allow me to rate a 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound GREAT! But the PAIN!","review":"These earbuds sound FANTASTIC! Some of the best sounding earbud headphones I have ever heard. great bass & highs. But unfortunately they won't stay in my ears without falling and after awhile of messing with them my ear canals became very sore. Maybe I have abnormal ears, but I don't think so. I bought these for use at the gym while on the treadmill, and for that purpose they are useless. They would only stay in if I kept perfectly still, even then they would work themselves out after a few minutes. I gave it 2 stars because of the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips may have listened, but I don't think they \\"listened\\"","review":"I just bought a pair of these. Although they are very comfortable and now offer two sets of silicone fittings, the sound quality is rather poor. No bass at all. They are crisp enough, but not having any bass really makes a difference. I used to have an old, old pair of Sony earbuds from the late 80s that I remember having much better sound.If you're looking for a good range of sound (bass to treble), these aren't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earphones, Great Price.","review":"I personally like these earphones... although they kept falling out at first, I figured out that you need to rap the cord around the top of your ear. I dont think they are painful, and the sound is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds for the price","review":"I give these earbuds 5 stars compared to other brands in the same price range. I'm sure you could spend more money and get better sound, but for this price you won't find any better. The \\"surround sound\\" feature lives up to its billing. I've tried other earbuds and none can match the sound.The earbuds I purchased came with two sets of inserts - one straight and one tapered - to achieve the level of comfort you're looking for. The tapered insert works great with my ears. They are comfortable and *never* fall out no matter how vigourous the motion. Even an incidental light tug on the cord doesn't dislodge the earbud.So if you're looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds that are comfortable and stay in your ear - this is what you should buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great surround sound at a small price.","review":"I was intrigued by the idea of 'surround sound' in an earbud and bought them at best buy. Well, they really do have GREAT sound and surround sound -- even better than some of my more expensive headsets. I use them at night to listen to a customized subliminal affirmation disk I am using to reprogram my subconscious, as well as to music. They have EXCEPTIONAL SOUND.The downside is the stupid asymmetrical design of the cord. I don't know if this was done for the surround sound or not but it is a pain and detracts from the product. i threw the case away -- useless and too hard to use. I transport mine in a plastic sandwich bag. I hope they improve on the flaws mentioned here. If they did I would gladly buy another pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"great alternative to noise cancelling","review":"just got these, and not sure about the surround sound, but they are by far the best ear buds i've tried for noise reduction without spending the dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great","review":"These earphones are pretty great.

They should come out with a smaller sized cap."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality sound.","review":"These headphones blow away the Vmoda bass phones. Bass is just as good, but the mids and highs are much crisper and cleaner. The surround sound claim may be a bit much, but I can verify the soundstage is much more expansive and rich than with the Vmodas.These headphones don't fit way inside your ear like the V-modas, but they sound just as good sitting mosty outside your ear canal. Much more hygenic that way anyway, I think.These will be my favorite bud-type headphones.Regards,Sam ChandraChicagoland"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, poor sound","review":"i love the around the neck asymetrical cord. having grown up in japan, where this set up was very common, i'm glad to have it. sound is kinda crisp, but very little bass. van halen sounds ok, but black eyed peas sounds wimpy. and the little rubbery thing falls off pretty easily, already lost one for good. it's key to the sound quality, now mine sounds real bass-less."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for work","review":"I wear my headphones a lot a work, and the ones that came with my MP3 player (not an iPOD!!) made my head hurt after a while. These are great so far! I'm not as aware that I'm wearing headphones/ear buds, possibly because of the surround-sound deal. I have no problem fitting them in my ear (and I'm a girl who doesn't have abnormally large ears).My only complaint was something someone else brought up: I wish the 'side-wearing' option let you change sides. My computer is on the right side, so I have to loop the headphones around the back of the monitor (and I'm buying an extension) in order to wear the buds on the correct sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER than iPods headphones","review":"My puppy chewed up my original headphones for my iPod. I bought these to replace them and they work GREAT! I used my nephiews iPod headphones side-by-side vs. these, and these won. Better bass, better surround sound. The chusioned part that goes in the ear helps align the headphones properly in your ear and not press had against the inner ear. I went back to buy more of the same headphones after I tried these out, but they were sold out. I am on amazon to buy 2 more pairs, (puppy insurance). For $20, you can't beat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I have to say that these earbuds look great in the package. After my standard iPod earphones stopped working I shopped around for a replacement. I like the in-ear style headphones because they are discreet. These looked great, they were even white.The first thing I noticed after opening them was the odd cord configuration. The cord is split unevenly allowing the cord for one earbud to wrap around the back of your neck to the other ear. The problem is that the cord splits too early leaving a dangling cross section right under your left ear. This tugs on the earbuds which fit horribly.Yes, they look great but they do not fit in my ears whatsoever; I even tried both attachments. At first I just thought that I was unlucky and my ears are shaped weird... but that's not the case. Every review seems to have the same conclusion: they don't fit.I will say that they sound great when I hold them up to my ears... but, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible fit","review":"They sound incredible, but don't stay in your ear unless you really shove them in there.

I cannot for the life of me figure out how these could be comfortable to anyone. The sound is ok, but the pain is not worth it.

Bottom Line: Do not buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best out there","review":"My one and only complaint is that they fall out.

So that should make me exactly the target audience for this re-release of the sole album by the Rockets, whose members Whitten, Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina went on to form the core of Crazy Horse. But in fact I'm totally unimpressed by this amateurish effort. Weak songs with laughable lyrics, poorly played in a badly dated psychedelic style. It's obvious that The Rockets were not even close to being ready for the big time when they cut this album. It's hard to recognize any sign of the talent that Neil Young obviously saw here when he recruited these guys to be his backing band.

Add to that the fact that there is very little extra content, and all in all this release of boxed sets offers very little for collectors. For those interested in a one time viewing the resale or trade in value is almost nonexistent.

Trent has always leaned a bit towards the Sopranos and I've been hard put to make a choice.Season 5 of the Sopranos finally made the choice for me. I can hardly stand to watch it. It is so boring, and so seeminly superficial. New characters by the dumptruck load do nothing to increase the watchability of this season.It is so boring, that, even though I own the complete box sets for the first 5 seasons, I may just simply forego buying the final 6th season, whenever that may be available.

The series is interesting in that it is like watching a car wreck. It's hard to decide which character I disliked the most. None have any redeming qualities. But, I guess it's entertaining to see how much lower the characters can and sink. The fifth season wasn't as entertaining as the first four and I suppose the sixth will be even less. I won't be watching it on HBO, But, will probably buy it when it comes out on dvd just to see if any of the characters have formed a scintilla of humanity.

However this reissue, like so many reissues, loses all of the tone of the original album. This was a groundbreaking album in some respects, one of which was the use of brass on a country rock album. Unfortunately on this reissue all you can hear on some songs is the brass. Horrible remix. I'm afraid this is another great old album that is lost forever in the remix/remaster machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a true pyschedelic classic!","review":"THis is the sound of the Byrds imploding while at the same time throwing everything but the kitchen sink into the mix. Hints of their eventual country turn sit inside burbling moogs and mellotrons- (Yes spacey keyboards)- backwards phrasing- flanged guitars and vocals - swirling inside the classic Byrds sound. The guitars still chime but this is very much a pyschedelic and one of the most unique i might add records from the era. Dont be fooled by the negative reviews this is right up there with piper-sgts peppers-( beatlesque horns at times) and for my money it may not be the best Byrds record(though i think it is)most interesting and rewarding listen. It also doesnt sound as dated as most pyschedelia. SOme of the bonus material is good (triad a crosby penned tune is very good and should have made the album originally). Crosby was booted during the recording but despite the problems internally this is a stunning album. And for the price you cant beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrds flying in different directions","review":"Not a great Byrds album, but a solid representation of the byrds in transition both musically and personel wise. This cd shows the turn to a more countrified- folk sound away from the 60's pop psychodelia sound. My preference is towards the country/folk/rock guitar Byrds era of Clarence White that included 'Sweethearts of the Rodeo', 'Untitled', 'Farther Along',etc. The Bonus tracks make this an album worth owning- the proverbial icing on the cake- with such gems as Bound to Fall (great instrumental), Triad, and alternative versions of Goin' Back and Draft Morning.

They'll often insert 5th Dimension. Notorious Byrd Brothers is WAY more psychedelic. The guys discovered phasing, moog synthesizers and mellotrons for this album. The only dark spot, as mentioned by other listeners, is the stodgy Space Odyssey, which tries to be an American \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" only without much energy or melody. But this album belongs in any 'delic music lover's collection.

Delicate, but totally assured songwriting, incomparable musicianship. McGuinn & co. are original enough to avoid the blues fixation of the time, drawing instead on folk and country. Maybe not totally original, but nobody else on the scene fused the two so perfectly. The songs fade into each other, a suite feeling, one, and then the other.

I bought it based on the glowing reviews here but now I'm convinced they were written by the author and/or the author's friends. Otherwise, some people have extremely low standards for literature, a term I use very loosely when reviewing this book. As far as the person who said the book is \\"laugh out loud funny\\", are you smoking crack? Either you read a totally different book or you're referring to the unintentional humor caused by the book's many misspellings, tortured syntax and general awfulness.There's a reason certain books are self-published."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Going Back","review":"I feel compelled to warn potential buyers that this is the most poorly written book I have ever (attempted) to read. I couldn't even make sense of it. It started out in the first person of one character, moving on to the third person of another character, and then finally the main character arrives in the third person (at least I think he was the main character--oh well, character-shmarachter, I say); at one point he was walking around on crunches. What are crunches?? I couldn't take another double-spaced, manuscript-typed, misspelled page! By the way, it is \\"published\\" by a company I now know to be a self-publisher. Next time I'll do my research before I place my order. By the way, I'm giving it one star because it's a great title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On...","review":"The book needs help, especially in terms of punctuation, grammar and spelling. First year college professors expect more hoaned language skills from freshman than the author showcased in this book. The book does serve a purpose.. if you just ended a relationship with someone who has severe mental and emotional problems (you mind find it comforting.)

The book and its contents are both a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book on the basis of the other reviews. I don't know.

However, the book falls short of hitting the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book supposed to be a joke?","review":"What a horrible waste of paper! I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book. When I hear about a book I think I'll like, I add it to my \\"list of books to buy.\\" Somehow this one got on my list. It was a complete disappointment. I'm always shocked when I'm reading a book and find a typo or glaring grammar error, and this book was filled with them. I'm really not an over-critical person, but this book is just plain BAD. I would give it no stars if that were an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Me Hooked!!","review":"... Rose Quintiliano has done a great job of describing what it's like to be hooked on a \\"bad boy\\". I got completely into the story and could not put this book down. This is a good description of what its like to be in the throes of sexual and love obsession for a man who is seductive, great in bed, but emotionally unavailable and abusive. I also think Rose did a good job of telling the story from the man's perspective as well. [...]. Bravo to Rose for trying to get into the head of a narcissistic abusive man and tell us what it feels like to be him and why he makes the choices he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad someone recommended this book","review":"I spent years wasting my time trying to reel in men who just weren't that interested in me--now that I'm happily married, I could kick myself for wasting so much time and energy.

I guess what irritated me the most was the mention of 'Lean Body' in the name...why would you name your product that if it's supposed to help you GAIN weight??

It is twice as sticky, twice as durable and definitely twice as strong. There is no comparison, in the world of duct tapes.

But the problem is that at 300 pages, and with little in the way of interesting soccer - or national - history to examine, the author is forced to conduct in depth interviews with the principals of the Liechenstein soccer world.And they repeat each other ad nauseum - \\"we played hard... we must establish ourselves a s afootballing nation...things are getting better\\" you get the point after the first interview.

The political backdrop is more interesting than just the ton going to parties. Wolf fully develops their love, admiration, and respect for each other, which makes their political divide even more heart wrenching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadup to Tragedy?","review":"This is a book of poems written from the points of view of students at Branston High School. Their school is pretty diverse--some students are religious, some are into video games, one is a member of an immigrant family, and they are of all different races. Despite living within such a diverse community, though, the students are narrow-minded and some have some pretty serious problems.We as readers see tension building. A few students are collecting weapons and planning an attack on some of their classmates. Many students have heard about these plans and know that there is a list of students who will be targeted, but will any of them take this plan seriously enough?I liked the idea behind this book. I thought it was a great way to show how a school system could foster such anger in its students, and how difficult it might be to stop a terrible tragedy. However, I was upset at the thought that teachers could be as angry and willing to buy into hate as the students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and eclectic","review":"Hart has an outstanding voice and a great feel for diverse types of music. Rooted in the blues, but with folk, swing and jazz thrown in. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravehart","review":"What's cool about this recording is its lack of pretension and love of variety. Big points for those qualities. Hart's talents are as broad as they are deep. Seems like he could set sail in any of the many directions that Territory's compass points to and land safely.There is some great music here, well worth exploring.And my sense is that with a bit more mapmaking (i.e.forethought), Hart could chart a masterpiece which brings together his diverse influences as a unified and unique vision, as opposed to a series of snapshots, no matter how compelling each might be in and of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for submarine action fans","review":"This ranks right up there with Patrick Robinson's \\"Kilo Class\\" & \\"HMS Unseen\\" for thrilling submarine action.

It weaves alien symbiosis, Solar System-wide war, personality transference, and psychiatric sleuthing into a great whodunit. It's marred only by the unreasonable choice of setting it in the period A.D. 2040 to 2070. It took me half of the novel to put that in the back of my mind. A.D. 2340 would have been more appropriate. Other than that, it was an outstanding read. I don't think they come any better than Sheffield."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ganymede Club - Great SciFi if you like suspence","review":"Both Ganymede Club and it's predecessor Cold as Ice, can be read independantly. I recommend both. What really sets Ganymede Club apart from the dirth of SciFi out there is Scheffield's use of classic suspense. The tricks he employs are usually only found in a James Patterson or Douglas Preston novel. Instead, this book captures the spirit of a real 'spine tingler' and wraps it up in a SciFi setting. Because of Scheffield's credentials as a scientist, he is able to pull this off in a fascinating bit of world building. Fun Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving hard science.","review":"I don't read a lot of science fiction, and what I have read was mostly Azimov-era adventure type stories with little hard science.

Lots of cute topless girls, but the real reason to watch? Kristine of course. She's not topless in this, but she doesn't need to be. She's one of the sweetest girls in the history of the movies, but never got the right role to be really big. The good news? We find out in the interview/commentary that she is back in Hollywood after having a family, and she is going to attempt to restart her career. This is her first ever interview, and though her memory is fuzzy after all these years, she still reveals a lot of things about her life.

She really was a remarkable woman, particularly in that time period; as was her equally remarkable husband, Robert Browning. The new information reveals a woman who shows unexpected strength, both physically and emotionally, that was completely antithetical to her adulthood at home, pre-marriage, as an invalid. Her father, also, emerges as more three-dimensional than the movie version and earlier books, depict him. Yes, he was a tyrant, but also capable of being charming and enjoying social events and family fun. All in all, if you want to know the real Mrs. Browning and her family, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit/doesn't operate correctly","review":"I contacted the company about this product issue.

I followed some Wilson suggested tune tips but there is just too much to do to make it work right. The company authorized a refund IF and only IF the safety was untouched.

'Professional Widow' is also fairly easy. Point being, even beginners can use this book.

Alice Taylor takes us back to the communal farm life of Ireland. She \\"shows\\" us vividly how she grew up in County Cork Ireland in a rural farming community where the community came before the individual; unheard of in our current paradigm. Everything that nature had to offer was used in daily life, including the grease from cooked geese to oil leather boots. Life was about pulling your weight, helping your neighbor, integrity, and respecting God and His creations. This book sooths my soul and slows me down.

Since I had seen virtually all of the first decade or two of L&O episodes, it was almost instantly apparent to me what was going to happen and how it would end up. I wanted to see original programming in the L&O style and not exactly the same programs rehashed with different actors. The style and accents are different as you go from Manhattan to London, but the plot and the story are virtually the same. I'm not sure of how plagiarism is defined in the TV media, but for those of us in scholarly pursuits, submitting the same research paper for credit in two or three different courses is not exactly ethical.

I love to follow the villain throughout the book, learning about his life and what makes him/her tick. And nobody does it better than Sandford. The \\"whodunit\\" style of Easy Prey made for a boring read. The person who did the murders really came out of left field. Sandford tried to make it interesting with Davenport's female juggling, but it didn't work. Hopefully, he will go back to his regular style because he creates great people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandford Disappoints","review":"I've read all of the books in the Prey series and this, without a doubt, is Sandford's worst effort/installment. There are simply too many characters that Sandford does not develop. With a number of people suspected of doing the dirty deeds, Sandford comes out of left field and introduces important characters much too late in the book. Sandford does not give any real insight into the killer and Davenport gets on to the trail of the real killer wholly by accident. At the end, I was left saying - \\"That's it, you've got to be kidding me.\\" The end was rushed and thrown together in a haphazard manner - did Sandford have to meet a deadline? That being said, Davenport is still one of the best characters in this genre and we can only hope that the next installment in the Prey series will be much better than this effort by Sandford. Everyone deserves a mulligan; however, as I recall from childhood, there's only one allowed per round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a puzzler!","review":"When model Alie'e Maison is found strangled to death in the aftermath of a party - and then a second woman (Sandy Lansing) is found murdered and stuffed in a closet, a media feeding frenzy threatens to cause trouble for Chief of Police, Rose Marie Roux. As Lucas Davenport races to solve the mystery, bodies begin to pile up - Alie'e's photographer, her parents, suspects and material witnesses in the case - and meantime time is running out before an all-out media blitz/political war ensues, that could potentially destroy the careers of Lucas and all his friends on the force.We're kept in the dark as much as those solving the crime in this novel. There isn't much I can say about that without completely spoiling the book for those who haven't read it, other than to say that when the case is finally solved, the perp comes from WAY out in \\"left field,\\" so to speak.An engaging book and one I definitely recommend for fans of this series, or of a good mystery/thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps You Guessing","review":"Lucas Davenport's newest case involves the strangulation murder of a young and famous model. Did her dissolute lifestyle lead to her murder, or was it something as mundane as being in the wrong place at the wrong time? And what about her co-corpse, a young woman who worked in a hotel but drove a Porsche? Each time Davenport and his colleagues think they have the case figured out and identify a suspect, the suspect ends up murdered. The pace is brisk as the guessing-game intensifies. Every time I thought I knew whodunit, there was a new surprise in store. I recommend that you not start this book unless you have the time to finish it fairly quickly because it's a real page turner. My only complaint is with sloppy editing, which seems to be a problem in a lot of publishing houses these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I love the Prey series (at least the first ten books), but this one was severely lacking.

I can never wait for the next novel from this talented author. However, this last book was extremely different from his previous \\"Prey\\" books. It focused primarily on Lucas' love life, instead of the murder/mystery. I enjoy his plots, based on detective work, along with a love twist, but this was ridiculous. If I wanted a book about a mans love life, I would have bought a cheap romance book. The case wasn't even solved by skill, but luck. And while the case should have received more attention, we only could read of his sex life. Sorry, but I hope the next one's better, it would be ashame if they continued like this one. I usually enjoy them so much. I hope I will be able to continue to do so. In short, less sex life, more mystery.

Easy Prey is by far the worse, just a plot outline masquerading as a novel.

This book felt like someone else wrote it. No suspense from beginning to end. Usually I can't put his books down, this time I wasn't excited about picking it up. Wasn't really sure what we were chasing at moments, not his normal suspense and terror. Even Davenport's affairs were lack-luster. I actually bought this one before release from Amazon. Next time I'll wait for the firesale to see if John is back on track. Barely 2.5 stars. I'll have to read the old Prey books while we await for the new release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Prey - too easy for the writer","review":"I have to agree with others that this is, by far, John Sanford's worst. I look so forward to each of his books and love Lucas Davenport. But this book was a huge disappointment. His earlier novels seemed so real that you found yourself checking to make sure your doors were locked so some killer didn't come after you. With Easy Prey, I couldn't relate. I think we've all had enough of the drugged-out models and that whole scene. I expected a lot more from an obviously talented writer. As a lot of writers get more popular, they seem to churn out more garbage because people buy based on their previous experiences. Sad to say, but John Sanford just churned this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened!","review":"Bring back the old Lucas Davenport. This is the worst of the series. I've read them all and I've liked them all. What happened Mr Sanford? Are your tiring of Lucas and company. It took me two weeks to read this book, where is usually takes me a day or two. There was no punch, no excitement. For a while there I started to get confused when they finally got around to figuring out who the killer was. And Lucas has never made this many mistakes. The ending was as lackluster as heck. Mr Sandford, I can't believe you did this to your loyal fans. And believe me, I am a loyal fan to your character Lucas Davenport. This still doesn't mean I'll given up. I can only hope the next Davenport novel is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Prey","review":"Okay, this was by far the weakest of the Prey series. Where shall I begin...It seems that Davenport is getting soft. Maybe that's how Sandford wants to portray Davenport, but that maybe a stretch. For me what makes a \\"Prey\\" book good is the cat and mouse game the killer and Daaavenport play. (See Eyes of Prey and Mind Prey) But with Easy Prey, it wasn't there. It was Davenport looking for the killer. Whick leads me to another point. Who the killer was....kind of weak. It's an interesting concept, but rather weak. I also didn't like the idea that Daavenport was going with 3 women. I can't say much more without ruining a plot line, so I'll just end this point. Which leads me to my last point. I *hated* the end! I can't tell you fine readers how much it bothered me. If you want my suggestion, don't waste your money on the hardcover. Maybe, and I mean maybe, get inin paper back. In a few months or so, look in used bookstores, and pick it up for a few bucks, or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I agree with Katherine Hill. She said it all. I haven't convinced myself to even read the last 50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreck","review":"This book is a waste of paper. Just awful. All aspects were poorly written, but first discovering the identity of the killer at page 500 of a 527 page book is not Sandford's style; in fact it's likely that Sandford was kidnapped by aliens who then tried to copy his previous success. If marooned on a desert island with only this book, I suggest it be eaten rather than read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Prey","review":"Yes, Lucas Davenport is still an interesting character, but this time out things got messy. At first I was intrigued with all the subplots, especially with Lucas and his women. The romantic in me fervently hoped that he and Weather would reunite. By the end, though, Lucas had become a calculated user. He really wanted to figure out how to engage all of them. He doesn't deserve Weather.Worse, though, Sandford's usually intricate plotting and interweaving of characters was missing. In its place was a mess. It's not that an investigation wouldn't be messy in actuality, but this one had the normally insightful Lucas jumping to all sorts of lame conclusions.In the final analysis, Sandford no longer seems to respect his own creation. While Lucas Davenport has had a very hard edge in past novels, there was also a weird morality to the man. He was never quite so shallow and trivial as he is in Easy Prey.Please, John Sandford, either revive Lucas or kill him."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Carmel and Clara","review":"After Sanford's last book, with Carmel and Clara as the Oh-So-Wonderful-Antagonists, I was looking forward to the new Sanford. This book was a big disappointment. Lucas Davenport seemed to be scurrying around looking for LOVE. He could't make up his mind. I didn't like that about him. I wanted him to be strong...I started thinking about him as shallow. Too many characters, too many murders, too many lovers. The ending was disappointing. His last was SOOOO good...this one SOOOO bad. Sanford, don't go for the bucks...plot your story out like the last book. We value your reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a disappointment","review":"Having always been a \\"Prey\\" series fan, I rushed out to buy this last installment when it first hit the stands. However, this book does not measure up to his previous titles. There are way too many characters and Lucas is involved with way too many women. (Am I reading a mystery or watching Days of Our Lives?) The ending virtually assures that a reader will purchase the next installment, but I will be hesistant to spend $ on mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who will live?","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author, and at times I felt like I was reading a murder-mystery parody. After a time you wonder if ANYONE will survive! But that's the hook that keeps your interest and keeps you reading.The writing is good without getting in the way of the reading. It flows easily off the page and keeps you turning pages without stopping to look at the clock. An easy excuse to get out of spending an evening with the Significant Other's friends.I'm not a mystery reader, but I've already ordered more titles by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Prey' for it to end","review":"'Prey' fans will be sorely disappointed in this outing. Not only is the story not Sanford's usual taught, suspenseful, page turner, it was a poorly constructed who-done-it. Gruesome murders, taunting notes, evil incarnate, these are the keys to Sanford's individual style of gripping fiction. Who-done-it? Who cared! Sorry John, you owe us for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Prey","review":"This book was much too predictable. John Sanford has written many better books so I plan to continue reading his new releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and hard to keep track of characters","review":"I found myself rereading chapters and referring back in the book. Towards the end I think Sandford found himself doing the same thing because suddenly the reader finds himself being \\"fed from a firehose\\" in two pages, and by that time I had lost track and interest. Not his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The two star \\" I don't like it\\" rating says it all....","review":"I love John Sandford books...at least most of them. This was a real disappointment. This is what I call a true two/too star book. Too many characters, too many plots, too few connections, too far fetched. Too much gratuitous sex, too little character development, and too easy to put down.Sorry, John. I know you did better with later books. Perhaps you listened to your critics and if so, good for you. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucas Daveport solves another one","review":"I loved this story by John Sanford. I like many others have listened to many of these stories out of order. I had always wondered how Marcie got injured.In this story you follow the life of Lucas Davenport again, while he is trying to help figure out who has killed a supermodel. Not only that but there seem to be a lot of twists and turns and different people being killed. You will find that in fact you have 2 different killers at work which makes the story much more interesting to follow as you try and see who will put the entire story together.John Sanford does a good job explaining the settings as well as the people so that you can create a whole picture in your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst So Far","review":"Hated it!! I gotta tell ya, I have either loved or strongly liked all of the Prey novels up to this point. This one was so incredibly BORING. I don't know what happened. To me it seemed like the ending was tacked on. I gave it two stars only because of the personal drama going on in Lucas's life. There was very little suspense and so much repetition of incredibly boring, complex real estate deals. Just a total waste of time. I wish I had skipped it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can hardly get through it....","review":"I have been zipping through the \\"Prey\\" series and have been loving every book. And then.....I hit this one and can barely get through it! I'm glad to see I am not the only one. If this is your first attempt at a \\"Prey\\" book please just start with the first of the series and don't judge Lucas Davenport or John Sandford by this attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best Prey Novel","review":"I've read other novels with Lucas Davenport as the lead character and have always found them enjoyable. This novel however; is somewhat confusing. The characters are not developed and entwined very well. The story had some boring spots and condensing the story and eliminating some of the characters would have been beneficial to the story. There were some interesting parts which made the book not a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Sandford Book I didn't bother finishing","review":"I wish that I had read other reviews before purchasing this book. This Prey book doesn't belong in the series. Very confusing and a huge let-down. I will never again automatically purchase a John Sandford book and will probably take him off my favorite authors list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book in the \\"Prey\\" Series.","review":"Easy Prey is a waste of time. The Prey Series always grabs my attention and I purchase a copy of the book as soon as it becomes available. Easy Prey is in a word - Terrible. I think John Sandford got tired of writing it and just wanted to get it over. The ending is a total letdown. This is the last time I will purchase another \\"Prey\\" book without doing a little checking. Fans of this series seem to be totally in sync in their comments on just how bad this book is. Hopefully Sanford will get the hint and return to his high standards. I do believe his web site was closed down after his TV Movie was panned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible Book","review":"I have always awaited John Sanford's next book.How disappointing this book was!He has always kept readers intrigued with the plot. In this book he resorts to sensationlism to sell his book. If you are a reader who gets into a book for a real good plot, don't even pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Hi all,get a pen and paper..you will need it to keep track of the number of characters coming and going (getting murdered) in this supposed to be mystery thriller.It does not fall into either of the two categories,first of all its not a mystery by any standards and far far behind being called as a thriller.I think its high time John sandford change his style of presenting the novel..rather than writing it as a mystery its better for him to introduce killer in the first page and then start it from there.Don't get excited reading the reviews of double murder and the hunt for the killer,in fact I totally lost how many killings take place in the novel one after the other and the most annoying part is the ending which is a big letdown.After going through 350 odd pages,I think the reader should be atleast given a good ending,but no..its really disappointing.The same thing happened with 'The Night Crew' and it is repeated here in this novel.So my final advice is avoid this novel at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, I agree","review":"What a disappointment! The \\"prey\\" series has been one that promised me a great read almost every time. Easy Prey delivered little in the way of his previous thrillers. No suspense, no characters of interest and not much action. Unlike earlier books, where I felt the tension and fear, I was totally uninvolved here -- merely an observer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried To Like Easy Prey...","review":"I really tried to like this latest book of John Sandford...however, I began reading it on a Friday and on the following Wednesday I was still slogging through it. This is a bad sign. Usually I finish a Lucas Davenport novel in one day! I was very disappointed. I did finish it, so there is that! But it just wasn't what Sandford is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not EASY to finish PREY","review":"Boring, tedious, with too many characters in and out like a chinese fire drill. There is no suspense whatsoever anywhere in the plot and the killer is not a danger to Davenport or the public. In fact, he is really not even in the book till the very end. It is not even a good police procedural and Davenport just kind of sloshes around like he is bored too. John: write us a killer next time that will bring the old Davenport back to life and turn him loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the Davenport I once knew!","review":"I was very disappointed in the main character. Lucas seemed to be hollow and false, four letter words was not his style in the past.This plot made Lucas seem not too intelligent, not really caring. His in and out referenences to his personal life was only distracting.The ending was out of left field as if the author felt it was time to end this story, it was long and tedious and repeticious. hopefully, Mr. Sandford will take a good rest and his next offering will go back to the quality Davenport. Ill patiently await the next novel and will continue to be a loyal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"There are Davenport novels that are pure whodonits and there are Davenport novels where our hero plays cat-and-mouse against a fully developed antagonist. This is neither. More convoluted than clever and more exhausting than exhilarating, Easy Prey is the worst Davenport novel since Night Prey (best in the series are Rules, Eyes, Silent, Certain and Winter). Sanford is a very talented writer, but by the time i reached the left-field climax, I truly couldn't care who did it and who lives or dies -- I just wanted it to end. The reader practically needs one of those connect-the-characters charts that Davenport used to hang on his wall to follow a case, yet your patience and close attention is never rewarded. Chapter upon chapter of pure dialogue detailing investigative procedure punctuated by skimpy action scenes and a hodgepodge of thin, sensationalistic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex Enough to make this a not so good book","review":"First of all,This book should be not so simple and not so complex,just normal like Eyes of prey.But Sandford change his style here.We got too many characteres,and also lot's of sub-themes: Drugs,Lesbianism,Obsession..The end was a big problem here,first becowse sandford introduce to us,a new character that haven't nothing to do in the whole story context(this one was just a stupid psycho-obsessed).The other one,well,i won't say but i didn't undestand very well why sandford use the word:'dishwater' two times....Overall,not a nice book if you don't like to Guess and thinking a lot about the characters relationshipPS: Sorry for my english"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HIS BEST EFFORT","review":"As a fan of all the \\"PREY\\" novels, I found \\"EASY PREY\\" to be Sandford's worst. I thought there were too many characters & the plot was somewhat confusing. Did this novel go thru the editing process?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I am trying to finish this book, hoping that something exciting will happen. It is as bad as \\"Night Crew\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A different John Sandford","review":"While I have enjoyed all of the Prey books,I sometimes find the mood of them a bit blue and depressing. Sandford seemed to be in a playful mood in this book -something unusual for him. Both my spouse and myself noticed a lighter, happier mood in this volume where Davenport seems to be at a crucial turning point in his life. The story is actually only a background for a kind of midlife crises for our hero -which woman? Which job? What to do with life? Instead of getting all dark and broody about it, thought, he seems to enjoy just riding the events that unfurl. I don't think I'd want a steady diet of this -anymore than I'd enjoy a steady diet of doom and gloom -but it was a pleasant change -and a good tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I saw this book at the bookstore, I bought it immediately. I love the entire Prey series and could hardly wait for another one to come along. What a disappointment. I started to read it several times before I could get interested enough to finish it. Too many characters...too much jumping around...and Lucas was not his usual self in this one. I thought about reading it a second time just to see if I missed something the first time around but just couldn't bring myself to do so. I'm still a Lucas Davenport fan though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Prey","review":"I thought Easy Prey was much better than Certain Prey because once again Sanford concentrated on Davenport and not the protagonist like he did in Certain Prey. I was hooked from the first page and read it in a weekend. Lucas Davenport has his hands full and I can't wait to see what happens in the next Prey novel...which one will he choose? Maybe none of them. I give this one 6 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I can't believe that John Sandford actually was the author of this book. It doesn't read like a Sandford. I would definately reccommend skipping it. It offered nothing to the Prey series. It never got moving, it introduced numerous redundant characters and went into the last few pages before introducing the villian. Readers weren't allowed to become acquainted with the villian at all. Didn't follow the rules of a good mystery. Extremely boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"too difficult to listen to","review":"I usually enjoy John Sanford's books and looked forward to listening to this one on tape. However, I gave up after struggling through cassette one. I thought that maybe it would make more sense if I could read and reread the passages in the printed version. But after reading the other customer reviews, I don't think that would have helped. I will just skip this one and hope John Sandford gets back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Prey is not an easy read","review":"I have read all of the Prey books and enjoyed them tremendously. I was eager to read Easy Prey but after 100 pages I was puzzled. It did not \\"grab\\" me at all. Too many characters to remember.The story lumbered along for about 170 pages when it got a little interesting. Lucas seems to be burned out, both as a police officer and as an attractive hunk. I am anxious to finish this book and go on to better fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever Happened to the \\"Old\\" John Sandford","review":"It is with deep regret that I am posting this review... John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series was an exciting, innovative, suspense series in the tradition of Lawrence Sander's marvelous \\"Deadly Sin\\" series... unfortunately, Mr. Sandford's latest is easily his worst....The plot is thin and drawn out... there is little or no interaction between the characters that we have known over countless novels... and, it is even worse when the author cheats and reveals a suspect who is not even contained in the first three quarters of the novel...A lesbian sub-plot is thrown into the novel just for the sake of luridness, and plot threads are either left hanging or under-developed.I can only \\"prey\\" that this series improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"This was a real snoozer - the characters are cardboard - especially the women and the mystery is very misleading - a cheap solution.I tossed the set after listening - it wasn't worth keeping or passing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also very disappointed","review":"The first ten pages were interesting, the level of writing I expect from this author. Then the plot stalled. The characters were uninteresting and not well developed.

Introducing a new character in the last few pages and having that character be an important part of the book is unfair.

I will read the next book with a bit of reluctance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Dissappointment","review":"I am a big fan of John Sanford and the \\"Prey\\" series. Without a doubt, this was the most dissappointing of the lot. I didn't even want to finish reading the book (whereas in most cases, I can't stand putting them down). Bland unsympathetic characters, little suspense, few surprises, and Lucas just didn't \\"strut his stuff.\\" Best advice: skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Prey--Easily Forgotten","review":"I've read all of Sanford's books. I'm a major fan. But this one's a dud. Sanford's plot is so convoluted that he resorts to a list of bulleted paragraphs to summarize the evidence through the mouth of Lucas Davenport.Speaking of Lucas, other than the fast Porsche and a paragraph or two on the game business, all we learn about Davenport in this one is that he's doing his best to juggle three babes simultaneously--what a guy.Sanford doesn't just stumble here, he trips and falls. This one is bereft of terror, suspense, mystery, fun, or originality.Sanford has chosen an apt title. As it lacks everything a Davenport tale should contain, this book is very Easy Prey for a loyal reader.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Prey Yet","review":"This has to be the worst book in the series. It lacked action and seemed to be designed to keep the reader off track. There is no way you can put clues together and try to figure out who the killer is. The confrontation in the gas station was so cheesy and unrealistic and the book even ends on a sour note, if I could get a refund I would. I wonder if author got a bonus for writing another Prey book so soon. I am a huge fan of this series, but I was very, very disappointed with this one. As a matter of fact I plan to go back to the first couple of books just to recapture the excitement missed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it!","review":"I've always liked his books but like so many of my favorite authors he's produced something unreadable.

Should have read the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Prey-The Reader","review":"I have read all of the \\"prey\\" books and this is by far the worst. Davenport has become a political animal and the fact he is juggling three women even lowers him more in my eyes. The plot is boring-put me to slep every night after a few pages...so and so went here, called so and so....no clues to who the killer(s) is/are....I had no sympathy for the victims, either. I can't believe I paid hard cover price for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Inevitable, Ultimate Disappointment","review":"I have read all of the previous books in the \\"Prey\\" series by Sanford and have been thrilled, frightened, and amazed by his work. Unfortunately, my previous experiences with Sanford did not prepare me for this poor excuse of an effort. The plot is obvious and even if it wasn't, you wouldn't care. The characters, even the formerly ever engaging Davenport, are wooden to the point of being comical. We can only hope Sanford got the bad one \\"out of his system\\" and that his next effort will again enthrall us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks the Rules","review":"A real letdown.

I hate to give too much away--but you can't introduce a major player in the last couple of chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Sandford is not Agatha Christie","review":"John Sandford novels are not the puzzle mysteries that Dame Agatha fashioned so well. Mr. Sandford's stories contain gore, violence, humor and sex. He tells his stories well, but don't buy a Sandford novel expecting to find a \\"fair\\" mystery with all of the clues set out in a way that the reader can unscramble.

It just didn't live up to what we had come to expect and enjoy from Davenport episodes.

There were too many subplots with new characters being introduced continually. There was not enough time to digest each character as he/she appeared.

Maybe EASY PREY is not the best Davenport but read someone else, you find the Prey series is always good. And by the way, read them in order. EASY PREY is a tough one to predict, death of a famous model and open lesbian, maybe impossible so it takes a little away but following Davenport's logic and in this book his love life with a returning Weather and Marcy and Jael and Catrin...very interesting. Loved the last line of the book. On to CHOSEN PREY!!

The novel has some okay twists, but its nothing special. We get within 20 pages of the end, we think we know who the killer is.

However, the good thing is, buying the 6682 comes with the headset so it is not really a problem.All the same, in order for amazon to be the place of choice for shoppers, this combo needs to be taken off the website. It is only reducing amazon's reputation for providing exceptional products and services. I got this combo before checking out previous reviews and I regret it to an extent.

Also, some canned mushroom soups have a beef base, which the author also neglects to mention.

It's the answer. It has to be, if we're going to survive. Then you continue on to the end and you get the chills because we haven't figured it out and probably never will.I'm an avid reader, but I don't make pretentions to be as intensely well educated as Jabanoski is.

Phillip, who has grown up being told to stay away from blacks, is rescued by Timothy, who is an older black man. The novel is a little bit Robinson Crusoe and a little Helen Keller. Phillip goes through many emotions that the readers may laugh about because they can relate to the absurdity-one example is his exaggerated selfishness. Phillip is forced to change, but does it willingly & in his own time. For as Timothy would say, \\"I'm all you've got\\"(but with his accent).

They have to work through problems to survive with nothing but a keg of water, a bit of chocolate, and natural resources. A big storm occurs and catastrophe hits. One big question is who dies Timothy or Phillip?I would NOT recommend this book because it is very boring and the main characters are dull. It is boring because the story seemed just to be about a spoiled brat and a black man who have problems with each other. To me the characters are dull because they are one-dimensional.

That's how good it was. The book seemed to drag on for a long time. I remember being really annoyed that the author didn't give many descriptions. This made it hard to understand why a character said or did certain things. The descriptions usually came up a few chapters later, but then I'd have to reread material to understand it.Anyway, I also found the book hard to follow and visualize.

If you read the book you'll find out why it was sad!I would deffinitly recomend this book to someone else.

This veridical description of the trials undergone by a young white boy and an old negro man on an unfertile island in the Caribbean attracts the reader and keeps him/her hooked until the very end. From the opening paragraph, Theodore Taylor has the reader deeply concerned for the welfare of the main character, Phillip. When Phillip is sad, the reader is sad. Later in the book, when Phillip is dissapointed, the reader is dissapointed. As Phillip grows up throughout the book, the reader comes of age at the same rate.

To me it gave me a real look about what it was like in World War Two, when my grandfather was a pilot. It gave me a look on how hard it was for everyone, even if you were innocent.

Timothy and Phillip have to survive stranded on an island.Phillip didn't like Timothy because he was black. When Phillip becomes blind he can only see what was inside Timothy instead of his skin color. Being blind was good for Phillip because he became a different character, so instead of seeing the outside, he saw what was in the inside. While Phillip was blind he learned a new way of life.

While many see it as the story of a boy who overcomes prejudice, I see it more as an adventure novel.

Well, because the best it got for me, was the group that played on the now-out-of print Verve album \\"Here and Now\\" which has been available only from time to time (shame on you Verve Interactive) most recently in 1998.That's where the interplay between Golson and Farmer seemed at its best, and Farmer gets to play some great flugelhorn. However this is just fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the Jazztet","review":"I purchased this CD for my husband, who had been looking for Killer Joe and Easy Living by Benny Golson, two of his favorites. He is a serious jazz fan; I am not, so I cannot be more specific about the music. We were disappointed though, because cut one, Serenata and cut three Avalon did not play. He was very happy with the rest of the CD, and was sorry he could not hear all the music on the CD. He did not want to return the item, because he was unsure he could find Killer Joe somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"for those that like the genre","review":"This was a made-for-TV film, but it wasn't below the quality of what one can see in a theater. It had no severe breaks where commercials would fit. If you like political intrigue works like Baldwin's \\"Crimson Tide,\\" Stone's \\"JFK,\\" or Crowe's \\"The Insider,\\" then this will be for you. For us Americans who were delighting in 1990s, Internet-based prosperity, this will remind us that not everyone in the world was succeeding. The main character in this work is a woman, yet the cover implies that she is just one of many main characters. This may be sexist, an attempt to appease the mostly male audience that expects men to be leaders in international turmoils. One character was supposed to work for the UK, lived their most of his life, but had an American accent just like any other American at home. Again, this work is just for those who like this type of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining as well as historical","review":"I love Wendy Crewson in general, but she gives a steller performance in \\"Hunt for Justice\\" I enjoyed the movie enough to watch more than once and have loaned it to many of my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"How about a reprint??","review":"I bought this book when it first came out and unfortunately lost it moving to England in February 1999.

They are all incredibly over-posed, even down to the same blue/white clothes that nearly all his models wear. I felt like every page had the same information as the last. Most of the example shots were the kind grandma would like - nothing young couples and families would be asking for. All too dated for the modern photographer.Some of the lighting techniques are useful and interesting, but when you are shooting outdoors, God-given light is pretty easy and straight-forward to work with.

This book is good if read back in the '80s. The style for protraits is out of current trends (meaning what comsumers would buy). If you plan to do business in photography, this is NOT a book for you.Aperture priority in some photos are wrongly used. Example: the girls at the gate with a cute basket of flowers. That is probably a 5.6 aperture. The point of focus (sharpness) fell on the fence! instead of girls faces or flowers. If soft focused is the point, you still want the sharpest area on the subject and not on the surroundings.Composition in photos: too busy and dsitracting from subjetc in my opinion.Secrets?

Although, the plot on the inside jacket is misleading, most of the book does not circle around Joshua Baker and how he saw \\"Santa\\" getting killed. It revolves around the insane town of Pine Cove and its inhabitants, which I loved. The extremely ironic and satirical humor made me laugh out loud.

Moore's humor and imagination are something very unique. So, I was looking foward to \\"The Stupidest Angel,\\" and was not in the least disappointed. I was especially pleased to see the return of Tucker Case and his Ray-ban-wearin' bat, Roberto. If you've enjoyed Moore's other books, you will not be disappointed in this new one, especially after you meet Skinner the dog. He's yet another in a long line of memorable characters that Moore has created. This book is sure to be a holiday classic for Moore fans.

This one pales in comparison to his usual output.Moore takes his usual writing characteristics and exaggerates them. This creates a book that is boring and unreadable, unlike the pleasantly quirky books he usually writes. Moore has a gift for taking various different threads and then making it all fit together. Not so here. The story feels weak and disconnected. The characters are not believable either. They are polarized to the point of being absurd.Perhaps this is the effect Moore was going for. If it was, then it was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stupidest Angel","review":"The Stupidest Angel was not my kind of humor; I did not laugh.

This is my first Christopher Moore book, so all the reused characters were new to me. I didn't find any of them particularly likable. The only exception is Theo, whose marriage and money issues were relatable, although the guy was a bit of a dunce. Everyone else was an absurd caricature that was either too crazy, obnoxious, or irresponsible to be believable. The \\"stupidest angel\\" didn't bring much to the table either. Much of the humor fell flat and didn't elicit more than a chuckle from me. The plot meanders along until about 200 pages in when the 'twist' occurs, but by then I didn't care what happened to the characters. This all wraps up in a sugary sweet ending that makes the preceding 300 pages feel pointless. Just weak all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book till the end","review":"This book was moving along in a fun way .... then went off into stupid land.

He is by far my favorite writer, due to his wacky creativity and hilarious (to me) humor. I was hesitant to splurge for The Stupidest Angel because I thought it was going to be a really small book targeted at a readership of youngsters.I was pleasantly surprised, on reading Angel, that it reprised some of Moore's best and funniest characters from his earlier novels, and that the book is written for his usual audience. There are few books that make me laugh out loud with the very first sentence. This one did. And it got better from there.Was I disappointed with The Stupidest Angel?

I giggled and laughed page after page after page. The edition I got was labeled as version 2.0 which made me laugh before I even opened the book. I think it was 307 pages. Bought it right here at Amazon. I can honestly say there was not a dull moment in this book. I am definatly going to get another one of Mr. Moore's books very soon. I recommend this to anyone over 18. Maybe 21. He has a warning in the front that I loved. Just go get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\\"","review":"This is \\"a heartwarming tale of Christmas terror\\". It's about what happens when \\"the stupidest angel\\" performs a \\"Christmas miracle\\" in Pine Cove. Apparently, the author has written some other books about Pine Cove, but I never read those. Despite that, I still thoroughly enjoyed this funny, irreverent book. I got \\"Version 2.0\\" of the book, which contains an all-new bonus chapter. The new chapter is about what happened in Pine Cove on Christmas one year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Chrismas tradition","review":"Christopher Moore is wonderfully creative. I recommend this book, as well as anything else you can get your hands on by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new holiday tradition.","review":"Everyone, it seems, has their own unique holiday traditions. Reading this book is now mine. Christopher Moore is one of only a few authors whose books areas good the second or third time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have really enjoyed most of Christopher Moore's books, but compared to his other books, this one was underdeveloped, slow, and an overall weak story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Moore does it again!","review":"Great read. If you can't laugh at Christmas, how about zombies at Christmas? Who knew they liked Ikea as much as living flesh.This book will be more enjoyable if you have read other Moore books, but don't let that stop you. Old friends are back and the more things change, the more they stay the same. I laughed my butski blueski."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moore still makes me laugh","review":"This really needs to be a 4.5 star rating. It is not on par with Moore's best stuff (Bloodsucking Fiends, Love Nun, Lamb), but it is very entertaining. Moore fans will enjoy seeing many of their old favorites pop up in this book, but new Moore readers would be better served by starting with some of the older work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid, Superb, Scrumtulecent","review":"I really enjoyed the dog scene with the food guy. It was by far the funniest part of the book. I still think Lamb is his best book, in fact I considered never reading another book by Chris Moore again because I thought it could never live up to lamb. I recomment this book to anyone who likes to laugh and garnish odd looks from people because you burst out laughing in public while reading a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Moore does it again","review":"If you haven't read his other books, read them first, or you may not be able to truly appreciate their appearances in \\"The Stupidest Angel\\". When the \\"Warning\\" at the front of the book has you laughing out loud, you know it's going to be fun. This was a very quick read, but it will have you laughing all the way through. Definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY Angle on the Angel","review":"I'm a huge Christopher Moore fan, have enjoyed all of his writings to date, and this book met all my expectations of wit, wry humor, and warped storylines featuring many of the eccentric personalities I've grown to know and adore in Pine Cove and from other Moore books. I recommend starting with \\"Practical Demonkeeping\\" (the first book in Christopher Moore's series and the reader's intro to Pine Cove) and following his array of books in the order he's written them. All are winners, just some more special than others. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the typical holiday books","review":"As the author says up front, this is NOT the typical Christmas book of good cheer.Bizarre is only the beginning. This book is only my second Christopher Moore book (A Dirty Job was the first), so I have no background for many of the other characters even though they have been in Moore's other books.I love that they love each other (well, almost) in spite of their faults and frailties. In that that way it's traditional, otherwise, all bets are off!The ending was a little rushed and pat, which is the reason for the 4 not 5 rating, but in the Christmas spirit, I'll let it go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave 'em wanting more Moore","review":"This was my first introduction to a Christopher Moore novel. So I don't have anything on which to compare it. What I can say is that after reading this first one, I'm frantically searching for more of his books on audio. The story actually made me laugh out loud. It's a very well told story that, despite being funny, actually keeps you wanting to know what happens next. I loved it. Can't wait to get more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Sick","review":"Christopher Moore's The Stupidest Angel has got to be the sickest, most perverse take on the Christmas Angel / Christmas miracle theme I have ever encountered.I loved it.Many of the characters were apparently resurrected (unfortunate choice of words) from other books by Moore, but a reader does not have to have read these earlier works to grow to love-or fear-the...uh...eccentric population of Pine Cove, California. Only the cemetery people (don't want to give too much away here) were a tad on the unlikable side, but I think that was probably Moore's intent, so that's not really a criticism.The plot builds logically (ironic, huh?) and suspensfully, and the final battle scene is delicious. Christmas simply won't be the same again.If you love irreverence, sarcasm, and situations that seem to actually make sense in their ridiculousness, you'll love The Stupidest Angel. If not, well, I'm sure they're showing that Jimmy Stewart movie somewhere on television right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked Version 1.0 Better!","review":"Stupidest Angel is a total hoot, especially for longtime fans of the author (in fact, those unfamiliar with the characters and location will miss a significant number of inside jokes and references). The additional chapter in 2.0 isn't as good as the rest of the book and adds nothing to the story (sigh). Plenty of room exists for a bona fide sequel however... Regardless, Stupidest Angel has become one of my annual holiday traditions (1.0, that is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stupidest Book","review":"Well, I hate to say it, but if I were to rename this book it would have been \\"The Stupidest Book\\" This was a book club selection, so I stuck with it through the most amazing dumb \\"plot\\" (of sorts). Or maybe I just need a humor transplant. If you want quirky characters, Pine Cove, California is the place to go. Everything from the police officer who grows pot to buy an ancient Japanese sword for his girlfriend, the ex-adventure/porn star with mental problems who thinks she's still an avenger when off her meds to a pilot with a talking sun-glasses wearing fruit bat named Roberto to the bar owner who laces her Christmas fruitcake with Xanax and XTC, through the entire town and down to the dim-witted angel sent to earth to grant a child's wish and in the process turns an entire cemetery into an attacking hoard of zombies. I loved Moore's earlier \\"Lamb: The Gospel according to Biff Christ's Childhood Pal,\\" but this one just didn't do it for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very odd, in a twisted way!","review":"I must say this guy knows how to loosen the moral fibers of one of our most important Christian days. He steps on most that is near and dear to our beliefs and understanding of the birth of our Lord. That being said, thew book is intertaining and while rude is never outright filthy. I would not tell everyone about it, only people who can understand solid black humor and full on tongue and cheek humor at it full power."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stupidest Angel","review":"It was really stupid! I did not think it was at all well written. The whole story was juvenile. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupidest angel","review":"What a ride. Once more Christopher Moore draws a bizarre and hilariously funny story that hits dangerously close to home."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRISTOPHER MOORE!!!!","review":"I am in love with these books. I have lent them out numerous times to people who have ALL said how much they love them. I can read them over and over again and never get bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stupidest Angel","review":"Christopher Moore has done it again! I love how he has, once again, combined characters from previous books (\\"Lamb,\\" \\"The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove,\\" \\"Island of the Sequined Love Nun\\") into this crazy Christmas story! Can't wait to read the next Christopher Moore book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Christopher Moore","review":"I have recently discovered Christopher Moore and i love his books. I started with \\"Lamb\\" which was hilarious. I then read \\"The Lust Lizard of Melancholvy Cove\\", and \\"Fluke\\" and most recently \\"The Stupidest Angel\\". I was thrilled to be back with the characters from the town of Pine Cove. This book is great. Very funny characters, and situations. Looking forward to reading his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planet Earth","review":"Awesome!!!!!!!Every nature lover should have these great DVDs, the quality is amazing.I cant watch enough of them.Thank you BBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely AWESOME!","review":"I purchased this item when it was a Gold Box Deal of the Day for $69.99. What a deal this truly is. In my personal opinion any DVD that is narrated by David Attenborough is just AWESOME! This 17 disc set has some of the most facinating pictures and information regarding birds, mammals, oceans, jungles, forests, and many others. The DVD's are very educational, if you have kids they should absolutely love these DVD's. We love to watch DVD Box Sets that are about nature and animals. I am so glad that I purchased this item, as it shows so many pictures and areas that I have never visited or seen before. It is an enlighten show for the whole family. You will not be disappointed by purchasing this item. It is truly spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"BADMEN OF DEADWOOD","review":"Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. This is a DVD made from a VHS transfer, made from a VHS transfer. The picture quality is so bad it gave me a headache after just 15 minutes of watching fuzzy images and dark scenes. And the sound is even worse. I have no idea why companies like this who spend money making attractive box covers and disc lables can have no regard for the quality of the movie they are transferring. There is no excuse....if they worked with a decent 16 MM print there is no way it could be this bad. This company has bought a bad VHS tape and made a copy from that bad tape to offer an even worse quality copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACE","review":"Amazon should not allow dvds of this sort. The quality is almost at a point that you cannot make out the identity of the actors. That is how poor the quality is.At $14.95, it makes it highway robbery."},{"rating":"1","title":"a quality print is hard to find","review":"The Braun media print is a poor transfer and their source must have been bad. I would recommend the Platinum / Echp Bridge transfer which also has other films included in The Great American Western series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best choice","review":"I decided to get this product after read the comments above. However, I don't think it's as good as what they said or what I expected. When I tried to close its two sides to flat my hair, they're not completely close so that the result is not as good as the regular iron. The material is a little bit poor and it's not very hot like what they described. So it's not a good choice to curl my hair because it take too much time. I'm a little bit disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for armchair explorers.","review":"I was looking for information on Machu Picchu, when I came across this gem. The cover stirred up fantasies of Shangrila. I was intrigued, ordered it, and was delighted.This is a photographic exploration of Kuelap, a mysterious citadel in the high Andes, discovered seventy years before Machu Picchu. The Chachapoya, or Cloud People (understandably so-called) were the inahabitants of this remote and inaccessible area.Keith Muscutt has provided a detailed and interesting text to accompany this visual feast. He photographs the present inhabitants of the region, supposedly the ancestors of the builders of Kuelap. Perhaps or perhaps not, but interesting anyway.The photographs of tombs built vertically in the cliff side are indescribable. All in all I highly recommend this, whether the interest is information or pleasure. Both are to be found in these pages. Thorough and interesting and visually beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAWS'S OUT","review":"SAW CONDUCTOR FOR A CONCERT GREAT GREAT GREATWE GOT A FEW MORE TAPES TO GIVE OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE TO ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Orchestra Jazz to a new level!","review":"If you are a Michael Buble\` fan you've heard what a GREAT band he sings in front of - and if you're like me, you like Buble\`, but you would listen to his band, WITHOUT him... ok, if you're like my wife, you won't agree with that last statement...The point is, move over Buble\` band, The Hawk-Richard Orchestra is HOT, vibrant and kicks big band jazz to a new height!!

The author delivers lip service to his title \\"The KISS Principle.\\" There is minimal discussion of software design with its associated \\"keep it simple stupid\\" principal. The first chapter covers the lessons learned from several small projects. This book advocates various software development tools in areas such as project management, diagramming, automatic code generators, structured design, editors, word processors, portable terminals, record management, and email."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is no longer of interest","review":"Unless you are a student of older systems technologies this book is no longer of interest.

I even suspect the speed of modern computers makes this whole issue moot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Christmas cd ever!","review":"I love holiday music, basically any type except country. I have seen Pavarotti perform twice, and have several opera CDs. I have a large collection of classical music too. Classical and opera music is beautiful and moving. So I was expecting a wonderful cd filled with fantastic music. Such a disappointment. I was entertaining with this cd on, and one of my guests actually switched out the cd. I advise you not to purchase this cd. I purchase a cello Christmas cd at the same time, it is very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fabulous Andre","review":"I think one of the greatest things about ALL of Andre Rieus DVD's is the Visual effects, it is absolutely incredible to see ALL that is contained in it. Not only the beautiful music, but the beautiful dresses of the ladies in the orchestra, the men all dressed up, some of the DVD's had such funny things going on ..it made you laugh. His Christmas one was a little more refined, calmer, but beautiful none the less. I own about l6 of his DVD's and there is not one of them I don't like...all offer something special.

It is a relief to simply not have to deal with a bad experience. This was a completely positive one. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Western..","review":"This book has a strong Anti-Western tilt. It whitewashes Islam and is both subtly and at times even overtly negative to Christianity and Western thought. There is \\"no mention of jihad as a warlike means to expand Islam; Islamic conquest is described as good, Christian conquest as bad; and non-Western civilizations as benign, Western civilizations as evil.\\"A good example is that the book doesn't even mention Muslims or jihad when discussing the 9/11 attacks. It also attributes moral equivalence between the Communists and the West during the Cold War. Its clearly written by far left wing ideologists. I would not want my children to read such a book. Its not objective. It seems like its one of these books funded by the Saudi Arabian Kingdom to promote Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!","review":"I am a student in 10th grade and I feel that this is the worst excuse for a history book ever.

This experience was a total waste of my time & hope. The book had massive amounts of highlighting, underlining, & graffiti throughout. The binding of the book had been taped back together. The cover was excessively beat up. No, I didn't contact the seller because if they really cared about customer service they wouldn't have misrepresented the condition of the book.

The text has an anti western, anti capitalist, anti Christian and anti Jewish bias, and conversely promotes Eastern and Middle Eastern cultures and promotes Islam as a religion.These concerned parents have approached the local school board and asked that this text be removed from the approved list of instructional materials. They were initially rebuffed, but the matter is now pending appeal before the entire Sarasota County School Board. This is the first time in history that such an appeal has ever been granted.I strongly urge readers to find out if your local School Board has approved of this text, and if so, to file a formal complaint with the School District Superintendent (not at the school level)."},{"rating":"2","title":"World History Book Buy","review":"This vendor got my book to me in very short order.

Full of diagrams and illustrations to make every concept crystal clear and graphic photos of some heinous crime scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in a long line of boring criminal justice books!!!","review":"This book is by far one of the best of the criminal justice books that I have ever read. If it wasn't required reading for my Criminal Investigations class, I just might have picked it up and read it on my own. This book is one of the most interesting and easy to read books that has ever been required reading. The photography in the text helps with the topics in the reading much more than in any other books I've read. Though a bit gruesome, the photos are of great quality and only help the book that much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Reference","review":"I initially purchased this book as required reading for a Police Sergeant promotional exam but, I realized that it was the most informative text on investigations that I have read to date.

THAT set you can order directly from Time-Life...and it contains over twice as much music and the songs are performed by differnt classic performers. Considering what you get, I'll spend a little extra and order it there.

Since we all came from families, Candy generously shows us what her family looked like and how they lived. This human element is something that is lacking in books today. Sure, Candy talks about herself and her brother Frank, but that's what you would expect from a family-type book like this anyway. Hard-core fans will come away with something they didn't know about Frank Zappa, and almost all of the early photos of Frank have not been seen before. On the basis of that alone, it's worth far more than the cover price. The rest of it is the icing on the cake. Just as important, Candy is a very talented vocalist that can stand on her own. Great work and highly recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the archives ..............","review":"Danny is a much better player now than he was when he made this.

This, his second album, was recorded in 1987 when the Synclavier was still in production, and its use here does not suit this style of music, except on \\"Ice Drops\\", where poor production nevertheless spoils the good elements, as it does on every track.The work of most instrumentalists improves dramatically during their careers, so listen to his most recent albums and work back. You won't get as far as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan Burger is even better than the Sting Burger","review":"This is truly an amazing book. Its not often that a piece of writing comes along that can make you shake your head in disbelief, roll around with extreme belly laughter, and question the world's reason for exsistence. Satan Burger does all of this and more. The writing style is descriptive to the point where you see, feel, smell, and get punched in the face by the settings and characters. Carlton Mellick III turns words that have never been used as adjectives and verbs before into mindbending surreal atomospheres that jump of the page and mosh inside your brain. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this book. OK I need to go bother LaVar Burton about seeing if I can review this book on Reading Rainbow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat at Satan Burger!","review":"An oddly assorted group of people living in a large house get a new tenant... Satan, who plans to open a restaurant. The fun starts here and never lets up. Heaven shuts down and the dead have no place to go. Plenty of great sex and violence, some great imagery, and a story line that gets stranger with every page. And I agree, the \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" original show had more than just a good theme song! Or did it?This is one of Mellick's first books. It is well developed and very interesting. He has since written many more in a very short period, including \\"Punk Land,\\" the sequel to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't look at the ending, until you are actually AWARE!","review":"I honestly did not know what to expect from this book. I ordered it on a fluke, and what i read morphed into something i won't forget, that is, unless i want to sleepwalk the rest of my life like a zombie! Could not put the book down, and the ending well, influenced a radical change in my apartment. I hope he keeps pummeling out the ideas, but he would NOT write like this, if THIS LIFE was interesting. His eccentric ability to combine random free thought, throughout the book, stretches your perceptions on what you accept, or think is life. Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Religious Drive Bys, rarely leave their readers still standing in the middle of the road. If you are smart you make it to the other side, or the end. However his end, which he aptly puts, is for most people, their end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected...","review":"I decided to read this book based on the other reviews and what it was linked to. All in all, it is an... interesting... book. It is very surreal, kind of annoying in its occasional shock for the sake of shock attitude, but for the most part, it has a good plot and subject. The writing is very mediocre. He makes up words, and uses childish vocabulary, possibly to prove some kind of point that never revealed itself to me. I, like a few of the other reviewers, did not get the ending. Last thing? About halfway through, I stopped wanting to finish the book, but I did anyway. Good or bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, trite and just plain boring","review":"I don't normally write reviews but i thought I should warn you. Dont buy this book. It reads like an angsty high school students journal. I bought this after being recomended it by many people on amazon. I like choke and survivor and easton ellis and all that but this is whack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish, Juvenile, Unreadable","review":"Folks, this is a cautionary tale -- not the content of \\"Satan Burger\\" mind you, but the fact that it exists. Was it self published? If so, please let somebody professional in the craft of writing take a look at your work before you put it out there. Otherwise you wind up with something like this, a bathroom-y, high school type mishmash of unconnected writing. Not that there isn't a spark here, an exuberance, but jeeze...I guess I should have been warned off by the cover, truely off-putting, but I am a fan of surrealist, dystopian sci-fi, and was suckered in by the reviews. I can usually get through a book if the ideas are interesting, even if the writing is sub-par -- that's what you often get if you like more alternative sci-fi. But even my lowest expectations were left far behind in this one.Just a friendly warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Story Ever Told!","review":"This book was an exceptional read for anyone into not too coy satire about religion, the devil, and all the other absurd oddball characters associated with diety worship. It paints society out to be absurd too but the author, this psycho-beat-realist was on something when he wrote this besides being just a cynical so and so. But it's pretty refusing to read a piece of anti-literature by someone who basically sees the world for sadly how it either really is or going to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with the ending","review":"I am an avid Palahniuk fan and had gotten linked to Mellick somehow through browsing Amazon. After reading the reviews, I decided to try him out. He definitely has a unique style. The story deals with such themes as cultural apathy, Christian demagogues, and social relationships. At times it is almost like a script for South Park, and other times, somewhat profound insights can be found masked by the silliness. I have to admit there were times in the book where I felt he was flailing, but the end drew everything together nicely without even a real resolution. It made its point and in doing so redeemed some of the tangential writing that preceded the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. T book","review":"Okay, so if you don't know why \\"Mr. T\\" is used as an adjective in my review title then you haven't read the book. Satan Burger is the first book I read by Carlton Mellick III. It is not my favorite, but it is nearly a classic for me. It's the first book I ever read that actually spoke to me. Most books seem to be written for middle aged housewives these days. This book is like science-fiction for weirdos. Not the kind of science-fiction you'd see on the sci-fi channel, but rather anti-mainstream crazy messed up weirdo sci-fi. Check it out. All books by this author are great. I've read them all. If you're looking for something different, check out Mellick. If you buy books because they are bestsellers then forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King, Ann Rice, and you other hacks rollover for Mellick","review":"There comes a time when you have to decide if you are going to be allowed to be force feed commercial material for the rest of your life. Most just blindly follow however a few rise above this and CM3 is one who has risen about the mediocraty of commercialism. Where most authors would beat around the bush with symbolism of the devil CM3 throws it in your face and says not only does he exist but he owns a fast food resturant, with talking furniture of course.Never has an author been able to keep me interested enough to shut the door to the outside world and actually want to read an entire book as CM3 has. It's easy to say the CM3 is bizarre and weird but without giving \\"Satan Burger\\" a chance you will never know exactly what bizarre is. I would highly, highly recommend this book if you are tired of the normal stories that always end the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrible","review":"Junk book...Nothing compared to Clevenger, Baer, Palahniuk... from whom I got to know this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"This book, while getting your attention and is rather good with details of characters and even non characters(hence the one star) is an utter waste of ones time. The ending is rubbish. It is a waste... The ending leaves the reader hanging and saying \\"What just happened? Is this it? Where is the rest of the book?\\" I suggest never buying this book and not listening to the ones that gave it better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professional?","review":"This book read like its editor was maybe a friend of the writer. Someone who's never edited anything but maybe their own shopping list. The book is a series of weird things made up by the author that usually don't have anything to do with one another. There is not much story here, just lots of jumbled ideas. The way the author presents them, though, lacks good prose style. Hmmm... I think the author must be someone that read Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions and was really into the photocopied 'zine world. It reads like an amateur, immature, rough version of things the author has read in the past. I finished it, though, so I am giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, original and well written","review":"with all the hype, i expected an extreme book that is sacriligious and raw and whatnot, but it isn't. the story is different, well told, and interesting. the book is well written, flows nicely, and has an interesting bunch of characters. at times the words are poetic, and there is one scene that was so well written i could see what was happening. the book is odd, has some odd philosopy, and an interesting take on the invention of the sandwich. i'm glad i bought the book, it is in no way cookie cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Too Silly","review":"There were some downright funny moments in this book. Regretfully, they were few and far between. For the most part, it was just a rambling exercise of imagination. Much of its perspective seemed juvenile, which is to be expected; he wrote it while very young.I'm sure his newer work is much improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah it\`s an \\"anti-novel\\".............","review":".........But the reason we read books like this is to be entertained. Satan\`s fast food restaurant is filled with VCR\`s that can\`t take someone\`s order, Leaf has \\"God\`s Eyes\\" that allow him to float to somewhere else, Wanna be Pirates, fascination and being turned on by Jesus. This book is really wild , but at some point I\`m waiting for the pay-off. The part of the book where it all comes together. For me, even reading about the \\"Blue Women\\", that moment never came. \\"The dolphin shocked me when he (?) picked up the accordian that was lying in the pool and began to play Wagner when Alisa said, \\"The toast comes before the butter God dammit!!\\"\\"If those passages were in a \\"Carlton Mellick III\\" ANTI-NOVEL I\`d be popular too. While a number of people gushed over this book, maybe I just don\`t get it. A little more of The Silence might have done it for me...........who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun book by the strangest author in the world","review":"If you haven't heard of Carlton Mellick III before, you need to check him out. He is the author of a bunch of crazy weird books that have been popping into print like somebody spilled water on a gremlin. Twelve books in 4 years? That's damn prolific. And every one is worth its weight in gold. I'm not sure if I can even call these books novels, or anti-novels. They are more like fascinating chunks of Carlton's brain.Satan Burger is one of his first books. Not a masterpiece, but it is so packed full of imagination and fun ideas that it's irresistable. Fans of Kurt Vonnegut or William Burroughs should check this out. But be prepared for something much different than anything you've read in the past. If there was a genre for Carlton Mellick's books it would probably be \\"perverted punk rock alternate reality surrealism.\\"Read a few of his books. He'll grow on you like a genital wart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I embrace unusual and different styles of fiction. However, this just seemed like a desperate attempt to throw in as many random variables just for oddities sake without any plausible connection to the main story line. There were a few nuggets of philisophical ideas that were interesting but all in all it was not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"its only entertainment, dont take it for anything else","review":"heaven is closed and nobody cares about anything. people use the bathroom in the middle of the floors, satan sells food for souls to stay in business and a cemetary where the dead write their own biographies for others to read. yeah, the title and cover will either make you want to read this or run from it. if you do read, take it as it is, dont put anything into it, it is not meant to damn us to hell for reading it, its purely entertaining and thats it. mellick does a good job describing how things would be if the universe goes haywire and the population can die but not go anywhere but turn into a zombie and slowly wait for whats left of them to slip away. there is a chapter in the book where they are having a concert and it starts to rain and the people go mad- you have to read the rest. cool book, nice flow and remember its just entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly bizarre but enjoyable","review":"It's the cover that drew my eye to this book, to be honest. I just had to see what it was about with a cover image like that.Satan Burger is easily the most bizarre book I've ever read. That being said, I enjoyed it from start to finish. Carlton Mellick III uses English in a very, very loose fashion which makes for some very interesting reading and unique word combinations to form descriptions that I found surprisingly refreshing.If you're in the mood for something completely out of the ordinary that tells a really weird tale in a really weird fashion, give this book a read. You might enjoy it. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless and Unforgettable Introduction to Higher Math","review":"After reading this:\\"It doesn't matter what mathematical things are: it's what they do that counts. Thus mathematics hovers uneasily between the real and the not real; its meaning does not reside in formal abstractions, but neither is it tangible. This may cause problems with philosophers who like tidy categories, but it is the great strength of mathematics -- what I have elsewhere called its 'unreal reality.' Mathematics links the abstract world of mental concepts to the real world of physical things without being located completely in either.\\" - Ian Stewart, What is Mathematics?...I was hooked and after reading it several times, I still can't put it down! Great job to all who contributed to creating this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"typos galore, terrible layout","review":"The book is littered with mangled formulas, mostly due to the fact the minus sign is missing from most formulas. This is completely unacceptable in any math book, but particularly so in a book aimed at beginners, who will probably feel bewildered by the huge amount of nonsensical formulas.Adding insult to injury, the poor layout of Kindle edition makes the book hard to enjoy. Section headings often appear as orphans at the bottom of pages and many formulas are displayed as small, low-quality images. The low image quality is especially visible when reading the book on a Kindle 2 as opposed to for example the Kindle Mac app. Inlining formula images with running text is particularly annoying, since it deforms the text layout.I was so annoyed by these problems that I tried to return this book, only to discover that returns are not allowed for digital books.Do NOT buy the Kindle edition of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by Undergraduate Math Major","review":"As an above average undergraduate math major(by no means exceptional) I always had some nagging questions in the back of my mind.

Almost every song on here is really good! I bought it because, when on his website, there was a song on here, Om Tare Tuttare, that I had fallen in love with from the 30-second clip on his site. This was expensive, so it was a while before I decided to go ahead and order it. But I did, and I'm really glad! When I got the DVD, I put it on my computer and put that song on a playlist by itself, and I played it for 10 hours straight the day I got it, 14 hours straight the next day, and then for several days after that for hours and hours every day. (I'm STILL loving it, and not the least bit sick of it!) Since Amazon doesn't have song clips on here, you can check them out on his website; he has wonderful stuff!

We have only used wooden utensils when stiring, yet this wok still underperforms the cheaper ones of 1/5 of its price.

It plays CDs that it feels like playing. Moreover, because of the slim design, the spinning head every now and then catches onto the case of the player itself, and stops spinning. The shock protection is very bad, and stops playing every other second if I am walking.Moreover, it takes ages for it to load and start playing the song. The FM receiver is not very powerful so one gets static if the CD Player is in a bag.If you are wanting to go walking with your CD Player, this really is not the CD player for you.On another note, it has a good programming and nice colours.Very unreliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice player","review":"Pros:Durable, Small, looks cool, nice remote, plays lots of formats, easy to use, lots of features, good design, good battery life, great sound quality.Cons: Slow loading... (sometimes takes up to 45 seconds to load cds), Expensive ($120).Overall: good cd player, not really worth the $120 in my opinion because of the slow load time mostly. It is only when you are turning it on that it is slow, it is very fast switching songs and everything. Other than that it is a great cd player and I would recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD!!!","review":"I was very curious when I heard that there was another recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Joseph\\". Being one of the cast members of the German production, I love the music and the show a lot. And I also have the whole \\"Joseph\\" collection of CDs and DVDs at home:-)Now what I was hoping for was a new, \\"fresh\\" version of Joseph, but this new recording is probably the worst I have ever listened to. I really don't like the voices of Patrick Cassidy and Amy Adams, they are boring and uninspired. Sounds like a poor imitation of the London Revival Cast with Jason Donovan. (I liked Todd DuBail as the Pharaoh though:-))Furthermore the sound quality of the CD was pretty bad.And finally there wasn't any \\"Megamix\\" at the end (Maybe this new production doesn't have the \\"Megamix\\" - I haven't seen it) and the finale was shortened and ended with \\"Any dream will do\\".My advice: Buy the Candian Cast recording of the show. In my opinion that's the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poison","review":"This is a great, easy to learn game for 2 to 4 people although 4 is the best number to play. It is fast moving and fun.

The book is well written with just enough illustrations...not cluttered with too much information. It's like the author is standing next to you, talking you through the entire project. Every project seems to be laid out in logical order.A caution I'd mention is that the reading level suggested with the book is Ages 4-8...which is accurate...but reading level and carpentry skill are not the same. My son is 6, and this is fun with LOTS of adult supervision. I think he will enjoy this book more when he is in the 8-10 age range.One other caution I would mention is that this book was written in 1959. Some of the projects - like the shoeshine kit - are a bit dated.So, all in all, I would recommend the book, but for an older age-range and don't expect anything high-tech here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good project book to teach kids about creating things from wood.","review":"This book will provide a lot of fun with adult supervision.

Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy Book","review":"I ordered this book to ahve some projects to work on with my kids.

The unit will not stay set on one station (89.7 will be 89.5 in about 2 minutes). It has no pre-sets that I was able to find and you have to turn the station using the knob, which was loose on my radio, so you have to push in and turn to change the station. Doing this while driving is not a sound idea, which gets back to my argument that no radio is better than this one. I bought a replacement and likely will dump this one on an electronics recyclyer. I'd rather do that than risk someone else using the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad radio","review":"It will not stay on a station. It is a very poor radio, do not buy one.

His prose is just as fine as James Lee Burke's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been 300 pages","review":"I read this book for a book group, and will have lots to talk about when we meet. The book felt very choppy, as if he has 8 or 10 great ideas for scenes & storylines, but could not blend them together. This kept me regularly confused, not caring about the characters, and not understanding what the big mystery even was! Maybe if he spread the story out a little longer, and finished some of his thoughts and added some character backgrounds, I would have enjoyed this book more. Better authors with characters in remote locations are Steve Hamilton and James Crumley."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the mystery?","review":"The only thing mysterious about this book was that I finished it. The characters were not likeable, the setting was grim, the crime was obvious. The Alaskan atmosphere was laid on thick.The writing was overly poetic to no purpose. What was with the quotes from famous poets like Mandelstam? The whole thing was a big mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak mystery in Alaska","review":"One of several volumes by this author, about the only private eye in Sitka. A woman survived a terrible attack by local workers, only to vanish and perhaps be the victim of the same foul play again. What is the answer to this puzzling case?You can't fault the gritty setting, but you can do so with the unrelenting airlessness of the plotline. Not many people other than the victim impress the reader as in any way sympathetic. There are also stretches in the middle where the prose is confusing and it's difficult to even tell what's going on. Straley is a good writer, but this is hardly his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"As in depth and accurate as the DOD will allow","review":"While my son is pictured in the book in his capacity as an STS operator, there's only so much he can tell me without violating his security clearance.

The multiple skill sets they possess, the types of operations conducted, and the the levels of dedication and courage they display are amazing. There names and faces will only be known after something went wrong. Read it! Believe it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for history, but information is slightly dated.","review":"This was a great book to learn a lot of the history about Combat Control Techs. and Para Rescue men. Very good information about some of the operations these men conducted and participated in, and how they became to be what they are today.

This puts out an enormous amount of bubbles for its size. I actually had to crimp the tube a bit to reduce the amount of air because the bubbles it was producing were dislodging my plecos from their perches under a stump. Definitely worth the purchase and it makes for an amazing show of bubbles under any decorations or amongst plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little helper!","review":"I have a 75 gallons tank and wanted to give it better oxygenation, so I started looking for an aerator. I had to think a lot before deciding which size to get, and in the end I bought the 3\\" one. As others said, it produces an enormous amount of bubbles for its size, and it's perfect for my vertical aquarium, so considering its power, you might as well consider that the size is utterly important, depending on the size of your tank; I believe the 3\\" will work great for 100-gallons-and-less aquariums.The only disadvantage is that it needs some weight to stay down, I had to tie it to the bottom. Besides that, it's perfect, and having it for a week with 6 ten-inches goldfishes who usually make a mess everywhere, it was pretty much clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"I ordered two of the Deluxe Bubble Disk 5\\" Aerating Aquarium Disks and both of them only put bubbles out of one tiny spot.

The plants in my tank are thriving since putting this in as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't aerate worth a darn","review":"All I got out of this lousy product were huge bubbles out of three locations on this piece of junk. Whatever happened to a mist of bubbles like I wanted. I bought a much cheaper airstone that really delivered the goods. I'm just going to keep this bubble disk as an emergency ornament (if that means anything). I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk total junk","review":"After soaking the 3\\" stone for about 40 minutes instead of the 15 (because I forgot about it for a few minutes), I hooked it up only to be disappointed with it's bubble output. There are only a few bubbles that come out on the sides and not from the entire top or even a quarter of it. My 1 inch stone produces a hell of a lot more bubbling that this entire piece of floating junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air diffusion not that good, tendency to float and flip","review":"It works, just not very well. The air diffusion is not good, most of the air comes out of the edges as opposed from the entire disk.There is also a high tendency for the disk to float up a little and eventually flip over, so the diffusion portion faces down and you end up generating large bubbles instead of thousands of tiny ones. To alleviate this, I weigh it down by placing rocks or ornaments on top.I still use mine, but would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I bough this to put in my 55 gallon tank, and as soon as I put it in, it floated right back to the top. I did everything to try to keep it down. I put lots of gravel over it, rocks, anything I could find to try to get this thing to stay at the bottom of the tank. Nothing worked! Would not recommend this at all unless you don't mind it floating around in your tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes bubbles, but not as many as wand styles","review":"I bough this and a 4in standard air stone. The 4in stone produces twice as many bubbles on the same exact air pump (wisper 100g). The bubbles were not any smaller than the 4in stone. Save yourself the cash and get a normal airstone, this disk is a paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bubbles, but","review":"I put it in my fish tank and it has great bubbles (so far). My problem is, that it will not stay on the floor of the tank. I have tried weighing it down using extra connection tubing and gravel, but it still wants to float. I also tried reducing the air flow to almost nothing, but that did not work either. I ended up wedging it behind a large intake tube to keep it from floating to the top of the tank. I like the bubbles but, I don't like the fact that it will not stay on the bottom gravel bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Bubbles but Floats Like Crazy","review":"Unlike the photo on the package that shows the disk laying nicely on the tank bottom, mine kept floating up. Even if I buried the line in stones it went up. Finally I put a big rock on top of it, the rock had a hole thru it and the bubbles now come up thru the rock. Actually a very cool look.Not well designed as it keeps floating up but it does bubble nicely.One week later, I ended up replacing this with a regular bubble tube that attaches to the wall of my tank because no matter WHAT I did to hold this down (put it under a rock,bury it in gravel, etc) it eventually would break free and float up. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study guide in desperate need of proofreading.","review":"I am beginning to believe that any book with \\"MCSE\\" in the title was written with a \\"damn the proofreading, full speed ahead, get those training bucks before someone else does\\" attitude, and this one is no exception. In spite of the abundance of errors, the book is well organized and is an excellent study guide for someone preparing for the Microsoft TCP/IP exam. However, you'd best have reliable reference sources (e.g., Comer's vol. 1, Albitz & Liu's DNS & BIND, Technet, the lab setup itself) to resolve the many suspect things in the book; using those references and otherwise following this book's course of study, with the labs, will prepare you well for the exam. Once you've passed the exam, however, this book is of little value as a future reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typo galore, missing critical information.","review":"This publication needs a lot of work. I would not recommend this book to be the primary study guide to anyone preparing for the 70-059 Microsoft exam.

Don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Books are available then this ONE!","review":"After finding the several typos in the first 4 chapters I quickly lost confidence for the remainder of the book and placed it in the circular file holder. I then purchased a study guide from Sybex and felt better about what I was trying to learn, after all the reason we purchase these study guides is not only pass our Exams but to have a good grasp on how to perform these tasks. I really felt that this book was a waste of time & money to those of us who are trying to learn a subject that affects our future performance and getting information that causes confusion is not the way to go when I'm hanging on to every word as being gospel.yes I was able to figure out the typo's and errors but by the time I had read chapter five I had lost confidence and went to another source for my studies. I do not recomend this book to anyone as there are better ones available to you.

This film had some potential, but cardboard characters and a flimsy script kept it from being anything but a routine slasher. The idea is pretty good, kind of like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' meets 'Last Action Hero', but it just doesn't deliver many chills. The last quarter of the film is better than the first three quarters, but it doesn't save this from being a \\"by the numbers\\" horror flick. The acting is decent for this type of film and the killer is pretty cool looking, but the killings are pretty mild for a slasher. It's worth a look for fans of slasher films, but it's pretty forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash.","review":"This movie reminded me of something that I watched when I was a kid in the 80s on late night HBO. I would not recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 18 who is a horror movie enthusiast. I was expecting much more from this movie after reading the reviews on the standard DVD, but was completely let down. The one good thing I can say about the blu-ray version of this film is the sound and picture quality are extremely crisp, but unfortunately the concept, acting, and storyline were not. I realize it is a low budget film, but does that mean the dialogue and concepts have to be \\"low budget\\" as well? EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and DEFINITELY NOT SCARY!!!!!!!

One of which was Midnight Movie, which didn't really seem very new or novel. While I'm not a very big fan of horror films, to me the film didn't seem very fresh. The killer was this demon with supernatural powers, sure he was scary but I didn't much care for the gore. At times the film felt claustrophobic and trapping, which I really didn't like. The music was really eerie and the louder it got behind the gruesome deaths the more it turned me off. It might be worthwhile to watch \\"The Killer Cut\\" to see if it was improved or what add ons the DVD has to offer, but for now that's my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Everything about this movie is horrible.

Horror fans tired of the studios churning out soulless, forgettable reboots need to check out this inventive and fun film where the killer crosses between a primary reality and a cult movie within the movie. Solid scripting, acting, and direction pay off where the budget couldn't. You'll cheer and hang your jaw over the kills. Not everyone you'd expect to make it does. I rarely get scared at the movies these days, but fellow audience members weren't so numb. And it manages to be creepy without overindulging in the blood and guts. There's also sequel possibility, without being an obnoxious setup. So glad I gave this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"This movie scared the beejezus out of my friend and I.

Granted, it is a lower-budget/independent film, but the acting is palatable and will keep you entertained. And it will not disappoint fans who favor gore. The killer is pretty standard, and the mother character smacks of Psycho, but there is enough tension from these two to keep you on your toes. Additionally, the theme of victims and villains popping in and out of the film within a film is highly original. And well-executed here. Another horror film that tries this isPopcorn, but I don't remember that being too engaging of a flick. Try this one if you are tired of standard slasher fare and want something with a few twists and turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"The only thing good about the film was that it was presented in Blu ray.

Good for a few laughs, lots of scares, and some old-fashioned mystery this movie will keep you watching till the end. While there are some gory scenes, they are done with taste.

I must say I was surprised. It was a really fun and interesting slasher film. It had all the suspense and gore of a retro horror flick and stylistically reminded me of some 1980s movies. I loved the way they play with space in the movie. The characters are watching a movie in the movie and the killer is switching back and forth between the movie and the real-world theater. I thought it was really cool and original. I'd recommend this one to anyone who's tired of these re-hashed horror films out now... this one's a good change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"The actors were horrible.

I ordered a size 6, which was the size of similar Speedo massage sandals I'd bought at Costco a few years ago (and wore to death), but found my foot was swimming in those ordered from Amazon. At first glance, I thought the wrong size (or a men's size 6) had been delivered. Besides being long, they also seem to be for Very Wide feet.In any event, they don't fit, even moving the velcro tab and, much to my chagrin, I'm returning them.

One such album was Angel Eyes. Gene Ammons lyrical and melodic saxaphone solos struck a chord with me and the title cut Angel Eyes conjures up haunting back ally scenes of beat despair and longing. In fact I heard this song in the early 70's in a New Orleans bar late at night and it soothed a worn out soul. The rest of the CD comes across as standard run of the mill jazz, tame when compared to the heights set by Miles, Roland Kirk, Coltrane and others of the time. But if you want that late night starry starry night feeling-\\"Angel Eyes\\" is worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"chocolate not purple","review":"I received two chocolate colored bowls not purple..but since purple has been discontinued and the chocolate is very similar color and I love the bowls..I kept my mouth shut!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Orchid","review":"What a cheat! Don't waste your time. Any good writer can put together a suspense novel; a novel worth reading requires that the author resolve the crime. The FBI and CIA have no luck; the bad guy has more luck than 12 4-leaf clovers. So, I read through all of it really trying to guess how this will be resolved. But, Stuart Woods can't resolve his own story, so on the last page, the bad guy and his accomplise go to ST.Bart's to start a new life. With this ending, the story is no longer even remotely clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Silly to Take Seriously","review":"I completely agree with the prior reviewer -- this book was way too silly to be taken seriously. I've read some of Stuart Woods' earlier work, which was VERY well written and believable. This book was decently written (I finished it) but had so many ridiculous plot developments that I can't recommend it.My advice is to skip this book unless you're looking for pure escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment abounds","review":"Having read all of Stuart Woods' books, usually as they first come out, this one is very disappointing. The book goes nowhere slowly. Although Holly Barker has always been a likable character, it is unbelievable that she would go through a few weeks CIA training to become an assistant to Lance Cabot. The entire book is spent with the CIA chasing Teddy Fay, although they are mainly chasing their own tails. There are no exciting subplots or getting to know the characters any better. You keep waiting for the book to take a new turn or get better, but it never does.Apparently Mr. Woods has become content with mechanical writing and relies on his name and reputation to sell books. Put some effort into it, and give us back the writing we are used to. Any more dissapointments like this one, and I'll have to stop buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Is this self-engrossed pompous writer being paid by the word. This was overly long, seeming the author was more impressed by his faux knowledge of the governments possible covert activities then by an interesting, enticing, exciting story line. I don't really care what Mr. Wood's political bent is, but I don't care to be \\"hit over the head\\" with his biases. I was seeking a fictional, entertaining thriller, a read by the fire in these chilly fall days. Not a long and drawn out, longwinded psuedo-factual diatribe about our nasty government operations. The only fun part was Mr. Fay's exploits and the detail in which they were carried out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Teddy Fay get away","review":"The only interesting thing about this book is whether Teddy Fay, the bad guy, will fool the stumble-bums from the CIA and the FBI who are chasing him. The best one can do about the \\"main\\" characters, Holly Barker and friends, relatives, and associates is skim read whenever they appear. Not even the dog is interesting. I expect that Woods has begun to outsource the writing of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A current events thriller.","review":"Stuart Woods, like many authors everywhere, has made great use of current events to fashion a story that could be true.A rogue former CIA agent Teddy Fay has become a one man execution squad. Having retired from the CIA, Fay has taken it upon himself to begin capping American politicians of a right wing bend. Then, with a misplaced sense of patriotism he begins knocking off foriegn diplomats that may have a terrorist connection. Making matters worse, there is a strong suspicion outside the CIA that it is the agency itself doing the killing.All of this is going on as Holly Barker is wrapping up her training as a CIA agent. Without giving too much away, Holly wins the day and makes the world safe for more WalMarts and Target stores.Woods in his usual way has crafted a great story. Lively plot twists, believable dialog, and terrific characters should make this another winner for Mr. Woods.Interesting story, but not his best stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Stuart Woods writes the best book IMHO and the Holly barker series is His best next to Stone Barrington.

Fortunate for me, I checked this book on CD out at the library, so it didn't cost me anything. The characters were so lame. No one gets what they deserve in this book. I hated that stupid dog Holly had to take everywhere with her. She seemed like a dumb blond and she, with the exception of Teddy Fay, was the smartest character in the book. This book deserves a NEGATIVE three star rating. The only book this bad in my memory is Patricia Cornwell's Isle of Dogs. That book was far worse. All the characters were unrealistic. If our real FBI and CIA are this inept, this country is in real trouble. If you're thinking about reading this book, don't, it's a waste of time. Go get yourself a Vince Flynn novel. He knows how to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful ending","review":"I liked the character Holly, and the dialogue was interesting, but after waiting for a reasonable ending it was a huge disappointment. Since this was my first Woods book, I will give him (maybe) another shot, but this was extremely disappointing after spending a reasonable amount of time reading a 'chase' book, you would like a far better conculsion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, flat, flat","review":"This book was passed along to me by a friend and is my introduction to the Stuart Woods collection. I thought an author with more than 20 books to his credit ought to be a good read. The plot line, a serial killer that targets terrorists in the U.S. with diplomatic immunity, had potential for philosophical debate. However, I am very disappointed. The characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is dull. The plot is shallow.If you haven't read this book yet, you haven't missed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to \\"par\\"","review":"BIG YAWN! I gave it \\"2 starts\\" because it is after all a \\"Holly Barker\\" novel and Stone Barrington did drop in for a few pages. As for the rest of the book.......it was pretty boring. It got to the point where I wanted the bad guy to get away with it.Holly goes \\"CIA\\" and is instantly at the top of her class and leading more seasoned agents on the hunt for a killer. No ramp up time for her...........I thought by the end of the book she'd be the new director. I really like her character and the author didn't do her any favors by not letting her feel her way around, make mistakes and learn from others who have been in the game longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ending and Torture Getting There","review":"I can't believe this tripe would be published. I took this out of the library on CD and found myself yelling at the radio, \\"are you kidding me?\\" Not sure how many times Holly looks right at Teddy Fay and says \\"Gee I think that's Teddy Fay, but he had on a blue jacket in the last description of him\\" then \\"hmmmm, I think I'll turn around, talk to someone, lose sight of Teddy, decide it's really him and chase him after I've lost sight of him\\". The things that happen in this book don't ask you to suspend disbelief they ask you to get a lobotomy before you begin. I've listened to plenty of Stone Barrington books and been entertained. That's why I got this book. Never again, unless I'm getting old Stuart Woods books. This was abysmal!!

Firstly, the book's copyediting is pretty poor, especially near the end of the book. Punctuation is missing/added and capitals are in the wrong places. Secondly, the book has so much information that the author is forced to move too quickly from one topic to the next. This means that the terms he's using--even the most basic principles--don't properly sink in before he's tossing them around as though his reader knows them perfectly.Despite this, it is wonderful. It's a great overview for someone who's familiar with the basics of the faith, and a decent introduction for a devoted beginner. Furthermore, it does a wonderful job at examining all facets without a noticeable bias.

I then went from one ska band to the other, this was 1996, and then it blew up that summer, with Reel Big Fish and the Bosstones getting airplay on MTV. Then every hack in hacksville loved ska, but no one ever really picked up on this band. And now, looking back over a sea of music I have listened to and the styles of music I prefer now, this particular album, along with Let's Go Bowling's Mr. Twist, are the only ska constants I keep in rotation. I also noticed later that the bald character on the cover is none other than Krillin of Dragonball Z fame with a Saiya-jin suit on.

It's when you use different ball types/weights/wetness, that you will get pitches that don't stay as tight as you'd like them to. This should not be a surprise, but some coaches are caught off guard...Be sure to always check tire pressure on these - that's a key maintenance point. Every so often sanding the tire (while it's running, just use some light grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots) also helps improve consistency.With very basic maintenance, you should literally get years of use out of this machine!

Unlike B-boy Blues and 2nd time around, LTOYW does not have the suspenseful conflict that Raheim and Little Bit had back in the day. He just parallels a lot of details from the other books, which makes me think why is this called a sequel when it's just a repetition. I didn't appreciate much the content of Little Bit's republican encounter and how Mr. Hardy incorporated that as if it was the center of the story. Monty's Bisexuality is ambiguous... and Little Bit's encounter with him wasn't really hot. Raheim still plays the old boy... and it never continued on as to Raheim coming out.

When I heard this OVA was to be a prequel, I had hoped it would be an anime version of the (so far) Japanese-only manga. Instead we got what amounted to a one-shot episode that reveals practically nothing about our duo, doing nothing to further the overall story and nothing to develop our characters (except, perhaps, for Jo's sense of humour - i.e. the cat scene at the start, which for me was the only element worth-while).In the end, \\"Infinity\\" felt like one big deleted scene amongst a bunch of other half-hearted DVD extras.

I thought the Cuisinart name meant I'd be getting a quality pan, but not in this case.I'd hope to give this new pan as a gift, but instead will probably return it & keep looking for a duplicate of the one in my kitchen. Sorry I don't know the brand, but it has a \\"W\\" on the handle. This style of pan is wonderful for so many things (my fave is quesadillas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.......","review":"I am glad I didn't pay full price on this, it's not what I expected.

Anyway it worked and I ordered a 5 litre bottle, which does not seem to work at all and customer service does not reply to my mails - very disappointing.But worst part is almost the smell that Urine-Off leaves behind its almost worse than the urine smell itselft.

I immediately called Entirely Pets and they insisted I had the product I ordered. I told the guy that I had it pulled up on my screen adn he said Amazon had it wrong! He said they didn't sell that product. So I pulled it up on their own website and there it was , plain as day.

Lincoln's life, Presidency and death just happens to be mine. This biography is very well organized and deep in detail. Lincoln is painted in a whole different light then what most are used to. For the first time historians and authors of Lincoln Biographies talk about his depression, his marriage to Mary Todd, and how he got started in politics. It's an amazing documentary which I would highly recommend especially for the classroom. If you want to get your students attention about the Civil War, Lincoln and history show them this documentary. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done, hard to follow garbage","review":"Done in an MTV-like style, and accentuating the negative, this program will do little to give insight into Lincoln's greatness. In fact, you will come away thinking he was a loser. Mary Lincoln is similarly lambasted.The documentary jumps back and forth with no apparent continuity or reason. In addition, many of the commentators are either openly hostile towards Lincoln, or are high-handed and eliteist.Unwanted political/religious opinion from Gore Vidal also leaves one with a nasty taste in one's mouth. This should have been left on the cutting-room floor, having no place in this discussion.Zero stars would be more fitting.Get a copy of \\"A House Divided - Abraham and Mary Lincoln\\" from PBS - you will be better informed and genuinely touched.Avoid this pap at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please - buy \\"Team of Rivals\\" instead ...","review":"I lost almost all credibility of The History Channel after airing this hatchet job. For starters, the various editing techniques make you feel like you're watching \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".

Please take the time to read Doris Kearns-Goodwin's book, \\"Team of Rivals\\". It may take longer to read but it least it is accurate. This DVD is 100 percent garbage. If I could give it no stars I certainly would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fresh perspective...","review":"This is by far one of the most insightful looks into one of America's greatest Presidents. The film in no way was meant to be a negative portrayal of Lincoln's life. It is simply a humanizing and deeply moving glimpse of a remarkable American told in a spiraling narrative. Lincoln did have a colored past, was plagued by depression, and was deeply ambitious. All of these things were balanced with a deeply seeded sense of morality and conscience. The fact that Lincoln rose from humble origins and was able to to rise to prominence despite adversity is the true testimony of his greatness. Never since, and perhaps never again, will a man born poor, plagued by depression, and motivated by the necessity of doing what he felt was right lead this nation.This video is worth watching. Also, it is punctuated by the commentary of Gore Vidal, in my opinion one of the greatest experts on American history and politics alive today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read my friends copy of the book and I want to buy it","review":"I am Italian-American. I was born in USA but grew up in Italy and I am very familiar with all the facts that the author writes about. I am pretty confident that he has been telling us many true stories. Although Andreotti was found not guilty during last winter trial I have my own stories about want happen during his half-a-century role in the Italian Post War history that confirms the author's views. I am married to a Sicilian and I have many interesting episodes my in-laws told me about the Lima brothers and Andreotti. The author is good in making the reader understand how Sicily could have been a Paradise to live but instead it is a only a place to visit. This all because of the Mafia and corruption that marked the history of this island. Few men, Falcone, Borsellino, Della Chiesa tried really to change things but they were killed and today every time I visit Sicily I can tell you things have not changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but thick going","review":"While presenting information that is, in itself interesting, this book was difficult for me to get through. The use of italics in place of quotation marks seemed pretentious, and the book itself leapt from topic to topic, so that I was frequently confused as to who was doing what to whom. Better books on the topic might be _Excellent Cadavers_, an exhaustive book on the Mafia, and _On Persephone's Island_, about an American woman's experiences after marrying a Sicilian. I really wanted to enjoy Midnight in Sicily, but wasn't able to warm up to it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"What I thought was a book on the history, food, and culture was infact a book on the intricate details on the mafia... This book is a diservice to the already narrow-minded people who think only of mafia when they think of Sicily. I want to learn what makes Sicily what it is. I was even more disappointed that the mafia wasn't left out of the art scene. The author has done his research on the history on the mafia, but if I wanted a book on the mafia I would have gotten one. Perhaps he should rename his book, 'The Sicilian Mafia And Everything It Permiates'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Schizophrenic Look at Sicily Misses the Mark","review":"The author of this virtually unreadable book cannot decide if he is writing a travel book, a cookbook, a history book, or a commentary on the complex relationship between the mafia, the government, and the Sicilian people. This unorganized and schizophrenic review of the aforementioned subjects jumps from topic to topic and era to era without warning and with such speed that it makes one dizzy. A detailed description of a meeting that took place between a mafia boss and a government official is suddenly interrupted by a maddeningly detailed account of a meal that the author had eaten in a particular restaurant, complete with an equally mind-numbing description of the restaurant itself and the surrounding landscape. Moreover, the author frequently interjects his own socialogical/philosophical comments regarding the mafia, the govenernment, and the Italian people that are unfounded and frequently miss the mark. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to read before a trip to southern Italy","review":"I read this book with pleasure and excitement.

Free of dialogue for almost the entire movie, it is just awful. Long extended sequences of nothingness. Its an \\"art film\\". Only there is very little art, and you might as well look at snapshopts instead of a moving motion picture.Don't waste your money.

A how-to manual that encourages illegal/unethical behavior available at any major bookstore. It's like being able to buy street drugs at the corner pharmacy! The author encourages women to lie, cheat and manipulate -- without regard to innocent persons -- i.e., children of a failed marriage. I especially liked (NOT) the case studies where women manufactured evidence to have their soon-to-be-ex's put in jail. I didn't realize that was legal. IMO, the author's attitudes and methods are counterproductive to the advances made by women's rights groups over the years, since they encourage women to remain dependent on someone else.

They are of such a length and of such a level of detail that they will serve the purposes of the general reader with a curiousity about what grandaddy did in WW II or great great great grandaddy in the Civil War and what he looked like and how he lived. This is not to say that the specialist such as myself cannot find useful nuggets herein. I can.

It's too loosely (and often confusingly) organized, and too many key films are missing. The employees of Scarecrow Video in Seattle have basically reviewed only what they wanted to review, and they've written in a very conversational style.

Whether your dad ever said he loved you or not, whether he was even around as you grew up, you can see God at work in each one of these stories. And you can see a little bit of yourself, and of your physical father, in each tale.Enjoy the stories. Share them with someone you love. Buy a copy for your father, and your father-in-law, and for every man in your life who has demonstrated a father's love. And thank God for these father figures in our lives, who make us who we are, and who show us the love of our Father in Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Embrace of a Father","review":"Wayne Holmes has done it again! In the spirit of *The Heart of a Mother* and *The Heart of a Teacher*, Holmes has chosen moving stories of father-child relationships that will linger with you long after the reading.These warm, inspiring stories may prompt your own special memories or let you glimpse a father you did not know. Through this book, you can reach a deeper understanding of the love of both earthly fathers and your heavenly Father. Whether from well-known Christian authors such as Bruce Wilkinson and Tracie Peterson or from everyday people, each story resonates with truth in the very special world of fathers and children. Especially for men who want to ignite their passions for fatherhood, this is an excellent read, but it's a treat for anyone. Most will want to read these stories again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Embrace of a Father","review":"This book achieves the dual purpose of showing the ideal traits of a human father while also, through them, exhibiting the many facets of God's love for each of us.

Each story is unique, and each is short and readable, tempting the reader continually to move on to just one more chapter.This book makes a great gift for Father's Day, or for a new father, or for many other occasions.

Ideally, if your background is materials science, engineering or physics, you can pick up some ideas from the text. The physics details are not too abstruse to turn away an engineering reader.Many of the designs described involve quantum mechanical effects. Quantum wires and dots, for example, that might have novel uses. Attention is also paid to how the new systems might be made. Not just as research efforts, but as practical outputs of a fab.There is speculation about future systems, as indeed you would expect. But commendably restrained.

There's the symphony number 2, the immensly melodic Karelia Suite, and the well known Finlandia. The CD begins with the Sebilius' symphony number two. The performance is intense, but yet well reserved. After the climatic Amen of the second symphony begins the Karelia Suite. This performance of the suite is top notch, not too fast, not too slow. In my opinion it is the best of the works on this compact disc. And last on the CD is the ever so popular Finlandia, known to some as \\"Be Still My Soul\\". This performance definitely lacks speed making it the slowest version I've ever heard. Instead of having a running time of seven minutes, it is bumped up to eight. Despite its slowness, this performance has plenty of dramatic power. If you are searching for a budget priced CD that will be hard to put away, then search no more.

You get a wealth of details that might take an R&D; group years to learn on their own. Keep in mind that the emphasis here is on the mechanics. So don't expect a discussion of IBM's usage of the Giant Magnetoresistive effect, for example.The book should make you appreciate the incredible mechanical constraints under which disks operate.

Dibdin pits Sherlock Holmes against Jack the Ripper in a \\"shocking\\" tale that takes the most obvious plot option to accomplish the task.

But, mercifully, a short book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliantly Written, But...........","review":"I cannot deny that this novel is effectively written, and was difficult to put down. Nevertheless, with hindsight I have to take note of how Dibdin resorts to some fudging of the Holmes canon to fit his square peg into the round hole of his seemingly ingenious payoff. The one fudging he can't be allowed to get away with is the total absence of the character of Mycroft Holmes from this story. I would have had a lot more respect for his unorthodox conclusion that admittedly is an outrage for true Holmes fans had he found a way of working Mycroft into the story. It soon becomes patently obvious after reading this story again that Dibdin has to pretend Mycroft doesn't exist in order to make his story and his theory fly. And that's something he really should be called to the carpet for when analyzing his story construction, and not just the simple visceral anger one might feel over the outcome itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, bad ending","review":"I've read several of Michael Dibdin's books and was looking forward to reading this one.

Ms. Leon continues her series of Uppity Women books with the same style and humor, but it falls flat in the face of glaring errors. It is obvious from the text that Ms. Leon has very strong views on religion and men. Unfortunately for the reader Ms. Leon wasn't able to set her own opinions aside to tell an unbiased story.The book is littered with misrepresentations, disparaging remarks, and an insulting brand of sexist humor that makes Woman's Lib and intelligent women everywhere look bad.On the other hand, if you can ignore the playground tactics, this isn't a terrible book. The history that is right is worth the reading (although not at the current Amazon listed price of $28).

I generally like my heros a little dark and tortured, so I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, the heroine totally ruined the story. She was so saccharine sweet - she was utterly naive and always nice. I am sure deers approached her and butterflies flitted around her head. I would also classify her in the 'too stupid to live' category. She was not a good match for the hero. Don't waste your time with this one - read To Have and To Hold for a dark hero/forced relationship romance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Language!!","review":"This was the fifth book I read by this author. Since she was relatively new to me, and I LOVED the first four, I was dying to get my hands on as many of her books as possible. How I wish I hadn't. I thought the plot was okay, the heroine really got on my nerves, and I just wanted to smack the hero. But the main reason for giving only two stars was the language. I am not easliy offended by harsh and sometimes vulgar words, but this was insane!! I am only 24 and definitely not a prude, but there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I had to literally force myself to finish this book. I know, I know---why finish it if it was so bad. Well, I didnt want to waste my money. By the time I got to the end, I felt a little dumb for having subjected myself to the filth. I will be extremely careful about choosing her books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has limited vocabulary","review":"This kind of literature is not one I usually read. But having heard Anderson to be a good writer I tried this book. Evidently the good reviewers have no problem with the prolific use of extreme profanity. Personally, it added nothing to the story, and served as proof of the author's limited vocabulary. The many times the First of the Ten commandments was violated, was unnecessary, and IMO served as an outlet for this author's hatred of God.If this writing, along with the titillating descriptions of \\"sexual adventure\\" is typical of Anderson and this genre, I don't expect to read anything more of her writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be on the shelf of all students of biology","review":"I am a biology professor, and I required this text of all of my majors students until it went out of print.

One of the chief reasons why this is such a good book is that Royal takes Dante's spiritual leanings seriously, unlike some commentators who see Dante as doing mostly political commentary. I recently used Royal's book as I embarked on teaching The Inferno to a high school student I was tutoring. It was an invaluable resource and made things clearer than the notes found in either edition of The Inferno we were using. I am now looking forward to finishing The Divine Comedy myself for the first time, inspired by Robert Royal.

I had planned to purchase a 12\\" skillet, but saw this pan and selected it as I prefer the two side handles to the long skillet handle -- these pans are heavy and when the pan is full of rice pilaf or pork chops, the two handles are MUCH safer and more comfortable. A bonus was that this pan included a cover, which I know I would have missed had I opted for the skillet.Like the rest of the line, this pan is dishwasher safe, has a tight-fitting lid, and the rolled lip of the pan facilitates spill-proof pouring.

With skill and subtlety, Bentz explores timeless issues of family ties, loneliness, and acceptance, and how they relate to a series of generations.

I learned that Texas has no state supreme court - important since TX executes more prisoners than any other state (VA is next in line). The case about the smoker being fired because she was an \\"at will\\" employee was so true.

The show churns out one gripping case after another, not forgetting, in its trademark fashion, to also introduce us to some of the strangest, most oddball characters in the world.The story arcs, relationships and cases are well written and complement the craziness of the show and of the dynamic duo heading it. While every episode is great, some of the best ones come midway through the season when Michael J. Fox sweeps the show away with his cancer-ridden yet profoundly charming special appearance.Overall, the some of the best work to come from the cast and writers of the show and the only season that's worth the watch for any Boston Legal or Practice fan.

All he did was whine and complain about how stupid his generation is, but it wasn't convincing or insightful. It is hailed as the next Catcher in the Rye, but I think that's out of desperation.

It's hard to write a review that doesn't make this sound less than it is, it's that good. Smither's writing has never been better, and his covers-- Cold Trail Blues and Visions of Johanna-- bring a whole new beauty to each piece. My favorite is the title track; it's catchy, tightly written, warm, full of understanding and that touch of humor that distinguishes Smither's work. I'm with him on Origin of Species (like I am on Train Home.) They draw such a gentle line between where we can be sure of ourselves and where we probably shouldn't. And after listening to Smither sing the blues, I always feel like trying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smither's Still Got It!","review":"I used to catch Smither in small clubs in the early seventies but haven't kept up with him since. I purchased this CD on a whim and was not disappointed with the sprightly writing and was impressed by the strong muscianship. In particular, the title track as well as the Shillin' for the Blues cut are really good. Additionally, Origin of Species and Diplomacy contain some memorable lines. Then, he gives us a Dylan cover--Visions Of Johanna--in three-quarter time no less!

His various experiences are vividly written as he authenticates artwork ready for the block. His frustrated attraction for Maggie, his colleague add to the spice.I highly recommend it for fans of Mortimer's work. Fans will find that Ben comes over as more dimensionally developed, and less of a caricature than Rumpole. The plots are equally if not more elaborate and carefully drawn than a typical Rumpole plot. (Don't misunderstand me, I'm equally fond of the Rumpole series.) The auction house premise provides more room for the protagonists to move around, and therefore make for a better story. I'm sorry Mortimer hasn't seen to add to this collection.

It would be certified GOLD by the RIAA. The documentary covered Elvis' concerts in Las Vegas. It includes both live recordings from the show and \\"studio rehearsal\\" recordings. It includes the US hit single \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" and the UK hit single \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\".

The song-writing is superb, the Beatle references abundant, and there's even a foreboding, Dylanesque track that takes you deep into a mummy's tomb for a lesson you may not be ready for...And if that's not enough, there's more.While I will concede that 'She's the One' is among the most beautiful love songs ever written,'Hercules' is the show stopper on this album. Like many things that catch us off guard, this song arrives in medias res, projecting the wearied voice of one who has lived through hardship, the voice of one who has come back to tell the tale. It is a brutally stark song, one that lifts you up and out of your stupor, sharing a powerful yet simple message of self-preservation that may seem obvious but bears repeating nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid piece of work","review":"this album has been out for 9 years and this is the first review? shameful!call me up and shes the one are classics. the rest of the album is very good. i havent ever been to a world party show, but now that the band is touring again, im looking forward to my first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal at this price.","review":"One wonders what might have been had this record not fallen foul of it's label's misfortunes and missed an audience by a mile.

Having seen countless Hitchcock films, I have to say that \\"Torn Curtain\\" is perhaps the most suspenseful film if his I've ever seen (save maybe \\"Rear Window\\"). The last 45 minutes of this film had me in and out of my chair, talking to the screen and totally engrossed. There is an almost inhumane amount of suspense then relief, then more suspense then more relief. It was eerie, in fact, how much of a puppet I became in watching this film some 35 years after it was made; Hitchcock is sitting above somewhere, probably very pleased. All in all, this is an engaging film that will take you on a rollercoaster ride as it did me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn Curtain","review":"Sure, the chemistry with Paul and Julie isn't the best (nor is her wardrobe)but I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.

This movie improves upon each viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delayed Action","review":"Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain is one of those pictures that you dont have to pause if you need to get up and get popcorn. In other words, if you can wait for real action and still pay attention to the so called \\"boring stuff\\", then this is the film for you. Then again, if you are like me,and just can't wait ten minutes to see an action-filled scene packed with drama, gore, suspense, ect... then I would not recommend this film to you.

We'll be bored too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed cold war thriller from the Master","review":"\\"Torn Curtain\\" is one of the worst films Hitchcock ever made - a cold war thriller with no thrill.Paul Newman (playing a U.S. rocket scientist Michael Armstrong) hated the script and he and Hitchcock were at loggerheads on the set. Julie Andrews is hopelessly miscast in a \\"serious\\" role as Armstrong's lover/assistant.The nadir of the film is the killing of the evil Gromek, an excrutiatingly long scene in very poor taste.\\"Torn Curtain\\" should be seen once by all Hitchcock completists but this film shows all the signs of a director who had lost touch with his audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"JCParis","review":"As for Marnie and Topaz, this remastering of Torn curtain in 1.85 (a bit too larger for a 35 mm base film in \\"flat widescreen\\" format - 1.66 is most appropriate) is not to recommend for the ugly colors: flashy red, some colors faded, finally bad color balance. Why to try \\"cooking\\" the original colors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, dull dull","review":"Hitchcock made some brilliant films in his later years (The Birds, Vertigo, and Pyscho) this certainly not being one of them.

So everyone stay away!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensefull","review":"I thought this was a great movie.I enjoyed the chemistry between Paul Newman and Julie Andrews.I think it added to the frustration that she felt,not knowing what her Fiance'was up to.I felt the murder scene of Gromeck was very shocking or at the very least grisly and graphic.I enjoyed the bus scene and the scenes where the older woman was trying to help the two lovers escape from their captors .This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn Curtain underrated Number 50 from Hitchcock","review":"This was Alfred Hithcock's 50th motion picture. This film marked a departure from his most recent bulk of films at that time, not in directorial style, but in the absence of many of his close-knit artistic-technical company he had been utilizing. Distinctively missing is collaborator-composer Bernard Herrmann. However, John Addison does a commendable job in Herrmann's absence, as his score seems to fit this film very well with the passage of time.This was a cold war drama set behind the Iron Curtain. The hero of the story as portrayed by Paul Newman is motivated less by personal staunchness for democratic idealism, but rather by his inner confrontation coming to grips with his own failure as a scientist.This very suspenseful film is really about his own redemption for his perceived failure. This film is has been highly underrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the masters worst!","review":"Oh man was this movie a dud. Its hard to believe this is an Alfred Hitchcock film. The film gets an extra star simply for the gorgeous photography and excellent farm house sequence, other than that there is very little to offer with this snooze fest. Newman and Andrews are pretty much wasted as a couple in Berlin posing as spies. They do the best they can with a suspenseless (a word I thought I would never use when reviewing a Hitchcock film) story. The whole movie was just so damn lethargic. You do not really care about any of the characters in this movie or what happens to them. Hitchcock would follow this with the far superior Topaz, however, even that film falls short in many areas. The late sixties found Hitch in a slump. He would be right back at his macabre mastery in '71 with the thriller Frenzy. This just happens to be one in the directors catalog that you can skip unless you are intent (like I was) on seeing everything Hitchcock has put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of Hitchcock list","review":"I've watched two thirds of Hitchcock's movies.

Being region 2 I guess it couldn't help be accessible.I can't get over the number of times it looked like the goose or geese of the stars were cooked, but at the climax always a way of escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchcock in Decline","review":"The Master of Suspense stumbles badly in this ill-conceived Cold War melodrama.

Not quite as spectacular as some of the other Hitchcock movies, e.g. North by Northwest (my personal favorite) or Psycho, but very good. The characters are very well fleshed out and presented. The movie manages to convey very well the claustrophobic atmosphere of the cold war in a country behind the former Iron Curtain. This movie is a must for any Hitchcock admirer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unappreciated Endeavor from the Master of Suspense!","review":"I really enjoyed Mr. Hitchcock's 50th exercise in cinema and IMHO ranks as one of the Master's better films; even though his magical touch seemed to wane just a bit towards the end of his film making career. I throughly enjoyed Paul Newman's performance and found Julie Andrews' presentation a nice departure as this film was released somewhat close the the Sound of Music. The scene in the farmhouse was a bit violent but no worse than some of the scenes from The Birds. It also gives us the perceived starkness of what the other side of \\"the wall\\" was like during the tense times of the Cold War.

If you like Zoinks! this is a great disc to add to your collection. It's worth getting for Ugly Side alone, and Chest Pain is a great track as well. Also, these are not the same recordings of Bridge Over Brautigan and Pedestal that are featured onStranger Anxiety--not vastly different from those versions, but there's some unique harmonizing here. Snowshine sounds like a wintery version of Thermalosis (fromBad Move Space Cadet), which is okay, but a slightly weak ending to an otherwise great EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title, no action","review":"When I saw a book covering the exploits of Navy SEALs in Iraqi I thought it was far too soon for anything interesting to be declassified. I was very right. Mr Couch's book probably does the best job possible without offending Navy censors, but that still makes for a boring book. Less than 10 operations are covered, and even then many of the details were left out. The rest of the book is filler with information about training and command structures. Maybe in 10+ years Mr Couch will be able to write a more interesting book about Mid East SEAL operations when the information is released to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"the filler thriller","review":"Well, I picked up this book because I thought, \\"Sweet. SEALs, middle east, covert ops, what's not to love??\\" Well the book was more like a documentary or briefing most of the time. It focuses far too much on the development of a SEAL and their organization. If I wanted to read about that, I would've picked up a book about the making of a Navy SEAL. I was disappointed. The story really only had a few exciting parts and those tended to come towards the end of the book. Let's put it this way, he spends around ten pages telling what should've been an exciting mission aboard a ship, only to tell us that the men on board were not dumb enough to carry weapons. Hmph. If you are looking for enemy contact, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled yawner..............","review":"While I have respect for Couch and his first excellent book on BUDS,the latest book \\"Down Range : Navy SEALs in the War on Terrorism\\" is full of filler and continues to recycle material from his last 2 books. \\"Down Range : Navy SEALs...\\" and has little in the way of action or anything new and interesting - save your money.I still recommend Couch's excellent first book, \\"The Warrior Elite : The Forging of Seal Class 228\\" as well as a new book by Reid \\"Suffer in Silence\\" a novel about BUDs (has it's flaws, but is gripping unlike the latest Couch book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but not great...","review":"Down Range reads like a Pentagon de-brief, with little action. Couch, a former SEAL with extensive street cred (mainly Viet Nam) is a terrific writer and even gives over-due credit to the Air Force Combat Controllers, who are often overshadowed by SEALs and Green Berets. This book is detailed, but with the wrong details. I'd much rather read about the men on the tip of the spear, the real war fighters with guns in the fight, than the brass back at HQ calling the shots. Problem is, many of the brass are Couch's personal friends or former students.The Warrior Elite is a great book, this is just good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a great supporter of our military people but find this work by Mr. Couch to be little more then a puff piece hardly worth the time to read. The Seals are a well trained force who don't need or deserve the gratuitous treatment that Mr. Couch provides in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I, too, bought this book hoping to read of the gritty exploits of these men in the war on terror. I was greatly disappointed.Couch spends the first 1/3 of the book going through the standard BUD/S and training phases diddle, he then goes on to relate the most superficial telling of battle anecdotes that never really say anything more than how great the teams are. He even spends time relating the 3 MOH accounts from the Vietnam War.By the time a person is interested in reading a book on Anti-terror Tactics they don't need to hear that \\"Hell week is really cold\\".It's obvious that Couch trotted this \\"gem\\" out on a weekend when he had nothing else to do, and clearly just saw the $$$ he was going to get for the effort.Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Go rent \\"Navy Seals\\" with Sheen. It is just as informative and a lot more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down Range Review","review":"A very well-researched and documented treatise.

He loves the SEALs. This book is a good look(although limited)at modern-day SEALs. If you have never read a book about SEALs then this is an excellent place to start. This book is very informative. If you have read alot or know alot about the SEALs then skip the first 38 pages. The author really loves the SEALs. Did I mention that? On one page alone(small pages) the word SEAL is mentioned 16 times. Dick Couch is a good, not great, writer and is very detailed and I was really enjoying his book until I read his account, on page 183, of a close-quarters firefight in which he describes how good these particular SEALs could shoot because they had shot the bad guys weapon and his hands holding the weapon. This may have impressed Mr. Couch or maybe he is just trying to impress the reader, but that is not good shooting skill. This isn't an old TV western. That paragraph really made me wonder about the whole book. Fiction? Non-fiction?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"This book details much of the training and preparation that goes into SEAL training and SEAL operations.

For those of you who have never heard of Robbie Fulks, his music is a fun mix of country and rock (at times hitting both extremes) and is full of intelligent lyrics.

Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the brand nor the price","review":"The enamel is sharp-looking and the tea-kettle design looks really nice. I'm disappointed with the product because the plastic components such as the top handle, the handle-to-pot connector and the whistle housing are made of a cheap plastic and it shows as the plastic moldings are visible and really thin for a would-be long-lasting, sturdy product. The plastic handle also conducts heat so it's hot to handle. Also, Le Creuset branded the product with cheap sticker labels that come off in the dishwasher. It's not worth $50 bucks but it works well. Save your money and buy something without the sticker-branded labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, functional and easy to use....","review":"Other reviewers need to follow the care instructions. Never leave water in your tea kettle! Hard water can leave permanent damage. I love this kettle for it's style and function. Just what I expect from Le Cruset! Beautiful color, but be warned it's more orange red and red red. I still love it though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but rusted quickly","review":"I loved everything about this kettle...until it rusted and the enamel chipped.

KETTLE.","review":"My mom got this for me for Christmas, or maybe my birthday, I can't remember. I love this kettle. It's so chic. I let it sit out on my stove top and every time I look at it, I smile.The looks are great, but the quality is even greater. Le Creuset is known for its fantastic quality, and this piece continues to please.The technicalities: The water boils really quickly. The kettle is easy peasy to wash. The handle will never burn you!

My old kettle was a little ghetto and I'd get burned every time, so I'm a little sensitive to that issue!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty is fleeting.","review":"It was a beautiful kettle, but quickly became blackened and rusty. The enamel came off along the bottom and top under normal use. The handle, almost from the beginning, was loose and feels like it is going to break off.Last week the plastic \\"whistle\\" lost it's pin and broke. No abuse, just normal everyday use.Seem liked it would be very nice for the price, but it was not a solid product a from an otherwise wonderful company."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible design, hard to use, rusts easily","review":"Because of the angle of the spout and the placement of the insulated handle on this item, you have to be at least 6 feet tall in order to pour it comfortably. I'm short, and when I pour it using the insulated handle, I end up pointing my elbow at the ceiling. Very strange. I usually get a pot holder and hold it nearer to the stem.My husband bought me this tea kettle as a present, knowing that I love Le Creuset. I haven't had it very long (about a year) and it is already starting to rust. But I am glad, because I will be able to buy another tea kettle soon. It will NOT be a Le Creuset.

More often, though, like on the slightly aharmonic \\"Do's and Don'ts,\\" he straddles both the indie rock and electronic worlds. The echoing guitar chords and organ on \\"Dumb Day\\" continue to blur the lines, and \\"One Eye Around the Warm Corner\\" might fall into that dreaded \`folktronica' label, but it's nonetheless lovely. The female vocals on \\"The Matter (of Our Discussion)\\" hints slightly of Dntel, but the composition is much warmer. Interesting: Boom Bip seems to be moving away from both the \`boom' and the \`bip.' This isn't necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"this ain't your father's christmas cd","review":"this ain't a Christmas cookie cutter disc. nope, way etter then what main stream Nashville has let loose over the past number of years. Sure Ms. Tillis mixes a bit of jazz and blues and other music forms in this, but isn't that --- her ? Ms. Tillis' style comes thru strong, loud and beautiful. The way she blends her vocals with the musical stylings makes this a must have Christmas cd, which you will play every year and not stick in the drawer with the pop favorites of the day. If you are looking for a change in Christmas music, but no so much it turns you away, give this disc a chance. you won't be sorry, i'm not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and helpful...","review":"I liked this manual very much. Some of the information may be considered slightly dated as the book was written in the early 1990s, but I would still not hesitate to purchase it.

I hope the author comes out with a revised version soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The characters come alive in this wonderfully written book.","review":"Tempestuous indeed! I could not put this book down. This is a very readable historical narrative set in England during the Regency Period from 1810 to 1820. Erickson paints a very vivid picture of the chaotic times in which George IV ruled as Regent while his father King George III declined into madness at Windsor, alongside the already troublesome war with Napoleon, social unrest, and economic uncertainty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Anyone Studying the Regency Period","review":"Erickson writes in a conversational style about English High-Society from 1810-1820. The overiding theme is the illness of the king, George III, who struggled periodically with insanity (porphyria, according to modern medicine). The real meat of the book, through a variety of sources, is the description of daily life during the times. No one got up before noon, and parties usually didn't end until the sun rose. The use of laudanum (opium) was prevalent, as were marital affairs--if discreet. We are introduced to Luddites, George Gordon (Lord Byron), the purgatory of Princess Caroline, Hannah More, Wellington, Bonaparte and a cast of thousands. Kuddos for an easy romp through the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A relaxing ride","review":"Unexceptional but very pleasant entry in the British Rail Journeys series filmed in 1995.

The price is right for this railway ticket!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PIL'S LAST STAND","review":"The last gasp from the original team of John Lydon and Keith Levene. This small offering gives you a taste of the bands post Sex Pistols punk (the classic \\"public image\\" ) to the art rock classic \\"blue water\\". This e.p. of course features the original version of \\"This is not a love song\\" as well as a remix of that track. I like this disk because it shows you where they began and how it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"darling decoration!","review":"The detail of this product seems to be excellent! It seems to be unique with the bead wind chimes at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bride to be Crystal Tank","review":"The tank itself was very nice but the sizes are misleading. I ordered an extra large (10-12) and it didn't fit my sisterinlaw who came all the way up from Texas to NJ for her wedding. I wanted it to be special and ended up paying $55.00 including an overnight fee for her to get it on time. The shirt fit like a medium (6-8). I contacted the seller Sandy Keller at Advantage Bridal and she only offered me an exchange. Not only was there not a larger size but at this point it was too late. The bacholorette party had come and gone and Sandy never got back to me having tried contacting her several times as to a credit/refund. I have contacted Amazon on this seller already. Don't order from this site. I just gotta hope now that I have a really skinny anorexic friend getting married soon so I can give her the shirt and not waste my hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly well done!","review":"A genuinely good film. For the ultra-low budget, the look is commendable. These guys prove that you don't need a huge budget and stars to make a really good movie. You need a well written script and a great story! A couple of \\"gasp!\\" moments with some clever twists make this film one of the better indie films I've seen in awhile. As a fellow filmmaker, I'm tracking these guys down to find out how they pulled it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Sorry, but I found this book to be rather boring. It contained page after page after page of deep introspection on the part of the two main characters,which is something I don't like. Along with very long descriptions of scenery, etc. Could not get into the book until about the middle, and then just as I thought it would pick up speed, it would slow down again. I like lots of interaction and dialogue between main characters, and this was really lacking. The relationship was not developed very well. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel set","review":"This is a good travel kit with two caveats: the board gets creased a bit if you roll it & then it's inadvertently flattened (though it can be corrected), and the carrying tube is quite bulky. I addressed this by pulling out the board & pieces and packaging them in a plastic bag, and I was then able to put it in my son's backpack for our plane trip. Generally, though, the pieces stick really well to the board, and it was great to be able to play chess on the plane and by the pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Imagery","review":"Musical imagery is the best descrption for this album. Joe Pernice has the unique ability, somewhat similar to Lou Reed, to tell a story that could stand apart from the music and still resonate. Joe's carefully chosen lyrics paint vivid picture and give each song its own distinct feel, regardless of the music backing it. That's not to say that the music isn't good, because it's great. Don't let the sparse production on this album fool you, it only serves to magnify the overall tone of the recording. Joe Pernice is one of the finest young song writers on the scene today. It's a shame that he's no longer with Sub-Pop. Here's hoping there's still some records companies out there concerned with content instead of looks and packaging. Get this album so you can say you \\"knew him when...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Side of Joe Pernice","review":"This is the more melancholy work of JP I've ever heard , sometimes a little hard to listen for that reason , but very beautiful and solid as a whole record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Effort by Joe","review":"On Joe Pernice's new project, it sounds like he is clearing out some of the older songs or perhaps songs that won't fit all that well on the next Pernice Brothers CD. For example there is the Scud Mountain Boys-era \\"Hundred Dollar Pocket\\". (Which, by the way, is a beautiful song, sporting some of his most imagistic lyrics). This is a good thing, because he is experimenting with sounds like I haven't heard him do up to this point. \\"Leave Me Alone\\" is a good illustration of that. The boiling tension is highlighted by hits where the snare should be on what sounds like an aluminum pie plate. A very effective and unusual complement to the seemingly existential lyrics.There is a lot here to hold you over until the next release by Joe and co. If you're a fan you need this. If you're new to the Pernice Brothers, then this is not a bad place to start.Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So, So, Boring","review":"Have you ever listened to someone talking in a monotone voice? Everything modulated at a certain pitch which begins to lull you to sleep. This is what this cd does to me. This is a style of songwriting and playing that doesn't dare to do anything to push either the music or the lyrics into something interesting. It's not that Pernice's voice or playing is bad. But, he persists in a style that is utterly forgettable, relegating it to background music where you don't even care what the singer is saying because it takes too much effort to make out what the hell this guy is droning on about. Start drinking stronger coffee, Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This rocket is awesome!","review":"This rocket exceeded our expectations. It is easy to launch and goes incredibly high. We even doubled up the disks and it worked fine and went even higher. It goes so high you can't even see it in the sky. The kids love chasing after it when it comes down.

The rockets do launch very well and get great height, however there are a couple of things I wish I had known before I bought this. First, there is a small plasticky wafer that you must use to launch each rocket. One new wafer is needed for each launch, so you eventually will need refills. Second, the pump ( before it broke) is so small that it takes quite a bit of effort to launch the rocket. If you are going to buy this, look for the model without the pump and opt for a larger bike pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"surreal and selective subjects americana","review":"This book depicts an artists journey through the indiginous people of the southwest through their art and artifcats .

I don't understand why this guy is driving around the U.S. in a minivan if he calls himself an environmentalist and if he is so unhappy with the U.S., why don't he just move the Cuba. But besides the questions I have about this book, I still think it is not worth reading. He provides detailed descriptions of what he and his wife does on their trips like we should care. If you would like to know about a place's demographics, tourist attractions, culture, socioeconomic status, and so on, there is something free to everyone called the internet. Please do yourself a favor and forget about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I shooked of inspiration when I saw this one!","review":"This event surprised me with it's unbelievable glamour. Every match was so exiting. The opening math set Lex Luger and the Brittish Bulldog against Jacob and Eli Blue, then Jeff Jarret defends his IC-title against RazorRamon. I's so fun when the 123-Kid jumps in the ring in the end of the match and just kicks the hell out of Jarret. Of course the championchip match between Shawn Mikaels and Big Daddy Cool was awsome. When you se a match like that you wonder how much punishment a wrestler can get (I refear to Shawn Mikaels). The final match is NFL-star Lawrence Taylor meeting Bam Bam Bigelow. I can't describe how fantastic exiting this math was, you just have to se it to know.

She has a certain sense of reality, of truth in her words that read more like an autobiography than a fantasy novel. Her characters are amazingly well developed, the mood perfect, and the ending is not only suprising but also leaves the reader with a feeling of cleanliness and light (that kind you get after taking a shower and the sun is shining beneath the clouds as you look out the window, a rainbow shimmering like a mirrage but still tangible as you sigh and smile) ^_^;; Well, read it and see!

The baby is not interested in it at all. Plus, the orange ears that you see in the picture had to be cut off. I did not feel they were secured well and was afraid the baby would swallow them.

Each project is cleverly explained.She tells you exactly how much and what kind of fabric you need for each project and exactly what to cut and how to piece it together.Easy to follow steps. I only wish she would have written more about machine and hand quilting itself.

I think they got the theme wrong. It isn't about their career, it's about pursuing your dreams. And I think we all know it needs a lot of practise to be a skater, but this is a movie. A movie is a means to relieve stress and maybe excape to your fantasy world, which is anything but real. And do you expect to see every training session? Would you read every lesson Harry Potter ever had? No. This movie has a suitable cast and a nice plot. It is quite inspiring too.

Of course there are no apologies from Amazon. You are supposed to take up your time to contact them about it and then more of your time returning the item. This should have been a simple order to fill and they messed it up. This seems to be the new trend with Amazon. I really should stop shopping with them.

In fact, force divided by mass equals acceleration."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Show's That You Can Make Your Dreams Come True!!!!","review":"My mom rented Ice Princess on Netflix I liked this movie alot that I watched it 3 or 4 times.I've always liked figure ice skater & I love to wacth figure skating all the time.In Ice Priness at the end of the movie I'm glad Casey gave up Harvard & to after her where she belongs is to be a Figure Skater.Michelle Tractenberg & Hayden Panettiere did a great job protraying their roles in the movie.My friend to me that she & her [...]granddaughter seen Ice Princess & they liked this movie,too.Ice Princess is great movie for kids & adults to enjoy together!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisely good.","review":"Ice Princess was a movie I didn't think I would enjoy but to my chargin, I found it very charming, intelligent and not at all sappy even for a Disney movie. The ice skating scenes are beautifully shot, Kim Cattrall is one catty board but you forgive her character later in the film. And Michelle Tractenberg's acting was very convincing, thank god they didn't get that Lindsay Lohan to star in this.

However...From the look of the trailers, it seemed like it's mostly dedicated for little kids who admire princesses and stuff. It seemed pretty ridiculous that they show a simple theme on the movie, follow your dreams?Also, Casey's a bookworm. Why is she trying to become an \\"Ice Princess\\" and be a \\"Brainiac\\" at the same time? It seemed as if it's making other characters seem lower than her. I want to see other characters that are \\"equal\\", and to create more plot to the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Message to Young Women","review":"The idea in this movie is that academic pursuits are undesirable. Look at the cover art. The Academic Casey is geeky and weird. But the Ice Princess Casey is wonderful! Get a grip, people, and do NOT allow your daughters to be taken in by this Barbie-world drivel. The thought that a young woman with a gift for the sciences would toss that away for frilly dresses and \\"Princess\\" status should be absolutely condemned. Women in the sciences are few and far between; a movie should be made showcasing those scientific talents and how she and other young women can succeed in those areas.

Next time I pick the movie and since I get in for free(I work at the movies) Im picking Sin City. It is a good movie for girls of all ages just not a guy movie.

On her way to Harverd she tried to do some jumps herself that's when she had no idea she had talent. I say she should forget college and be an athletic.

It was that boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the stereotypical Disney movie","review":"I took two young family members to see this movie and it was worth it.What I enjoyed the most about Ice Princess is that the storyline didn't follow the predictable Disney plot: A girl who follows her passion and, in the end, has the world wrapped around her finger.It was a bit more realistic this time around. While the average viewer might have expected Casey to perform the stereotypical flawless performance in the movie's finale, it didn't turn out that way.Cute, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on the sequel","review":"An excellent, well-cast movie that manages to entertain without inane car chases and explosions.This is a fine movie and a great piece of casting, with the superb Joan Cusack as Casey's Mom, and the divine Kim Cattrall as Tina. Kim is a perfect choice for Tina the former skate star, having the athletic physique and the beauty that one associates with ice goddesses such as Michelle Kwan, who makes a delightful cameo as a commentator.I was already a Michelle Trachtenberg fan from her days as Sarah Michelle Gellar's younger sister in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and she is absolutely perfect for the role of Casey.The intelligent ending provides a classic platform for a cracking sequel, which I hope they will make with the same core cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"inspring for youg girls","review":"I don't think the writing or the timing of the jokes was great in this movie, but Michelle Trachtenberg does a wonderful job with her role. I think the message the movie sends is that girls need positive female role models to encourage them to be strong, independent, and go for their dreams. I liked the fact that both the moms were working and not freting over their husbands not being around. I liked that the love story beween Michelle's charecter and that guy wasn't the focus of the movie, her ice skating career was the main focus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Princess","review":"A must for any Michelle Trachtenberg fan she put on a wonderful performance in this movie, this is a must movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"I found the dvd quite entertaining but I like the fact that it shows young people that you can 'have roots and wings.'

Loved Vision of Light. Was looking forward to more of the same. In this Green Lion, Margaret didn't seem to be the star. She didn't talk to God but once, which is something which I liked in the first one. The whole ghost thing and the whole gang trapsing off to France . . . I couldn't stand it. Finishing this book was very painful. I finished it because I typically finish what I start, not because I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I would not recommend this book at all; I have serious doubts as to whether I should read Water Devil. If it's better than Green Lion, please let me know, because I do not want to waste anymore time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than part one","review":"I read the first part of this series and loved it, but this one was better!

Maudlin, contrived, cliched characters, and wretched similes.Here's a good one for you. The broken-hearted, AIDS infested, crack-smoking homeless guy describing his now deceased daughter.\\"She looked like a fairy princess and wrestled like a seminole alligator.\\" Are you kidding me?I was going to stop after the homeless guy kept mumbling about \\"the molecules.\\" (Like wow. That's deep dude.)I finally pitched it when the generic mafia character started a very long, slow shakedown in the hero's office. Did this guy eventually blurt out \\"I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse.\\"? Don't tell me. I don't want know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story revolves around only three characters","review":"This novel was just average and it took me forever to get excited about it. I finally started enjoying the last 100 pages. This novel has only three main characters and the plot is pretty straight forward. You have the lawyer and family being harassed by the Intruder and the handyman/mobster who comes to the aid of the lawyer. If you think you know the ending halfway through the book, you are probably right. If you like to read a lot of books, I recommend this one as a change of pace. I did buy Man of the Hour by the same author so I liked Intruder enough to read the same author. If you are choosy about your books, then skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed","review":"I was really excited to receive this book, I really enjoyed Slipping Into Darkness, but this book really disappointed me. It started wonderfully with the downward spiral of John, the death of his daughter taking such an incredible toll on his life, but after that tale, the novel died. Jake was average and incredibly boring, and this is Blauner's \\"hero\\". I didn't even like the guy. The bad guy I'll call him, is so incredibly cliche! Gangster makes good on trapping Jake in a crime so that he can strong arm into a construction contract. Ugh. These characters were horrid, and even the wonderful character of John couldn't make up for this lackluster story and really slow developing and eventually predictable plot. Blauner missed on this one, I was utterly disppointed. I suggest that you read Slipping Into Darkness, it was wonderful and that book alone will keep me coming back to Blauner in hopes that he can recapture that magic. It didn't happen here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You'll Never Forget","review":"The Intruder by Peter Blauner is the absolute best book I've EVER read. Even though it sounds like a typical storyline, Blauner twists and turns it so there is nothing typical about it. The story brought many thoughts into my head: what if that homeless guy was once happy, but lost his family? What if he was an everyday normal guy? What if that fancy lawyer was involved in a murder? What if.....they just kept coming with no end. It helped me try to think past the appearance and what's inside. It helped to think about morality. It has defiantely changed my outlook on everyone, maybe even myself. This ones a definite reader and keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I had seens ads for this book all over the subway a few years back. The plot looked cool and it had some good reviews on the covers. However, the book was far from the book I thought it would be. It was plain stupid. An interesting plot turns into something very different. I read this book on an airplane, where I had nothing else to do, and still found this book to stink. IN my opinion do not waster your time. Read some David Morrell or Nelson Demille. Do not waste your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"There have been better, there have been worse..","review":"There is some originality in Blauner's subject matter. Blauners tale would have made an excellent low-grade, realistic,daylight horror short story. Unfortunately the desire for sensationalistic hero gets the bad guy takes over and spoils the read.The book begins with the thoughtful and sometimes heartbreaking description of the downward spiral of a train conductor into homelessness, then crescendos into the thrilling tale of a couple being terrorized by this man who has begun to fixate on them. Just when you think this story is going somewhere, Blauner adds in a stereotyped Mafioso in the mix for some bizarre reason and this ultimately takes the story in acompletely uninteresting direction.Overall, I believe the first half book is worth reading. Once mafia guy enters the picture - feel safe in closing the book and calling it a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King was paid off","review":"First, the write-up on the back cover of this book is definitely more exciting than the actual story. I felt like I had been deceived after reading this snore-inducer. This book is not about a \\"malevolent stranger\\" terrorizing a family - it is about a cardboard-character Mafioso terrorizing a family (and doing it slooooooooowly). This is nothing but a very blaw tale - flat characters, boring plot, stereotypical bad-guys. It wasn't completely awful, but there was nothing new or exciting to the whole book. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"I picked up this book to read during a long flight, and I am so sorry I did.

This is not her best, but still well worth reading. The hero and heroine are not as well characterized as usual (there's not even a physical descrption of either) nor is the spark between them inevitable to the reader. Well, I suppose it is, because of course, that's how it must end, but the reason for it and development of it is not as clear as one would like. Still fun though"},{"rating":"2","title":"always enjoy Heyer","review":"A handy 'Kindle-ised' return to an old favourite. I love Heyer's historical works - especially the Regency novels.

There was hardly one page without a distracting spelling error.

I found very little to like about this book. The plot does at least differ from the usual \\"rake falls for unconventional girl\\" that most follow. However I did not like the style of writing. The characters are very one dimensional and it is difficult to form any affection or interest for them. I appreciate that the author tried to weave historical events in to the everyday lives of the characters, but the authors way of unfolding and explaining these events was to allow the characters to recite tedious monologues--that went on FOREVER. In the end the book was so disappointing. This was my second book by this author and I don't see myself purchasing more of her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Vintage Heyer - funny and engaging.The incidental characters \\"steal\\" the show, but that is where Heyer excells.

I read some really glowing reviews and was so excited to find a book that seemed like it was something I would love.I didn't care for the writing, the mystery, the characters, or the so-called love interest or romance portion of the story. In fact I thought the whole story was ridiculous. And the repetition of the word odious was very annoying.I so wished this had been something like Kate Ross's Julian Kestrel Mysteries which I loved.

I have not field tested this poncho, but I have serious doubts about the quality. Mine was missing one grommet. The color and pattern are okay, but somewhat lighter than the picture.

Not a good choice for a hunter or other situations where silence might be an advantage.Maybe I was expecting too much quality but I'm a vet who spent a fair share of time in the field and this is trash.

Anyway...it is what it is.Update on this...It was the seams around the hood that were leaking. I used some seam sealer (stuff used for waterproofing tents and such)and it seems to be better. Still, you would think a rain poncho would keep out the rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Given the price, I guess I expected something a little more sturdy, or rugged. It's a lot thinner and lightweight than I expected. In fact, it's not too hard to see through it with a little effort. Will it keep you dry? Yes! I had a slight problem getting my head through the top (and I know my head's not that big). But that's a good thing; you want it snug around the neck so water doesn't pour inside. I'm curious how long it'll last. It is huge though, and it should fit almost anyone and cover everywhere unless you're very tall or very obese.

The head opening and hood are so small I can barely fit my head thru them, let alone a hat or helmet. Used as a rainfly it does ok, so long as you leave a path for run off leaking. I gave it 2 stars because when I needed it I was glad to have it, but just barely..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This is a horrible product. There are two major problems with this poncho. The first is the hood is too small. It assumes you have no neck! Also, the hole for the head is too small for the average person. My head is not unusually large, though I do have a lot of hair; but the hole is too small even for someone with a buzz cut.Even if the hole is large enough, there is no length for the hood to each my neck. It looks so odd and is uncomfortable. The fabric that should be resting on my shoulders is making a triangular shape.What is even worse is that the fabric is not water proof! After being in the rain for more than a few minutes, water begins to leak through. I recommend you avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everything it says it is except one thing..doesn't keep you dry","review":"I ordered this after reading the reviews thinking that this product would do what it was primarily intended to do, that being keeping you dry.This morning we were receiving a moderate rain, so I thought it would be a good test when I went to walk my dog.

I do have a large head but seeing as how this poncho is suposed to militry spec as long as my head is not bigger then a combat helmet it should fit even my large noggin with no problem what so ever. The matterial seems to be good enough to do the job of keeping you dry but the hood was so small it literally felt like I was wearing a swimming cap. I would not even be able to have the hood on with a beanie, much less a helmet of any size. I've owned mil-spec ponchos before and the hoods on them were very roomy and definitely large enough to accomidate my large cranium even with a helmet.

Her voice sounds just the same if not better than the days of SWV. It's strange how she has remained under the radar in the world of R and B music. I'm so impressed how Coko's voice has transcended into a fantastic instrument of love, and how her music has evolved into a spiritual realm of God and all his glory.

This book actually changed the course of my life, in the respect that it showed me that no person could make me happy, or sad or anything emotional -- I had the control over those things where I was concerned.

I'd recommend having this book around and reading it every couple/few weeks whenever you are in a rut or a rough patch because it is hard to remember to apply these thought processes long after having read the book.

I read (though struggled would be a better word) through this book, forever keeping an open mind, hoping that it would get better, but could only come to the conclusion that this is a bad book. It's vaguely interesting at points, and Edgar Allan Poe being one of the main characters is kind of fun, but overall, it's a childish, boring, and uninteresting pile of trash. Seriously. If you see it, burn it. If you have already read this book, please don't let it deter you from his other works, such as \\"Software\\", \\"Wetware\\", \\"Freeware\\", and \\"Hacker and the ants\\".

It may be less expensive to purchase this set but in the long run we are very disappointed that there are multiple episodes from each season that we are unable to watch.

It's durable and fabric wrapeed. There's a neat little clipboard inside the front cover to hold the booklet. If only they'd made the rest of it out of fabric. I own a wide variety of TV series on DVD and none of them come in a really good case. Even fancy collector's editions are poorly constructed. They only seem to care about how it looks, and not about how it functions. It's disgusting!Despite all that, this is a great collection, MASH is great.

Each time you take the discs out or put them away you run the risk of scratching them....The heavy case and wooden clipboard was unnecessary. However, getting all eleven seasons, the original movie and many special add-ons, all for less than $100...who could really complain...I'll go buy my own disc cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"M*A*S*H","review":"My husband is an avid fan of M*A*S*H.

Well worth the money and these were the most reasonably price that I found online anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice of packaging","review":"As others have noted, this collection is packaged in a cheap paperboard binder. When I removed DVD#1 from the sleeve, I noted many scratches, which were obviously a result of the paper packaging. I checked a few other DVDs and noted similar damage. I was only able to play the first four episodes before DVD#1 of 36 started skipping. I assumed the rest of the collection would behave similarly, so I requested a return authorization from Amazon, which I am happy to report was a very painless process! Unfortunately, I did not receive the same consideration when I reported the problem to FoxTVDVD.com. Thinking I was requesting a refund, the customer \\"service\\" representative got very defensive. Too bad! I was looking forward to seeing the series from start to finish for the first time, and without the laugh track. Perhaps if Fox receives enough complaints they will eventually take the feedback to heart and package this excellent collection properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros 'N' Cons","review":"I am an avid MASH fan and still remember watching the series finale broadcast when I was 11 years old. This set contains everything a MASHphile needs. The only gripe I have is that the extras are pretty lame give 11 years of material to draw from, and the packaging will trash your disks if you use them at all. I bought clear slimline jewel cases and a small tower just to hold the collection. The cool looking box remains on display on my media rack, but the collection is safe from being scratched to oblivion by the cardboard sleeves. Those of you upset that you bought each season and therefore have no extras, I assure you that you aren't missing much...you already have the good stuff, and better containers for it to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged discs","review":"I ordered this product new.

The discs are scrathed by the edges of the discs underneith them when they are pulled from the cardboard sleeve. If you are only looking into buying a wickedly awesome looking box set to put on your shelf the by all means waste your money. or you could be smart and buy the seasons individually and if you want the special features...by the \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" DVD as it contains the 2 special features discs.

To Hell with the loyal customers that spent the primium to buy them individually over the last ~6 years.I even sent an email to Fox with my concerns and pleading my case for a way to for those who bought all the seasons to get these \\"extras\\".Guess what...no reply.

My husband and I bought each season as it came out - we had to - it was either that or record the Hallmark channel and deal with VHS tapes constantly, seeing as we watch a couple episodes of MASH every night. I'm extremely annoyed at Fox. Hopefully they'll release the special features disk eventually to fans who faithfull bought all the individual seasons, but I'm not counting on it. Well, fine - if Fox believes that good things only come to those who WAIT, then I plan to WAIT this box set out until someone decides to sell their special features disc on ebay one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOT ANY CHEESE TO GO WITH YOUR WHINE?","review":"Just got my set.

I think the general public are not preordering this set as fast as Amazon hoped....hense the reduction in price.

They want us to shell out hundreds more dollars to get the special features that we were expecting to see on the season 11 set. If FOX would have remastered the discs for better sound and picture quality, it would be worth rebuying, but all they did was put the same discs in a different box. Shame on you, FOX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal - a must for lovers of the series.","review":"My wife absolutely loves this series, and already had most of the years on DVD, but when this set came out we had to get it.It takes up less space on the shelf than the individual years, and it includes everything.Some people have mentioned problems playing some of the discs, we had problems with a 5 year old player, but found a newer player handled them fine.The shows themselves are timeless, and are fun no matter if you're watching them for the first time or the twentieth time.

Every single disc is scratched. The cardboard disc holders do not keep the discs separate, so the discs can rub together. Every disc in the set has a half circle mark on it from the disc next to it, and same fourth and fifth episodes on each disc won't play. Mash is a great show, but you may not get to see every show due to the damage. Check every disc for damage when you get the set, or buy the show by the season. This is not Amazon's fault at all, the package design damages the discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these disks new or used an just repackaged?","review":"I've read many reviews about the poor packaging. I bought this set with the intention of storing the disks in a seperate container, I assumed I'll be able to take the disks out of the cardboard sleeves atleast one time!

Not the show. I'm assuming that you have to be a great fan of the show like I am to have gotten close enough to buying it to read these reviews.Others have said it, but I have to reiterate. The packaging is designed to destroy the discs. I tried to heed the warnings and got a CD case just to hold the discs. But upon removing them from the box, it was already too late. Just taking them out scratches them beyond repair.

But the packaging of this set leaves much to be desired - I received my set with loose DVD's in coarse cardboard sleeves, and nearly half of the discs were scratched - 4 of them to the point they are almost unwatchable. It's too bad, too, because this is otherwise a great way to get all the MASH episodes. You better buy the series in the separate seasons format so as to avoid this problem.I hope that whoever created this thing will let fans like myself have a discount on future purchases so MASH fans lie me can have a good, scratch-free set of DVD's to make up for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"M*A*S*H martinis and medicine","review":"Of course, the series itself is great-they are the same DVDs as in the individual seasons; however, the packaging scratches the DVDs, so we had to buy a normal CD portfolio to keep them safe.

The scripts were usually well-written, the cast ..

They have been watched every single day since then, and I do mean \\"every single day\\". They are still in the box they came in and not one single DVD has ever been scratched, even after being in and out of the slots lots and lots of times. I do try to handle them carefully though. This is a great set and my only gripe is the lack of a \\"play all\\" button on Seasons 1-4. Hopefully when they renew the set for HD, which I'm sure they will, the \\"play all\\" feature will be added to the first four seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection, poor packaging","review":"I had read enough reviews to know about the poor quality of packaging, but bought it anyway. Especially since this is the only option for purchasing all seasons of MASH, particularly at a reasonable price (I got it on sale for $100), and I got sick of watching my mom cradle her VHS player to painstakingly replay all the episodes she had recorded, with commercials, so long ago. Until she opened it Christmas morning to find that, not only had all of Season 11 slid out of those terrible cardboard slots, but the back cover had detached from the rest of the set, exposing one large, ineffective strip of glue. Thankfully, she's not one for aesthetics and will likely be changing these disks over to a CD holder of some sort, so it wasn't a big deal to her. I'm quite disappointed in the quality, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scratched Disks","review":"The set was exactly what it advertised itself to be. The extra specials disk was just a bonus for me. The only drawback to the whole set is that straight out the wrapper over half the disks were scratched pretty bad. It looks almost like they got slid across sandpaper. So far I haven't had any problems playing them, but I'm not going to be too surprised when I do. Modern players are pretty good at playing scratched disks, but it still sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribel Packaging","review":"The one star rating is strictly for the packaging. The box itself looks pretty cool, covered with army green canvas but the fold out sleeves are completely inadequate. There are four fold out sleeves that hold the discs that are made of thin cardboard that does not hold the discs securely. Many of the slots were torn and most of the discs slipped out during shipping and many of them were scratched as a result. Even though it is a great deal, I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they improve the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off again!!!","review":"Sure buy each season like a good trooper and then get shafted.

If you are looking at this set, you are more than likely familiar with the series, so, I will tell you that the transfers are great. Many times I see that the transfers are lacking, and the quality just isn't there. Of course, as other reviewers have mentioned, the cardboard is brutal, and if you are like me, you will be watching these a lot, so you will need to protect them better. This is a great set for the MASH fan, and is so inclusive that at this price, it's a great bargain, and really a no-brainer. It is the most complete collection I know of, and I doubt you will find this new for anywhere close to this price. It comes with the movie as well as out-takes, etc., all of these are just icing on the cake, and make it an even batter value."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor packaging","review":"I'm sure the set is fine; I give it two stars because the packaging was so poorly designed that the cardboard arcs in the disc 2 and 3 slots for each season left identical perfect arcs dented into the discs, making it unwatchable; we just sent it back and bought the rest of the seasons we needed separately. This type of packaging also makes it difficult to remove and replace the discs without scuffing them. Maybe our situation was unique, or the seller had too many things stacked on top of the set so it got pressed into the arcs, but it wasn't worth the risk to try another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT series!!","review":"I've been wanting to get the M*A*S*H* series on DVD for some time, and the price for this wonderful DVD set is just right.

It also has some kind of storyline that is definitely not going to appeal to the short attention span of a very young kid.The graphics are dated and bottom-shelf in any event. No tool tips, so you don't even know what a button is supposed to do without looking at the documentation which, as you might expect, is electronic. How much would it cost to print a quick start sheet or provide a Flash tutorial?My overall impression is that this game is designed to part suckers from their money. It sure feels that way to me.

Strong chemistry is evident in their first meeting but both of them carry a LOT of baggage and it takes a long time until they can admit their feelings for each other. Terrific secondary characters - Arthur, Janine, Angela, Clara, Mr. John- provide humour and heartbreak. This book was a long time coming but well worth the wait.

I always prefer my characters a bit wounded, scarred, and flawed, just like real people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than a story about a bear sculpture","review":"A controversial bear sculture... doesn't seem like the catalyst for a book about the frailties of human and family relationships and how common needs and lucky timing are sometimes the best gifts one can receive. Richard Riconni is the sculptor and creator of the bear. It seems like his only supporters for his art are his wife and young son, who give up so much in order to support him. But then there's the chicken farmer in Georgia, Tom Powell, who adopts the bear and saves it from the town's distruction. Through a series of circumstances, the children of these two men are brought together, years later. As both search for more in life, a tale of love, commitment and human understanding is told in this heart-warminig story. This was the first book I've read by Deborah Smith, but it won't be the last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I've read other books by this author and I was truely looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about. However, I was greatly disappointed. The book was good until the leading characters actually met. The meeting counldn't have been more contrived-a tornado that just destroyed her barn and nothing else-no one ever mentioning it afterward. I was even disturbed by the hero's handling of a autistic man. Just 'act like a man'. Why didn't we think of this before? Autistic, kissing cousins who are made for each other because of Mickey and Minnie Mouse shirts-who can gather black bears and drive them around town. And let's not talk about how the hero is shot, at which point I literally dropped the book and groaned.Again, the book started off good when the characters were in their own element, but when the two met, I was left scratching my head and wondering what the heck happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I don't get it","review":"I am really confused by all of the rave reviews on this book. I continued reading because I wanted to try and understand what everyone got out of this, and b/c I found one of Deborah Smith's other books mildly entertaining.

The group plays a variety of styles from light jazz to instrumental pop to Latin- flavored music. The playing is excellent - tight ensemble, great brass playing, interesting improvised solos.

Unfortunately, to my dismay, I was terribly disappointed when the book arrived. The photos were as dull and unimpressive as the writing style. I found it hard to believe that a town known for it's eccentricities and interesting history could have been accounted for in such a simple, factual, and boring manner! This was, in fact, the first book that I ever returned for a refund. My advice: If you really want to read this book, go to your library instead, and save your money for a treat at Clint's \\"Hog's Breath\\" restaurant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cool, Refreshing Breeze for the Holidays","review":"Wind Machine's interpretations of Christmas standards are always a joy to listen to, largely in part to Joe Scott's playing of the guitjo, an instrument that creates a lovely and delicate harp-like sound. The only drawbacks are the inclusion of original tunes that, although still pleasant enough to listen to, just don't quite seem to fit in with the traditional stuff.Here, fortunately, the originals are kept to a minimum, resulting in the very best of their Christmas output. Where most performers fumble on their version of The Little Drummer Boy, Wind Machine ends up creating a fresh and original rendition that remains respectful to the original spirit of the song.If you've never listened to Wind Machine or their Christmas music, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you'll find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"Bought this for my mother for Christmas.

If you also are able to condense it down to a few hundred pages, send me a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking and Destiny","review":"Thinking and Destiny by H.W. Percival is one of the most remarkable books ever written. It deals with the age-old question, Quo Vadis? Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? He explains how our own thoughts become our destiny, as acts, objects, and events, in our individual lives. That each of us is responsible for these thoughts, and their affects on us and others. Percival shows us that what appears as \\"chaos\\" in our daily lives has a purpose and Order which can be seen if we will begin to focus our thinking, and begin Real Thinking, as outlined in his masterpiece. Percival himself acknowledges he is neither and preacher nor a teacher, but presents to us a cosmology based upon Intellingence. A Universe of Order and Purpose. No metaphysical book has ever presented the clear, concise, information that is available in this book. Truly inspired and inspirational"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable","review":"There must be others like me, who, even as children realized that something was wrong with the world. Things were not right, and worse, the explanations given for the questions we raised were unsatisfying, if not outright lies. Becoming an adult only magnified the distance between what was and what we thought should be. This book explains as none other, and I think I have read them all, what life is and what it is not. The difficult truths Percival reveals are often what we might have feared but dared not think: we alone are responsible for our lives.This is tough stuff, and Percival's solutions to discovering who and what we are are enough to frighten away the casual popseeker who thinks he is enlightened already. But for the rare individual who is weary of the incessant emptiness of life, Thinking and Destiny is a gem beyond price."},{"rating":"2","title":"THINKING AND DESTINY","review":"The basic fundamentals on spiritualism,mental--ism and physical man.

I bought this set as part of an attempt to begin a daily yoga practice at home in addition to twice weekly classes. I find the instructional CD to be too slow-moving/easy for me, but using the flash cards and music CD, I can create a short daily practice that works for me. I wouldn't recommend using Om Yoga in a Box or ANY yoga cd/book/video as a substitute for real, live yoga instruction, however. So much of the alignment and correct breathing and meditation is better learned with feedback from an instructor. This works well as a supplement, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Think","review":"This book is really just a book of pictures that can be converted to cross stitch. There aren't any color codes so you need to make your own color selections. Not for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something's just missing","review":"I bought the book expecting to \\"play like Tori.\\" that was my first mistake. She just goes TOO many places, and that's very noticeable in this book. As has been said before the Piano took a back seat to the other instruments, and so playing without the other instruments just doesn't give the feel; however, it is fun to turn on the CD and play along, especially with Raspberry Swirl. But other than that, there isn't the fluidity that other Tori books have. The chords are so blocky and sustained (ie Jackie's Strength: held bass notes throughout the entire song) that I just couldn't capture what I was looking for. Not my first choice for a Tori sheet music book, but still not a bad buy if you like to play along."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Written under one of Idris Shah's many pen names. This book provides a dated and suspicously incomplete overview of some so-called secret societies. One howler is that he considers the Tibetan Buddhists a secret society! - they never were but until the earlier 1900's certainly inaccessible to most foreigners. I guess Shah thought that his audience was too stupid to figure this one out. Another is the so-called Illuminati he makes a connection with Bayazid Ansari's atheistic cult of libertines and bandits with Adam Weishaupt group. However he provides no references to back up this claim.Overall this book is a ok place to start with secret societies - but PLEASE take what the author says with a grain of salt. Shah has a history of playing it fast and loose with facts in order to support his many claims like being the Grand Shiekh of all Sufis and which is not recognized by any Sufi orders - Naqshbandi, Mevlevi, etc,"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit lacking on novel 'secret' information","review":"I'm afraid that these 'historical' reviews seemed a little short on unique information that I haven't seen elsewhere. I was also disappointed in the apparent random placement of diagrams that seemed to have notthing to do with the text. For example, within the first 7 chapters, there were numerous diagrams of encryption codes used by secret societies, but yet there was absolutely no discussion about secret codes anywhere in the text. Perhaps I'm missing the real 'code' hidden somewhere between the typeface of the printed page, but as a useful historical perspective on what 'secret societies' are all about, how they differ, how they perhaps associalte or embattle each other, or most importantly, how they might impact (positively or negatively) our lives today, I feel the value of this book was lost on me; or perhaps it's just a 'secret'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the Pseudonym","review":"It should be kept in mind by the reader of this book that the writer's real name is Idries Shah, who is rather better known for his Sufi books. His scholarship here is about as thorough as it is in his other works. His writings on the Isma'ilis are almost totally based on the accounts of Marco Polo and are otherwise devoid of historical accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Secret Societies","review":"Secret Societies, throughout the ages, have existed wherever civilizations and peoplehave existed. Living behind veils of shrouded secrecy, and remaining uknown to the verypopulaces which have furnished their existance, Arkon Daraul provides the reader withresearch, as well as travels throughout Europe and the Middle East, from suburbia to theHimalayas, in search of answers.\\"A History of Secret Societies\\" furnishes a worthy glance into a few rituals and beliefs ofnumerous societies. A correct reading of the entire book allows the individual to makeconnections throughout, whether it be a correlation between one ritual or another or onesociety or the other. Because the book seems to angle toward examining rituals andbeliefs, as opposed to lenghty research capable of manifesting a new outlook, one getsthe impression that the true objective of these societies remains untold. A good\`spark-igniter' for this subject area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy the Firm","review":"This slim little book is full of wonderful writing; as many have said, it's as near poetry as it can be. And Ms. Dillard makes some trenchant observations. The big \\"however\\" you may sense coming is: this book is cool, distant, self-involved, and worst, inhumane. Another reviewer pointed out the hubris of Ms. Dillard's pronouncement in the last paragraph of the book concerning the burn victim--that it will all be ok. This unhappy episode was prefigured by the fact that Ms. Dillard read by the light of a burning moth for two hours, which seemed to me awful. Could she have saved the moth? No. Could she have given it a more merciful death? Perhaps. Does it matter? Maybe not. But it left me chilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-intentioned arrogance","review":"Dillard's work is poetic, but her conclusions troubling. She tries to form a redemptive narrative of material that cannot be answered by this simplistic approach. For example, she addresses a young girl who has been badly burned, telling the girl that she has become a nun in her suffering, that she will learn something, that it won't take this young girl as long to come to the same realizations that she, Dillard herself, has reached. This seems a hubris of the most disturbing kind, to use the suffering of another to say \\"now you'll know what I've known,\\" when it's entirely questionable whether or not Dillard can claim this kind of suffering. Or, even if she can, that she attempts to instruct another in the realm of what lies beyond instruction. Dillard's thoughts are worth reading, but they also require a careful questioning, as her assumptions are sometimes highly problematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning and profound","review":"Someone has compared Dillard to Thoreau. They were right. The way this author fashions her words leaves me wordless.

It has been 3 to 4 years since II=I was released. I am speechless after listening to Chimera over and over again.. It consumes me entirely.. Andromeda succeeded once more with their technical proficiency of their musical instruments. The band is better ever than before... This time Andromeda has recruited a fifth member to make this new album an album that surpasses everything else they have ever done before... The inputs of an additional member has contributed to this amazing powerful album. The mastery of melodies, dynamics, heaviness, technics, compositions, solo etc.... shines out. You'll be hooked listening to Chimera zillions of times once you put the disc in your cd player. It has yet to leave my player for as long as I could remember... A fantastic come out from Sweden's Premier Progressive Metal Band: ANDROMEDA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Andromeda release","review":"See my review for II=I for my Andromeda thoughts and notes.

While there have been a lot of books published in recent years that discuss the prospects for internal peace and economic growth in the former Soviet Union, Christensen's is one of only a tiny number to focus on the class that was supposed to benefit from the 1917 Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Life","review":"So much for the mistaken notion that it is the students who bring immorality, sex and drugs into the university setting.

It carries you through a look at what makes trouble in our lives and helps you to think about what \\"happiness is for you\\". The theme looks at the \\"ego\\" side of each of us and the \\"spiritual\\" side and contrasts how the different sides of us lead us on different paths.After reading many self-help books over the years this one helped to bring everyhing into focus by not being so complicated.

The narrator of this book is completely self-absorbed. She has no interests, and the greatest interest to the reader is noting how many times \\"I\\" appears in each paragraph. She seems to yearn for a meaningful connection with another person, but has nothing to offer a relationship. This is definitely someone who needs to \\"get a life\\". Anita Brookner's prose has been praised to the heavens, but I noted several jarring errors in sentence structure. Her vocabulary is admirable. Although I usually set aside a book that doesn't engage my interest, I seem to be continuing with this one with a kind of horrified compulsion."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Brookner novel","review":"Rules of Engagement was boring. No other word for it. I have read many of Brookner's novels and I finally realized they are all the same. People who do nothing and live only in their heads. But now Elizabeth, the protagonist, knows that women are supposed to do more than cling to their husbands. She has heard of the feminist movement.Actually, she does less than your typical housewife. She is so passive, she has so little energy that she doesn't even bother to have a child. On top of it, she chides her friend Betsy for energy, eagerness and vitality.Unfortunately, Betsy does go downhill also. Brookner can't bear to give her women anything to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully crafted...on an important subject","review":"Ok, so Rules of Engagement is not an action-packed novel; it is moving nonethless. Previous descriptions of Elizabeth and Betsy are accurate, and the reason they deserve Brookner's skilled description and dissection is that so many people, not just women, are just like them. They arrive at middle age not knowing how exactly how their early decisions determined the course of their lives.This is a reflective, analytical, beautiful novel that reveals much about life to those who read to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"This is the first of her novels that I read, and I have to say that I expected more. The characters are weakly drawn, and maybe because I'm not English, I didn't understand their motivations. In addition I didn't like any of the characters, and couldn't identify with them. It was also very very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm!!!","review":"I'm a bit shy of writing this. I respect Brookner and the high esteem in which she is held. This is one of the most depressing novels I have read recently-a vision of how not to live a life, of chances missed. A friend of mine once complained that author William Trevor was \\"mean to his characters\\". It seems that the same could be said of Brookner. though this is the only work of hers I've read. I have to confess it leaves me not wanting to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT, LISTLESS, LIFELESS","review":"I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH EVERY OTHER REVIEWER HERE THAT GAVE THIS CD FIVE STARS.

I LOVE CUBAN MUSIC (PARTICULARLY OLD BEBO VALDES RECORDINGS), BUT THIS CD JUST DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME.

Supernova/ Poseidon Adventure are two films that deserve each other, but are truly a waste of time to watch and a waste of money poorly spent.Here are two movies that failed to sell well, so the studio decided to pair them up in hopes the two together would bring in $$$$ for their bottom line.The original Poseidon Adventure was an excellent film.

I think the previous reviewer missed some of the point of this extraordinary novel. It may have failed if you are just looking for junk-food horror, but this novel is so much more. More Faulkner than King. It takes the best of historical fiction, ghost story, and New Orleans and cooks it up into one of the best books I've read all year. Jesamine is one of my all time favorite female characters. As to horror, I was scared to read this book at night, alone in my house. I live in an amazing city. This novel taps into something true about New Orleans. If you love this city you can't help but love this novel. This is the kind of book that you would love to see as a movie, but your afraid some director would mess it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied Customer","review":"I own the entire MASH series and I was appalled when FOX released the final season with no extra's hoping those that shelled out over $300 would shell out another $130.

While I applaud those who appreciate his artistry, I believe that this description does not really do him justice. During the era that this recording was made, jazz organ on Blue Note was dominated by Jimmy Smith, whose success helped keep Blue Note afloat financially. Jimmy played in a blues and boppish style. Larry Young, on the other hand, had a totally different conception. This date from 1965, really showcased his advanced harmonic and melodic style. Additionally, the supporting cast was truly world class; Woody Shaw on trumpet (one of his first dates), Joe Henderson, and the legendary Elvin Jones. This was truly a date for the ages; it sounds just as fresh today as it did when released over 40 years ago! This recording should be in everyone's basic jazz library."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential album","review":"This is one of the best jazz albums ever made.

Still in heavy rotation even though my collection has gotten out of hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have!","review":"Wow, what a great album. Who would have thought that Larry Young would provide one of the great jazz albums of the 60's. This album is the perfect blend of old and new. A lot of jazz purists scoffed at the organ as having a roller rinky, circus kind of sound, but this album proves how great the organ can be. Along with the outstanding playing of Woody Shaw on trumpet, Unity creates a unique vibe of its own. It's hard to deny the power of this album. Not overly uptempo or funky like some of the organ albums of the seventies and not entirely contained in the boundries of the traditional jazz of the fifties. This album is for any fan of jazz. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organ-based jazz","review":"Maybe I'm a sucker for the Hammond B-3, but this is some great music.

I began reading his blog some time ago and was super excited for the book to be released and it's more than I had hoped for.

I love hearing the male specimen's unbridled point of view on life - that alone is amusing enough to sell me the book, which is based on his journal and blog. But it's not self indulgent - there is a clear subject. This guy is a skate punk my age, from the Bay Area, going to Mosul Iraq with the US Army. Generation X speaks about the war - I only want more clarity of his perceived split between what the news outlets are presenting to Americans vs. his first hand experience. Page turner. I'd love to read about what he's up to now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Awesome.","review":"Simply put, a great read from word one.Everyone has a different taste in books, but this book fits my taste perfectly. Neither political or war-heavy in a sense of blood & gore, but its visualization techniques are top-notch.Definitely a must-read for the war-heavy mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"one unvarnished view","review":"besides being cute as hell, colby buzzell is a hell of a writer. i'm anti-war, and i found this a fascinating tour through some of the many realities of what's happening in iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY WAR was a book I felt I needed to read","review":"With the all volunteer military it is not often that the average American even knows someone, who knows someone, fighting our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is very easy to just put them out of mind. Colby Buzzell paints a realistic picture, for those that care to see it, of the day to day life of the average combat soldier in Iraq. He has a good eye for the small details that make all of his accounts ring true. It's not over the top action packed, it's just real. Sometimes funny, often sad, occasionally harrowing. The kind of things that I think that if you have loved ones in Iraq you'd wish they could tell you about. How many times have I heard from pundits not to except the media accounts of the war, but find out what the soldiers who are fighting it think. Well here was my chance and it was very much worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My view....of My War.....","review":"I must say that I found Colby Buzzell's account of his time in Iraq to be spot on! I am back for a repeat tour....and it is a lot of the same! He nails things on the head from the moment he is recruited to the moment he arrives back home free from his military obligation. I applaud Colby for standing up and writing his blog. I can honestly say that his accounts are by far some of the most accurate and TRUTHFUL personal accounts of a soldiers time in Iraq. I picked this book up while I was at Fort Lewis myself and found myself chuckling at the very same things that he wrote about....get this book, read it and you will see for yourself. Thank goodness there are people out there like Colby that can share their true experiences and give others a taste of what it is like for us soldiers! And I hope that he is enjoying every moment of his freedom! He earned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nitty Gritty of Army life in Iraq","review":"Written reminiscent of a travel (b)log, Mr. Buzzell makes his points while making you laugh (sometimes nervously) at the surreal world of a soldier. Want to know what the infantry is really like? Read this book. Want to know about the impact on normal every day Iraqis because of this war? Read this book. At times the language is course in the language of the common soldier but that only adds to the sense that you are there with them in the struggle. Its the nitty-gritty of army life, the comradere, and the boredom punctuated by brief moments of terror.Every day young men like Mr. Buzzell put their lives on the line often without fully understanding why they have been asked to do so. It is one of the great mysteries to me that we have found so many such young men to fight for us when we can rarely tell them why. We owe a great debt to them whether we agree with the policies that sent them there or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling book","review":"For one who is two generations away from Colby's generation, it was difficult for me to digest alot of Colby's lifestyle, language etc. If you force yourself through this to see how it is played out in the latter part of the book, it's worth it. For me, once in the military, I could identify with his descriptions of who and why he respected certain officers as well as his fellow grunts. His descrption of a heavy firefight from his perspective vs. the Army's or our media's, leaves one unsettled. Every recruiter should be required to have every perspective enlistee read this book before they sign on the dotted line. I wish Colby well, wherever he is. Perhaps he is my FedEx man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just A War Book","review":"Colby's book while being an accurate account of what is really happening in Iraq, is also much more. He touches on topics that really are a part of every twentysomethings life, whether or not they are serving in the army. He joins the army because of the lack of options and the high cost of living. When he's out of the army he's in the exact same position he was before. What';s cool is that he goes on this \\"journey\\" but comes out of it almost unchanged and finds himself back where he started. As someone his age, who has never served in the armed forces, I found he touched on many things that are applicable in my own life. Also like many people have said this book is laugh out loud funny. Bonus points for naming the book after a Black Flag lp and quoting both Bukowski and Social Distortion. Can't recomend highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read from a real soldier","review":"I just finished reading My War. I was a fan of the blog that he wrote while there and he transitioned it very well from ether to paper. Colby comes across as an intelligent and \\"real\\" representative of his generation. His observations are detailed and illustrate well his experience. He shows an internal conflict that I am sure that many feel in his position. He is not a 2-d flag waver, nor is he a cynical nay-sayer. I feel his real care for the Iraqi people and thier plight. That said, his descriptions of combat and \\"punishing the deserving\\" are riveting and engrossing. After finishing my copy I boxed it up and shipped it to Iraq, which may or may not be a mistake. In many ways, My War, is a vivid reflection of this wierd, yet necessary war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Read","review":"This book is a frustrating read. Colby Buzzell is an incredibly gifted writer. Incredibly. But he has chosen to write a very superficial account of the small world of, well, Colby Buzzell. There are occasional glimpses of a much more thoughtful, obervant side; it's hard to figure why Buzzell sets the bar so low for himself here.Anyone looking for a ground warrior's insight and experience in Iraq may want to skip this book. There are better accounts avialable now and history suggests the best are yet to come.Don't skip Colby Buzzell, though. Read one of his shorter pieces (in the March 2006 Esquire, for example) to appreciate his talent, and keep your eye on him in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much war","review":"This book was written by a man with a 50 page story who wanted to fill a 354 page book. The first 70 pages seemed to be about whether he was going to join the Marines or the Army. He filled up pages with a list of books he read in Iraq, public affairs guidance rules, a couple of pages descibing the music he had in Iraq. I started scanning pages hoping to get to something more interesting. Can't recommend this one. If you want to read a good book about the Iraq War, a real page turner that will keep you riveted, I recommend the first half of the book, The Good Soldiers by David Finkel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chess board at this price point!","review":"This is a very nice chess set at this price. It is relatively heavy and it is rugged. It is a large board with easy to identify pieces and makes an excellent first set for anyone serious about chess. I purchased one of these as a Christmas present for a youngster and was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lock","review":"I've only used this a few times but it has been great so far. It seems a lot more secure than the cable lock I was using. It was easy to set the combination. I haven't used the frame mount yet, I just carry the lock on my handlebars while riding and that works okay for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"rough locking mechanism","review":"The lock works, but the mechanism is rough. The dials are hard to turn and it requires a bit of force to move the latch release. I think it is just a symptom of low quality manufacturing. I use it for communting, and yes I have lubed it up, but it has not helped much. Nice to not have to carry a key.Update. I have used it regularly for months now. The mechanism is much easier to use. It has really eased up. The dials turn easily and the latch is smooth. It must not be well finished at the developing world machine shop. I moved it up to 4 stars. Would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I set the combo per instructions. Tested it 3 or 4 times to make sure it worked like I got it. Then a little later just before a ride I tried it one more time and it wouldn't open. One of the dials is really hard to turn, so maybe that's the cause. For some people it works fine, others it doesn't, so just know that you are taking a chance. I'm returning mine and going for a key lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found a lock in my garage and figured out the combo easy ...","review":"So I moved into my house and there was this lock left behind. I have the Kryptonite evolution lock (with a key) so never bothered to try and use this one. So earlier today I figured why not try and open it just to see if I could. Turns out it wasn't very hard. Once you push the little plastic knob the dials will wiggle, well it turns out they only wiggle if it's the wrong number. So after about half an hour of playing with it I figured out the combo and it popped open. So if your using this in a high traffic area where people will walk by often I wouldn't see this as a problem, but if it's going to be locked away somewhere where people could sit and spend some time with it (even a couple minutes a day) then I'd go with a keyed lock instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this lock","review":"This lock broke and became effectively useless after two weeks of moderate use, averaging about two locks/unlocks a day.I had the same problem a few other reviewers had: the plastic knob to open the lock broke off, which renders the whole thing a rather ugly paper weight. I'm now living 300 miles from where I bought it (I just moved), so I can't return it there. And I'd send it in under warranty, but I urgently need to buy a new lock. Thanks, Kryptonite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lock","review":"Although it's a little shorter than the standard Kryptonite, it is lightweight and works well. I have had no problems locking or unlocking it, as opposed to my last U-lock which stopped functioning and had to be sawed off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a great lock, but opening latch easily falls off","review":"I hate the idea of adding another key to my key chain, so a combo lock is great. I don't know why Kryptonite goes to such great lengths to make a secure U lock, but make the opening button so flimsy. It basically fell off after two weeks. So we hot glued it into its little hole, and it stayed for the better part of a month. After that, the button got lost, and the only way to open it is to use something like an awl to push the hole to the side. Useless...I'll check out the other combo U locks available..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single worst product I've purchased","review":"I saw there were some issues with this with the number dial locking. This happened to me but I used a screwdriver and hammer to pop it into motion which worked well and since then the dials rotated ok. I was patient with it but was un-prepared for what was about to come... The outer plastic protective sheath which rotated to protect the dials swelled and now it won't move. I cut into it to relieve some of the tightness and wrestled with the dial again, this time with the release switch. I finally opened it and realized there was spot rust on the steel of the u shaped portion. I mean WTF, this does not seem like a complicated product to engineer and I only had it for like 4 months! I literally had a GROUP of issues with this product and wonder if I will even be able to release my bike next time I try to. I'm literally stunned."},{"rating":"1","title":"stolen","review":"left over night in nyc and found the u bent. bike gone. i was happy with the price and lock until this happened. also, the pad is tough to see in the dark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"Like many other reviewers, I had this lock for only a short period before the release button broke off. By looking in the hole where the button post was it is clear that the attachment point fractured about 2-3mm inside the hole. This makes this lock a bad investment. Fortunately Amazon's return policy is stellar and I returned it and purchased a keyed lock. Kryptonite needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No go","review":"The release latch for this lock popped off & was lost 2 weeks after buying this lock...rendering the lock completely useless.

NEVER AGAIN, EVER, will I buy this lock. Biked downtown. tested the lock twice before I left. Locked it. Cam back to ride home.

I had to take a cab home, get my truck and pick up my bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the other bad reviews...","review":"I had read several bad reviews about the dials not turning/being difficult to turn, etc., but thought I would give Kryptonite a chance since I had used the brand in the past with good results. I should have listened. The dials are not only difficult to turn, they get stuck easily rendering the piece of crap unusable. I am returning it and buying the bulldog which my girlfriend has and uses with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly manufactured and unreliable!","review":"I had this lock for a few weeks and then it worked fine. Then, one day, the combo (that I've used for weeks) wouldn't work. Somehow, when fussing it a bit when the lock mechanism seized up, the combination had reset itself! Luckily, it was only two numbers away, so I was able to GUESS the correct combo -- otherwise I would have been left stranded without a working bike lock.Unfortunately, thinking this was a fluke, I continued to use the bike lock under the new combo. Sure enough -- it happened again. This time, the lock was ON my bike and therefore, I was stuck for two hours on a street corner trying to guess which number(s) was off. Needless to say, I'm never using this lock again. It's obviously VERY poorly manufactured.Also, on numerous occasions, the lock fell out of it's holder while I was riding. I'm just regretful that I ever wasted time going back to find it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from this one","review":"Worked for a week, then my daughter called me from the store, could not unlock her bike. An hour later, after driving to meet her and banging on the lock for 20 minutes, it finally opened. Next step would've been to cut it off. It's reckless to sell a lock this bad, if she'd been on her own the bike would've been left overnight \\"locked up\\" by this junky lock. Totally different than the one I've used successfully for years so Kryptonite must've outsourced the manufacture. Bad idea. I returned it and switched to a key version, different manfacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to set combo","review":"I got the lock. I am unable to set combo after having many people try.

After following the instruction to reset it, once I reattached the \`U' portion to the base I was never able to reopen it. The seller, Seasonal Outfitters, was of no assistance. Kryptonite said it would replace the lock, but while waiting for that I can't park my bike, and once I get the replacement I will always be fearful that I will lock my bike with it and be unable to reopen the lock. How sad that such a simple device (at a premium price) fails right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot change factory default combo","review":"Not useful as the factory default combo cannot change.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was sold a used AND broken product","review":"The bicycle lock I purchased (Kryptonite Kryptolok Combo Standard Bicycle U-Lock) was delivered not in a package, but loose. The button on the lock next to the Kryptonite name wasn't even on it, it was already locked, and the combination was not given to me nor instructions for how to change the combination. After FINALLY finding the instructions to reset the lock on Kryptonite's website, I found out that the factory setting for the combination is 0005. I set it to that combination, but it didn't open, so somebody already changed the combination on the lock. Even if it did work, though, the reset pin key wasn't mailed with the lock, either, so I couldn't even reset it if I wanted/needed to.I can't believe these people (Warehouse Deals) are allowed to sell an opened, obviously used product on Amazon. Horrible company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains harmful chemicals!","review":"I returned this lock after seeing the warning label:WARNING: This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.

Why subject myself to that if I don't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't lock properly","review":"The first time I put this lock on my bicycle and went for a ride, I didn't have the combination set and trusted the button to hold it together while I rode. Big mistake, as the U came off and bent the rear derailleur on my new bicycle. OK, that was mostly user error, so I won't blame them. After that I made sure that I scrambled the combination every time I put the lock back on my bicycle. Turns out that's not good enough. I had it locked and stored on my bicycle, and the U fell off again a few months later. I never found it again, and I know you cannot trust a lock that unlocks solely with vibrations. Thieves would have no problem getting it open! If you get this, buy the anti-theft protection, because you will probably need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"After about three (3) weeks of use the plastic latch knob fell off (while I was riding) leaving me stranded and unable to use the lock.

I thought I had placed the lock on it side when transporting the bike, causing it to rub on the combination dial and breaking the release. Fortunately, it was not locked to anything and I was able to grind off the lock. Decided to buy another one as it was assumed to be my fault.Second lock again suffered a broken release mechanism. I suspect the same problem. The release has no resistance as like the first failure. Again, fortunately, it was only locked on the bike. Was able to grind off the hasp.I will not buy this lock again as a failure to open when locked to a stationary object would be very inconvenient, not to mention embarrassing to explain why I was cutting the lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioned - easily bypassed with bolt cutters","review":"I owned this lock for about 30 days. It was used for four lock - unlock cycles in that time. On its final voyage to the university bike rack, one of the tumblers failed and I could not disengage the lock. I emailed Kryptonite customer service and have yet to receive a response. I had to cut the lock off because I need my bike. Here is the real surprise, it took less than 45 seconds to cut the lock with a decent 24\\" bolt cutter. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.In short this product receives 1 star for three reasons:1. Lock failed after 4 use cycles2. Lock is bypassed in 45 seconds with bolt cutters3. Kryptonite support is poor and potentially non-existant"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy parts: broken within a week of owning","review":"I've had my Kryptonite Kryptolok for under a week and two parts have already broken. The plastic piece that holds the lock on the bike while you are riding fell off my bike into the middle of the street when I went over a bump because the metal pin that holds the two pieces together fell out. Similarly, the button that slides to unlock once the combination is in also fell off because it was not in any way secured.

All characters are true to their nature. Green Lantern is Kyle Rayner who is still new to the power he has inherited, Thanos as always is scheming manipulator, Parallax is still obsessed with resurrecting the dead and the Surfer is the Surfer. Each hero finds himselves teaming with the other's arch enemy and the interaction is wonderful. The only thing I hate about this book is that this begins the new fact that the DC and Marvel Universes are separate and distinct and that the inhabitants of either universe will have to find a way to go to the other universe. Does this invalidate previous DC/Marvel teamings? It sure feels that way. The story is good and the separate universe theory worked for it, it's just that it opens a can of worms when the theory doesn't work out well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plesant","review":"I read the reviews and had mixed feeling about buying this CD, but I'm glad I did.

Next was \\"Love Bizarre\\" (her 12 minute plus duet with Prince)which actually saved the album from complete ennui and possibly diminished record sales. \\"Dear Michealangelo\\", \\"Yellow\\" and the title track itself are listenable, but really don't measure up to the fire of the songs on \\"The Glamourous Life\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Album Bizarre ( Too Bizarre)","review":"On Sheila's second album Romance 1600 she tried to desperately re-capture or duplicate the success of her debut Glamorous Life album.

Everything else sounded too experimental and a lot like the outtakes from Prince's mysterious vaults, if not the b-sides from his earlier hits.

Does this author live in the present?Being the friend that the author advocates and doing the doormat favors that he suggests (e.g. sewing with her) is what women find unappealing. The male \\"friends\\" are the ones women cry to when other more pro-active, challenging guys give women a hard time or leave them confused.This book should be more appropriately titled \\"How to be the doormat, friend type that women find unappealing.\\" Becoming the passive friend which the author advocates is contrary to why male readers probably bought this book in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Become \\"Just Friends\\" with every woman you meet","review":"Don't get me wrong - the author has a sense of ethics that I wish was echoed amongst people in all walks of life, whether seeking a companion or selling a car.

What is less known, is that the women completed the exact same tests and in many cases surpassed the men's scores, especially in psychological and sensory deprivation experiments.Like the female aviators who volunteered to fly reconnaissance missions during World War II (and were never paid), these female test pilots gave up jobs, left behind families and made great personal sacrifices to be a part of the program, because they hoped - just as the male astronaughts hoped - to one day set foot on the moon.Unfortunately, half a century later, no woman has set foot on extraterrestrial soil.

Sure, there are some funny monents in these episodes -- Osama's blooper reel comes to mind -- but they are few and far between.

First of all Family guy is a hilarious poke at pop culture. There is nothing that is sacred with them as I have reported in previous volumes. Here the point, people try to read to much into the episodes thus they don't get the simplicity of the jokes, for example people complained about patriot games where Peter is recruited by Tom Brady to play for the Patriots and then traded to the london Silly nillys after to much show boating, Does this sound like anyone we know. But the secondary story line is even funnier as Brian bets $50 on celebrity boxing with lone shark Stewie and then doesn't pay in time. The abuse Stewie puts Brian trough is hilarious. As is every other episode if you don't overthink it. Look Family guy is what it is and that is Funny!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the incredibly large price hike?","review":"Seriously, 14 episodes for $30? Why? The original box set came with 28 episodes, on four discs. More episodes per disc than anyone could ever dream of. It was awesome. Don't tell me you still can't pull that off.

I have watched it from the very beginning, and suffered during its hiatus. I have every episode that has ever been released on DVD and have their books / CDs. BUT, I am shamed to say that I no longer like Family Guy as much as I used to. These newer episodes are not nearly as funny as the first two (and even three) seasons. Now it seems as if Seth MacFarlane is struggling to be funny as his comedic stylings are growing dryer with each episode that he releases. I am dissapointed with this season, but am pleased with the entire series as a whole. If you're a big FG fan, go ahead and buy this. If you just heard about it and want to watch the show, buy the first two seasons.

It took about one epsisode, I think the one where Peter battles the giant chicken, for me to admit that this was some of the most savvy and cogent commentary on everything from family life to politics, to the media, wrapped up in a most laughable and heartwarming package. The references to all manner of historical events, movies, tv shows and cultural icons are as educational as they are amusing and I guarantee you will find yourself scanning the credits carefully to find which real persons are providing their own voices in the many cameo sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox is pathetic","review":"The 1 star is to Fox for splitting Season 4 into two separate volumes.

You know there is a button on your t.v. remote that says on/off you know. Stewie is my fave character! I got the family guy bendable set and a Stewie plush animated doll. HILARIOUS!!!

Unfortunately Amazon.com does not make much of her music available for listening so it is difficult for someone new to her music to be aware that the mood of her work varies greatly.

No one has played before and no one will play after like him. \\"Who do you love\\" stands up there with hendrix's \\"voodoo child\\" as one of the greatest guitar-laden live track in the history of rock music.

Parts of it are worthy of a second listening but much of it is some of the most boring tripe put to record - not avant-garde or ahead-of-it's-time or even very good psychedelia. Just tired old hippie-stoner droning drivel. Certainly it's devotees are lost in the foggy halcyon days of yore, fondly remembering their first time listening to it - sitting around their dorm rooms high on hashish, which may have made this much more listenable.

I first heard Happy Trails when it was first released, and only recently got the CD. Despite a couple of decades between the time I last listened to it and today, the music was a fresh and creative, and exciting as ever. It had lost nothing of its power and spacey appeal and could easily hold its own against any contemporary band if released for the first time today.

While Quicksilver's debut had showcased ex-folkie bassist David Freiberg's ear for quirky material and the band's few attempts at songwriting, this album emphasizes Duncan's backlog of rhythm-and-blues garage tunes (Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love\\" and \\"Mona\\"), brought to life by John Cipollina's inimitable finger-picked electric guitar leads, as well as Duncan's own daredevil psychedelic forays. As one of the first recordings of its kind, \\"Happy Trails\\" suffers a bit in retrospect -- mediocre sound quality, shoddy drumming, and occasional improvisational dead ends -- but its bright spots are as exciting and triumphant as acid rock has ever been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Overrated!!!","review":"It seems that a lot of the folks reviewing this CD still spend a lot of time with with their bongs. Yes, it's a pretty good record. But a little of the Bo Diddley beat goes a long way, and 30 plus minutes of it overstays its welcome. And for my money, Gary Duncan cuts John Cipollina to shreds; John's OVERUSE of the whammy bar takes a lot away from his playing.

In this book it seems as if Mr. Smith was giving a blank check to write anything he felt about anyone whom he has had a disagreement with over the course of the past 50 years.The book starts off well enough with insights into how he got started in his training and some very colorfull stories of early Judo both in the United States and Japan. But, from mid way on Smith takes the opportunity to degrade many who deserve better. It also seems as if Mr. Smith has a fixation with Chinese Tai Chi players and anyone not in this camp is secondary at best. Yes, some of his observations are true but many others seem as if he is simply trying to settle old scores without any means of defense from those to whom his comments are directed.Over all it would have been a great read if it focused more on the history he experienced.

I found that the newer version folds over at the top band which drives me to tears because I bought a pair a month ago and it has a nice thick top elastic band that doesn't fold over! I just wanted a pair to wear while I hand wash the other because you really can't turn back once you've felt the support of this thing. I found that the velcro tabs in the butt area poke, so I snipped the very tips of the corners off and I don't have a problem now.

I would echo the advice about purchasing one a size larger than the weight limits indicate. I would have easily fit in the small according to the weight guide, but am finding the medium fits well and I'll be able to wear it for the duration of my pregnancy. It is visible under pants with stretchy fabric, but I'm a SAHM so luckily I don't have to worry about how it looks very much. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c it has a tendency to pull my underwear and pants down with it. I may need to go buy some bigger/maternity underwear to put underneath it.

It does not have audio. Read the other reviews and decide if this is worth it. We tried all the DVDs in the trilogy and there is no audio during the film, only when you fast forward it. The bonus features do have audio, as well as the menu, but that was not really why we bought it. We tried updating our player to see if that helped, sadly it did not.

I managed to remove it from my chairs the first time, but the second time I couldn't get it all off so now you see white text on my chairs. I tried covering the text on the booster with clear packing tape, which worked pretty well until my toddler discovered it and kept ripping it off. Now it sits in our garage. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the sit-still eater","review":"This is a good product, which my 21 month old daughter likes to use (at other people's houses).

But overall, a great little seat and she also likes to use it to sit and play in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book is a great way for people to see how Hmong people see their life coming to America, and life before they came here. While reading the book I learned a lot, even though I am Hmong. The writers go into really deep details how living was and also how hard it was to adjust to America. Faderman also talks about how it was to be an immigrant, too. She compares most of the stuff Hmong people went through to her life as a child.This book really gives you an understanding of being Hmong. You'll learn how they lived before they came over to the United States. Then it'll talk about how hard it was to change their lives to live in the U.S. Who thought that someone would explain how Hmong people came here and how they lived? After reading this book, you'll be able to open your mind to other cultures. They did a great job of opening Hmong people to the whole world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Begin My Life All Over","review":"This is an awesome book that tells the true and heart-wrenching stories of fear, desperation, and resilience that so many Hmong people endured as they were forced from their homeland due to the Vietnam War. Many Hmong immigrants that relocated to the U.S. found a \\"culture shock\\" awaiting them, as assimilation made it a difficult adjustment to the lifestyle they once lived. This book is a good read and recommended to anyone who is interested in learning about the immigrant experience or ethnic and minority groups in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"theft","review":"This book is a copy of Culture Shock!

Thailand 2005 instead","review":"I was interested in this book until I read Robert Cooper's review. Now I will not buy it, and there are good reasons for you not to, either. Be sure to read his review for more information.1. Robert Cooper is the author of Culture Shock! Thailand, and uses his name on the review. I trust what he says is true - who would know better? - and he's putting his good name on the line.2. There is a newly revised version of CS! T for 2005. Culture Smart! is older, does not have the revisions.3. The definitive, updated, newly redesigned Culture Shock! Thailand for 2005 is about the same price as this out-of-date copy, and you can get an earlier edition (with similar text to this one?) for substantially less if money is tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info, bad writing","review":"This book contains good information and some very interesting hypotheses about how human emotions evolved.

I am able to leave mine outside WITHOUT a cover, without any problems. It just works.Speaking of working, the heat is spread very evenly inside, so you're not burning one burger while waiting for another to cook. Fish? Perfect. Few flareups. I cannot say enough about the cooking performance of this grill.Do yourself a favor and junk the cheap grills.

He's looking great, showing off his excellent acting abilities against the backdrop of beautiful Alaska and is shown doing what he loved almost better than anything; flying. It is exciting to see him in fight scenes, a sharp contrast to his gentle nature and beautiful songs. Even peace loving people sometimes have to stand up for what is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and provocative","review":"I can't think of a movie in recent memory that has truly risen to treat the subject of religion. Vera Farmiga's new film, Higher Ground, does so with honesty, not reaching for an easy black and white resolution. It raises very relevant questions for anyone who has tried to reconcile spirituality with life in the modern world. And though the topic may seem austere, Farmiga does a wonderful job (as director and lead) of imbuing this film with subtlety and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly good movie","review":"I would liked to have seen a better ending, however. I won't say what, as someone might want to see it.I felt the portrayal was of a woman thwarted in her own giftings. She never got an outside job and she really would have been a good preacher or teacher. Unfortunately she was in a group that did not allow this. Some Pentecostal churches encourage women preachers. Nowadays, it is better in many churches.If she had been encouraged in her giftings, she might have chosen differently in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Story is Hard to Find\\"","review":"There is a story embedded in this film, but it's largely overwhelmed by endless scenes of praying, praising and preaching.

This \\"church\\" stifled her more than helped her and she floundered in the strangeness of what came off as those professing the faith.

This work, though dated, does well in providing a balanced biogaphy. Clay's extream idealism comes through well. Especially useful is Smiley's narrative of Clay's recognition of the mountain region as a potential abolitionist support base in Kentucky. This is an early admission of the split nature of Southern political geography. Smiley does talk a bit on his work in Russia, but I had wished it was in much more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"how-to\\" writing book that really helps!","review":"I love this book! Very unpretentious, and solidly grounded in a real writer's own experience. I have borrowed it a number of times from our local library, but finally realised that I need my own copy! Yes, all the techniques of fiction are adequately covered, but what makes this book particularly helpful is that it is written in very human terms. It makes you feel you can really do this, and in calm, reasonable steps--without all the \\"storm und drang\\" of so many writing manuals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bernadette of Lourdes","review":"This is the story from which the motion picture is based. Franz Werfel's writing brings Bernadette's story to life. I owned the book for quite a while before reading it...I assumed that it was written by a Catholic who would paint a glowing and sentimental picture of this poor French girl. But Werfel is Jewish and wrote the book in gratitude to God for his escape from the Nazi's. He carefully researched the events of her life and wrote a lucid and insightful account without sentimentality. Although I saw the movie the book is full of details which make this biography shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"The book was in excellent condition and arrived promptly and without issue.

The seat is comfortably soft, but suppportive. It's a life saver when you're cooking or taking a shower.

He's 5 months old, and almost ready to sit on his own, so I wish I had found this sooner. This seat is perfect for any baby that can hold their head up on their own. He's able to sit and play with his toys on his own instead of being frustrated because he can't sit up.

I could really sympathize with the well-defined character of Strahd. Why the low rating? Simple: the ending. Losing Tatyana by simply being human in thought and action was the epitome of Tragedy. I liked the fact that it didn't end there, but I didn't like where it did end at all. This has to be, counting the ending, the single most depressing book I have ever read in my life. I feel the ending was a humanistic outlook on something misunderstood, and thus called a monster without feeling, and humanity's way of cursing forever that which it does not understand. In a world where the ending makes or breaks a book, this one shattered it horribly. I almost didn't finish reading it when I saw what was going to happen. It's the only book I've ever thrown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unfortunate disapointment","review":"after all the hearings from the readers around me, I got the book and read.

The plot is familiar enough, a stranger (Burnette) wanders into a small town bar and lands a job as the musician. He quickly moves in on the bar owners abused wife (Ford), who in turn sexually manipulates the well meaning musician into murdering her husband. Eventually, she double crosses our hero and.... I thought the movie was a disappointment. The acting was very sub par with the characters being mostly unbelievable. There are a couple of sex scenes featuring Maria Ford, but if that is what you are interested in, she has better scenes in some of her other films. Another main hook to the film is the music by Burnette (Fleetwood Mac) which consists of blandly put together country fare and a far stretch from his Fleetwood background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and smooth transaction, thanks.","review":"Received the item quick and in good condition.

My dog is 12lbs and usually sat on my lap when I drove. I like this strap because is is simple and just slips over the seat belt before it is clipped. Not only can I keep him off of my lap and clip him in a belt beside me, but he can also be clipped in a belt that is being used by someone, so that he is still safely in place and unable to move into an area that could be dangerous without taking up a seat.The strap is sturdy and should work fine for a bigger dog.

This is also, unfortunently, when the vacuums suction has dwindled to nill. This happens often. After a few minutes of medium to heavy cleaning, the whole thing needs to be cleaned, otherwise your just pushing the thing back and forth for show. After about a month, this condition became permanent. The light stayed on, and the vacuum was basically useless.

Will keep searching though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless!","review":"didn't like this vacuum cleaner. it didn't pick much up. then it was a bit of a hassle to get new filters. it broke fairly quickly (w/i months). just stopped working (wouldn't turn on anymore) despite all troubleshooting efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hard surfaces....ok for carpet","review":"We've had this vacuum for 5 weeks and are having success so far. The suction is great and picks up loads of cat hair and other yuckies. It's very lightweight and takes up little room to store it. The canister is easy to empty and clean. The red light on our's which means change or clean filter has been on almost constantly but we ignore it because we do clean the filter. It does run hot. We have not had any shutoff problems as of yet. We have a medium sized 1 bedroom condo and we can vacuum the whole thing and it's not overheated. We have about 75% carpet. It great on hard surfaces like tile and lino. Just ok for carpet. But if you are broke and have pets, it should do the job for you. WARNING it's not a whole house vacuum. Recommend for small apartments or just for hardwood/tile use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick anything up","review":"I've had this vaccum for over a year and it really doesn't work. The suction is only good in the very middle of the already narrow head (I'd say only the middle 3\\" or so actually work) and even then I find myself going over the same pieces of dirt over and over until I finally just lean over and pick it up with my fingers. It works alright on loose debris, but anything that's been in your carpet for more than a few hours just won't come up. I also use it on my hardwood flooring and it doesn't even excel there. The brush attachment is also a joke - it uses the air flow to spin the brush, which isn't nearly powerful enough, so the second the brush makes contact with the carpet it just stops spinning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible for hardwood!!","review":"First of all-for all of the negative reviews that talk about how horrible this is on carpets...IT IS A STICK VAC!!! They are not meant for carpets. Our home is 80% hardwood or tile. This incredible little machine has tremendous power and lifted the dust out of the crevices. We upgraded from our last Shark, which was the smaller 600W. The EP602 is a dramatic improvment. From the easy empty bin to the ergonomic handle. Ours came with the power head attachment. I thought it was kind of a joke at first, because the suction of the vacuum is what causes the brush to rotate. I was wrong. We used it on the recliner and it lifted everything out. The chair looks new again...even with two kids and three dogs! The power head really is powerful. I highly recommend this product for those that need a vacuum for a residence with little to no carpeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS VACUMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the WORST vacumm ever!!!! I went over 2 feet of carpet, and it was COMPLETLY CLOGGED with hair!!! Then I had to go over the same piece of lint 3 times!!!! - Do not be fooled by the advertisement on the box that claims it has the most powerful suction in a stick vac - Yeah right, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! I returned it for the Dirt Devil bagless upright Jaguar model, and I am VERY satisified. - Go for Dirt Devil, you'll be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This thing is a piece of crap. 2nd time used it and the thing shuts off 5 minutes into cleaning. If you want a reliable vac don't buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and skip this product","review":"Don't just skip this vac but avoid ALL Shark products. I can echo what a previous reviewer said....The unit will die on you after minimal use. I made the mistake of buying two sharks, this one and a small hand held one for my car. As soon as I use the hand held for more than a minute it gives off a a burnt rubber smell. This one began to do the same after being used only two or three times and died completely on the fourth clean up. The container was never really full so it was not a case of overload on either unit...at least not user overload. My best guess as to what is wrong with this product is that they put some great filters on a cheap motor. The motor isn't strong enough to pull the dirt through the filter and quickly burns out. They had to know that when they made these. What a rip!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is a definitely a disposable vacuum. The hose is too thin so it gets clogged alot, and motor burns out 1 month on usage at most! Don't wast your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark vacuum is useless!!!","review":"As I read other reviews I can only repeat...this bagless vacuum cleaner is hard to push, doesn't pick up animal or human hair, and with just one room, and not very hair covered, I had to empty and clean the filters three times..especially the little round one or no suction....in a plain and simple word it sucks and not literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit working","review":"I purchased this vacuum for my new home. After less than 15 min running the machine shuts off. You have to let it cool down and it will start again. The cord is too short and it is hard to push on higher pile carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Vacuum","review":"I dont think you should buy vacuums that are sold on informercials. All the money is put to the informercial instead of the quality of the vacuum. I dont really think the hepa filter really works that great on my vacuum. There is lots of exhaust and hot air that burns you. It is too small to be a good vacuum. I think the EUREKA vacuum is an awesome vacuum. It maybe featured on this website."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks - NOT!","review":"Just received the Shark model #ep602 after being on back-order for two months. Easy to assemble, easy to follow instructions. And then I turned it on. With most upright vacs I associate how loud it is with how powerful it is. This vacuum wasn't very loud. I have hardwood and tile floors with a couple of area rugs, it was OK on the floors but when I got to the rugs it was like trying to push a car in park with four flat tires. Not Good. I have a dog and the vac this was supposed to replace I only have to go over the rugs once, but with this vac I went over a couple of times and it still didn't get all the hair up. I am for sure sending it back as soon as I can access their web site or get ahold of somebody on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts off; rotating brush broke; no good as a handheld","review":"I have had owned one of these for about a month and absolutely hate it. First, it overheats and shuts itself off after very little use. Second, to use it as a handheld is really awkward. The over-the-shoulder strap is unworkable. Even without the strap, the nozzle is constantly getting twisted with the cord. Third, the brush nozzle on mine has broken. I have two hairy cats so the brush nozzle is a necessity. It looks snazzy, but it's crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum QUITS, OVER HEATS & LOSES SUCTION","review":"I purchased this mainly because it looked like it would have great suction, and it did - FOR 2 DAYS. The 4th time i used it it started cutting out after 5 minutes (and i only used it on hardwood floors) and will not turn back on for a couple of hours until it cools off. not to mention it gets VERY hot. it also lost the great suction that it had ?. i cleaned the unit after every use as it instructed to no avail. Don't waist your $, i am currently shopping for another after having this vac for less than 1 week."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"Just received this little \\"jewel\\", and cannot begin to tell how wonderful, efficient, and just plain \\"GREAT\\" this small vacuum is! I am very familar with vacuums, being the receipient of several \\"duds\\" over the years.....This vacuum is all the commercials state, and I am delighted with the power this little guy has over dirt and dog hair, not to mention the ability to do just as good a job on bare floors! Indoor, outdoor, pile carpet to mexican tile, this is the \\"ONLY\\" product for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vacuum that gave me third-degree burns","review":"I received this vacuum from my mom who saw the company's infomercial and thought of me and my dog. The Shark does an all right job cleaning up my dog's hairs about the house, but the exhaust from this vacuum also left my knees and shins with third-degree burns. This vacuum is not safe to use, especially if you have infants or children in your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheats","review":"I used this a few times and now it constantly overheats within 5 minutes.It's also always telling me to clean filter and when I check, it's perfectly clean. Small dirt cup, so if you don't vacuum daily, be ready to empty every few passes. Also, hoses fall out easily.Please think twice before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word - Disappointed","review":"It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed in something. That roller attachment is almost useless. The roller is air driven and can hardly pick up anything on a carpet. Press down even slightly with the roller and the brush stops. Other reviewers are saying this is only for hardwood floors. What? Then why does the picture on the box show a woman vacuuming a carpeted stair?The suction on this vacuum is very poor, even brand new with the filters clean. I'll stick with my hand-held Fantom FM430, which has five times the suction as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on bare floors","review":"I have had mine for about 3 years and love it. I use it on my pergo floor only - no carpet- and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"I have had this vacuum for a few years. Although it seems to have good suction when you hold your hand up to it, I have found it to be inconsistent.The dust container is easy to empty, but the HEPA filter seemed to clog quickly and didn't clean easily in spite of following the instructions. The Hepa's are expensive to replace too! Like another reviewer, we operated with two vac's, one for our rugs, and this one as a supplemental vac for hose functions. Still, I wasn't satisfied with it and eventually gave it away.I would not recommend this vacuum!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable vacuum","review":"This vacuum began to short out on me after just two weeks of usage. Now, I can't run it for more than 5 minutes at a time without it over-heating and shutting off on me. It takes AT LEAST a half hour before it will turn back on again. Not very conducive to a productive cleaning session!An interesting note: The vacuum I had prior to this one was another Shark brand, but a different model. THAT vacuum lasted all of perhaps not quite one whole year before it began to lose suction.... and shortly thereafter, it completely died.Do yourself a favor and avoid this vacuum at all costs! Find the money for a really good Hoover Wind Tunnel or an Oreck! These cheap vacuums - or maybe it's just this Shark brand(???) - are not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product but HORRIBLE customer service","review":"Works great on hard surfaces and carpets. Customer Service is horrible, though. We enrolled in the \\"Shark Free Filter For Life\\" Program but haven't received a filter in over a year (the program stipulates one every 6 months). When I called the toll-free number, the agent was unfriendly and unknowledgeable. She never apologized once about the missing filters. When I asked what had happened, all she was willing to give me was that I didn't receive the filters because of \\"some technical problem.\\" I would NOT get another Shark vacuum for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst vacuum I have ever used","review":"I just use it on hardwood and tile and it still doesn't pick up cat hair - basically it's a very noisy fake vacuum cleaner. The suction on it after 2 months of light use is about the same as a very soft breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorriest vac I've ever had!","review":"It sucked fairly well for about a week. Now it won't even suck up the smallest visible piece of tissue paper despite my having cleaned everything on the vacuum several times. I have contacted the company three times and they have never answered my email nor my postal mail. It is worthless as a vacuum since, as I said above, it won't pick up an extremely small piece of tissue paper, cat hairs, or anything else that I can see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this!","review":"When I first got this vacuum I thought I had a little gem. It was very powerful and picked up just about anything it was near. Boy....what a surprise I got when it just stopped working! Okay, after about a half hour, I turned it on and it was working again. I learned that you can't use it for too long because it overheats. So I resigned myself to doing little bits of vacuuming at a time. But then, after I had it less than a year, the telescoping handle just broke. I could no longer get it to snap back into place. I sent an e-mail to Shark, and they sent me a new handle, but, although it did snap into place (somewhat), it just twirled around and around. Neither my husband nor I could get it to stay straight. I just gave up on it at that point. I've never had so much trouble with a vacuum. I advise you to stay away from this, and all Shark products. Judging from everything I've read here on Amazon and elswhere, the quality of their products is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Fell apart!!","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner at Bed Bath and Beyond, In Ohio.I paid 60.00 for it. In the first 3 weeks, the release button for the suction head fell out, I can not remove the floor attachment anymore.After 8 weeks of use, on 2 rooms of hardwood floors the handle broke. I can no longer turn the vacuum around corners, the handle just spins in its socket, around and around.After only 12 weeks of use, the hinge that holds the bottom lid of the dust cup just broke off when I pushed the button to empty the cup.Now, if I take out the dust cup, the lid falls off and dumps the dirt all over the floor again.I have contacted the company 4 times in 6 months and they have not answered my mail or my email. They have not contacted me at all to make good on their product or warranty.Buy this vacuum at your own risk. My experience has been awful so far.Jane Kohler-Ohio"},{"rating":"1","title":"just a database, not very plant specific","review":"I don't think this was designed by a gardener.

However, the poems are complicated, and very few rhyme. Although it is written for children, some of the poems are simply full of jargon, too long, to indepth, and too wordy. Sometimes the titles do not match the content of the poem in a conceptual manner. The book has some interesting illustrations, and it does have some delightful and unique features (concrete or shape poems). The book is more suitable for gifted elementary students or middle school students grades 6-7th."},{"rating":"1","title":"atrocious illustrations!","review":"I bought this book for my 9-year old who loves poetry. I'm basing my review merely on the illustrations. I was convinced by the many positive reviews, speaking so favorly regarding the illustrations that this book would be enjoyable to read and to look at. Upon receiving the book I couldn't believe how unappealing the so-called artwork is. I would be surprised to find any children captivated by poor modern, streaky-looking water color paintings within this book. To me they are darnright ugly.

The impact driver is a very powerful tool and the drill is a very nice addition. For lighter work, the drill has a mode for skrews and bolts (adjustible by trigger pressure) and one for drilling (with 400 rpm and 1200 rpm setting).I am a happy camper.

I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her. Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived. Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those \\"clairvoyant\\" elements.3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting.

It's like an HD-CD.GO SKILLET ANED BUY THIS CD!I also reccommend:Demon HunterToby MacUnderoath"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revitalized interest in cookware!","review":"When SKILLET's first album came out, I was instantly a fan. I thought, \\"Ooo, something slightly harder, less generic in a generally softened and generic christian genre!\\" Then Hey you, I love your soul came out, the sound changed, became more electronic. I thought some of the lyrics became a little cheesy and the music a little weak outside of a song or two. I continued to try to be aware of a new album releases from SKILLET, but found the albums to contain a variety of wandering genres and lyrics that tried overly hard to be unquestionably \\"christian.\\" FINALLY, after a long time coming, SKILLET HAS RETURNED. The rhythms are captivating, the lyrics are thoughtful without seeming to be trying too hard. I was so surprised and so pleased. Thank you SKILLET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite","review":"This is great. I've recently purchased Three Days Grace \\"One X\\" and this is much more interesting, while not without some weaknesses, the very best of ended 2006. I had wait for power of music and now I got it with the Comatose.No more to add - others did it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, this is amazing","review":"Comatose is probably the best CD Album out right now. This music is heart 100%... God Rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Full-Length CD Ever","review":"This is by far my favorite full-length album of all time. I have loved Skillet's music for a long time, but this CD completely blew me away when I bought it. The songs are so amazing and the lyrics are so moving. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album by Skillet!","review":"This one is second only to Collide. Though they don't rock quite as hard as they have in the past, this is still a good, strong album. Rebirthing(awesome song) was the song that really got me looking into this album. For most bands, I'd say that this is their best, but its second place for the amazing band Skillet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rockinest Rock Band Ever!","review":"I'll admit, we own this cd because my kids absolutely love it.My daughter Ellie says her favorite four songs are: Rebirthing, Falling Inside the Black, The Last Night, and Whispers in the Dark. She is a drummer and really relates to and admires Skillet's girl drummer, Lori Peters, who is AWESOME! Both daughters love John Cooper, not only for his energy and driving voice, but the inspiring lyrics of the songs.Katharine says she loves the quality of John Cooper's voice - how it is harsh, yet beautiful and always in tune (she's an All State violinist, so she would know!) She says it shows that true Christians can be tough guys.As a mom who willingly took a bunch of teenagers to a Skillet concert, I have to admit I actually enjoyed them! Their songs are addictive. You'll find yourself singing them at the oddest times. The lyrics of Rebirthing and Last Night definitely make you think and want to hear them again. As Ellie says, Skillet totally rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best is coming","review":"Skillet is no new band to the music scene, and yet this CD got them more exposure that they deserve. This CD is arguably their best yet. Catchy melodies, agressive backdrop, and sweet guitar solos to add the spice on top. If you are new to the band, check out this CD and work backwards. If you've heard of Skillet before but forgot about them, I encourage you to give this CD a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Skillet Yet","review":"If you're looking for edgy heartfelt music, then this is a great pickup for you. It lacks all the \\"trying to define themselves\\" moments of all of their previous albums and really puts forward a solid sound. Great album, best yet, and I look forward to more. Buy the delux version and get a few extra goodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Skillet Ever","review":"I am amazed that Skillet can keep producing great albums and seem to be at their best with this release.

The marriage between amazing lyrics and hard rock power cord riffs are better in Comatose than Awake. I wish I would have started with this album first.The nice thing I always loved about Skillet is they don't push the bible down your throat TOO hard like some other christian rock bands but they still manage to convey a positive message, combined with solid riffs, that makes you feel great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They have done it again","review":"It is hard to find enjoyable music these days, but Skillet takes all. I just love their songs! I would highly recommend ordered this, and giving it a try.Thanks,Kirstie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most amazing CD EVER!!","review":"Skillet has totally outdone themselves and any other current rock artist out there, whether on Christian or Modern rock radio. Comatose is filled with powerful amazing songs. Every song on this compilation could and should be radio singles. They are that good. Ben's guitar playing is reminiscent of something you would hear from Eddie Van Halen. Lori's drum playing is as always very present and awesome. John's vocals have never been better, and his wife Korey's vocal assist on many of the tracks make this cd incredible. I have never liked a cd more. I bought when it came out on oct. 3, 2006 and I still can't get enough. I can't imagine how much better their music can get. It's simply the best. God Bless them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Surprise","review":"This is quiet the surprise of an album; it is excellent and totally released under the radar. In a year of huge disapointments across the board (muse and underoath, I am looking at you) this album is a shining example of how great of music artists can produce if they take their time coming into the mainstream and constantly strive to improve. Five stars for this album, definately one of the best five albums I have hear this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comatose","review":"Excellent Christian rock (Metal). Great message and good listening that provides a good option for teens that like rock music. Far better than modern rock or even country that speaks of the lesser things that life has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suprising uplifting rock tunes!","review":"This is a very different cool heavy rock/metal band with huge rocking tunes, and their style often changes slightly from each album. This one is one of their more heavier ones with some great tunes, thoughtful lyrics. Good rock metal to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"still waiting for some reason","review":"it is now the 17th of august and we have not yet received this cd for some reason. this is highly unusual from our past amazon orders......martha reimer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather get the deluxe","review":"When comatose first came out, I was very disappointed. Comatose definitely did not have any of the great hits that Collide had. Skillet recently released this deluxe version though, and there is one song added to this collection which brings back the Skillet we saw in Collide: Live free or let me die. Rebirthing, and Whispers in the dark, and Live free or let me die are the three songs which makes this album worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I've bought this item last month and it came in less then two weeks :) It's a great album and it's a shame they don't have it in music shops in my country. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My son is (in his head) the biggest skillet fan ever.

I emailed the vendor 2 times and didn't receive a response."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this album was better than drugs!!!","review":"The album title could not be more apt as this is what it does to me when I listen to it, fall into a coma. From the overly generic lyrics and repetitive nature of it all to the sheer annoyance of the female vocals (his wife) is off the scale. What made me love Collide I hate in this album. It shows no growth or anything of interest to listen to this album. Is one big long whine fest that is utterly disappointing. What a freakin shame that this crap is there next album I have been waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"The music sounded fine, but was this about a girlfriend or what?I really expected more from Skillet. Some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"i am so tired","review":"I have been a longtime skillet fan, and i am so shocked by all the reviews for this album. Ever since Skillet got a tad bit of mainstream success a few years ago, i have been so over this band.But when I heard Rebirth, I became interested in Skillet again. But when I bought this album, I quickly got tired of them again. John Cooper (Lead Singer) is married to keyboardist (Korey Cooper) and yet the album is all about broken relationships. So does that mean that the married couple is having trouble and just staying together for the band or what. I am so confused by that, and then I remembered if anyone christian band wants to be a secular artist it is Skillet, and I just figured they're trying to be more mainstream.If anyone knows anything about the Skillet history, you know that they just keep jumping from genre to genre and this guy here won't buy into it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my CD?","review":"I really wanted this CD and ordered it last month... but it still hasn't come. I'm kinda bummed out. I hope it comes eventually..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impactful CD","review":"This album is a great album for your collection. I have known skillet for a long time and have all their cd's and I recommend it. If you struggle with drugs or know someone that does the song \\"Your Better than Drugs\\" is a good song to listen to or to give to someone to listen to. I personally know people that this album has helped them through struggles they are having in life and not only that the music is just very well written and performed if you have ever seen them live. SRE records has done a great job with this release along with Disciple, Decyfer Down, Jonah 33, and Flyleaf. Skillet's Comatose album is by far their best so far in my opinion and God is using it for His benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help for Caregivers","review":"As a Registered Nurse, and now, sadly. a caregiver to my own husband, i was disappointed with this book. Perhaps it would be more helpful for someone distanced from \\"actual\\" 24/7 caregiving. - like a hospice worker who has never actually been a caregiver to a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort for Caregivers","review":"As a hospice nurse I often recommended this book to the caregivers of my patients. It helped me minister to my patients as they walked their final journey home. I am no longer a hospice nurse, but I keep a supply of these books to give to my friends who are facing the challenge of helping a loved one on their final journey. Every nurse, regardless of his/her area of practice, should read this book.

I met Joyce at the Hospice care facility and we have become great friends as she walked with me through my husband's death and my widowhood.

A mechanic told me that these plugs normally burn too hot, but he didn't see any issues when he pulled a single plug out of my engine. Price is about average for other platinum plugs.

However, 50% of the reason I bought this product instead of another manufacturer was because of the proposed rebate. The company is ridiculous because I send not only the UPC codes they require, but the entire box, and they send me a letter that they need the UPC codes. Obviously I don't have it because I sent it already. Try not to buy from Bosch. I already emailed and Facebook-ed my friends in case they ever buy something for their cars.

These new plugs look cool and are supposed to be a huge upgrade over factory plugs. There is no upgrade, I think it's a bit of a downgrade even from the worn out factory plugs. The factory plugs look to be NGK iridiums. The whole 4 prong thing is stupid hype and does nothing to increase power or performance.The car appears to accelerate a bit smoother but slower. And when decelerating at faster speeds the engine appears to \\"misfire\\" because you can feel it \\"shimmy\\".I can't believe I wasted 30 some bucks on these pieces of junk.This is the second time I have been burned by Bosch Plugs, they were junk in my 01 Civic too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very poorly written book!","review":"Obviously, NO one edited this book.It is full of grammatical errors and improper use of the English language.

I generally liked the instrumentals although #2 \\"Escape\\" seemed too much of something for me, Spanish guitar or something pretty well drowning out the piano. Most of the tunes have some instrumentation besides piano, #7 \\"Winter Waltz\\"- has a lot of violin or cello, but it doesn't get in the way of the primary for me.Three singers, I think I like # 5 \\"Never Alone\\" about as much as #9 \\"When it Snows\\", #12 \\"My Angel\\" didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Mediocrity from Brickman","review":"I've been aware of Jim Brickman's work for quite a while, as I worked with him a number of years ago. At the time, my co-workers and I were not big fans of Jim's music but we supported it because we had to. One guy I worked with described his work as \\"soulless\\" while a female colleague said \\"Listening to Jim's music is like listening to the color white.\\"Sadly, my co-workers' comments still hold up. With his latest album, \\"Escape,\\" it's apparent that Brickman's style hasn't changed that much over the years. It's still pleasant, New Agey background music -- so inoffensive that it becomes offensive! If this genre is your cup of tea, that's fine -- but do yourself a favor and buy something by Yanni or even John Tesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of his best work yet!","review":"Everything I have read about the CD says that it has been three years since his last CD of original material. This has to be some of his best work of all time! He can take three year gaps between every CD if this is what is produced. :)The best tracks are some of the first on the CD. Waterfall is the absolute best track on this CD. A beautiful melody! The guitar/piano duet is also amazing in Escape. Barcelone and Awakening are also beautiful pieces! The best vocal track on the CD is Never Alone, a duet with Sara Evans.While I did find two of the vocal tracks to be unejoyable, but that is more an issue with the singers themselves, and not the song itself.This truly is a wonderful example of Jim's work and a great addition to your collection. I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on the Money","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my husband, who grew up in \\"Viz Valley.\\" He couldn't put it down! Part of a series that explores small-town America, this particular volume visits one of San Francisco's many self-contained districts, each one with its own unique identity. Chock-a-block with both historical narrative and lots of photos, a reader like my husband can trace how the area came into being and then, delightfully, take a stroll down memory lane. I sat with him as he looked at the pictures, and he had his own personal story to tell about many of them. Definitely a nostalgia gift, either for oneself or a significant other . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hood","review":"I am currently half-way through this book and find it an absorbing read.

This book is one of the worst that I have ever read. The story is basically about a woman who is dealing with the recent death of someone she loved. However, it is written without any emotion.

It was difficult to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon","review":"Whenever I encounter a novel with homosexual themes, I usually roll my eyes. You can predict what's going to happen most of the time: the two fall in love, they disagree about coming out/ one gets beat up/ they have to hide/ etc., they are pulled apart, then they come back together against all odds and love overcomes all.All except death. This novel is great because, for the most part, this is not the plot. Cara's death has nothing to do with her sexuality, and besides having to explain her relation to Cara, Pen's grieving is the grieving of anyone who has lost someone close. This is not about lesbians (although they are the main characters); it's about love and grief and living through that grief, no matter what sexual orientation you are.I definitely reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare find","review":"This book is truly a gem. I randomally picked it up, and it was the best buy I've had in awhile. Donoghue paints a marvelous portrait of Pen O'Grady, a woman who must come to terms with the loss of her lover of 14 years. While some readers will identify with Pen's struggle with her sexuality, others will recognize the universal theme of dealing with loss. The book can be a bit slow in parts, but your patience will be well rewarded. Definetely buy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I bought this book on a whim when living in London and wound up writing numerous essays on it for my graduate degree.

But, I wanted something unique. This board is. I am not sure what the board is actually made of... it is like a sort of fabric/leather. Very cool. The pieces are plastic like those of an old-school checker set, save a tiny magnet embedded on the back. How it sticks to the board I have no idea.The only part I did not like is the sticker that was on the tube. However, I was able to carefully peal it off. Now, when I show up to play people are not really sure what it is I am carrying, at once, I roll out my board, and begin setting up the pieces. Pieces, that seem to magically stay on the board.

Predictable until the last chapter and then just a let down. If you enjoy reading about a perverted, sick man who kills people just to kill them - well have at it!

I can't imagine why anyone would call this piece of crap a classic. The story is so proposterous. A sheriff in a small Texas town kills the simple town folk for no logical reason. And then there is his ridiculous back story about how he killed when he was 12 or something and since then it's just something he does. I found this book in a store and thought it would be good because the late great filmmaker Stanley Kubrick praised it. WRONG!!! If you ask me, this book is a waste of time and money. Unless, of course, you get it from a library. Life is to short to waste a few hours on a book like this.

Thompson grabs you early and gives you a ride as you gaze into the mind of an engaging psychopath.Thompson crafts here a character that us attractive and yet horrifying. His is a chilling, absorbing book; don't pick it up unless you have the time to read it through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Slow At First, But Great Anyway","review":"I got this book from my parents for my fifteenth birthday (yeah, my folks are a bit strange- they also gave me a book about the Weather Underground) and, by the end of the day, I had finished it. The first 100 pages were awfuly slow, but I pulled throw and read the rest. I am not disapointed. Although this isn't my favorite first-person murder novel (that would be \\"Double Indemnity\\" by James M. Cain) it's still a aonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"It is very very boring book. I wouldn't recommend this book. Its a waste of money. I am not sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Creepy","review":"I had to read this book for a class. I know what you're thinking, \\"For class? What class was this, Murder 101?\\" Well, not quite. We read dark novels from the first person perspective. And that is exactly what this book is. The reader gets into the head of a killer and watches, almost feels the protaganist slowly go insane. While there are grittier books out there, this was still very creepy to read. It does have a good amout of plot movement though, very few boring, slow passages, but you alomost wish there were more so there is less blood and crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good killing violence and stuff.","review":"as a killer myself i think this book was a fair representation of my kind. the violence was real and so was the sex. im just kidding, i've never had sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was better!","review":"One of the rare times in all my years of reading that I thought the novel was not as good as the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Killer Inside Me\\"","review":"I recently purchased the book, \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" by Jim Thompson, on my Kindle. The book was an interesting view from inside the mind of an unassuming, yet disturbed, law enforcement officer in a small town in the early 1950's. The book was written in such away that, even though it was originally penned decades ago, it doesn't seem dated and the setting could be anywhere in small-town USA today. Although we know who the killer is all along, it's interesting to see how the story unfolds and is brought to a compelling conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Edgy But Flawed Plot","review":"The typically edgy, sparse writing of Jim Thompson almost kept me reading this drama about a mean, killer sheriff, much like a Cormac McCarthy character. However, the plot line eventually turned me off because it really made no sense. The protaganist beats a whore to death and kills her boyfriend and somehow they convince the DA and Sheriff, as well as the boyfriend's rich Daddy, Conway, that the whore killed the boyfriend. Huh? My suspension of disbelief just left the building. I have enjoyed most other Thompson books, and I realize this is considered a cult classic, but it left me cold as the main character's heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Thompson: Unheralded Master","review":"It is time people woke up and gave this man his due. Whenever I think of the current crop of so-called \\"mystery\\" or \\"thriller\\", my stomach turns to think that people read the kind of pablum that a writer like Sue Grafton spews out of her money-making writing machine. Thompson is a man who wrote real people in real situations and never once did he slip on their psychology. Lou Ford is a small-town Texas sheriff who deep-down possesses a desire to kill again and again and he doesn't hold it in because he doesn't want to. Here is a character who is the Id embodied, and when you read his thoughts you feel that he is all there but at the same time the undercurrent of his psychosis pulls at you a little. As the book progresses, Lou slips deeper into his bloodlust until it eventually ruins him. A great surprise ending and a convincingly-portrayed destruction of a regular Joe who just has to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Short Read","review":"Pretty good Psych read without being gratuitously gory.

It shows how a young girl goes through loosing her favorite horse. This book showed how over time a young girl worked through this problem. This is a book that almost anyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book, but Joelle was kind of a brat.","review":"As the cover states, the book really is in the tradition of the TB series, which I am an avid reader of. I cried when Dancer died, because it was horrible. I could understand why Joelle was very upset. The mare was her best friend. But she came off as a total selfish, spoiled, brat after that. What kind of person is she to say that she only wants Dancer? At least she had the foal. It sure took her long enough to figure that out! And in the mean time she totally ditched her friends, not to mention her family. That's the only reason that this book lost a star. It was very well written, and I reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forgotten Filly","review":"This book is an entertaining one for younger readers. It goes through the period after Joelle's beloved mare Dance Away dies and Joelle turns to almost hating horses, especially Dancer's foal. She and her family, in the mean time, have to keep up their riding stable and help her paralyzed brother, Jeff, go through physical therapy.All in all, it was a good book, however really only satisfying for the younger set. Joelle was fully developed character, however her friends were completely flat, which is typical young girl and horse book. The book tugs at your emotions--if you don't like the way Joelle's treating the filly, that means that the author's done a great job at making those scenes pull at your heartstrings. Good job, definately worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope there is a sequel.","review":"I really liked how realistic this book is. The ending disapointed me somewhat.

I still can't beleive that I read it all in one day! I just couldn't put it down! I think the author should write a sequal. I know that I would love to read it. I think it was well written. Why? Because the author described everything perfectly to me. I think Karle Dickerson did a wonderful job with this book. I just couldn't stop myself from crying my eyes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"why was there no shows, races or events?","review":"this book had a good plot but no real story. the ending was disapointing, and I feel that most of the book was about Joelle and how she couldn't appriciate the fact that she had a pure thourghbred filly sitting in in a stall. But what really annoyed me was the fact that there was nothing at all about shows that she entered, nope, the book was about her feeling sorry for herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking, Lacking, Lacking","review":"I just completed my first semester of Spanish using this book. Had it not been for my professor, I would have unsuccessfully finished. This book is full of cryptic grammar rules. The examples given are mediocre at best. I do have to say that it gives a lot of vocabulary...a good thing. This is my second language to study, so I do have experience with foreign language texts. If Mr. McAlpine would revise this book, it might me OK.

Zhivago gives very practical advice on how to quickly and easily figure out what your customer will pay for -- and thus which direction you should point your business. My only gripe with this book is there's no index. Still, an excellent book which I highly recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"Let me just start by saying that I love the entire collection. Celine had really nice songs during that decade, and I think she deserves more recognition for them. Perhaps those songs should be put with all the hits she had in the 90s (English and French) together to form a box set. If it does happen, let's hope the collection includes \\"Ce N'était Qu'un Rve\\" and \\"Incognito\\". I ordered it used, however, and I'm afraid I made a big mistake in choosing to do so because one of the CDs is all scratch up causing me to have to skip three songs on it, so I am going to reorder the collection under another title: \\"French Collection\\". Since I love all the songs anyway, I will still give the compilation all the stars. For the amazon.com customer who purchased it and said that the album was bland, I guess he wasted his money. Maybe I should have bought it from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great ablum from a great music artist!!!!!","review":"This Cd is so awesome!!!

I want the book as it was written. I would not buy this book again regardless of how \\"good\\" it is because it isn't authentic. Very unhappy. (I've read \\"A Serious Call\\" and loved it.) If anyone can tell me of a legitimate copy of this book I would appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The key to the life I want","review":"This is an amazing book that describes exactly what the Christian life is all about. If every Christian could only learn what is on these pages, we would be a very different Church here on earth. The only downside to this book is that it spends a lot of time debating against what seems to be people who were teaching against the need for the Spirit at all. These people are no longer around, but the arguments against them are still useful, just not as needed as they were then. Overall a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundless Kelly","review":"This thing sounds like it was recorded using one mic covered by a blanket.

Too bad, sounds like it would kick ass - if you could hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reckless Kelly rocks","review":"Reckless Kelly is one of those great bands who sound as good live as they do on their studio albums. (You find a lot of great live bands in Texas music and Red Dirt music - check them out.) A couple of reviewers have mentioned the sound on this recording, and they're right that it could have been much better...yet if you listen to MP3 songs and you like them, you will still enjoy this. I can see how a true audiophile might be bothered, but if I couldn't hear Willy Braun's vocals, I'd give this 1 star, not 5. RK's performance is highly energetic and entertaining, and it's darn good.

The pump pumps air through an almost 48inch bubble wall hose and the other hook up currently just off gases as we don't need it at this time.

If you're not already familiar with the characters and events to some degree, you'll just be lost, because he doesn't refer to specifics too often. It deals in generalizations and large sweeps. And it's no good for research for the same reason. What it's good for is in helping those of us who already have some familiarity with the subject to see it in a new way, and to draw connections that probably escaped us. The value of the book is in the perspective of an accomplished and perceptive expert that it provides.Sadly, the quality of the printing in this Penguin edition is absolutely deplorable. It is the worst I have ever seen. It looks like a bad photocopy. Apparently Penguin is too cheap to reset the type, and is using plates that should have been thrown out long ago. Buy a used copy.

It is an example of condensed storytelling at its best and never fails to entertain, induce laughter, and thrill with its imagination.

It details his emotional soul searching as he came of age and began to consider accountibility and responsibility toward others to be honest and truthful. I do come from a faith base and do believe in the miracles of healing, but I think Mr. Gortner tried to speak from his experience and not negatively portray those who were touched through his ministry.

For some reason, I was curious about the actor Marjoe Gortner. While the film was interesting, I wasn't impressed with the moral aspect of it. Here was a man who used the faith and trust that innocent (perhaps foolish) people put in him to simply make money. I felt bad for the hundreds of people who were filmed handing over their hard earned cash to him.While I understand that his parents trained him to be a pint-sized preacher - his only interest, as an adult, was to be the center of attention. This could have been a much better film if he came clean with his audience while he was standing in front of them and let them know how he felt about what he was doing.I am not a religious person, but I do believe in being honest with people.

IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!","review":"I love crushed ice and was hesitant to buy this product due to the negative comments left. However, I took a chance and I am so glad I did! This creates the most wonderful shaved ice, just like snow! It works really well, even on my crescent shaped cubes. Now I have FABULOUS, fluffy, ice in minutes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After Two Uses","review":"We ordered this from Amazon and we were initially very happy with it. We used it twice about a week apart and made six snowcones on each of those uses. We were very happy with the snowcones, the ice was a great consistency, etc... When we went to use it the third time we made four snowcones and in the middle of the fifth it just stopped working. We didn't see any smoke or hear any popping noise. It just stopped working and never turned on again. We were able to return it to Amazon for a full refund but I would not recommend that anyone buy this product as it is unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work that great - and I really tried!","review":"Bought this based on all the good reviews. Even tried the tips some of the reviewers left. Unfortunately, this ice shaver just doesn't work that great, at least not for me. Sometimes it just won't shave the ice. I tried switching back and forth between slushie and snow cone settings like one reviewer suggested, but it still doesn't shave it. It's like the ice isn't being pushed down on the blade enough for it to shave it. If I stick with it, continually removing the lid to reposition the ice cubes, eventually I get enough ice for ONE small snow cone. That's just too much work for one little cup of shaved ice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good toy","review":"This the worst item I have EVER purchased on line and maybe EVER.After 15 minutes all I had 1 teaspoon of slush. It is supposed to usestandard ice cubes. It was a total dud using the ice from my ice maker.The ice just spins around above the blade. I should have read all the reviewsvery carefully.I had much better luck using a freezer bag and a mallet.This is the only Item I have ever returned, Amazon was excellent in handing thereturn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice...for 1 day","review":"This ice shaver was very nice for ONE day.

It was the hit of the party! Have used it several times since when people are over with the little ones. It is slightly noisy, but what can you expect when your are slicing/shaving ice. Duh! To keep the mess down, I just put it out on the patio and let them go at it! Been making my own syrup. 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup water and bring to boil. Boil 1 min. Remove from heat and add two packs of your flavored drink mix. Let cool and then refrigerate. You can use 16 oz water bottle with a spout for easy dispensing. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"The machine is very noisy. It grinds the ice slowly, way too slowly. The cup in the bottom which I thought would be nice, is super hard to put on and take out. It doesn't have a pour spout so it makes a mess when you try to pour the ice into a cup. I guess the idea is that you would mix the flavor in with the ice while you are shaving it, because it has the stirring paddle, but when do kids ever all eat the same flavor snow cone? I wanted an upgrade over what I had and I sure wish I had bought the other one that was available instead of this one. I would much prefer one where you can put your own cup beneath it and have the shaved ice come out right into the cup. (the other one had that). So sorry I bought this. The sad thing is I bought it in April for an Easter gift but didn't use it until now. So I doubt I can even return it. Amazon is great, but this product is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"Bought this somewhere else on a \\"deal\\", so returning it is not an option. Like others say, it makes very little ice and you constantly have to fiddle with the ice to try and get some to shave. It will probably go in the trash, as I see no way of making it do what it is suppose to do. Great idea, but worthless product. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed.","review":"1st item didn't work,had to be sent back to company. 2nd item arrived was really excited as it was meant to be a christmas present but very disappointed, this machine is rubbish. have brought a 3rd from a differnet company works brilliantly and is in the style of 1950's which looks great.Would definitely not recommend product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"My husband bought this for me, but we are very disappointed. The ice cubes just bounce off the blade as the machine turns. If the ice actually starts to grind, the machine jams and makes a terrible noise. After both my husband and I attempted to make it work for half an hour, we had a 1/2 cup of large grind snow cone ice which was melting quickly. You would be better off with a hammer and a freezer bag, and a lot less frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"Horrible. I just threw mine out. I've tried 4 or 5 times with the same result, the shaved ice actually melts before I can shave enough for a snow cone. Maybe it's my ice, maybe mine is defective, maybe I'm just unlucky. In any case I'm done with it and could never recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"Do not waste your money. I bought it for my son who love shaved ice.

Why bother?????!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work!","review":"We followed the directions and tried to make snow cones multiple times with various sizes of ice. Nothing worked. The most ice we ever got was about 1/8 of a cup. We promptly sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fine enough for my taste...","review":"I was hoping for an ice shaver that would produce very fine ice shavings, but this shaver won't do that. It leaves big crunchy chunks of ice. If you want something like a crunchy snowcone, then this shaver should be fine for you, but if you want fine shaved ice, this isn't even close. With the way it works, I've used it twice and now it sits on a shelf collecting dust. The plastic used for the shaver is fairly thin and gives an insubstantial feel. So far it's worked fine, but as noted above I haven't used it enough to cause any sort of wear. I suspect that it will break down over time due to the thin construction and the poor tolerances of the fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ice works great for refreshing drinks of summer.","review":"It works alot better than an osterizer. The shaved ice makes refreshing drinks of summer. It makes a good amount of shaved ice in about 2 or 3 minutes. To keep the noise low I put a towel over it and it works good. It is easy clean up too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Works well, used bagged ice & didn't have any problem. It's nice it has measurement marks on the bowl for the amount of liquid. Doesn't make a lot of drinks at one time but that wasn't a problem. Would recomend it to anyone who enjoys snowcones & icee drinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best home slushi machine ever","review":"I'm a huge slush-puppie fan and decided to order this little guy based on the reviews and price. Since receiving it a few days ago, I've been extremely satisfied. It's very simple to use and clean, and produces excellent shaved ice. I'm also quite surprised how fast it makes it. For the quality and price, you will not find better machine!Also, to make a slushi just like the blue raspberry slush-puppie, mix it with Berry Bonkers Hawaiian Punch (one of the harder flavors to find, but I get mine at Shaws). The very similar taste together with the great shaved ice makes it virtually indistinguishable. As a result, I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good product!","review":"This worked very well for us. We made shaved ice and put fruit and condensed milk over it. I've only tried the slushie setting which worked great. It shaved ice fast. I had a party and served about 10 servings (about a cup of shaved ice each) and it took less than 5 minutes. Sometimes it was not shaving the ice cubes in it, and all I had to do was to shake the machine a little bit so the ice cubes would rearrange themselves. I used the long ice cubes came directly out of my refrigerator freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good On The Wallet When You Want To Beat The Heat","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers are saying about this product it's one of the most cost effective ways to beat the heat without having to go to a convenience store every day to buy a slushie. The machine is a little noisy at first but that's to be expected with shaving ice but other than that little annoyance the shaver works well as advertised and once you get the syrups to go with your icy desert the rewards worth it. So if you're tired of the heat and are looking for a cold treat without having to continue to buy one everyday here's a good alternative..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine!","review":"Fast, efficient, works great. It's a bit loud but it's shaving ice, what do you expect, right?! Very sturdy and you don't have to press down or do anything but wait for the perfectly fluffy bits of ice. I love the little spinner inside that keeps the ice from clumping up near the chute. The cord is decent length as well. Don't bother with a cheap machine if you're serious about your snow cones, get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaves Ice Fast! Use Ice Cubes straight from the freezer","review":"The Hamilton Beach Ice Shaver is faster and quiter than other models I have used. It holds one standard ice cube tray of cubes in the hopper, turn it on and in about 30 to 40 seconds you have shaved ice.Being able to use cubes directly from the freezer is a big plus since we make ice at least twice a day.Frankly I can't tell much difference between the slushy and snow cone setting the snow cone setting seems to produce slightly larger flakes of ice than the slushy setting. My other half prefers the slushy setting he says it takes slighly longer for the slushy bits to melt in the mouth.Over all very satisfied with the ice shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Bought the item after reading the reviews. Thought it was going to work great. The machine does not work well when you use the the ice from the freezer without crushing it first. Even after crushing, the machine is slow to produce slushie/ ice shaver. It is a noisy. Would not recommended. Skip this machine and look for something else. I saw a margarita machine that a friend has, it make a quick slushie. Going to give that one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better.","review":"I purchased this model because it used regular ice cubes and not a mold of ice. It took at least 15 minutes to grind the ice for 1 icee. I kept having to stop the machince to rearrange the ice just to get it to shave. Very annoying when you have 2 little ones anxiously waiting for thier snow cone. I am most likely going to return this and try to find a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly jams, not stong enough","review":"This was my third try with an inexpensive ice shaver. Guess I gotta spend some bucks to find an ice shaver that actually works, although when I was a kid, I remember my Snoopy hand-crank ice shaver worked pretty good.So my fridge makes crescent shaped cubes, like most fridge ice-makers. No go with those in this thing, so I used the 'crushed' setting on my fridge dispenser, and tried that instead. No go with that either. Maybe I read the label wrong, maybe this is a cheese shaver, cause it can't handle ice at all.This thing jams within 1-2 seconds and uses a cheap stationary blade that can't hack it."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I was excited to finally have a great ice shaver. Unfortunately this was not it. I tried several ways to get it to work and they all failed. This is probably the worst piece of junk I ever purchased. It was extremely noisy and bounced around. If I held part of it at an angle the whole time it would eventually shave a bit of ice. This is a definite DON'T BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works poorly!","review":"I had high hopes for this appliance. Unfortunately, it works extremely poorly. Placing a few pieces of ice (half moon shape) into the machine and turning it on, almost nothing happens. It literally will be on for 10 minutes to get a few tablespoons of shaved ice. To get enough shaved ice for a single snow cone, it often takes 20 minutes. Of course after that amount of time, the ice is already melting.For $30 I expected something much more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, but...","review":"I love making slushies out of all my favorite drinks so this ice shaver is awesome to have during the summers.

I would reccomend this product to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best ice shaver","review":"Bought this to use for margaritas and slushies, but the ice didn't really shave well, and I ended up making them in a blender instead.

If I have to do it almost every time I use it, it is not worth the money paid for it.My grandson finally got it to work well...then when trying to turn the container at the bottom to remove it, the stem holding the mixing bar broke off making the container useless.

It grinds so very slowly and stops every few seconds because the ice jams it.

It works well and efficiently if the ice cubes are placed consistently in the hopper. If the cubes are just dumped in randomly, they tend to melt around the center support and jam up, thus preventing the 'shaving' blades from engaging the ice. -This is a minor inconvenience only.The big problem was that after using it for five months, once every other day, the central post that locks down the blade bay in contact with the motor gears broke at the single screw in the locking ring. I am an engineer and IMO, if the locking ring post were made of a stronger material such as steel or delryn this would not have happened. The locking ring-post is made of injection molded plastic and is just not strong enough to last very long.I will not buy this design again -it only worked for about 100 uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOKS GOOD, GOOD PRICE BUT DOES NOT PERFORM","review":"Features on papers are convincing and the product itself looks that it will deliver, however, i get frustrated every time I use this product to shave ice.

What I got was nothing more than a reproduction of the listings that Beckett includes in its monthly publications. With the exception of about 200 prices for celebrity autographs (which is a far cry from the thousands you would find in other publications), this book has nothing that you can't get in a monthly issue of Beckett. It may have a few nice pictures, but that does not make up for its lack of content. And the prices are obscene! Is a Dean Cain sig worth more than Willie Mays? Or for that matter is Dean Cain worth more than Jack Nicholson? Where do they get their information? They spend way too much time listing prices for autograph inserts manufactured by card companies, and not enough time listing prices for REAL autographs obtained by collecters.

We see Max Baer act, dance, box and best of all, being himself. We also see Primo Carnera, who at the time (1933) was the actual Champion of the World, figt Baer. There the fight ends in a draw, and everybody is happy. The uncanny event is that a year after the movie was filmed (1934)Baer and Carnera fought in real life for the Heavyweight Championship and Baer won by knocking out Carnera.The film is supported by excellent acting by Mirna Loy and Walter Houston... and yes, Jack Dempsey is in it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a watch, especially for Baer","review":"This was televised late one night a couple of years ago, and I enjoyed it immensely. Not a great film, but fun for all sorts of reasons. Myrna Loy is a doll as always and Baer was surprisingly good--very charming even when misbehaving, and giving some clue why so many people who knew Baer liked him and were offended by Ron Howard's hatchet job on Baer in his \\"Cinderella Man\\" film about Jimmy Braddock (who fought Baer). Baer was not a great actor by any means, a bit mechanical the way you'd expect an amateur to be, but effective when necessary, and he does a great tap dance number with a chorus line that is just terrific! The film ends with a lengthy \\"bout\\" against Primo Carnera, which is filmed before Baer and Carnera actually fought for the title in reality. The filmed version is as wild as the real bout was, though the result is a bit different.

It is horrible. The tv series is not even close to the book series. Main character should have had a different name. I don't know if I want to read the books anymore.It doesn't help that Brennan is portrayed as a young woman with no social characteristics. She is totally ignorant about everything, and is allegedly too brilliant to care. So she hires an intern who is very similar.So why did they get rid of him in season 3?The series should be called Leuton Lab in deference to the old Peyton Place my grandmother used to watch.

Not as good as CSI, but definitely a quality crime drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mass murder as entertainment","review":"My core problem with this show is that it presents FBI agent Booth as a hero.The U.S. invaded Afghanistan under a false pretext. We had troops pre-positioned to invade the country on 9-10-2001, then came the 9/11 attacks and we went in. The invasion was premeditated; 9/11 just provided the justification.Then the Kean Commission lied endlessly in its 9/11 report. Even the members of the commission said they didn't tell the truth. So, if someone like myself knows that the Kean Commission's report is a lie, how come FBI agent Booth (a trained investigator) doesn't know the same thing? Answer is, he DOES know. Yet he went to Afghanistan anyway and killed 50+ as a sniper.That's really foul, people. A guy who shoots 50 people knowing he has no honest justification for doing so is a mass murderer. Booth is as profoundly flawed as any lead character I've ever seen in a television program."},{"rating":"1","title":"halp","review":"Most likely a wonderful show (I haven't gotten around to watching it) that I got as a gift for my dad for Christmas.

It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines. I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite. It adds depth to all of the characters. Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year. I like holidays that are about what is good in the world. Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day. I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way. Buy, watch it, love it. But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone. So moving, great performances by the whole cast. Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here. David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments. Touching, poignant moments. This really is the best of what is great about Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, Poor Packaging","review":"This is actually my second copy of Season One, as my first copy got scratched beyond repair.I was very disappointed to see that it is still packaged very cheaply, with episodes on both sides of the disc.

This is a great way to catch up on old or missed episodes. The first season consisted of 22 episodes including the pilot. If you've just started watching, this gives you the opportunity to understand the characters and why they are the way they are. While this may be similar to the CSI-style of crime shows, this goes more in-depth with anthropological investigation with bones. There is also a human interest element with the character interraction of the bone investigators and the FBI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Bad DVD Set","review":"Bones is an awesome crime drama with all the characters - especially the two main ones Booth and Brennan - making it very compelling to watch. I've already ordered and watched two more seasons and can't wait to see the rest. The only problem I have (and why I gave the product 4 stars even though it deserves 5) is because the DVDs in this set were made double-sided, possibly to save money on the manufacturers part. However, I found that they got scratched very easily and episodes I hadn't even gotten a chance to watch yet were scratched when I got to them. It was disappointing, but since this first season/dvd set I haven't had the problem because the rest of the seasons are one-sided discs. it's a small, unfortunate problem for someone like me who wants to watch the episodes and can't because the DVDs will be scratched. I do wish they'd re-release the set and make them one-sided, but that's just wishful thinking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily my favorite series!","review":"Loving this series.

Talk about a let down. Brennan is a completely unlikable character. She's clueless to social etiquette and popular culture, and worst of all, completely dismissive of others' belief systems. That lack of respect really turned me off to the show. How Brennan wrote a best selling murder mystery is beyond me. She doesn't understand how human emotions work so how could have the characters in her book been readable? Hodges is a left-wing conspiracy nut job who spouts the same old tired nonsense. They could have had fun with this character, but wrote a cliche. How this show stayed on the air so long is beyond me.

Sorry, but when I watch something I don't like rooting through the menu every 40-45 minutes.

Our daughter does not have Cable so we have been taping the episodes this year for her to see. Her husband and boys have also gotten the \\"bug\\" for the series. Of course we had to check out the DVDs for quality inspection and enjoyed the first year all over again. We think the DVD set and the books are first rate stories and the TV series well acted and with a cast of characters who really work well together. Although there are a lot of yucky, skeletal and sometimes gooey scenes (not fit for young children) the humor is priceless. We are anxiously awaiting \\"Season Two\\" to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad !!","review":"As a life-long Elvis fan all I can say is don't waste your money.In this concert he really could care less about this performance,talking and laughing in the middle of most of the songs.I listened to this cd just one time,and its at the very bottom of the pile never to be listened to again.Not a very good way to preserve his music or memory !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same software available for free","review":"While I endorse the Sony LocationFree system, I was previously annoyed that additional LocationFree players required the purchase of this CD-ROM for about 30 bucks. However, as of November 29, 2007, the software contained on this CD-ROM is available as a free download from Sony's website. No code is required -- it is truly just free. My 1-star rating of the CD-ROM sold here is based entirely on \\"value\\", comparing it to the exact same version that is available as a free download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I never rate 5 stars.

It was great I took it out into the field everyday! It was the only way I could write down my information as well as all the data I had to collect. Without Rite in the Rain I would have failed the course. Those who brought paper notebooks couldn't write in the forest like I did. I love this!! Next time I'm going to the rainforest I will take my Rite in the Rain notebook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wheels","review":"Purchased for my grandson ... came in quickly and he was so totally satisfied with them. Will definitely keep amazon in mind when other replacement parts need to be purchased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dece","review":"I got the wheels in a timely manner, the only problem was that they sent me red wheels instead of orange, but that really isn't a big deal. However, if the color really matters to you, I would second guess this dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product... Just not for Heavier people to use.","review":"We use scooters in our production plant, so we use scooters alot. They work really well as long as you are not over 250 lbs. The plastic rims just cant handle the weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 9 year old daughter loves her scooter again!","review":"My 9 year old daughter's Razor has been used at least several times a week for about 4 years, and the OEM wheels had just worn out. I didn't realize how rough a ride they were giving her until I got on it a few weeks ago, then compared the experience to my 4 year old's brand new Razor.These wheels arrived in just 2 days with Prime membership and upon spending about 10 minutes swapping the original wheels out, her scooter is like new again. What a difference! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the replacement wheels aren't quite as thick as the original wheels, so I don't expect them to last quite as long, and for the price, they are almost half the cost of just buying a new scooter altogether.That being said, they were easy to install, and my daughter loves riding her scooter even more now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooter wheels","review":"I was not super impressed with these at all. After a week they started to get flat spots from braking and my son replaced them after about two weeks. If you are buying them for a young person under 9 it should be fine but my son is 13 and all into the stunts and they didn't hold up... although they looked cool. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures don't match product","review":"The hubs are much larger than shown in the Pic; They LOOK great... however, The wheels are Skinned over the hub and the urethane is thin - they came apart easily.

The item is packaged in clear plastic, so it is obvious that these wheels are not CLEAR, but RED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels = OK, Color = not what I ordered","review":"I understand that there's not much to this particular item, but if Amazon is going to offer several different colors (and charge a different price for each), the least they can do is provide the color that you order. The package I received has two red wheels in packaging that says 'clear'. And while I don't really care what color they are, I'm sure my 9-year-old will. So don't pay extra for a specific color because you might not get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected","review":"Unlike the picture suggests, these wheels are actually the NEWER version of replacement wheels which have SMALLER rubber width making it very easy to wear off. Just look at the customer uploaded photos of the product and you will see for yourself that the seller false advertised this item. I am very upset that they sold me these wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor replacement wheels.","review":"These wheels we for my son's scooter.

Also the wheel was too big to fit into the front spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased!","review":"My son picked these wheels because of the picture. I just received the wheels and what the picture shows is not what I was sent. The wheels I got the center area is not the same. The center of the wheels I received is larger and not as many spokes (not sure if that is the right word for the center area, but hopefully you get my drift) The actual rubber part of the wheel is smaller. I'll keep the wheels I received but be aware that what is pictured is not what you will get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made the scooter like new again.","review":"Replaced these wheels on my son's scooter which was suffering from a bad bearing.

They're wheels. The 'wheel' part is larger than pictured, so the 'tire' isn't as deep. It probably won't matter if they become flat spotted from looking up the rear brake like the original ones did.They did go on just fine and the overall diameter and thickness are correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this import.","review":"Joe Cocker sings better today[2003], then he did back in the late seventies or early eighties when this album was recorded. This cd is no better than his other live retro release from the same period \\"Standing Here\\". The fact is that Joe was still on the mend from years of self abuse and it shows in the quality of his voice. He sounds terribly strained to say the least. If you buy this cd, you should compare it to his live cd \\"Joe Cocker Live\\" from 1990 on Capital records, and listen to the difference for yourself. I can see why this is only available as an import? This live document, should never have been released period. Although the band backing him is adequate, they do not come close to matching his Chris Stainton led band on the 1990 live cd. I consider any executive who okayed the release of this cd to have committed musical malpractice. Joe Cocker deserves better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Cocker on Tour 1981","review":"This cd is bad.This live cd includes only elleven tracks recorded live in New York 1981.If you looking for a concert of Joe Cocker in this periode, buy the dubble album \\"Standing Here\\" (2001), instead.Joe Cocker did a comeback in 1981 and released the album \\"Sheffield Steel\\" the following year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it!","review":"Too long and too boring. Character development was absent. In fact, you read about a person, get to know them and they do something so out of character that it's like reading a new book.

I would say 85 percent are the CD equivalent of vinyl records I first bought many years ago. The crisp, clean sounds of the original recordings come through and produce a whole new experience of listening enjoyment. So too with this collection of Donovan songs.I consider this album to be a very good mix of his songs - some lively but with a message - while others are much more relaxed but just as thought provoking. 'Operating Manual...' is one of the former, while 'There is an Ocean' is one of the latter. And of course who could not fail to be moved by the final song in the set 'Sailing Homeward', the journey home, through life, wherever that ultimate home may happen to be.Perhaps I am the wrong person to be writing a review of Donovan's music. The man can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned, apart from 'Sutras', that is. But I think you will love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas but poorly written","review":"The author knows how to tell a story. I thought the plot and the characters were very interesting, but I did have trouble reading the book because of the overwhelming amount of grammatical errors. Misspelled words, incorrect verb usage, missing spaces and missing commas were some of the MANY annoying errors in this book. The author even had the nerve to \\"write\\" in a letter next to a typed word. That was absolutely ridiculous!I actually read the author's first book, The Manhunt, and that book had numerous errors as well. I was assuming the author would learn from her mistakes and perhaps hire an editor for her second novel, but it seems as though the errors are even more numerous in this novel than they were with the first!Major suggestion for the author - HIRE AN EDITOR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Bad Editor","review":"All in all this was a very good book. All those grammer mistakes was driving me crazy, I can't see how the book got pass any editor, But the story it's self was very good I would have gave it a five star rating if it was typed better, but if your looking for a good read this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to the point!","review":"Overall the book was ok personally I wouldn't recommend it to people I know. Why? because it was too long for the story she spoke about she dragged it too much just get to the point we already know whats going to happen. And the language was too vulgar. I know we all have our slang but she over did it. It's like at times the story was going in circles. Too each its own I wouldn't read it again. Any book that makes me put it down more than once is not worth it. But I finished it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept me on the edge of my seat","review":"This was a great book it kept wanting more and it's ending was phenomainal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodoo tends to be the root of most problems...","review":"This book was GREAT! In reading it, it actually made me think about how selfish and evil women can be and that should be a warning to all the selfish men out there fooling around on their women! I loved everything about this book! Can wait to read more from Sonia."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABC's","review":"I feel really bad writing this review because, as a struggling writer myself, I know how important it is to receive positive feedback, and at the very least, constructive criticism. I will start by saying that the plot was wickedly amusing, with outlandish, over the top characters that you pray you'd never meet in real life. The premise was intriguing. Having said that, I must go on to say that, grammatically speaking, Voodoo Love was the most poorly-written book I have ever read. Misplaced commas had me pausing where I should have plowed through, misspelled words had me reaching for my dictionary every 45 seconds, because , maybe, just maybe, \\"caint\\" is a word? She needs to get an editor - it is worth the money, and her audience will increase 100-fold. The author knows how to tell a good story - she just needs to learn how to write one."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET HELP","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read. The grammatical errors left me feeling like a teacher reading the paper of an eighth grade student. Sonia told a great story but she needs a proof reader and an editor. I must admit she is very brave to release such an unfinished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written!","review":"I fully agree with the other reviews,the grammatical errors in the book is unbelievable! I cannot believe this book actually got published. The author should get her act together before publishing the next novel. Ask the friends she acknowledged to proofread for her, then get a good editor.Borrow a copy, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy plot","review":"Voodoo love was an interesting book. I was very dissapointed with the grammatical errors that were in the book however, the book kept my interest. There were a lot of characters to keep straight. I think the reason why I liked the book was because the plot was unpredictable and somewhat crazy. It made me think of the saying \\"what goes around comes back around."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's voodoo got to do with it?","review":"Darika was a fool from the beginning,before she even thought about going to see the voodoo woman. As for all the other women they were just as foolish, falling all over Keith. The author could have used some of her own advise from the book and taken some English courses. The grammar was horrible. I was insulted that this book was put on sale and was considered okay to buy.Just sell us anything.I had to read this book because it was chosen as a book club selection.I borrowed it from someone,I'm glad I didn't shell out any money for it.In reading some of the other reviews other people agree with me.

Eve's banter with Peabody is hilarious and Peabody is now Eve's partner and comes into her own. Their growth is wonderful, together and apart. Roarke is still wonderful but the passion is tempered somewhat. Friendship comes into big play when Peabody is attacked. The regular players are all there, but Eve is what we read these books for.

This is great series for mystery and who done it book. You feel you are really there with her solving the crimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still a good addition to the series!","review":"If you are a fan of the IN DEATH series like me, this will not be among your favorites. It lacks the edge of a NAKED..., VENGEANCE..., or CONSPIRACY...for example (which are my personal favorites). But still, we know the characters so well, that it is always a pleasure to get the new volume, sit back, and rejoin old friends. I am interested to see how Ms. Robb/Roberts keeps this series going. I believe she has stated that if all the issues were resolved, the series would end. But to keep readers coming back for more, there still has to be new and exciting developments and plots. This volume had nothing new to offer, and I can see how some readers are discouraged. But I still enjoyed it. Does this make sense to anyone out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Again","review":"Once again, I spared no expense by running out on the first day to purchase the new J.D.Robb thriller. With much excitment and anticipation, I sat down in my favorite chair ready to read this new story. Within three pages, I was looking to see if I had maybe bought the wrong book. I could have sworn that I had read these pages before. The interaction between Roarke and Eve was lacking in all areas and Eve seems to have gotten a shot of \\"Glenda the Good Witch.\\" Where is the tough-talking, hard a** detective we know and love? One can only hope that this is an insidious plot by Ms. Roberts that we are unaware of and soon our favorite characters will once again return. This was strike number two, and if the next book is no better I will no longer be reading this series. Concentration is key to a good story and this story was definately lacking:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"While all the previous \\"Death\\" books were excellent with good plot development, witty dialog, and excellent characterization, Ms. Roberts appears to have gotten tired of the series. This book was simply phoned in. The plot line of a serial killer has been done much better. The addition of a psychic did not benefit the story. There was no further development among the relationships of the characters. I can only hope that the next book indicates that Ms. Roberts has rejuveniated her ideas for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci Fi , Mystery , Romance ... Oh My!","review":"I guess I'm hooked. I read everyone of J.D. Robb's books as soon as they make their way to paperback. They are always a quality, gripping read. No exception with this 19th installment.With each book the relationships of the central characters deepen. This novel focuses on Dallas and her relationship with her longtime partner, Detective Peabody. Eve and Roarke continue to harmonize and share adventures.This series of books is solid, and like most mystery readers I appreciate it when the writer takes the time to grow the characters and keep the plot turns interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad dreams","review":"I have been enjoying reading the \\"In Death\\" series of books, but now that I have read 12 of the series I find the repetitiveness of the recurring dreams and dare I say it the constant sex tends to leave not too much new content in the books.If the dreadful nightmares of such a shocking past keep occurring how can Eve go home and screw her husband senseless? I know it is only a book but!!!Aurora"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions in death","review":"This is my first review ever, on anything, so bear with me. I am a recent 'in Death' fan. I have been collecting not only the books, but the audio books as well. I love the author's development of the characters, and their interaction with one another. Visions is one of my absolute favorite. It's great to see Eve begin to allow more and more of her close associates into her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for a Christian","review":"Me.. being a Christian teen, I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read, but kind of short. The one part though that made me not give this book a five is that it was published before his career was over. He said he could now walk away from the game knowing his career was over. (1994). But Hawk actually did come back with the Marlins the next year. It was a good book, and an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Liberating book for gays who are serious about their faith","review":"Michael Piazza makes his case elequently in a book suitible for lay people and clergy alike.

I bought this DVD because we recently got a vehical that has a DVD system in it and instead of only watching junk shows I decided I wanted to try something of learning value so we purchased this one. My daughter loves it and can now tell you what sounds all of the letter make even if they make more that one sounds. I even find myself signing the a,e,i,o,u song and she can recite her vowles no problem. I was only able to sit through the video once, they obviously know what works for a child but as an adult I was ready for it to be over. But as I said my daughter loves it and has watched for the last week every time we get in the car. It has taught her a lot :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 year old","review":"Unfortunately, my five year old was bored with this dvd.

I seem to be the only reviewer that is appalled by one line spoken by the \\"hero\\" of the story. The book focuses on the struggles of a single mom, fleeing a mob-connected father-in-law. The author made the mental, physical and sexual abuse of the \\"heroine\\" a key point in the book. Good story until the end when she and the hero were reunited and he states how often he's thought of seeing her again and \\"raping her sweet a@@.\\" WHAT????!@!!@@?? Are you kidding me? There is NEVER an occasion when this comment should be used as a joke or an endearment.

This is a very well thought out design. The extendable comb is designed in such a way that it catches the hairs while its cutting, so they don't fall on the floor. Very nice! I have tried others for the same price and they do not cut/trim properly. The blades are just not sharp enough. This one cuts without any problem. It is made very strong and you can tell that it is very well designed and was tested well before production.For about 20 bucks, you cannot find a hair trimmer then this. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Clumsy","review":"Only good for those that can figure out exactly how much hair will come off with the settings of the two trimmers.

Whether it be a song, a dance, or a good old fashioned joke.The months of workshops and sessions all lead up to the final performance which will leave you truly inspired"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but would not ship them in the summer","review":"This product is awesome. The only problem is that I would not have them shipped in the summer! They can only take temperatures of 100 degrees or more for 24 hours. If it is 85 or 90 degrees the formula could be exposed to 100 degree temperatures which would spoil the formula. Just be careful"},{"rating":"1","title":"10 bottles were broken","review":"I will never order this product again from Amazon. I mean, our daughter loves this formula, and it's very useful when you aren't home and need to feed your baby.

I suppose they should use a special packaging for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the nipples?","review":"Bringing baby home from the hospital we thought we'd get a pack of these so we didn't have to make bottles right away.

What's the point???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for supplementing","review":"I love these little bottles. My baby would not take formula AT ALL and upon suggestion bought these and she loved them. I use the $5 off coupons that similac mails me and buy apack for only $1.67.

We did not nurse so we continued to use these for two weeks until they became too small for our daughter as she is up to 3 + ounces per feeding after two weeks. The only negative is that each box of 8 only comes with one nipple. She does have some re flux and gas however I can not say it is because of the formula make up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So handy!","review":"After diapers & wipes, these are the most important thing in my diaper bag! I'm breastfeeding my son, but we supplement with this formula so my husband can feed the baby (I don't always have enough pumped for a bottle) and for convenience. It is very helpful to have a bottle handy when I'm waiting at the register at the supermarket and the baby is crying to be fed. I love these little, ready-made bottles because they are the perfect size and there is no mixing needed - just shake, open, screw on a nipple, and feed the baby.These don't come with nipples, but you can use regular bottle nipples or get disposable nipples separately. You can buy about 50 disposable Similac nipples from the Abbott store online or use Enfamil disposable nipples (I've used these - they fit fine), which they sell on Amazon.com in packs of 10 or 25.I have two nipples in a ziplock bag and 4 bottles in my diaper bag at all times. There are cheaper feeding options, but for convenience I can't recommend these enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"Item came on time.

I am breastfeeding my 6 mo old baby but starting to wind down a little. With just 2 ounces, they are great for supplementing without filling him up too much.

Easy to program and use, and you can see your weight and body fat percentages. BUT - turn the scale off, and then step on it again. I guarantee you will see different numbers-sometimes off by 1 or even 2 pounds! And how can a person's body weight suddenly jump by 4 percent?! Move the scale to another side of the bathroom. (Yes, we all do this!) Totally different reading than the previous two. I'm giving it two stars because it's always within 2 pounds or so, but boy, is it frustrating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the coolest!","review":"This is a great scale and well worth the very reasonable price. Easy to program, and the readout is big enough for me to read. The instruction book is clearly written and explains why fat percentage readings seem to fluctuate depending on the time of day. I get my most consistent readings around bedtime. It weighs me a tad heavier than my old scale (bummer), but that's MY problem! This scale will definitely be a help in my fitness/diet program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Bought this scale 3-4 years ago and it still works like a charm.

The thing could not make up its mind what weight we have. The digits run riot. Only twice did it give a final figure. All other times we could stand minutes and minutes on the scale, and it kept blinking digits. What is going on? No discussion of this problem in the instructions, nor on the website of the manufacturer. We've sent it back, and are waiting for its replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"bogus system completely innacurate","review":"I did a little test to see if this thing was for real. It is not.Set the system for my weight and height and it said my body fat content was 25%. I then used the same settings and held 40 pounds of steel weights. The scale said my fat content was 36%. The weights had no fat in them. the scale assumed that 93% of the additional weight was fatI then said my height was 9 inches taller than I actually am. It said my body fat content was 12%. My actual fat content did not change. I told the computer I was 5 inches shorter than I actually am and it said my fat content was 31%Obviously the scale is only using a simple algorithm to determine optimum weight for each height and then assumes any additional weight is fat. This is erroneous. A football linebacker has a different body build than a marathoner. Even if they had the same body fat, this scale would tell them they were different.A bogus gimmick. Do not trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience with this purchase","review":"I bought one BF682 and two BF792 for holiday gifts while they have promotion on Tanita. Unfortunately, I received all three scales were opened box.The BF682 is work properly but the bottom on top is not that smooth when pressed, so I requested for exchange. The exchanged one is opened box either and it has the same problem as the first one.Two BF792 have problems with the fat %. I've tried 15 times on the first one, only 3 times showed the fat %, they are 8%, 18% & 23%. I've tired 10 times on the second one, none of them showed the fat %. Of course, I requested for exchange. The exchanged scales are also opened box. They work fine although the bottom is not smooth.Since I have no time to buy another gifts, therefore, I keep all three opened box scales. I was extremely angry and disappointed with this purchase. Amazon, do you have quality control on all stuffs that you sale? From this bad experience, I am scare to buy electronic from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further then a Tanita...","review":"This is just an absolutely wonderful scale. It is always the same every single time I hop on it, unlike my other digital scales I have had in the past. When you are losing weight, it is very encouraging to see a .2 lb loss which is one of the features of this scale. I kinda wonder about the BF% though but it gets close and doesn't vary much. I have no complaints at all with this scale. The memory feature for the the body fat for 2 people is a must have. I actually am glad you can't see your last weigh in on this scale because if you are like most, you don't want just anyone going in your bathroom and finding out your exact weight! Not to mention my own husband!

This is wonderful book for that purpose. You will not ever forget reading this little gem. One could almost laugh at the ruthlessness of it, except if you read it again when you approach 50, you realize - very sadly - that some people you've worked with (perhaps someone who tried to destroy your career) actually live by these rules. A great book on the introduction to power (as - of course - was the book from which it was drawn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is insightful and ruthless.","review":"This is a very cruel book. It turns Machiavelli's words into childrens' words, and what he said is insightful and ruthless. As you might know, Niccolo Machiavelli, known as the father of political science, lived in Florence, Italy between 1469 and 1527. This book was based on another book by him, The Prince, which was in adult language and converted to little people talk in this book. This book was full of cruel proverbs such as, \\"If you just took over someplace, have a bunch of friends from your old neighborhood go live there too. People won't even notice that these old friends of yours are actually your spies.\\" Even though it was cruel, this book was extremely funny in the sense that this is in child's language (such as \\"'cos or 'specially\\") and it is so wrong. It really made me laugh, and it would probably do the same thing to you. I especially liked where it said something about people being scared of you but not hating you. Nathaniel Hillard, age 11"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"When I first read about this book I was very excited, but reality fell far short of my expectations. The text is in an awkward script font and the attempt to convey Machiavelli's concepts to an audience of \\"children\\" is stilted and insluting. The illustrations are garish, ugly reproductions from classic children's books (such as Alice in Wonderland) and rarely corrolate to the maxim they are meant to depict. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to speak Korean, learn Korean","review":"This book has good intentions, but unfortunately falls very short. There are things about Korean pronunciation and grammar that romanization cannot convey. Although this book may be decent for a tourist who wants to be able to ask for basic things at a department store or restartaunt, it is completely inadequate, even as an introduction, for someone who wishes to truly speak Korean.As someone who can speak, read, and write Korean, my advice to you is that if you want to speak Korean you should learn Hangul and Korean grammar. It is difficult at first, but once you do that you will find that you can learn and speak more effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Trying to use this book to actually communicate with Koreans is a painful process. All of the translated text is in Romanized format. The Romanizations are not standard either. At best, Korean pronunciation is difficult to express in English characters but the method used in this book guarantees that Koreans won't have any idea what you're trying to say. Futhermore, because the writers don't print anything in Hangul, you couldn't even show Koreans the book to get them to understand. Buy Barron's \\"Korean at a Glance\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"You shouldn't like this book, even if you do.","review":"The main part of this book is an alphabetized list of English words, together with their Romanized Korean equivalents. For each word, there are a few phrases using that word, also Romanized in their translation.I have two major grievances:1. An English-Korean dictionary could provide most of the services which this book provides, and more.It is hard to figure out what was the intended purpose of this book. We all know what grammar books, phrase books, and dictionaries are, but what is this?2. After a student becomes fairly proficient in Korean, that student will develop a repugnance for Romanized Korean. That's why I say that \\"You shouldn't like this book, even if you do.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A very basic book that might not be enough to get by with...","review":"It provides a list of several words that you would need if you were in a primarily Korean-speaking area, and provides a couple examples of sentences that you would use them in, both in Korean and in English, but it leaves several important phrases out that might end up becoming very useful. It probably would be sufficient for any quick trip where you wouldn't need much, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"fulfills its purpose","review":"This book never claimed to be a comprehensive guide to the Korean language. I'll be going to Korea to work soon, and I needed a guide with a fun approach, so that the task of learning conversational Korean wouldn't be so daunting. The book claims to offer \\"a basic introduction to Spoken Korea or just a few words to get by on a trip.\\" It helped me to overcome the phobia of learning a new language, so I believed it fulfilled its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"Displays some of the weaker print and broadcast advertising of 1998.

I was actually happy to find how sturdy these hard plastic pieces are. No breaking, tearing, or biting parts off.

Even guests must enter their gender, age, and height before stepping on it. And because it does not run on a calendar, you must manually change your programmed age, if you so choose. Because of the required programming feature, I cannot weigh packages on it, unless I first enter some bogus info. Thus, I have another scale in the house that I use far more often.Final word: If knowing your approximate body fat percentage is of high importance to you, get this scale. Otherwise, go with something a cheaper and more user-friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPENSIVE SCALE","review":"I bought this scale because of the reviews. There is no way this scale measures fat. According to Tanita my BM is 28, but even though I have lost 16 lbs the scale shows me at a healthy weight, but my fat at 41.5, which is where it was when I started. I feel all I have is a pricey scale, not a fat monitor, which is what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This is written with heart by Marilyn's half sister. It is a view into Marilyn's life we have not otherwise seen. It correlates very much with the book by Marilyn's assistant Lena Pepitone \\"Marilyn Confidential\\". I loved the book. Marilyn's sister loved her and knew her story from the inside. Who knew she had a sister? It is not mainstream information. I really enjoyed the humanity it gives Marilyn. She was thoughtful and sweet. Interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very inaccurate and dis-jointed","review":"I was extremly disgusted with the book. There was substance to it. Just rambling thoughts strung together ina desperate attempt to make money off some weak memories. Obviously, Marilyn was not close to her half- sister. The book jumps back and forth between the childhood years to 1962. It's a shameful attempt to exploit Marilyn. Books worth reading : Joseph Jasgur's \\"The Birthof Marilyn\\" by Joseph Jasgur and Jeannie Sako"},{"rating":"2","title":"A moment of sheer nostalgic pleasure","review":"I purchased this book as a birthday gift for an old friend with whom I grew up in the fifties. And it did not disappoint. While many who watched this king of the bad men throughout his black-hatted career might not remember his name, they certainly would recall his face. I highly recommend it as an adventure back in time and a great opportunity to see the real Roy Barcroft apart from the actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Cars is not for beginners or the squeamish!","review":"This book tried to cover alot of the major Die-cast cars, Matchbox, Johnny Lightings etc., but the Early Hot Wheel info was what I was most into and that was fun and I learned alot of stuff I never would have known otherwise. The beginners tips are a must for collectors expierienced and new. The variations are countless on these cars and would be impossible to list all of them, however if you collect only the 'Redline Years' of hot wheels it's a pleasure to see these cars and it's a good companion to other books you may have. Photos of rare color combo's and proto-types are cool. For the hard core Redline collectors only."},{"rating":"1","title":"not vary good for finding cars","review":"no index, very few pictures, no discriptions of cars or variations of cars . it has a lot of cars listed by the year and prices for them. vary hard to find a car you are looking for if you dont know the year ,make or model"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed that i spent the money/time on it.","review":"I was very disturbed that there was very few pictures to show the vehicles. How is a collector new or old supposed to know what the vehicles, colors, and vairiations are..? to top it all off many vehicles i found weren't even listed, but then again you are never given the opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This is a very good book about the truth of a little who is in bad shape and then made it throuth with help. And parents who are willing to give for their little girl who is having a hard time and can't see or hear and speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! A Must Buy!","review":"I really thought this was a great book. It gives you an idea of what some people struggle through in life. Definitely read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Daughter needed this book for school so I bought it here on Amazon, it arrived in time and who doesn't love a classic. Good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaaarrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhh !!!!!","review":"An inspiring story, but a difficult book to trudge through. I never have enjoyed reading the scripts for modern plays - it's so much better to watch them being performed. I'm not sure that either of the Hollywood films has really captured the essence of the story, but watching them is certainly more enjoyable than reading this book. The only way we could get my daughter through it (for a 6th grade assignment) was by reading it out aloud and giving the characters ridiculous accents (for example, Captain Keller became a pirate). Only get this book from the library, and even then, only if you have an assignment to do !"},{"rating":"1","title":"#NAME?","review":"I found this novel to differ wildly from william gibson's excellent \\"cyberpunk\\" novels...Neuromancer, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, etc. It's really hard to believe the work is written by the man who gave us the gritty prose of \\"Idoru\\" and the amazing Artificial Intelligence characters of \\"Neuromancer\\". The book is historical in nature, but unlike \\"The Difference Engine\\" (in which John Keats falls in with Charles Babbage and devises a mechanical computer) _the events happen exactly as they might have in the real world!_ There is no alternate history, no fanciful imaginings, nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a CyberPunk Book","review":"This book is not a CyberPunk book. I thought it was and bought it, but it turned out to be about some deaf, dumb, and blind chick. This book does not mention computers, exotic drugs, or bleak urban decay. It may be a good book if you like deaf, dumb, and blind people - but I'm not into that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A four star good reading book to read.\\"","review":"This book was assigned to me to read in High School for my English class. When I first saw this book my first inpression was that it was about alittle baby which when grew up was going to become one of the greatest workers. Then i started reading it and found it interested. I really recomend this book for people to read it's a really good book to read in a way it relates to your life if you have someone in your life that relates to the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly inadequate","review":"The book fails to provide adequate information required to perform its own problems! If this book were to actually *explain* the material in a straightforward fashion, the problems would be feasible to accomplish without referring to other sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I have ever seen","review":"This book is the worst! First the are very few example problems, in fact I found myself in the library checking out other circuits book, because this one had no expiations or examples for a problem included in its text. Once I did learn how to solve the circuit; I had no way to check my answers, because there isn't any student's solution manual available. Lastly and most aggravating, and the reason I urge you not to buy this book... The answers in the back are wrong! To my estimates (and I am not exaggerating,) about 1:3 or wrong, or have errors in one form or another. How is a student supposed to learn if his/her answers are correct? but the book tells you otherwise. Please do not use this book; it is useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifth Edition had answers in the back of the book","review":"I went through my introductory class using the older edition, which had answers in the back of the book to most of the questions!!Why are there no answers in the back of this book? It's the instructors job to make learning circuits challenging, not the author...and I wish my school had stayed with the older version.Someone needs to provide a copy to some of the answers to the end-of-the chapter problems, FOR FREE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an introductory book","review":"I used this book during my freshman year as an ECE student. The book is too complicated for the novice engineer. At the end of each section is 1 or 2 examples that have complete instruction and pretty much hold your hand. The end of the chapter problems are too complicated, and in the back of the book, only a third of the answers are given so you don't know if your answers to most odd and even numbered problems are correct...what on earth? The author is probably counting on individuals contacting their instructors, which is a bad idea given that my instructor was anything but instructional. And he refused to give answers or even look at my even numbered problems. NOTE TO AUTHOR: Have appropriate level of reader proof read your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"be aware","review":"Anybody who buys this book should be aware of tons of very poorly designed homework problems in the 7th edition. Although the other features of this book are okay, it still is lacking in pedagogical relevance to the beginning student. Though the latter is to be the main audience. This is, in my personal view, very unfortunate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solved Problems?","review":"This book has minimal solved problems. Of the few problems that are solved, the author fails to provide any thought or steps used to solved the problem. He simply believes it will suffice to simply give you the answer without any reasoning or background. I would not recommend this book to learn circuit analysis"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst textbook ever!","review":"If this book were not required for my electronics class, I would burn it; not resell it and expose another poor individual to the worst textbook ever. This book must have been written by a committee. There is an absolute disconnect between the materials in the text and ALL of the examples, assessment problems, and chapter problems. I spend more time referencing other materials to make up for the breath-taking absence of content. The additional materials that come with the book, (online tools) are equally worthless! If you are required to use this book, I recommend that you contact your professor and petition him or her to change textbooks. It's not fair to you to have to spend hundreds of dollars on such a worthless learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that must have imaginary rating","review":"How could one become a good electrical engineer after reading this mess?I have to rely on books from the 90s to understand the material better.Definitely should be burned, no doubt about it."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],O={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-42c83014"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/43.md","filePath":"guide/43.md"}'),N={name:"guide/43.md"},P=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
