If anything I am into Rock from the late 60s, 70s, and early 80s: The Who, Rick Wakeman, Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, etc. (plus the unclassifiable Frank Zappa) What I like about Soda Stereo, and this album in particular, is that it is rich and subtle at the same time - blending traditional Rock sounds with original variations. It is unfortunate that Gustavo Cerati's creative days are most likely over: he was hit by a stroke right after a concert and has been in a come for months now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Powerful","review":"This a record that has not been out performed by any other latin band or Soda Stereo. In a way, it is the point of reference for many casual latin rock fans on Soda's music.The most striking aspect of this recording is how simple and straight foward these songs are. The instrumentation is perhaps the most guitar oriented in Soda's recording career. Zeta (bass) and Charly (drums) layed down a extremely solid foundation for Cerati's guitar to come foward. This recording offers a set of songs that have become standards for a Soda Stereo live performance such as the title track, De Musica Ligera, Hombre al Agua, Un Millon de años luz, etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant romp with Rock and Paula","review":"This is a lighthearted enjoyable story of a fishing supplies expert and author who hates fish and has never fished a day in his life.

The anticipation did not live up to the actual viewing experience!The editing of this film \\"classic\\" is akin to watching a movie on TNT. I constantly wondered, \\"What was cut to allow for the extra 16 minutes of commercials?\\" The Paula Prentiss character seemed to suffer the most at the hands of heavy editting, as I struggled to determine why she had a hate-hate-love relationship with the Rock Hudson character, or why he responded the way he did.This was certainly not the comedic romp I was so higly anticipating, and will probably never have another showing in this house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"I agree with the reviewers who didn't care for this picture.

I would rescind this review in a heartbeat, and give him the five stars I'd like to, if a single thing he said was verifiable; but as it turns out, most of the book is in direct contradiction to simple logic.Instead, I recommend reading something that will provide a toolkit for the establishment of the insight necessary for personally verifiable results, like Vivekananda's Raja yoga, or any meditation manual, at all, ever.

I WANT to believe the beautiful teachings here. The messages make sense to me about the journey to either place being totally up to me and how I live my life. I hope I can hang onto the pictures given me by this book so I can make those choices with the end in mind of what the Lord may offer me if I live my life in a loving way.

Maltin is a critic who isn't afraid to state his true opinion. Sonme criticts think that if a movie makes no sense, they need to look smart and talk about how brilliant it is, while Maltin will just say, \\"It makes no sense.\\" Maltin is also a critic who appreciates the value of widescreen (there's even a widescreen guide on different aspect ratios in the book!) and will say when a movie must be viewed in letterbox format. He's clearly a man who appreciates great cinema and this 2004 guide features a very cool section about excellent films that have been forgotten. Some people complain that they don't agree with Maltin, but any mature person would realize we all have our opinions and whether yours and a critics' are the same is no reason to bash that critic.

I realize that many of the best of the year do not come out until November/December, but if Mr. Maltin can't get an advance copy to review he should delay publication until he can include at least some of the top 25 and/or Golden Globe/Academy Award nominee's.

Some of his ratings are fair and accurate, but lots are unfair and vague as to why he gave them the rating. Example: He gave Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, one of the best movies ever made, only a 2 1/2 out of 4 stars, the same, I might add, as the animated version of Thumbelina, or as my younger sister likes to call it, \\"the stupid one with the pink-haired frogs and George Washington chickens\\". He is also totally obsessed with Disney animated movies. Don't get me wrong, they're great and I love them, but he gives them all 3 stars, practically no diversity, so don't waist your time looking them up.

Awesome.The games they included?Come on!If you are going to include a Portland game, include the 1985 game with the greatest buzzer beater ever. That game was awesome. It was epic. It was huge.I agree with his 60 point game. He was hitting all kinds of shots.

The book is written as a large comic strip wich makes it very enterntaining and at times alsmot like you are watching a movie.

Again the sound quality is great. All the other cheaper radios I looked at in the stores, didn't compare to this.

There are many other songs on it and many singles are missing. There are [still!] no CDs of all his singles. The songs not on other CDs could have fit on part of one CD. I don't know why they did this thing. I don't know about anyone else, but I'd also like to hear his real voice without all the digital monkeying. The music is the point that matters, so I'm sorry to tell you the criticism I'm seeing is on the mark. I guess people are finally noticing these record people fiddled around to long.

It tells about mysteries of the 20th century, as the title says, which is a very broad topic. Thus people with different interests can enjoy it, as the description of each is quite short- 2 or 3 pages- and the subjects vary from murders to disasters to spontaneous combustion. The writing style is suspenseful and mysterious sounding in most of the entries, which is appropriate for this kind of book, and is easy to follow. Not very good for reading at one stretch, it is more the kind of thing you would leave on your nightstand or coffee table to read one or two chapters whenever you get a chance. Also good for sudden changes of conversation. Most people will probably like it, but the ones who don't will really hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - it is big!","review":"From the photo, I thought this would be a smaller butterflynet but it is big enough to catch other lightweight creatures.

And for the 30 minutes it took me to find a handle that would more or less fit this net.However. . .my net had a rip in it that had obviously been repaired before mailing it out, making my net a second rather than first quality product.Add to that the fact that the net was mailed in a flimsy cellophane covering, no box, no protection whatsoever for the net.I am not a happy camper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great net","review":"I like the net.

Seems like that ought to be clearly stated in the product description. The low-quality packaging provides no protection, so be prepared for a warped net. While the net is big, it is very hard to catch (and keep) something since the net does not close over. There were many inexpensive nets to choose from when I was shopping, and I am sorry I picked this one.

I paid 150 bucks for what has become a giant paperweight. It works great with WinXP. It really is a great product!!

The concept of metabolic programming is forward thinking, but the concept of giving a baby what it needs from day one is common sense.

There are plenty of shoot-outs and gunplay and a few opportunities for Rayne to use her swords. Actually the vampire themes seem to be a natural extension of the violence of the wild west, or at least the wild west as seen in Italian spaghetti westerns.

If you're curious about this movie because of the \\"Hott Chicks\\" as one of the other 'reviewers' said, well, thats what we have the internet for. Don't see it!

She did carry a gun in the game but nothing like this six shooter she carries in this movie. Next the guys she fought Rayne would easily despense of these clowns.Next when ever she was weak she could easily feed on her enemies to regain her strength. As far as martial arts she didn't use any in this movie.THe first one was more entertaining than this even though they butchered it too. Furtehermore anyone who plays the game that she can't come near water it burns her skin instantly. i could go all day long about things they left out about her acrobatic abilities they should have included but it won't do this movie no justice. If you gonna do a movie about a game character at least geta a better depth look into the character damn!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This movie is just as bad as the first. Or maybe just a smidge better. Just a tiny little bit better. Yeah. The first one was completely abysmal, and so saying this movie is just a tiny bit better isn't saying much. The only thing that added ANY interest to this dreck is that it was set in the Old West. This movie is a drag to watch, and is almost laughable at how contrived it is. At least there was a different actor for Rayne, since the one in the first Bloodrayne was just awful. At least the actress for this film was better than the one who played Rayne in the first, but that's not saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGHH","review":"This is a movie you really should not buy or watch.

This was another tragedy concocted by boll. another movie that I believe could be good with many sequels if they had just let someone make it besides boll..he is the worst...do not buy or watch this...I repeat!!

Rayne is a great character and the game story line entertaining. To my disappointment nothing that I enjoyed about the game has translated with the films. The first is barely passable as a film. It was still a dog, but showed that with better acting and action, the promise of a great film translation.The second film fails on every point made above. It is worst if that is possible then the first. Acting is very very poor. The storyline is boring to tears.It is sad that what could have been great films have been butchered so badly. If you are a fan of the games, beware you will be extremely disappointed with the second film. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Some day I hope someone gives Rayne the film treatment she deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uwe Boll has done it again!","review":"Everyone should know that UWE BOLL is the WORLD'S WORST FILM-MAKER. His movies are worse than direct-to-DVD films. Now that you have that knowlege, let me divulge to you that you should STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE or any Boll flick. If you've had the wonderful opprotunity to not watch the first Bloodrayne, well, here's another time to not watch the sequel. Uwe Boll can't make films and this movie shows it. The action is well...not choreographed, the actor's are not even acting, prostitues are hired as extras and there is little or no story. Oh and more thing, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VIDEO GAMES! Boll's films are mostly game-to-movie adaptaions but they're never based on the game. So, in short STAY AWAY FROM UWE BOLL FILMS!!! YOU'LL LIVE A BETTER LIFE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloodrayne 2","review":"I only paid 3 bucks for this and that was still \\"expensive\\" in terms of how much this film is worth. Try 50 cents if anything. I fell asleep during the film but maybe I was just tired to begin with but then Bloodrayne 2 was boring. It is really rare for me to rate a movie low and more so to not enjoy it. If I had her weapons, I'd be using them non-stop and her she is only using them, if not just one of her blades for a very short time. It's mostly just shootings and some blood here and there. I didn't care for any of the characters or plot. Bloodrayne is a bad ass videogame and Rayne is mighty fine so it's sad when the films stink. I dunno why Uwe Boll sucks at directing and hasn't discovered it yet. I hope they remake Bloodrayne into the gory, nasty, sexy film it's suppose to be. I respect Uwe Boll for all his films and work but he really needs to try harder so he can make a movie that can earn more than a 2 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"campy vampy western","review":"This is a B-movie, nothing more, and on that level it was successful.

I've no regrets about buying the set (I also bought seasons 5 and 6 and the episode that was released separately), but my viewing pleasure would be greatly enhanced if the DVDs had closed captioning. Given that the series is not that old, I was completely surprised that I couldn't access captions. Other than that (to me, significant) complaint about the set, the series is wonderful!

It was very refreshing to read about these people, and Mr.Strickland shed some new light on a sometimes confusing era. The same cannot be said for his handling of the minimalist painters.

This thesaurus will not improve your writing a great deal. It seems as if words are only included if they are in very common usage today. Who needs a thesaurus if it will only mirror the blandness that surrounds us? MW also sticks to words that are exact synonyms as if thesaurus users do not like to wander into subtle shades of meaning. I consider the MW thesaurus a waste of money.

Some words have examples of proper usage in a sentence - but I would have been more satisfied if all the words had it. Not a big problem for me since I tend to look up words as soon as I see them in an article (is'nt that one of the main reasons that you get a CDROM version of the dictionary - so that you dont slack off?!).

Smith focuses on more powerful and also more complicated methods available within CS2. [Though as an aside, the moniker CS2 seems so clumsy. Like an HP product label.]Of these, perhaps one of the most powerful ideas is layers. That you can compose an image out of several layers. Where each layer can essentially be manipulated independently of the others. And the objects in a layer can thence be moved around, relative to another layer, until you get a satisfactory juxtaposition.It is worth your time to thoroughly study what Smith has to say about layers. Because without layers, an image is often no more than a collection of coloured pixels. Layers are like object oriented programming, to use a rough analogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was misled!","review":"How misleading.

His Mr. G will be familiar as a slightly more sociopathic version of the narcissistic Drama teacher found all over the world -- men with exaggerated perceptions of their own strengths as performers and with little or no skill at teaching. His alpha female student Ja'mie is as painful as she is accurate, and is a lesson in the powerful charisma of the mean and selfish.

Of the three main characters, Jonah Takalua is the most fleshed-out and original. A Tongan by birth, he struggles with his ethnicity, his illiteracy and his standing as a breakdancer.

My personal favourite is Mr.G, the drama teacher, whos ego is as large as Aussie itself. This one isnt really for the kids though.

Most of Kenny's albums are very nice. A lot are on the bluesy side of the jazz fence. He's always a very tasteful player, gets a great tone, and always seems to maintain a deep connection to the blues. I remember one guitarist describing Kenny as spinning jazz lines that phrase like speech patterns. I believe that's true, and adds to the great warmth and humanity that his playing projects.

If you want an authoritive development book, join the queue because this one is a waste of money.

I have to say that this CD is worth it. It doesan't matter if you like Keanu Reeves or not. I am still tryin to decide if that is him singing on \\"Enemies\\" but I may never be able to.

These guys are very good! Brett Domrose's soulful lyrics are backed by the strong rhythmic stylings of Robert Mailhoue & Keanu Reeves, and combined they produce a musical offering which is powerful in it's simplicity.I'll be honest - I heard all the jokes and snide comments about 'vanity bands' and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, this band's quality speaks for itself. I was not disappointed. The work stands up great as a whole but I found 'Cornerstore' to be an exceptional ballad and I caught myself humming Halo after the first listening. The fact that their cover of 'Superstar' is excellent has been mentioned more than once so I'll just add my accolades to the others.There's a reason why the Dogstar shines brightest in the night sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"The band, Dogstar, has an amazingly great sound.

Even considered giving it a one star rating.This really is a creep show in western dress.If you enjoy watching people on peyote trips, people eating flesh, crazies that speak to the dead, women dying from child birth, the misery of severe alcohol addiction, and suffering; you might like this movie.To top it all off it has a really cheesy soundtrack too!!!!The story is.... well I don't think there is a story here other than to illustrate a sadistic view on death and life.Thomas Milan plays a brief part... no doubt to use his name to sell the movie... and does his character well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Spaghetti Oddity","review":"Of the large body of Italian westerns, many are largely forgotten. For every Sergio Leone, there would have been a dozen or more contenders. Four of the Apocalypse is a real oddity; but one that should be seen by any afficianado of the genre.

I applaud it for it's mostly UN-western approach being a tale of four individuals traveling from a dangerous situation in one town with literally the clothes on their back to the next and their encounters along the way.Chief of which is Tomas Milian's Chaco playing the role of the Western equivalent of a deranged psycho hitchhiker. This is when the film is at it's best, but alas all too briefly.After this high the movie seemed to drag for me until the no-surprise finale that could have been done better.There was a lot of build-up to this I had either heard or read. Like most items of the type you need to see them for yourself. \\"Great Silence\\" measured up...\\"Four of the Apocalypse\\" didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!","review":"This movie is an absolute mess. You thought Fulci's horror entries made little sense or were disconnected? Wait to you waste an hour and 45 minutes watching this atrocity. If this is going to be your first foray into the world of Spaghetti Westerns, please, please put the disc back in it's case and get something else, anything but The Four Of The Apocalypse. If you like snail paced movies, if you like westerns with horrific folky/countryish music with lyrics, if you like watching animals die on film, if you enjoy finger paint bloody gore then this movie is for you. If you like excitement, if you like a good Ennio Morricone type scores, if you like clear direction, if you like interesting storylines then this movie is not for you. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an apocolpyse??","review":"I think Fulci put that in the title (or however it translates to in Italian) to capitalize on his yet as unrealized desire to create superb horror. Westerns were not his forte' There is some violence, but it goes out of it's way to be gratuitous. There is an annoying song that is used throughout half of the movie. There is a kickass villian who sould've gotten more screen time. And there is loads of Fulcian nilhism that both the story and this view could've done without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Owing to the fact that i am a huge Fulci fan i was very excited about seeing Four of the apocalypse. I have enjoyed a wide spectrum of his movies including the beyond, conquest, house by the cemetary, city of the living dead, new york ripper, contraband, lizard in a womans skin, dont torture a duckling etc etc.Unfortunately with four of the apocalypse,i was very disappointed. The acting is good and im a fan of Fabio Testi but the pace is slow and plodding, the soundtrack awful and there is very little of Fulcis signature violence to speak of !Worth a look but for Fulci completists only, I would certainly recommend renting this first before you buy it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Cartridge","review":"When I received this product, the back was opened and one of the cartridges was gone.

I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real. It seems possible that Gillette may be letting go of some of their quality.Sorry all but the blades suck.

The outcome is pretty amazing. I have not noticed any reduction in braking power (as good as OEM), linear brake response, virtually no brake noise (quieter than OEM), far less brake dust (have not washed my rims since the brake job, but still very clean).

I't wholesome enough for children, so it would make good bedtime reading.

This thoroughly enjoyable epic tale has the reader begging for the second and third installment of Jack's adventure quests. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all","review":"The book i read was The Sea of Trolls. The author is Nancy Farmer. This book is a fantasy. It is about a young boy named jack who is kidnapped by berzerkers with his young sister lucy. He makes his journy towards the berzerker home on there viking ship. On this whole journy jack trains to become a bard, with help of a skald (viking bard) and by a bard in his village. In this story they fight ther way through glory and through the evils of there world.I thought taht this book was a pretty good book, It is for people of ages of 12 to any age beacause of all the violence and details that is put into the fighting.

This is one of the best books I've ever read and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read and fairly accurate","review":"I commend Nancy for writting a young adult novel with a Viking theme. Certainly she did her research and I would say was about 90% accurate for most of the book. Some historical facts were embellished on for drama. One has to keep in mind that this book focuses on a very narrow aspect of the Viking culture, the Berserkers. And in that does not represent the whole sum of the Vikings (who were not all a bunch of mindless brutes).I'm 28 and I enjoyed the book. It flowed fairly well and was an easy read. I sometimes I had to stretch my imagination to visualize a place Nancy was describing, as it could be a little vague.It is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting fantasy","review":"Nancy Farmer's \\"Sea of Trolls was a delight. It is a saga filled with adventure, intrigue, fantasy, and just the right balance of humor to keep young minds engaged. It's a hefty tome and reading the first few chapters to your kids will get them hooked and motivated to continue reading this classic on their own. I found it to be a compelling and totally charming read.

I found \\"Sea of Trolls\\" to be totally enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farmer Delivers Again","review":"I read \\"House Of Scorpions\\" a while back, and Nancy Farmer's skill at depicting real people shines.

Lucy, of course, is a spoiled brat who \\"knows she was adopted\\" and is waiting for a knight to carry her back to her \\"parents\\". Her living in a daydream world makes life worse for Jack when in trying to save her from the Viking marauders, she calls out to them because she thinks them to be her rescuing knights.This kind of clever detail makes \\"The Sea Of Trolls\\" more than just an adventure story about apprentice Bard Jack.The other reviews here mention a lot of the story, but there are many levels to this book, and can be read on several levels.I'm looking for more Nancy Farmer books. This one was a pleasure.--Jerry Wright"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing fantasy","review":"If you can't find a book to read or you are just waiting for another book to come out, read The Sea of Trolls. It is a good book of fantasy and action. Nancy Farmer has done a good job just as she has in The House of the Scorpian and The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm.Jack is taken out of the protection of the Bard when he and his sister are kidnapped by berserkers, people who are half wolf/half man. When they finally arrive at the safety of a castle Jack is set out on a quest to find Mimir's Well with his friend Thorgil.

I thought the author did a great job in writing a fast-paced story with interesting, fairly well-rounded characters. I enjoy 3-D characters who are neither good nor bad, and this book contained a number of them. This book also contains enough serious danger and violence to interest adult readers -- it's not \\"cute\\" at all.All in all, a fun book that read strangely like fact, even with the mythology thrown in. Another reviewer commented that this book wasn't up to par with Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. I won't argue with that: the Prydain books are classics and a favorite of mine.

I recently switched from the Mach 3 Turbo to a Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor and I can safely say I will never go back. The Mach 3 provides a decent enough shave (much better than an electric, in my experience) but the single blade is actually much smoother.

Certainly, one of the frustrations of the author of this remarkable text must be that people just don't seem to \\"GET IT\\"; indeed, given the volumnous detail and the magnitude of ethical/moral reflections woven throughout the glorious fabric of this composition, Carroll must agonize, daily, that her message has fallen upon deaf ears. But I'm pretty sure I understand exactly what she's trying to shout and whisper to the world in which she lives.The dinosaurs continue to disappear as time moves on. The dead don't care and the ones who think they're living have it so pitifully wrong, most times. And the anguish of a broken heart still recognizes no metes-or-bounds.Read this book. Then, go back and study it. Put away those things that really don't matter for a while. Jordan Carroll deserves your attention. She certainly has mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not for everyone.","review":"If you don't play or worship the guitar, don't consider buying this album. Simple as that. Then again, if you do one of those things, you are in for a treat.Steve Morse (of Dixie Dregs, Kansas and Deep Purple fame) serves a cocktail of instrumental rock music in the compositional and guitar styles of his own idols: Derailleur Gears (Cream, Eric Clapton), Well, I have (Jimi Hendrix), TruthOla (Jeff Beck, but also Eric Johnson and even Alex Lifeson (Rush)), Migration (Roger McGuinn, Byrds), Led On (Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page), The White Light (John McLaughlin), How does it feel? (Keith Richards, Rolling Stones), Bring it to me (Mountain, Leslie West), Something Gently Weeps (Beatles, George Harrison), Free In The Park (Allman Brothers Band, Duane Allman, Dickey Betts, BB King), Prognosis (Kansas, Kerry Livgren, Yes, Steve Howe).I bought it, not as a fan of Morse particularly, but because of the guitarists he honours, and wasn't disappointed. A beautiful homage indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"morse fest","review":"Great,great album. For those who likes guitar, there is the funny game of trying to discover which guitar hero style is Steve Morse playing on each song, but also as always these are great original compositions from one of the best composers which casually plays guitar.For those who just simply likes good music, this is probably the most easyly accesible album from Steve, but as I said, great guitars and compositions as always.Great job also from Dave Larue, one bassist which should be more recognised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up to usual high standard","review":"Steve Morse has kept his latest release up to his usual standard. Even though each track relates one big influence of his, they all retain a very big Morse flavour. His bandmates Dave LaRue (Bass) and Van Romaine (Drums) are incredibly tight - you get the feel that they have been playing together for years. 'Truthola' is my personal favourite as it soars with the influence of Beck, Johnson and Lifeson very much apparent. This is followed closely by 'Led On' which for a moment I thought could easily be a new Led Zeppelin instrumental.In fact this is an excellent showcase for both Steve Morse's awesome technique as well as compositional skills. This is a worthy addition to any lover of good guitar oriented rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"the current Deep Purple guitar player with his solo album","review":"Mr Morse (DIXIE DREGS and KANSAS) is a typical high professional guitar hero. This album represented his solo work, his technique by picking guitar is excellent and a lot of beautifull ballads. That's the reason, why DEEP PURPLE /heavy rock Dinosaurus asked him to join them to replace the old Guitar veteran Ricthie Blackmore. Because they know that MR MORSE is the only one guy who replaced The old veteran Ritchie Blackmore. If you love Deep Purple, surely you will love MR MORSE solo album too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve's Amazing!","review":"This is a phenominal CD!

What was I thinking?! For example, is there any guitar at all on \\"Don't Send Me No Flowers\\", attributed to Jimmy Page?? Meanwhile, Russ Pay (who?) performs Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\", sounding like any one of a million Zeppelin cover bands.

Defiled may be the craziest of all-- this is some of the most psychotic metal I've heard. Extreme in every way, in its technicality, ridiculously chaotic arrangements, lyrics (although somewhat typical of death metal), and bowel-shaking vocals. The songs are more collections of riffs than real songs, but this is pretty irrelevant. You just have to sit there and let it assault you, without trying to figure it out. They don't really sound like anyone else-- Cryptopsy is probably the closest approximation, although Defiled are a little more \\"out there.\\" Some of the riffs are incredibly complex. One thing I particularly like is their guitar sound, which has a unique sludgy tone to it. This would probably appeal to most death metal fans-- although a little patience is required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, poignant...a touching score that moves the soul","review":"After seeing this movie, I was moved by both the story and the beautiful score.

A career session and back up vocalist to the superstars, Kate Markowitz captivated me with her depth and sound. THe music has a nice rhythm, one that she says was influenced by the Brazilian music she listened to as a kid, as well as the R & B, Motown and the performers she accompanied, including James Taylor and Shawn Colvin. I cried when I listened to I Remember You, a tribute to her late parents and to the late JT band member and friend, Don Grolnick. It is about life, loss and learning. And it is about romance. The last song, Who Needs the Spring, was written by her parents to each other. It is better than comfort food for the soul.

It follows a sometimes unsypathetic stuggling musician and her sometimes unsypathetic friends through a few months of her life in New York City. Living in New York is unlike living anywhere else and this book captured that wonderfuly. The author was able to capture the narrators feelings brilliantly, a perfect example being a scene where the protangonist ran a full gammett of emotions from exicted to rational to annoyed and finally to acceptance as she waited in her apartment for her date who never shows up. The book's humor is sometimes hysterical and sometimes contrived but it never slows up and keeps you wondering till the last page what is going to happen next.

'Waiting for Woody Allen' is not a masterpiece, but it is a very well made and very well acted short film. The Central Park scene is a good choice instead of the usually alien landscape of Godot on stage.This is not for Neil Simon fans.

I thought the show was far more superior to Hercules as a spin off show. The difference with Xena is that this show delivers all the right punches at the right time. Xena (and Hercules) both represented a new departure in television as well. So, if you enjoy camp, adventure or just want to escape from reality for awhile this is fun show and Xena shows always end up on a happy note. (Even with Callisto around!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the subtitles?","review":"I'm a big fan of Xena and i only have to say one negative thing about this DVD and that would be that they did not include subtitles. Almost every popular tv series on DVD has subtitles and why would they not, they must be cheapies. Subtitles do a lot of help if the sound is bad or if there are deaf people out there that want to watch it too and they are stuck with not buying their favorite tv series on DVD. Plus, i think they could sell more copies for including subtitles. Hopefully, in the near future subtitles will be included in their other Season sets or this will be a big disappointment not only for me but many other people out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the series, hated the DVD encoding","review":"There's been a lot of stuff, both positive and negative, about the Anchor Bay package of Xena on DVD. I've been watching it on a very good quality all-regions player (which has no trouble with other NTSC progs) in the UK and it's frequently awful. The soundtrack (which should be glorious) is disastrously out of synch from time to time (The Titans, Prometheus for example) and picture quality varies from OK to really awful. Don't believe anyone who tells you it's because Series 1 was shot on 16mm film instead of 35mm: believe me, 16mm should look terrific on the small screen. And there's no excuse for the out-of-synch-sound or poor quality DVD encoding.On the plus side you get loads more extras than the meagre Universal/Playback versions available on this side of the pond, but at least the Universal DVD's are watchable.A great series and good package spoiled by very poor quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"Ok, so I'm a bigger Hercules fan than I am of Xena, but I love how these two shows collide sometimes. So I saved up a boatload of money and bought them both at once after all seasons were released. Season 1 of Xena has a few memorable moments. For one thing, Kevin Smith portrays Ares for the first time. I wasn't too thrilled with that monsterous incarnation of the war god in Hercules because I'd already gotten used to Smith's portrayal of the character. And what a fantastic job on his part. I also enjoyed the first appearance of Callisto. She's creepy, but you can't help but feel sorry for her. I also enjoyed the Herc and Xena crossover episode included this season as well. It was an ok season, but I enjoyed later seasons a great deal more because Ares and Callisto had more important roles to play. Not a bad first run, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"good good enjoyed it very entaining brought back memories I can't wait to buy more good good good good good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Autolycus","review":"This episode (\\"The Royal Couple of Thieves\\") marks the first appearance of Autolycus, a character from \\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\\". Have I mentioned that he is the King of Thieves? Or so he says. That isn't why Xena seeks out his help to recover a stolen \\"powerful weapon\\". It's because Herc's put in a good word for him. This episode is memorable because Xena and Autolycus are not only locked in a battle to bid against mercenaries for the \\"weapon\\", they're locked in a battle of wits with each other. It's like a screwball comedy with the physical eclipsing the verbal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor release of a great season","review":"I have a region-free DVD player and bought the Australian release of Xena Season 1 because I was so disappointed with the picture and sound quality of this Anchor Bay release. The Australian version does have a few slightly grainy moments but nowhere near as bad as the Anchor Bay version. Now I'm stuck with an inferior quality set to get rid of.

If you were worried about not getting enough grain in your diet, folks, worry no longer. Yes, grain, grain, and more grain permeates every disc of this set like some kind of terrible, grainy plague.

Well, same deal here -- except in this case you'll WANT to shoot your eyes out after having received even only 3 seconds of this visually painful jolt to the old optic center of the brain.

And I haven't been disappointed. I don't have top-of-the-line equipment (I watch it on a TV with a regular DVD player), and there were some grainy scenes (usually in scenes with dull lighting), but they were few and far between. And I didn't have any problems with the audio, either. The only real complaint I have (and maybe it's a small one), is that at least a couple of episodes (Prometheus, Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts) left me with the nagging suspicion that some of the original material had been cut out (I'm thinking 10 seconds worth or more). I don't know why. And that's just what I noticed; perhaps all the episodes were cut short. Or not.

I don't know what the quality of the sets on the Xena website is like but they can't be worse than this.

I knew this might change when I got my new TV setup of a Sony 32\\"HV600 HDTV and a Panasonic DVD Player/Recorder EM50 with component cable hook-up. Sure enough the blurriness problem went away, and though you could still see some graininess in some of the scenes, it wasnt that bad, and maybe attributed to what film the original season first used til midway through the second season. So, many of the problems might just be what you are using to watch the series. It is unfortunate that they couldnt have cleaned up this collection better but I still found the DVD's worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Complete without the Closed Captioning or Subtitles","review":"I am a huge fan of Xena and was very disappointed that this DVD series haven't been encoded with Closed Captioning nor offered English subtitles. The majority of new media releases contain these features and the television even aired it with Closed Captioning as well as the finale DVD, so why would they exclude that in the season series? The pictures are great, but since I'm hard of hearing I need the story line to go with the pictures in order to fully experience Xena/Gabrielle, their adventures and spiritual growth. I will be holding off from buying any future Xena Season DVDs until someone produces them with CC or Subtitle features."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legend of its Own","review":"I began watching Xena when I was about 9 years old. Back then, it was a new series and it was known by almost everyone. About into the 4th season, the show stopped airing on public television so I thought the series was canceled. Then I came across season one last year and knew that I had to buy it. My memories of season one were gone but what a surprise to watch the old times again! The sound, the stunts, the adventure, the thrills, everything made my purchase all worthwile. For some, the Xena series may be odd and somewhat distorted from ancient Greek legends, but looking aside from that, the show itself is a fun and entertaining addition to other adventure shows and movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you hear my disappointment?","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed to find that these DVD's did not include closed captions nor subtitles. I have enjoyed watching the various Xena episodes over the years on TV where the CC's were broadcast. It's unfortunate that in the year 2003, when the technology is readily available, that so little regard is given the paying customer. I am one of the millions of hearing impaired persons that like to buy and view DVD's. I would certainly 'not' purchase any DVD in the future that did not contain either closed captions or subtitles. (At least foreign films, with non-English dialogue allow the viewer the opportunity of reading English subtitles.) If they want to sell more DVD's and be a 'responsible' company, then they need to do it 'right'."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a memory trip!","review":"Iloved this show back in the day and was devastated with the series finale where the concept of vengeance was elevated above the power of love and forgiveness but I had forgotten how great the series was. I picked up my copy at Walmart and if they had the rest of the series I would pick it up right now. Picture and sound was great. If you love the idea of great story good acting and kick butt women then this is really your series. There is drama and chees, comedy and action Xena has everything.

I speak French, but my husband does not; I wanted him to be able to share this book with our young son, who is learning French.The book has a brief pronunciation guide in the front. It is woefully incomplete and hard to use; the English words selected to give an idea of the pronunciation of some French vowels are words which are pronounced very differently by English speakers in different countries and areas. If you don't already know how to pronounce those vowels, you'll be forced to guess.The pronuciations listed in the dictionary itself are misleading. They don't even match up with the guide in the front of the book.I'm giving this book three stars because the illustrations are charming and old-fashioned, and the book does appeal to my son.

It is helpful that you can turn the sound off if you desire as this doll is fun to listen to for a period of time, but it is a relief to know that her conversation can be limited and she does say good night if she isn't handled for a period of time.

Where is The Punisher when you really need him? Frank Castle should hunt down every single person who had anything to do with this sham comic adaptation and PUNISH THEM! Do not waste your time or money, this movie is a prime example of how NOT to make a movie of a comic book character.

He's a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands. That and the script is awful! You can't tell me that you could be impressed with this one.I give it a zero.

You can see the marks, literally white x spots, where people are supposed to stand or objects are supposed to be placed. I was waiting for an anvil to fall on one chicks head, Wily Coyote style. And you won't see this only once or twice, it is throughout the movie. Take a drink everytime you see one and you will be stone cold drunk before it's over.

I think Dolph Lundgren did a great Job portaying the Punisher and in my opinion he should have played the Punisher in the new Punisher Movie instead of Thomas Jane, don't get me wrong Thomas did a good job playing the role of the Punisher, he just did not look enough like the Punisher, Dolph resmbles the punisher a great deal and played the role almost to perfection. But this version of the punisher does have it's faults like for example Dolph's version of the Punisher does not display the Trade Mark Skull on his shirt, and the movie took place in australia instead of New York. But overall the Movie was pretty good considering the lack of help from Marvel. Louis Gossett Jr. also played a good part in this movie, The new Punisher is a little more accurate than this version, but this movie is still a must get and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolph Lundgren's Best!","review":"This Is Dolph Lundgren's best movie to date.

Its gets only four stars for the cheesyness it sometimes displays and the fact that it's obviously a low-budget movie but there are other low-budget films that made it big. Highlander is an excellent example. When Goldblatt picked Lundgren as his choice to portray the Punisher he hit the nail right on the head. He makes a GREAT Punisher. The Punisher was a big, burly, strong guy in the comics and so is Lundgren. He also gives an excellent performance. And who's to say the Punisher didn't dye his hair black to hide his true identity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a awsome movie.","review":"I love dolph,I love punisher,and i love this movie.It is sooooo cool.i wish thier where more then 5 stars.lundgren is way better then people say he is.if you have the chance you shoud buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wanna see a remake of punisher","review":"To start off, this is a cheesy movie. This is a big dissapointment to marvel comics and a slap in the face to the fans, they really weren't going for the comic appeal in this movie. They only made this movie so they could try to make money off the name punisher and they didn't do well with that, Punisher is one of my favorite comic books and since they made all these other comic book movies like Spider-Man, DareDevil, X-Men, The Hulk and i think the punisher should be remade and everyone would go see it, I wanna see punisher remade cause it would be a cool ... movie and it can a sweet anti-hero movie and go for the comic appeal this time and wear the skull and get a cool actor to play him."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's almost good!","review":"B-Movie is definitely the way to describe this film. The dialogue is cheesy, the storyline cliche and the lead character never really develops a second dimension.But despite knowing all of this, I had to buy the DVD.I grew up on comic books and The Punisher was always one of my favourites. The movie is bad, but it's still a lot of fun. There is some decent acting in the film (Louis Gossett, Jr.), although Dolph Lundgren barely says 3 words. If you're a fan of B-movies and comic books, this one is definitely worth buying (especially at its current sale price).As for the DVD, it really doesn't have much in it. The quality of picture and sound is below average (although about what you'd expect from a transfer of a late-80s movie. There are basically no extras on the DVD (it only contains the trailer, cast bios and a few pages of production notes).Oh well - it was fun to watch again! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated B film deserves a shot","review":"Most of Lundgren's work is in B movies and this film was not a big success. Let me explain why: Like Van Damme's Street Fighter, this film maintains some elements of the comic book story but not all of them. I feel it was a pretty good film because it was not your run of the mill superhero film. It is gritty urban violence, which was being craved by audiences more and more during the 90's. The most impressive element to the film are the Japanese villains and their leader, Lady Tanaka, beautifully portrayed by Kim Miyori. These characters embody everything villains should be in a film: cold, calculating, sadistic, brutal, nonverbal (to a certain extent), and I mean, the list goes on and on. Dolph shines as the tortured hero as does Lou Gossett, his best friend and the only one who believes he actually exists. The opening credits and that catchy music also get an A+ in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"REvenge and Redemption","review":"The punisher does not follow the comic book but it is a good flick. It deals with two primal needs within the human psyche - revenge against those who have harmed us- and redemption, both internally and socially.The punisher is out to avenge the death of his family by killing everyone remotely involved in it. He also wants to redeem himself for letting his family be killed.A good flick to watch on a dull night with popcorn.Plenty of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words can't describe...","review":"...how much this movie sucks. Post-Batman, it's a transparent attempt to jump on the comic book movie bandwagon. Dolph Lundgren demonstrates the acting ability of a brick wall, and Louis Gossett Jr.'s talent is wasted. Just say no to this, and wait for the new movie version that is supposed to start shooting soon. Better yet, go buy the comic books. They're infinitely better written than the screenplay for this piece of tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echoes of mystics from the past","review":"Reminds me a little of Emily Dickinson, a little of her contemporary, Thérèse de Lisieux.

When recording, it has frozen many times--like if you want to cut out commercials. The player will not play many discs previously recorded on this player. Do NOT waste your money.

Gatway told me to throw away the DVD+RW supplied and upgrade the firmware by downloading a file from their website. I told them I had a Mac, and they said no problem. Well it does! You have to have a Windows XP or Windows 98 SE machine to download upgrades. I had to find a friend with one of those operating systems and that was not easy.I downloaded the upgrade and loaded file into the Unit. It loaded fine, but it still would not play or record. Gateway promised a replacement would arrive in one week. It never arrived. On my fifth call to them to fix the problem, they told me it would take another two weeks because they were out of stock.

Our TV did not recognize a signal from the recorder and when we attempted to send the recorder's signal through our VCR to get to the TV it completed wiped out the setup of our VCR. We had to disconnect the VCR from power for an hour and then plug it back in and redo its setup. We tried composite as well as coaxial connections to no avail.

And now the Dorkus is once again singing the praises of Hamas. OK--the man can build houses . But he weakened this country tremendously. He was a disgrace as a leader and was soundly defeated in a landslide election after only 1 term.More recently, he said on PBS that no senator or congressman, \\"Could ever vote against an issue favored by the Israeli lobby.\\" And he said this with a mean, goofy, sarcastic smirk.

I am a great fan of Jimmy Carter, one of the two greatest living men on earth (the other being Nelson Mandela). This film basically follows him throughout the country on a book tour of his controversial tome on the policies of Israel toward Palestineans. What I like about this work is its intimate portrait of a man who inspires great respect in some and rabid hatred in others. That fact is dramatically driven home when Carter is confronted by a very hostile man who obviously has much disdain for the him. But there are also many people who show great reverence for the former President as he candidly discusses politically explosive matters related to the Middle East. I strongly recommend this film to anyone wanting to know more about Jimmy Carter, a complex and profoundly humane man."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MUSIC FOR CHILDREN!!","review":"I HAVE THREE OF THE FOUR MOMMY AND ME CDS AND MY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THEM.

I wish they had this for every school subject. The quizzes with 100 multiple choice questions per disc (6 discs in all) are great review, and the questions are very SAT II-like.One warning though, you won't find every single topic in u.s. history.

A character I could relate to, with real struggles and crazy family. I have to say I disagree with C.L. Wilson's review this is \\"light summer fare\\" and \\"unfunny\\". Shelton is extremely talented and finds the humor in everyday life. I am a big fan of her parenting books, and was very excited to see that she is applying her humor, warmth and smarts to becoming a first class novelist. I give her my congratulations on a great first novel. I'm looking forward to reading many wonderful novels from her in the future. Hurry up and finish your next book Ms. Shelton, you have many many fans out here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Sweet, and So Real!","review":"Maz, the first person narrator in this novel, reveals her story with amazing textures of human feeling and emotion cleverly wrapped in those layers of humor that make life bearable even in the most trying circumstances. I question the \\"chic-lit\\" classification because this is a cut above others in this genre. It is a rich read that would feed the soul and spirit of any reader - great for a book club and would be a super novel to teach in the classroom with its brilliant characterization and flowing narrative qualities. I greatly look forward to Ms. Shelton's next novel!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a FUN read!","review":"I guess humor is relative for those not finding this book funny. I found it hilarious and the characters couldn't have been more real. It was easy to get into, character development couldn't be more on track and the story was fun. I'm looking forward to more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exaggerated story line--and where's the humor?","review":"I'm surprised that so many reviewers found this book so hilarious--in fact, I got the book mainly based on the rave reviews!Now, I do appreciate dark comedy (for instance, I love Marian Keyes' novels, and I watch Desperate Housewives), but there simply wasn't much that was funny in this novel. Most of the characters were not very fleshed out (well, aside from the ones that really *were* supposed to seem one-dimensional, like Lenny and Madame Lucille). Perhaps my problem was that I failed to see the humor in situations that really were quite awful. Madame Lucille, for instance, *would* have been funny, if the things she did (and is still doing) to Maz weren't quite so terrible. To top that all off, as some other reviewers commented, the protagonist, Maz, just really isn't all that likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite all the good reviews...","review":"...I just didn't like this book. I found it to be dull...there is so much farce that it becomes overloading. I wanted desperately to love it, but just couldn't seem to get past the ridiculous drama. I didn't find it to be a fun read; I found it be a stressful one.There are some wonderful, fun books in this genre. This is just one that didn't resonate with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not crazy, just weird","review":"I can't see what people find funny about this book at all. A main character that is a complete ditz. Jerry Springer like story lines. A child whose dialogue is of an adult. If one wants to read it, I would save it for a beach read. However, I suggest picking a beach read that isn't full of the mindless drivel, unappealing characters, and bizarre, though not amusing, story lines that this book has."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"Maybe I'm not a true chick-lit connoisseur even though I generally can't get enough Keyes or Crusie, but I couldn't even get past Chapter 3 of this book. And I have to say I pride myself on finishing every book I start. However, this story line made me so sad and uncomfortable for the main character, Maz, I couldn't read another word. I won't speak for the entire book, because there may be some miracle that occurs later in the book that makes it palatable, but I guess all I can recommend is if you're going to try it out, at least power through to Chapter 4. Perhaps, I was just too impatient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like this writer","review":"Haven't read it yet, but was highly recommended, this writer appeals to women.

This track is poppy enough to play on \\"alternatvie\\" stations, yet rock enough to play on hard rock stations. The Album \\"All The Right Reasons\\" shows no signs of nickelback fading into the sunset yet.The other tracks on this CD include a live version of \\"Animals\\", Live version of \\"Follow You Home\\", and the video for \\"Savin ME\\", along with the radio mix of \\"Savin ME\\".

After reading a few good reviews, I was so excited to have this for my stationery business. It damages more paper than it can cut clean. I have wasted so much money on this machine (it is being sent back). And time, from having to reprint everything. Unfortunately, the paper slides around, and if you have the crank too tight, it curls the paper at the base of the holder which causes damage. It did cut clean, just not straight or without damage. For my purposes, the paper I cut cannot be damaged, so this cutter was not good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Christmas Gift","review":"Charlotte Diamond is a family treasure.Her melodic sounds and beautiful rendions of holiday favorites are enjoyed by young and old alike.

Or give us a truly legitimate reason for going so slow. With the decline in quality of the show over the last few seasons you guys are in danger of losing your fan base. As others before have said, we do not care about the extras. The episodes speak for themselves. I urge all Simpsons fans to write the studio and let our collective voices be heard. I think they are forgetting that the window for selling the most sets is limited. Money talks and the rest walk. When I see other shows with reasonable release schedules it makes wish I was a fan of them. Do not waste your money (and more importantly) give them more reasons to release these teaser DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE NEED ALL THE SEASONS RELEASED FASTER THAN ONCE A YEAR !!!","review":"Come on guys.

Had they asked for my input, I would've done it for free.This does not tide me over till season 5's release. Friends/Buffy/X-Files/Sex and the City/South Park dvd release schedule beats the pants off the Simpsons dvd release schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Because R.E.M. was a Guest for 65 Seconds........","review":"I hate to admit I do not watch much T.V. at all, but I love R.E.M. and wanted to see the episode where they made a guest appearance so I picked up this 4 episode disk. Although R.E.M.'s appearance consisted of a partial performace of \\"Its the End of the World as I know It (and I feel fine)\\" and a few lines by each member of the band, I think it was worth it. The performance just picked up so much of the band's personality (Homer telling them it was a benefit to save the rainforest to get them to perform in his garage turned bar from Stipe wanting to wack Homer with a broken beer bottle when the deception is discovered and being told that was not the R.E.M. way, to recycling the broken bottle bits). It was a little freaky how much the cartoon depictions resembled Stipe, Mills and Buck.So if you are an R.E.M. fan this is a disk to pick up as it is just so funny (if not brief) and such a parady of the persona the band was dripping at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly stupid cash-in","review":"This is nothing but a stupid cash-in.

I love The Simpsons, and so far I own all four of the season box sets, with season 5 pre-ordered. Someone gave me \\"Gone Wild\\" for a present, and always willing to watch The Simpsons I popped it in. The DVD starts off with an episode already available on Season 1? I don't understand why they would include something that has already been released onto another dvd? The other 4 episodes found on this collection are not available in the season box sets...yet, but to be honest, I would much rather wait and get the entire season complete than purchase one show on this disk, another show on another disk etc. Only if you are a die-hard fan of the show and cannot wait for Fox to slowly dole out the remaining seasons would I recommend this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOX, THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT!!!!","review":"Let me first say that I am a diehard Simpsons fan and have been watching the show since their premiere back in 1989. Every day, I never miss a single episode because it is very original and captures the atmosphere to the ways of everday society in a funny way. I've bought Seasons 2, 3, & 4 and am patiently waiting for Season 5. Unfortunately, it seems that FOX just wants to get more and more of our money by selling THESE!

I do not even know how one can manage to get such bad colors. I am not talking about the slight color shift that you sometimes notice from one book to another, I am talking about terribly wrong and ugly colors, with saturation you would not imagine and soem parts of the paintings completely washed out or darkened.

Aside from that the album is great ...every song on here is a classic and will never get old . Like others have commented Social D is true punk rock and is not on mtv or vh1 or the charts (most radio stations never play them either). This really is a good thing too because it keeps them from getting mixed up with everyone who calls themself punk (good charlette , blink 182 , avril lavinge).

All of the songs, or should I say \\"the song\\" because they are all the same song, are boring, repetitive, corny, lazy, trying to be neo-white trash, fake-punk and most of all terrible.

As I read each chapter I was amazed at the tasks Mr. Boudreau was assigned, which would intimidate most most men.His diplomacy rose to the occasion over and over again, solving potential crisis and disaster. I admire his wife, Dailyn, for accompanying her husband to Africa and other places he was assigned to, having her children with her etc. and placing herself in possible dangerous situations, yet having the guts to \\"stand by her man\\" and assist in any and all ways she could. I have recommended Mr. Boudreau's book to many of my friends and family. Very educational, emotional, often times humorous, and a valid account of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Great","review":"Ok, first The Bad:The quality is OK. A little mastering, and the rumbly bass and high-end hiss could have easily been eliminated (I know this for a fact since I did it myself on my home studio). Wetton's voice is a little ragged, and the backing vocals are always off-key. The beginning of \\"Heat\\" is inexplicably lopped off. The packaging is chintzy, and the whole thing would have fit on one CD.The Good:WHEEEEEEEE!!! We finally have the original (and for most of us, the ONLY) line-up of Asia in a live soundboard recording. The musicianship is incredible -- you can hear most parts clearly, and Geoff and Steve's soloing (and Carl too) is stellar.

The other holes include the fact that the greed of the rich in the 20's is what drove us into the great depression and social security [which is paid for by you and me, not corporations apparently (da-ding)] was set up to prevent another great depression by providing financial insurance should your corporate CEO decide he wants more money.

Tintin spends a bit of time on the docks and as a stow away on a ship. It is still a great mystery, and I love this episode a lot.Some of this episode was blended into the 2011 film, The Adventures of Tintin. This isn't the main story line - the Unicorn and Red Rackham are the bulk of the movie.I loved watching this on HBO in the early 90's with my son when he was young. We still love watching this today and are always surprised by who did it and the great mystery of these stories.The animation is simple. The story tries very hard to follow the books closely. The same color pallet and figures are used in these cartoons as the books.

Although the DVD follows the story line more closely than the new movie, and the animation is very much like the book, the detractors outweigh the entertainment value. Sadly, the quality of the animation is average and the voice acting poor. My children, who generally are tolerant of most of my trips down memory lane and also fans of the boy reporter, disliked it so much they left the room and told me they would rather watch nothing then put up with the acting in this show.Recommendation - In the end, even through rose-colored glasses of a fan, the best I can say is this is okay to poor.

Great music, characters' voices just about perfect, and the art is essentially Hergé's set in motion (sure, it's not 3D, but it's distinctive and charming).

It's not even worth downloading. Man, has Cash Money went downhill. Their ship has sunk. Baby's lyrics are so pitiful... Lil' Wayne can rap, but ever since he started to try to freestyle all his raps, he's sounded like garbage...And now apparently, Mannie Fresh has left Cash Money... good thing too if it's true. He's the only one in the whole camp that has any talent... true, he can't rhyme to save his life... but when it comes to production, Mannie's always good.

This product is good for guys that have short textured hair styles and will pretty much let you create any look you want. The product is very concentrated so use sparingly.

It's hard to describe. Lyrically, sometimes it's high school sounding (fun high school) and sometimes it's very well written, with thoughtful lyrics. Musically, oh, it is all over the place - but it works. These guys do a fantastic job of changing styles. They can go into a pounding hard rock mode, and then effortlessly jump into a funky ska groove complete with a horn section. But I swear, somehow they pull it off and make it sound great and not amateurish or cheesy. This will sound weird, but I like heavy metal, and I like this stuff. It's fun, active, irreverant, party punk rock. It ain't boring, and it makes you want to consume mass quantities of beer, and ANY music that makes you want to do that can't be all bad! Buy it, listen to it a couple of times, if you can handle rockin' music that wants to be a little fun instead of sinister, angry, and dripping with vengeance (which I also like!), this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Heat Build-Up","review":"I purchased this product with the intent of using it to replace an old slow cooker I have had since the 1970's due to safety concerns with the old one.

Bravo!","review":"I am a music major at a big ten school in the mid west and I can easily say that this is the best version of Mahler's 2nd symphony that I have ever heard. The intonation and rhythms are dead on and I was deeply moved by the superb and climactic ending. The low brass plays with a rich, bold, and dark sonorous tone while the woodwinds and strings play with clarity, meekness, and much emotion. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra is definitely a world class leader of symphony orchestras and they most certainly delivered in this Mahler piece. It doesn't matter if you are a music major or just an average joe, when you listen to Mahler's 2nd by the CBSO, you will be moved. If not, you must not have a pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"the wild thornberrys season 2 part 1 review","review":"This is one of the great reasons i love shout factory, Ive been a fan of this show sense it aired back in the late 90's.

If you grow up watching this show like i did pick it up, you will not be disappointed. i just wish they would of come on DVDs sooner. i see amazon has the pr-order date for season 2 part 2 ( its coming out this April ) , I'm defiantly going to order it. i guess my only complaint is that they split the season up into two parts and there are no extras what so ever in any of the season that have come out so far ( i hope this may change later on ) but like i said i HIGHLY recommend you pick up this season set ( just make sure to watch the first season first lol )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hezog's darkest hour","review":"Of all Herzog's documentaries, this film most closely follows actual events without the director indulging himself in \\"ecstatic truth\\"-telling. Neither is he the flat-brained teller of the \\"accountant's truth.\\" The horror of both the crime and capital punishment need no poetic or operatic treatment. This is not an anti-death penalty film as some have accused. Herzog does state that he is opposed to capital punishment, that he respects human life, but that is as far as he goes. He does not overly empathize with the accused. In fact, his film is dedicated to the victims' families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portrayal of teenage sociopaths","review":"I used to work adolescent psych crisis management on a locked hospital unit. Michael Perry is the perfect example of a \\"baby sociopath.\\" If you've ever wondered how someone can make you think the opposite of reality, well, welcome to the world of sociopaths. He was a good one. The other one isn't as good, but you can tell he is one,too. Sociopaths and their existence is why I've changed my mind on the death penalty. They can never change or be changed. Their specialty: making you feel sorry for them. This is a great documentary, pure Herzog..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another heartwarming story from Werner Herzog","review":"From the director of \\"March of the Penguins\\" and \\"My Best Friend\\" comes \\"Into the Abyss\\", the story of three families in smalltown USA whose lives become permanently linked one starry October night. Herzog weaves together interviews from a cast of characters in a rural Texas community to tell a story with an ending that no one, and I mean no one, will see coming. *** SPOILER ALERT *** I give it four stars because some of the police video of the bloody murder scene could be little disturbing for children *** END SPOILER ***. Still, a worthwhile download since this one inexplicably didn't make it to a wide national release."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep twice","review":"It was so boring. Now \\"180 Degrees South\\" is an awesome documentary. It is just documentary of a murder case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and light-handed Herzog doc","review":"This documentary is part Herzog social comment and part Errol Morris investigation. Told as part 'Thin Blue Line' style crime scene remembrance, and part interviews, Herzog seems to me to be very light-handed in his approach vs. his other efforts. I have to admit that I could also listen to Herzog read the phone book with his awesome accent. A good documentary, surprised that it did not get more push in it's release year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"After being so highly acclaimed I thought this movie would envoke some real emotion. To the contrary I was bored throughout, waiting for a gripping point and it never came. I felt the producer who interviews the death row inmate really failed to engage the audience in the story, his lines of questioning really lacked much depth. I was totally shocked that he received such high acclaim for this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleeding heart, \\"act on emotion\\", 1 sided","review":"From the very beginning, this \\"documentary\\" is an agenda ridden attempt to press one man's opinion that the death penalty is bad, not to mention that it just simply drags on and on. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portrait of Evil","review":"The evil portrayed here isn't the evil of the murderers, but rather the evil of the director. Those who think that this movie is primarily about the death penalty are missing the point. I oppose the death penalty. The movie is primarily about liberal (leftist) sympathy with evil. The murderers in the movie are simply evil, and one is obviously a manipulative sociopath. Everything that liberals do is in support of evil, and particularly in support of the evolutionary success of evil over decency. This is made so clear in this move as the director does everything in his power to evoke sympathy for evil men. And in the end he celebrates the reproductive success of one of the murderers who found a wife while in prison. In modern liberal society, women love murders while decent men can't get a date. This is the result of liberal celebration of evil as exemplified by this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Enough","review":"Herzog condemns the death penalty but never preaches. Both inmates absurdly claim neither committing nor seeing the murders, but admit joy riding in the stolen vehicles and running from police. It spends slightly too much time on the personalities and not enough on facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, The River Knows","review":"Really enjoyed the second book as much as Ms. Dunham's first in this series.

Day after day, Chibi is faced with feelings of isolation and rejection. This memorable story presents the reader with a situation that all children experience some time in their life. The realism of this story allowed me to feel close to Chibi and watch him change towards the end. Through the unique illustrations, Taro Yashima was successful in describing the mood and setting. The moral lesson of this story is beautiful, and should be included in every classroom at the beginning of the school year. Through this lesson, the reader learns to develop an awareness for individual differences. This short story will present you with an enjoyable learning experience. I highly recommend this book for any type of reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Teachers","review":"This story was first read to me by a colleague. A very enlightening and heartwarming story \\"Crow Boy\\" forces readers to reflect on the importance of considering individual differences within classroom settings.

Goes well with season 2! Action, adventure, comedy. What els could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's that good","review":"The Venture Bros. is quality television in a way that mankind rarely sees these days. While most cartoons rely on a consistent formula of the same jokes and storytelling, Venture Bros. evolves and unfolds much like a great novel that you just can't put down. It helps answer questions such as \\"What would it be like to live nextdoor to a professional necromancer?\\", \\"What's the everyday life of a butterfly-winged villain when he's not being evil?\\", and mostly importantly, \\"What would happen if I were to throw a yard sale and invite all my arch nemeses?\\" Watch it and be hilariously hooked on every character's unique persona. You'll find yourself praying for your favorites to make an appearance while a Johnny Quest-esque overdramatized theme catapults you into a hysterical and witty universe. Once you watch a few episodes, you'll have to see the rest; once you reach the season finale, you'll be clawing at your television for more.Yes, it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like to dream, too","review":"Probably the best show to come out of Cartoon Network's [adult swim] lineup, and a real GenX milestone.If Terry Zwigoff had directed Austin Powers, you'd end up with something like this:\\"The guilty party has twenty minutes to confess before I just kill all of you.

Publick and Hammer have slammed it out of the park with this.However, I'm going to rain on the 5-star party here by docking the DVD set one star for the disappointing commentary.

That is, Ballads, Crescent, A Love Supreme, Transition, First Meditations, Sun ship, Coltrane, John Coltran Quartet plays. The recent issue of these recordings as a box set was long overdue.These recordings are among Coltranes best, and the content is uniformly good (some of it is exceptional. For example, Love Supreme) The chronological approach allows one to hear Coltrane evolve as the CD progresses.Another nice point about it is that the quartet tended to get things right the first time, so the CDs are quite listenable (because you don't have to hear several alternates in sequence). The alternates are included on a seperate disc.In conclusion, I'd recommend it to anyone who digs Coltranes classic quartet.

The quality of prints was really, really low, and my photographs had none of the usual shine and vividness that you associate with photos. I strongly recommend that you use this paper with HP printers or perhaps the Canon printers. I don't think that the fault is with this paper: I've had similar suboptimal results with other documents on my Epson printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"grainy quality, very slow drying time.","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this product which I bought for use in my Canon Pixma iP6000D printer.

The sound quality and features are unmatched for a receiver in this price class. The problem is with HK's backing of the product. Four months ago the center channel on mine went dead. A fluke by the statements of the service technician. HK still cannot deliver the parts to repair the unit. The repair technician has told me that this kind of treatment is typical from HK. After numerous calls to HK's service department I have decided to sell all of the HK equipment I currently own. So if you feel \\"lucky\\" I strongly recommend the AVR-65. But if you even have the smallest problem with it you might as well throw it in the nearest dumpster and buy a sunfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Receiver But Zero Reliability","review":"Less than a month after installing the AVR65 it failed and had to be brought to a Harman Kardon service center for repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control shoots down a great receiver","review":"The AVR-65 has the potential to be a great low to mid-range receiver. It handles the all basics (DD5.1, DTS, 6-channel analog, coax, and optical inputs, S-Video switching) nicely, without the added complexity of DSP modes and dozens of buttons and front panel lights you'll never use.Unfortunately, H/K quality control has fallen down on the job. Internet review sites are awash in stories of AVR-65 owners experiencing an inordinate amount of hum, hiss, and RF interference. Mine is suffering from only the first two. H/K doesn't seem to want to own up to the problems at all. At this point, even if I can manage to get it fixed, I'm soured on the brand.Too bad. Features wise, it's great, and when adjusted to volume levels that mask the hum/hiss, it sounds very nice. But the problems are unacceptable for a product at this price point, from a company with the kind of good reputation Harman/Kardon has. (Had.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The AVR65 could have been better and should have!","review":"After many years of owning H/K equipment, including a Citation 16 that is still in service, I thought the AVR 65 was going to be the perfect A/V receiver for my surround system. Within three hours of hooking it up I experienced hum, noise, and an intermitent problem with the optical input. The end result was the AVR65 being replaced with the less expensive, yet equally capable, Onkyo TX-DS575. Both have discrete stages and HCC. If you are looking for an low/mid range A/V receiver, the Onkyo is the way to go. Both the H/K and the Onkyo have a similar limtation in the number and type of video inputs. I did not find this annoying on either one as the best picture will be possible with a direct link to the monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"H/K is worth the try!","review":"I bought this unit in March of 99'. I'ts construction is solid. Sound is well detailed, with a great soundstage. Awesome DTS decoding.The only cons are: 1. Not enough digital inputs. 2. No pre-amp loops on channels to integrate an outboard eq. for fine room tuning. 3. DSS input with a digital input for the audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Promises with little return","review":"I had owned HK equipment since the first Citation series came out. When I first saw the 65, I thought this would be the ideal receiver. From minute one I had nothing but problems with it. Noise, Hum and RF interference that I had never encountered before. I now have an Onkyo TX-DS575. It has the same discrete circuitry as the HK and I have experienced none of the problems not to mention it is a LOT less expensive. Overall, the HK was a great idea poorly executed.

The meledy and placement of certain sounds is amazing. Er, that is goes for some tracks. A few sound like you just entered a tavern or something(Bottle of Blues, Canceled Check) But not to say these songs are straight out bad though, none of them are. My point being is Beck is one of the few artists that still relize what music actually is; Meledy! The right placement of sound. If you like this album I strongly suggest the recent Smashing Pumpkins effort, Adore. Another great album in the same vein. Not much real music out there anymore so come inside Mutations and actually liten to good sound, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIdn't really care for this one...","review":"The songs just seem too slow and funeral-dirgish.

He just doesn't have the emotional depth that is necessary to make a Folk Rock album work. Beck has the emotional depth of Fred Durst, minus all the Macho posing. Beck's lyrics on \\"Mutations\\" aren't even worth mention because, as always, he goes out of his way to say absolutely nothing in particular. Beck even tries to be \\"dark\\" on a couple of songs but, alas, he's no Jim Morrison. If you want some creative Folk Rock with some actual depth try a Cat Stevens or Neil Young record. As for the future of Beck's career in music? Get ready for an album all about Scientology!

And like \\"Midnite Vultures\\" and \\"Odelay\\" it has a few things in common. These albums are all over produced, uninspired, and pretentious(can anyone else smell a sell-out here?). It is quite obvious that beck has gone done hill and he is never coming back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Mostly mellow, all very cool...what is the name of that bonus surprise song starting at about 5:18 on track 11?

I love that he is a true independent in the big-business music world, experimenting with styles and music technology with a sort of child-like abandon.That said, this is my favorite of his releases. It is sort of like the quiet middle child between Odelay and Mellow Gold (though it's not chronologically in the middle). It's the one with the real story to tell. The songs are dark in a way, but not gloomy. Beck really creates a mood here and what I presume is a sense of his inner world. And his voice is so smooth and cool. The tunes are so tight and hummable. The three-time beats are so unusual and so catchy. If you're prone to swaying to music, these songs will have you swaying, as though they're grown-up lullabies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck is a winner... even when stripped down bare!","review":"First off, if you only like Beck when he is turning the blender in his head on pop culture, you probably won't like this album. This album is Beck, a guitar, his backup band, and that's it. The only song that resembles the work from Odelay or Midnite Vultures is \\"Tropicalia\\" (Ok, and the hidden track). That said, this is also probably Beck's strongest album. The songs, while technically un-fussy, are beautifully written and performed. \\"Cold Brains\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But My Own\\" are two of the best songs I have ever heard, and they're only the first tracks. This album grows on you the more you listen to it, and it belongs in anyone's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic release from Beck","review":"Beck's Mutations was a classic as soon as it was released in 1998. Standing as his only true \`acoustic\\" album, it severely departs from his more standard fare - funk/hip-hop/alternative/whatever. The album's spacious, eerie production accentuates the album's ethereal sound-scape. There are waltzes, breezy salsas, all blanketed in a strangely fitting atmosphere of cosmic space - this feels like an album David Bowie could have recorded after Space Oddity. For non-Beck fans, this album should offer accessibility and expose him for the original and often bizarrely creative songwriter he is.

Mellow Gold was gritty, catchy, and overflowing with self expression. Odelay, was innovative, filled with well construced melodies, and even one a grammy. And now, finally, we come to Mutations. The priors are nothing like it, and really don't even come close to the caliber of it. Imediately after listening to Mutations all the way through, i thought of Todd Rundgren. That's where this album is at, thats the genre. Think, \\"A Wizard, A True-Star\\" or \\"Somthing/Anything.\\" However, i would never ever say that Beck is ripping anything off, he has simply crossed over to a different style, and a rare and unique one at that. I am very proud to own this album, and i deffinetely believe that it should be in every music lovers collection, right up there with, The Joshua Tree, Siamese Dream, Who's Next, and all the other greats.

This CD was somewhat disappointing, going from the genre-shifting style of Odelay and (to a lesser extent) Mellow Gold, and has switched into new-age mellow (quite mellow...like sleepytime mellow)...Frankly, I don't like this CD very much. It doesn't really do anything for me...it just sounds weird, and not in a good way like the last two albums.

I paid $3.50 for it, and it should've been half that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally not what I was expecting or hoping for","review":"I am one of those listeners who really enjoyed Odelay and couldn't wait to buy Beck's new album. However, I am really disappointed with this album. It is not that I think that it is a necessarily bad album but it is just a totally different style - very folksy - and this style doesn't appeal to me. I do like some acoustic artists but that is not why I buy Beck. Many people are saying that this album reflects some growth and maturity in Beck, but I don't think the funkiness of Odelay was immature or sophmoric. It was just simply a DIFFERENT style, which I think will be missed by many who really enjoyed Odelay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics are real depressing","review":"What is with these lyrics anyway? Death, decay, decadence, flies, and other wonderful subjects. I get the feeling that Beck is just writing this stuff to get attention.

I guess what i really want Beck to do is make a whole entire album of \\"Beercan\\" (considering that song is tha bomb Beck track). The only song that stands out on \\"Mutations\\" is \\"Tropicalia\\"? I think I like Beck's \\"fun\\" side rather than the somber/serious Beck.

Yeah, that's what i'll do................................THANKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After the Turntables...","review":"Beck is an original, but always diverse artist. After MELLOW GOLD and ODELAY, there was something else that was needed from him. MUTATIONS is the missing peice, now that Sea Change is said and done. Mutations may not be for the casual \\"Loser\\" or \\"Where it's at\\" fan, but if you find something else to Beck's music other than the surface and the singles, than MUTATIONS could be a valuable listen. It's more laid back, not so rough around the edges, and not so distorted to the listener. But what \\"Where it's at\\" did for Odelay, the haunting \\"Nobody's Fault But My Own\\" goes beyond for MUTATIONS. There are some great songs and although not as catchy as his singles, and even though you could listen to \\"Nobody's Fault\\" and \\"Tropicalia\\" by themselves; there is more in the sum of the parts than in the previous records and you can respect the album as a whole, which certainly says something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mutating to the 5 stars","review":"This is Becks best work. It may not be his catchiest or most popular but musically, it stands above the rest of his stuff. One only has think back to the awfull 'Steropathetic Soul Manure' to realize how far this guy has come. He puts the 'M' in melancholy with 'Nobodies fault but my own'. The rest of the offerings are somewhat more upbeat with standouts being 'cold brains' 'Lazy Flies' and 'Bottle of Blues'. This is mostly an acoustic set and thus may dissapoint some of his more narrowminded fans who think 'Loser' and 'Where its at' are the Pinacles of Beck's musical talents. For the rest, mutations is sure to please and open some eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"mutate into something else....","review":"The best collection of songs from one of rock's most intersting artists: this is just plain good music - for a counterpoint, see Beck's predictably hip-hoppable and cringe-worthy \\"Midnite Vultures\\" release. It's amazing that these works were created by the same artist; if you are more into \\"shaking your booty\\" than listening to interesting verse, pick up midnight vultures... if you are into interesting and complex musical and lyrical tapestries, get Mutations. His best work , earning equal marks alongside One Foot in the Grave and Stereopathetic Soul manure. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two careers, One artist","review":"Beck's new release is not a follow up to Odelay but, as the title states, a mutation. It seems more like a follow up to One Foot In The Grave in the same way Odelay seemed to follow from Mellow Gold. Beck seems to like to release \\"popular\\" CDs, cohesive works, and mixed bags (like Streopathetic Soul Manure). He is running two careers at the same time, the \\"popular\\" Beck who sells tons of records and the artist who creates a whole work such as Mutations. While Odelay was geared toward singles Mutations must be taken as a whole and on the whole it is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"singing along","review":"I can't stop singing along to \\"Bottle of Blues.\\" Beck hits such a fun note on this track.

I have a bunch of Beck CD's and this is one of my favorites. It's mellow and slower than the other's but it still has the quirkiness of Beck. It's a great CD with the usual Beck style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Songwriting","review":"The more I hear from Beck, the more impressed I am. Odelay was great in its way, but Mutations shows that underneath the flashy sound effects, sampling, bizarre instrumentation, and other tricks, lies a real songwriting talent. I may be going out on a limb here, but I think Beck just may stand up well in comparison with Ray Davies, Syd Barrett, Richard Thompson, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck!","review":"If a rock group ever puts Jabberwocky to music, it will be Beck. The lyrics are a mish-mash imagery which is so incomprehensible as to be as boring as Beck sounds throughout the album. This is a combination of several older styles, most noteworthy being The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan; yet it does so without being innovative. And why is it every Alternative group has to have a stupid buried track at the end of their album? Honestly, the buried track is more interesting than the rest of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Simplistic and Excellent\\"","review":"Beck gets back to the basics on this cd. I have bought many of Beck\`s cds including his latest cd \\"Midnite Vultures\\". \\"Mutations\\" is entirely different from the fast paced beats and many sound effects in \\"Midnite Vultures\\"(which I also enjoyed). \\"Mutations\\" is a great combination of many different styles of guitars,soft sounds and great vocals. The effort and talent oozes out of this cd as Beck once again shows what a great and talented performer he really is. This cd is well worth your $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another side of Beck","review":"Mutations is wonderful. These are simple yet well thought out songs that make me feel warm every time I hear them. Much like Bradley Nowell of Sublime used to, Beck is pulling from a musical background that is far beyond his age. I don't recommend this to someone who is looking for the typical Beck album but is instead looking to expand their musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good...","review":"i listened to this one a lot when it first came out. A LOT. then i kind of put it away for a while... listened to midnite vultures a lot when it came out -- then set it aside... this one is just such a great album, though. i can't think of many (any?) other artists today that are on the same level lyrically, musically and atmospherically that beck is on on this album alone. dead melodies, cold brains, lazy flies, sing it again... man! i always wondered if some of the songs on this album reference alejandro jodorowsky's film holy mountain...(we live again and static)? i also always wondered whether or not the song static is about brian wilson...??? it doesn't really matter. this album is simply a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck's \\"fake\\" album (How Stupid to Call It That!)","review":"When Mutations came out after Odelay!, critics and fans said it wasn't a \\"real\\" Beck album, mostly due to its acoustic nature. What rubbish. This is a fantastic album, showing Beck to be more talented than a lot of people thought with his singing, songwriting, and guitar playing really shining here. And the songs, overall, are awesome. Tropicalia, Bottle of Blues, Nobody's Fault But My Own, Lazy Flies, Cold Brains, and an AWESOME hidden track (Diamond Bollocks) that is a cross between what Beck did on Odelay! and what he would do on Midnite Vultures. Just awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is easily the best beck album out there overall","review":"guero? nah. this ones the best. guero just got more mainstream airtime. this is the beck album that you probably have seen in stores and said to yourself, \\"i never heard any of these songs on the radio,\\" after checking the tracklist (as i did). but dont worry about that, just buy it and enjoy.everything meshes perfectly on this album. the solos, the music, the strange spacey effects, becks awesome voice, becks amazing lyrics.theres a lot of imagery of alcohol, infidelity, longing, and all the good stuff you'd see in a sappy western love movie, which fits the music perfectly.it sounds like bob dylan kinda. if you like great songwriting, buy immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album!!","review":"This is my favorite Beck album. Mutations will definitely stand the test of time. Those tracks that really stand out to me are \\"Cold Brains\\", \\"Sing It Again\\", and \\"Static\\". I recommend picking this album up, putting it on, and then chilling out. For those Beck fans that were looking for another Odelay, this is not that album but if you like Beck and give this album a few thoughtful listens it too may become your Fav."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"nothing like any of the more well known stuff, but really beautiful... I was just reading some other Beck reviews and I thought I'd comment on something: isn't it odd that all the bob dylan fans who keep on hearing the whole \\"bob dylan of the 90's\\" label tagged onto beck only end up hearing the more widespread mainstream hit \\"loser\\" and \\"where it's at\\" type stuff and are angered because it isn't stylistically like Dylan, and yet the people who come expecting this stuff end up bying something like Mutations because they expect something more danceable and say it's \\"boring\\"? anyone who questions the \\"90's bob dylan\\" thing should hear some of his less flashy work such as this album and also One Foot In The Grave and it would change their whole perspective..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally.....a cd worth listening to over and over!","review":"This is the best album of the year....by any pop artist. Fantastic production and sound. I'm sick of people whining about it's \\"low fi\\" attributes and how \\"Beck didn't put as much time or soul into it.\\" Soul? Yeah right, this could be the ONLY Beck album with soul. If anything, it makes his earlier effort Odelay sound like a mish mash of post-grunge neo-homie poseur crap. This is an album for people who appreciate well-orchestrated tunes with thoughtful, but sparse arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlimited Blah","review":"This CD contains NO Donna Summer vocals! ... which is apparent from the first note.

I wore these for the duration for the class which, while not a lot of time, gave me eight hours to test them out in summer heat.First off some good points. They're vented which aids in keeping your hands cooler than plain leather. The pad on the inside of the palm is thicker than the rest of the glove which, usually being the first place to hit the ground, makes them a touch more durable. Also the leather itself is more supple than most cowhide.Now for the bad news. While they're vented, the cooling it adds is negligible. Also the seam for the leather is on the inside and that is its biggest flaw. As you ride the seam digs into your skin and starts irritating it.Overall, they're cheap but it might be worth it to spring for a nicer pair if only to avoid the inner seam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nissan Xterra Air Filter Element","review":"This element looks just like the OEM part, but seems to be different in one aspect - the gasket material seems more robust. This will make it a slight challenge to install because the air box has a hinged lid. I found I had to remove some of the components going to the air box to give me the freedom to hinge the lid properly and thus obtain a perfect fit, but I am very happy with the result. If you don't hinge the lid correctly, the air box will not be air tight as intended - the seams will not meet perfectly and will bulge in the area of the hinges. I think the hinge issue is a Nissan design flaw, and not with the filter. The only other observation and comment: the element is made in China. I would prefer made in USA, even at a higher price.

I kept reading, because I thought the story might be interesting, even if the writing style was a little annoying. Then, I got to the end and was further dissappointed.

I am a new digital camera user, and I have been very impressed by both packages in the bundle. Album uses \\"Tags\\" which you can attach to your pictures, making it possible to easily sort your pictures by topic, person, date, event, etc. For example, we recently went to the circus, and I imported my pictures to Photoshop Album, and assigned the tags. So, now I can sort out all of the circus pictures from my other pictures, or can sort by date, or by animals, or by family members who went to the circus. With this kind of power, you don't need to worry about where the files are in your directory! Photoshop Album will do some basic editing, and Elements will do advanced editing, and is very helpful in sizing your pictures for printing. I highly recommend both Photoshop Album and Elements. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elements, Good. Album, Bad.","review":"I love the photoshop elements for the features it offers to a casual photo enthusiast like myself. As for Photoshop album that it came bundled with, I can't say the same. I have been a long time ACDsee user and I found Album's file organization structure really awkward to use. ACDsee allows you to see photos as well as other files in their folders and directory trees. If you know how to use Windows, you know how to use ACDsee. Photoshop allows you to see only image files and arranges them in a calendar chronicle order. This is a problem when you need to delete or transfer photographs in between different directory locations. In short, Album might be a good image viewer, but it fails pretty bad when you need to use it for photographs organization. Actually, Album is not as good as ACDsee as a image viewer either because it takes longer to cache and display images. Still loving Photoshop Elements though, just don't pay extra for the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and super shipping!","review":"I would highly recommend this product, and Amazon offers the best deal.

She passes into many hands and along the way she becomes the most literate of dolls. One girl after another owns her, though her painted features fade and her various dresses come and go. She has a series of exciting adventures: she lands in a tree, in a shipwrecked, on a deserted island worshipped as an idol (!), on a steamship, under the cushion of an old couch, in an exhibition, and, finally, in an antique store.

The dual guitar attack of John Allen and Dennis Vestman is breath-taking on the entire album, especially so on \\"Forgotten Land\\" and the mid-paced song \\"Village of Agabba\\" is an instant classic in the power metal field.

If you turn off the \\"preview\\" option, the camera can snap photos in pretty rapid succession. We bought the camera mainly to get better quality photos of our newborn baby, and its been more than adequate for that. Our camera came with the docking station too, but I don't really see that as any big asset. We would like the camera with or without the dock.Complaints? The only real problem I've had with the camera is taking photos outdoors in bright sunlight. I've had a tough time seeing through the viewer (but I am probably doing something wrong in all honesty). I'm not a huge fan of the wheel that turns the camera on and changes modes, just a minor complaint. And, again, I wish the camera was a little bit smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good camera","review":"I have this camera for about a year.

At least it can provide you with some basic functions of manual photography.The functions of this unit are very user-friendly, even though it took me some time to master all the functions in the beginning. It's a bit hard to control the right amount of light entering the lens in the beginning, but after you get acquainted with all its light functions, you should not have a problem.The price of the unit is very reasonable and the quality of the picture is no doubt. I especially like the 10x optical zoom. With such a reasonable price, you can hardly get something so elaboraed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"I am happy with my camera.

I am a rubbish photographer, but get great shots, my brother-in-law is a good one and gets awesome shots. It took a couple of days of slightly blurred pictures before I got a handle on how to use the camera, so I'd reccommend buying it a week or so before the big event! I also struggle with the zoom when it is right out, but am stunned by the results when I manage to get past the shake. I think that next time I'll go for a smaller zoom. The macro is fantastic. My inside shots became really good once I got into the habit of putting up the flash! I get frustrated by the fact that the manual is on disk, as I usually need to read it when I am away from my computer, but this would be my biggest gripe.I now have hundreds of photos on my computer and can never decide which to use on my desktop, they all look really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera for a point and shoot","review":"This camera is a very good camera for what it is. I have taken some great shots that have made excellent 8 x 10'S. The fact that it has the capability to use an external flash really helped with night time action shots. I shoot football and racing and it has worked for both. The only complaint with the racing photography was there is some shutter delay but if you pan with the subject it does a decent job. If you learn to use the manual modes on the camera you can adapted to most photography situations. I pushed this camera to its limits for over 7,000 shots and videos combine. The video mode is nice and does a decent job. As far as durability it is great I have droped it, subjected it to intense amounts of dust and dirt, and temperature changes and it has held up great.

Overall for a point and shoot it is very adaptable and can shoot in various conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"very good camera, nice amount of features, the night mode could have been better,pictures show a high amount of detail even when using the optical zoom.

If you want a great camera that takes crisp, clean shots and has a variety of functionality, this camera is for you!The only downside is that it is somewhat bulky but, it's very lightweight which makes up for it.

Inside or outside in lower light settings, the pictures do NOT turn out at all. I would not buy this camera knowing what I know now. Too bad - Kodak had our loyalty until this experience!

Everything from kid's daily silliness to vacation photos, weddings and every other thing we want a pic of.You really don't need more than 4 mp (google it). You can buy a fancy camera with a lot more features, but this camera will take as good of pictures as most of the newer ones in the same category (I would compare to bridge cameras.)Pros: Great, great pics, ease of useCon: Size -- feels great in my hand, but not great in my purse.Bottom line, this is old technology, but I would not hesitate to recommend or buy this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little River Band member Beeb Birtles album","review":"As I like Little River Band & try to listen to material with the old members, If I can get records with them!That's why I bought this cd with Beeb and I think it's good.....nice production and good songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testing the timekeeping","review":"I purchased one of these clocks nearly two years ago from a drugstore chain. The lighted dial is excellent and would probably have a battery life of a year even if never turned off. However timekeeping was a major problem. If the clock was carried in a suitcase or, perhaps, knocked over on a table, it would subsequently loose hours of time. After being reset, it would function correctly.The two clocks purchased from Amazon are intended for a test to see if they have problems similar to the clock described above.

But upon inspection, the different tools appear very poorly made - example: the ratchet tool feels like it is going to fall apart as you twist the head to change the direction from left to right, and the flashlight is light as a feather.Given that, having these tools together in one portable place is nice. Plus I guess you shouldn't really expect much more for the price. Don't get me wrong, I still plan on keeping this in the back of my truck.

He is very kind andhe loves the boys at the school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"I had hoped for very good things from this book, but the good things are just too thin, such as they are, and too far between. Chips has a narrow world-view and is completely out of touch with most everything. He is married briefly and his wife dies. He retires in 1913 but cannot bear to move away from the boys school where he has taught so many years. His life seems to be taken up by staring across at the school and reading detective novels. It is hardly enough to sustain a reader's interest.During the World War he returns to the school temporarily, while the faculty is thinned out by army recruitment. During all this, he seems almost proud of his ignorance in such things as movies, popular music, etc. The only part I found interesting was Chips' tribute to a former teacher who taught German at the school, the man having been killed in the German army.Hilton also wrote several short stories featuring Mr. Chips, but they are no better."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental drivel","review":"The real problem with this book is that there is no substance to it.

While the story is short, you will be reading a bunch of sentences full of dull, who gives a horses battoot storries from an old guieser with a dream to be a cool teacher (Yeah right) and crack quick jokes and tell cool storries. Yahh, go Mr. Chips go, Your my Favorite teacher, heres an apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for all Teachers: Past, Present, and Future.","review":"I'm a junior in high school and considered giving up hoping to be a teacher because of the constantly changing politics behind it, but this book showed me that teaching isn't out of the question. I learned that as long as you love what you do and continue to do what works well for you, you will succeed. Mr. Chips was a kind, but firm person and had a great influence on his students. My mother is also a teacher and I recommended the book to her. All teachers should read this at least once. It makes a wonderful profession that much better.My only complaint is that the novel seemed rushed and too short for me (I read it from start to finish in two hours), so it seemed more like a novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy to read Classic","review":"Still waiting for the DVD (the movie starring Peter O' Toole was a true masterpiece), I have been surprised by this enchanting book.

Chips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Chips","review":"Our family usually purchases the book and we read it as a family, and then watch the corresponding movie after we have read it.Good-bye Mr Chips is a heartwarming, well paced story that our family, including two \\"tweenage\\" girls, very much enjoyed. The book is very old and some of the language is dated, but the story is very touching. We found it a \\"keeper\\" and recommend it for its values and wholesomeness."},{"rating":"2","title":"It truly is \\"The Best Valentine\\" one could give","review":"Simply wonderful!

An Englishman takes a simple fishing trip for relaxation, but soon he is busy preventing a royal coup by standing in as the heir apparent.

For another Balkan novel written on a juvenile level try The Lost Prince of Samavia."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my favorite!","review":"I love the Prisoner of Zenda. There's so much going on, and it is so interesting to see how the story turns out. At the very beginning, when Rudolf Rassendyl was going over his relation to the Eldorphs it was slightly slow, but other than that the book was excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent adventure","review":"A rolicking good read, with a hero who is far from perfect and seems to tumble into the adventure willy-nilly.Honour and high morality are key, though the hero and his well-meaning side-kicks seem to fall from both. There is a lovely love interest for our star-crossed hero, drinking and riding and fighting and a nice strong plot. Some of the secondary characters are a little flat and two-dimensional, but the ones we care about are nicely delineated.The language is lovely and, in the digital version I read, without any of the ebook glitches and typos that can so annoy and diminish a reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zenda-A Classic Romance","review":"The Prisoner of Zenda is a fast-paced adventure romance that rewards the reader with clearly defined characters and moral values. If you want a story that leaves you feeling good at the end, this is a good one to read. The language is a bit archaic at times and some of the dialogue is stilted. But these failings do not materially interfere with enjoying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two dozen 'nugats'","review":"Distributor of this album, INTERSTATE MUSIC LTD. is a British-based outfit that produces its CDs in the Czech Republic.Vocalists on CUGAT'S NUGATS: Dinah Shore, Linay Romay, Frank Sinatra (in English, two 1942 sides), Miguelito Valdes and Tito Rodriguez.

First of all, I'm not some Limp Bizkit fan who accidently stumbled upon a scary power metal album. I love this stuff, but man, this band is pretty terrible!They're not really bad musicians, but the music is just really uninteresting, and goes nowhere the whole album. The symphonic arrangements are unbelievably cheesy, and sometimes this even sounds like hair metal or something. Not to mention, the vocals are beyond bad. This guy has the highest, most annoying voice I've ever heard. Even higher than John Arch, and at least he's a fairly decent singer. This sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks with helium balloons!Maybe I'm being too hard on this band, but I just cannot get into them at all. For good power metal, go with Kamelot, Blind Guardian, or Sonata Arctica. Heck, even Stratovarius is better than this. Not as bad as most of the commercial garbage out there, but \\"saviors of metal\\"? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Metal","review":"Just like the creators of power metal old Helloween and Gamma Ray. edguy maybe just a baby power metal band but a excellant one. with the inspirations of Michael kiske and kai hansen this band will go far.

Great high and clean vocals with awsome guitar melodies and speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edguy goes oh-so-slightly commercial","review":"\\"Theater of Salvation\\" is a more \\"commercial\\" album than \\"Vainglory Opera\\" and thus I find it slightly less interesting. What do I mean by \\"commercial\\"? I mean that they've adopted 80s arena rock influences into their overall Germanic power metal style. For example, \\"Land of the Miracle\\" and the ambitious 13-minute title track are almost Meatloaf-ian. Strange but true.In general, I prefer the stomping, muscular style of \\"Vainglory Opera,\\" where fast solos and dual guitar harmonies are squeezed out over a frenetic rhythm. This heavier side of Edguy shows itself less frequently on \\"Theater of Salvation.\\" Yet it must be admitted that Edguy retains their sense of melody, especially on songs like \\"Arrows Fly.\\"High 4/low 3 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good.... :)","review":"This is an excellent CD.... I don't understand all the talk about things in metal being soppy, just because they don't write about the standard stuff..... So Land of the miracle and Another time (on this Edguy CD) are written about hope and so forth.. to me that does not mean it is soppy or anything. The lyrics fit the music, and this adds a different dimension to the CD, instead of just flat out power metal... The Title Track is awesome... There are some beautiful parts to it, and it is written well... Overall it is quite a good release, edguy fans, this is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible work of art, a magnum opus","review":"You can't go wrong buying this album.

What a nice change from ordinary books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series is getting old now","review":"Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot. Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series. As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date. It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all. I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me. There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive. I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"First Evanovich book I've read, and I'm not impressed. This novel was not gripping, thrilling or excited, it was mildly entertaining. Eleven on Top had the highest reader reviews among the Plum series, can't imagine enjoying any of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plum","review":"This was one of my favorite plum books ever! The Ranger/Steph relationship gets steamy and will keep you reading late into the night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally hilarious!","review":"I was getting a little bored with Stephanie Plum and the destruction that she causes, but this book returned my faith in this funny, rollicking series. In the book, Stephanie is having a career crisis. She's tired of being a bounty hunter and attracting all kinds of crazies to her world. But, guess what? Even though she thinks she's quit her job, she's still got crazies going after her. And she's still got to decide between the two \\"hot\\" men in her life. I don't know about Stpehanie, but I'm all for the black-clad Ranger. These books are some of the funniest you'll find out there, and this one caused me to laugh out loud numerous times. I highly recommend this series for good laughs (and there's always a mystery thrown in)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Doesn't Disappoint","review":"Evanovich does it again. Another great entry in the series. It leaves you wanting and waiting for the next book. In this book, you really feel for Stephanie. You get to know her more than ever with this book. It's definitely a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Read","review":"I have to confess that I was getting tired of every car blowing up and Stephanie acting so silly that even I couldn't beleive it. I was considering losing hope on the series.I had to read this one, though, just to see if it would continue. I was pleasantly surprised to find a more thought out book, a good story line, and that the characters had grown a bit.I do read this for the humour and I'd hate to lose most of the antics in it but I did want to see some growth because after all, they are grownups.I find \\"Eleven on Top\\" with a curious mystery, great story line, good tension between Steph, Ranger and Joe, and all the characters we know and love back in full force and doing what they can to entertain us.I won't give up yet because this one makes me want to continue the journey to see where we all end up.I'd say if you were on the edge of considering this one, I would surely give it a try. I think it's moving ahead and back to what we read the series for."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELEVEN ALMOST AT THE TOP","review":"\\"ELEVEN\\" is so much better than \\"TEN BIG ONES\\" that if I hadn't been a fan of all the books and know what the author is capable of, I would have rated it with 5 stars. Ms Evanovich is once again finding her stride. I especially liked Lulu's and Stephanie's analogies with jelly donuts. The secondary characters were in the groove and the cake fight well, hurray for Plum's mum!Now the 1 star part, I am getting bored with Stephanie's lack of maturity or commitment in her romantic relationship. I can buy the repeated slap stick antics of cars blowing up, sugar fixes, being thrown in the air and then the garbage. Hey, I watched \\"I Love Lucy\\". But, Lucy committed to Ricky, sure she'd get goofy over some Hollywood hunk and that made for humor. I think we, as readers, have been strung along with the Morelli/Ranger,which one will it be,line long enough. If, it's beyond the realm for Stephanie to move forward at least let either Ranger or Joe have some development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleven on Top (Stephanie Plum Novel) enjoyable","review":"While traveling in the Northwest we listened to this Stephanie Plum novel. It was really great! The reader was very good. And as usual Janet Evanovich keeps the story interesting & fast paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit while you're ahead","review":"Of course, why would Evanovich quit when she's making zillions? But this book is nothing more than a series of warmed-over Stephanie antics. I listened to discs one and two because I think the reader is so terrific, but I never would have read even that much. The first three books were extremely funny. Get some new schtik, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULLER THAN A 10-YEAR-OLD PAINT JOB","review":"Evanovich now churns out books with about as much imagination as McDonalds pushes out hamburgers.Her books are so formulaic that only a reader with amnesia would not feel like each one is an exercise in deja vu.Evanovich puts Plum, Morelli, et al, through all the familiar paces--even the characters seem bored with the whole charade.This isn't writing, it's typing.Evanovich is really just a marketing machine; she's really no longer a writer (if she ever really was). It would be OK if she was in it for the art and the cash--now's she clearly only in it for the cash. The books are as gimmicky as the promotions that shill them (i.e. contests to name a character in her books, etc.).The best contribution Evanovich can now make to the genre of the comic novel is to quit, or actually write one that gets a genuine laugh for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING!","review":"I can't even believe how incredibly dull this one was! I loved 1 - 9, 10 was a little iffy, but 11 was awful! Stephanie is getting dull and stupid, I can't stand Ranger any longer - can he say anything more than \\"Babe\\"? Ever??? Lula is the only bright star in an otherwise dreary day of a book and even she got a little tiring. Just marry Morrelli, have accident prone kids, and be done with it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting predictable but still a great read, Damn Skippy!","review":"Ok, I'm another one who went out and bought the book as soon as it came back. I am a total Stephanie addict. I just finished it this morning and I really enjoyed it.Stephanie has quit the bounty hunting business and taken a job with the hunky Ranger. She still manages to blow up a car or two, have a few capers with Lula and squeeze in hot sex with Joe. Wish my life were so exciting.Ok, my personal plea to Janet, I think Stephanie and Joe are a good combo but I find myself rooting for Ranger to sneak in and sweep Stephanie off her feet. I like the tension between them but I think those 2 trying to have a relationship would be even more entertaining.Only problem with finishing this book, have to wait until next year for number 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I love Stephanie Plum.

The formula has worn out [Stephanie can't choose between Ranger and Morrelli and is terrible as a bounty hunter. Lula still wears 'ho clothes...so what else is new?].I was very disappointed with this book and quite frankly have lost the desire to read any more of Ms. Evanovich's works.How about writing a story about Mr. Kloughn? He is hilarious. It could be called \\"Klouning Around.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie Plum Ran out of gas a long time ago","review":"Sorry all you Stephanie Plum lovers. The series was great until a couple of volumes ago. Then the stories began to sound weak and boring. This one is no different than #10: and that one was a stinker.I got the feeling that Janet Evanovich was now just in it for the money and had no fresh ideas. She was probably washing the dishes and writing something at the same time, or had someone feeding her bad storyline. I wish authors with her original flair for charactors would know when to give it up. That is not the case with this one. Spend your money on a better book.I hope you don't think that I am sour grapes. I used to thoroughly enjoy her books. #6 had me luaghing so hard at a coffee store In Buenos Aires that coffee started to come through my nose.The italians say \\"there is no worst thief, than reading a bad book\\". That is sure the case with this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"This is only the second Stephanie Plum audio I've listened to.After listening to the previous one I knew that if I ever saw another available (on the library shelf) I would listen to it.

It makes the commute to work enjoyable.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Top","review":"I was nervous after book nine left me disappointed. Ten proved to be worthy and eleven has (at least in my book) Janet Evonovich back on top. What a wonderful entertaining story loaded with the best of stephanies eccentric friends and family. Lots of Ranger (which never hurts), and some interesting changes making it hard to wait for the number twelve. What else could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more things change...","review":"Stephanie Plum quits her job as a bounty hunter, expecting that this change will normalize her life, and she will no longer be shot at or have her cars blown up, or be the target of other mayhem. Unfortunately for her, but fortunately for us the readers, that expectation does not come true, and once again there are shootings, explosions, and other assorted bad things going on around here. There is also much more about her disfunctional family, and the odd relationship she has with Officer Morelli and Ranger. This is a book to keep turning pages, and when it's done, you'll feel satisfied that you've had an excellent literary ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love love love this author","review":"i am a total evanovich fanatic. have almost the whole series. they keep getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and quick reading!","review":"Light and fun reading for quick entertainment!Which guy gets the girl?

I am from a super small town so I can relate to the speed of gossip so that part isn't as bad. Morelli needs to get his head out of the sand!

Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down and all the interruptions in my daily life served only to annoy me, as I really wanted to read on. Janet writes in such a way that you are captivated right from the start of a book and her mysteries are solved in a surprising way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleven On Top","review":"What I like about Janet Evanovich novels is how easy it is to live along with the characters. Stephanie Plum is a woman, who has issues, some she faces and some she lets slide. She has low self esteem, but carries on and meets the problem full force, and then is surprised when it's solved.Eleven On Top is full of exciting, dangerous fun. A little romance thrown in,and funny moments that made me laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I got this book as a freebie in a book club offer. It's a light read, fun and predictable. It was a good to pass the commuting time but not the sort of book I'd take on a vacation or a longer trip. Stephanie Plum is sort of a ditsy grown up Nancy Drew type. Entertaining but not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Top pretty much say's it all","review":"Janet Evanovich does not KNOW how to write anything that isn't completely worth buying, reading from cover to cover and then, reading again! Go Janet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to modify the formula","review":"I've read all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series. I love Ms. Evanovich's humorous style of writing, but am beginning to tire of the Steffy Plum formula. It's been repackaged and retold eleven times now. Nothing new, nothing different in this book. Where I once \\"felt\\" for Stephanie, as she tried to choose between Ranger and Morelli, I now find her slutty and manipulative. I now feel pity for handsome babe-magnet Morelli and that's wrong. It's time for him to have a new long-term girlfriend for a while. Readers would enjoy seeing how Stephanie would react to that. Ranger seems to regard Steffy as an amusement; let him stay that way. Keep all of the nutty folks in though. They're what keep me reading. Standouts inlcude Lula, Grandma Mazur, Bella and Steph's mom. No one can match Ms. Evanovich's humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All about the romance, No real mystery","review":"The Stephanie Plum series is all about the romance. The relationship aspects of the series are the parts that the author plans out two to three books ahead of time. The rest of the story follows where she wants to take the relationships book to book. Sounds like more of a romantic comedy than a mystery series. The author will keep rolling out these books and her fans will keep eating them up. Why mess with a winning formula? I used to wish that the author would take this series further, stretch her creativity and talent and bring back some of the freshness that made the Stephanie Plum novels and characters so original. But I haven't seen anything new for at least half the series and now don't expect anything but more of the same each time I read. They're still entertaining but no longer exciting. Too bad. It used to be such a sassy series. Now it seems more lazy then anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn........","review":"Ok, I give up. I used to be a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series, but the last few books have been a disappointment. ELEVEN ON TOP is one big, drawn out yawn. No laughs, just careening from one car explosion to the next with eccentric antics by Grandma Mazur, Lula and sister, Valerie, and a silly, improbable story. This is one series that has completely lost its momentum."},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Evanovich","review":"Another excellent outing for Ms. Evanovich. Glad to see Stephanie is expanding out her world of chaos but I think Ms. Evanovich has painted herself into a corner with the love triangle. It's going to have to end sometime soon and it will be disappointing whoever Stephanie chooses because both male protagonists are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot Again","review":"I don't understand why this author is a best seller. She is certainly not a mystery writer.I have read several of the books in the series and other than the first one I read in which I found her characters to be novel and amusing, each book is the same.Very little plot - the same romantic triangle and the same offbeat characters. This is not a mystery, but a romantic comedy.Sue Grafton does this much better - at least her recent books have become intriquing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Author","review":"There's just no way that this installment was written by the same author that wrote one through about eight. Although the main characters have the same names as previous efforts, they are bad cardboard versions, especially Ranger; the constant use of the word, \\"Babe\\" in every sentence attributed to him was jarring and just bad writing, totally out of character.I suspect that this installment was written by Ms. Evanovich's editor, to whom the book is dedicated \\"for all her efforts\\". A sad and irritating end to what was a joyful series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ride!!!","review":"Ms. Evanovich has done it again. Somehow I always end up laughing outloud by the time I reach the middle. I didn't love the mystery part of this novel- but who reads Plum novels for the mystery!! LOL There is loads of crazy prediciments that Stephanie gets herself into and out of. There is loads of Ranger and Joe and loads of sexual tension with both!! Grandma Mazur will not let you down and neither will the rest of the kooky gang. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enchanted by the plight of Ms. Plum","review":"Yes, they are a guilty pleasure. The key thing is they keep me coming back for more. I heard a rumor that this will be made into a TV series so I've had a fabulous time imagining who will play the main characters. Especially Ranger and Morelli and Lula. She cracks me up. I wish I could snap my fingers and have number 12 in my hands... since I can't do that-- I'm tossing the idea of heading to the mall and smelling the testers... namely the \\"Bulgari\\" men's shower gel. *sigh* ;o) Book ten was my favorite but 11 did not dissapoint. Great twist and it ended before I wanted it to. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Stephanie, get a clue","review":"I have read every book in this series and really liked them all until about Hard 8. Now they are just all the same. It's time for Stephanie to grow into a new direction already. She's still stomping off to the donut shop, can't keep bullets in the gun, sleeping with one guy and lusting for the other and getting cars blown to bits. What was once funny is just now tired, predictable and rote. I find myself angry at Stephanie for being so stupid. Let's see some personal growth and new characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another home run for Janet Evanovich","review":"One of the best of the Stephanie Plum series. I would recommend this entire series to anyone who is looking for light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"This book was very entertaining.

Can't wait to get the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but lacks some ooomph!!","review":"While I did read this book in 2 days...i didn't get the \\"warm fuzzies\\" I usually get when reading a Steph Plum book. Not enough Grandma Mazur for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"she phoned this one in","review":"I couldn't wait for this Plum installment, and I was disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because I did laugh out loud a few times.I discovered the first Plum book and read all ten in 6 weeks! I loved them.I fear that Janet is more concerned about her empire than writing a well constructed story with multi dimensional characters. I will check out the next one and if it is equally as disappointing, I will make up my own ending and move on.In the meantime, I highly recommend The Bubbles Yablonsky series, the Amanda Pepper series, the Blackbird sisters and a new great discovery, Amanda Cooper, psychic eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I waited a long time for Eleven on Top to come out and it was worth the wait! I had to stop myself from reading the entire book in one sitting. I found myself giggling many times - poor Stephanie.

Even though she is trying to leave the danger behind the 'bad guys' continue to blow up her cars, shoot at her and master mind her death. Stephaine sex-drive goes into over drive when she give up sugar and she can't make a decision between Morelli or Ranger. In this book we get some more insight into Ranger past life. I enjoy Janet Evanovich books and enjoy the smile it puts on my face. I hope someday Stephaine will make a choice and live happy-ever-after - but I would be sad to see the series end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old - Same old - Boring","review":"This one is worse than 10. Morelli should dump Stephanie she is such a pain, still going up and down on the same spot. Ranger and Stephanie deserve each other, she's an immature child and he is an egomaniac with big raps on himself. Janet Evanovich has also lost her touch with the humour in her books, I no longer find them funny because the situations are so repetative. I no longer buy the books, I wouldn't waster my money, I borrow them from the library. I only buy books that I feel are worth reading. It's a great pity because I really loved her early books, but unfortunately the only character that has shown any growth is Morelli. In an ongoing series characters have to grow and change otherwise they become very boring. Which is exactly what has happened with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"New material needed","review":"Having read all eleven of these, I can only conclude that the author needs to invent some new characters and situations to go with Stephanie Plum. How many times can I be amused by her car being destroyed? By her grandmother's antics at a funeral home \\"viewing\\"? By the rippling muscles and puerile approaches of her two suitors? By the malaprops of her ex-hooker friend? By the hamster in his soup can? By the dysfunctional sister and her kids, one of whom thinks she is a horse? Perhaps if I had read all these with a year between each, it wouldn't be so obvious. But, alas....There is humor, I'll admit, but it gets thin when the same joke is told over and over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Good","review":"First of all, I really find Lorelei King annoying as the reader. Her midwestern accent is so miscast(Hat Dag?). She is also not a very good actress. The first Stephanie Plum novel I listened to was read by Debi Mazur. She was absolutely the funniest and the best. Her attitude was perfect. And I have a bulletin for the author: New Jersey natives do not call our state JERSEY. It's NEW Jersey, thank you very much, and if we were to believe the deprecating humor about it in these books one would wonder why it's one of the richest states in the union.I am afraid Stephanie stopped being a sympathetic character in this book. She is self-destructive, wreckless and just plain stupid. Half way through I stopped wanting to be bothered with her. Why on earth these two allegedly sexy men find her to be so delicious is a complete mystery to me; the only mystery in the story, apparently. Enough, already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Story Doesn't Go Anywhere...","review":"While still entertaining, this book really has nothing to offer. Sure you can finish this in one day, becuase there is no real storyline, no plot, and no depth to any of the characters. You can skim through much of it and not miss a moment of the \\"action.\\" I think Evanovich is just riding the success of the previous books and not bothering to put anything new, original or interesting into this story. The characters have become so unbelievable... Stephanie was once cute and endearing, but now is just an idiot. The plots are too unrealistic, even for a bumbling \\"bounty hunter.\\" This series has more than run its course. There is no attempt to develop any storyline and venture out of the comfort zone that was created many books ago.Glad I got this one from the library, it wouldn't be worth the money. Maybe the next installment will move things along and develop a storyline?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"I'm not sure how many times Janet Evanovich can use the same worn storyline before she loses all her fans. Sure, Grandma Mazur, the cars blowing up, the family dinners, the bad hair, etc. are all very funny the first time, but after reading about it for the eleventh time, I'm completely fed up. If this is the first Evanovich book you've read, I'm sure you'll love it. I just hope you love it enough to read the same exact story ten more times. She either needs to get new story material or put down her pen and give it a rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book series!!!!!!!","review":"Janet Evanovich is so awesome, the Plum series is my favorite! I can notget enough of these books, can't wait till the next one comes out...Everyone I have turned on to this series has enjoyed them too, frommy daughter in law who is 20 yrs. old, to my friend who is 49! These books are laugh out loud funny and just plain entertaining to read! You have to start with #1 and don't skip! They really build on eachother! Love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum at her best!","review":"Stephanie Plum is back in action in true form. Someone is trying to blow her up, again... While the action heats up, so do her relationships with the darkly attractive Ranger and the seductive Joe. You can't ask for more in a romantic mystery/crime/suspense novel. This is a five-star romp all the way. Janet Evanovich should stick to the crime/mystery genre and avoid the zappy romances she writes with a partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleven on Top","review":"Any book that has me giggling all the way through to the end is worth a read. If you're looking for deep thought read something else. If you're looking for a book that will make you smile and giggle at the outrageous characters and the situations that the main character seems to repeatedly get herself into you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Stephanie Plum novel that blew me away...","review":"...and it wasn't just because Stephanie has another string of cars blowing up, or that a Cluck-in-the-Bucket, a woman with a bad temper and wicked mole, or Morelli's garage blew up as well. No, Eleven on Top blew me away because it's just that good! I laughed...then laughed harder as Stephanie quits her job as a bounty hunter and looks for something safer. It just seems that safe and Stephanie don't go together so well. She's not sure why someone seems intent on blowing her up, not sure about much...except she's going to figure it out.Add to all the blowing up, Stephanie's sister's impending marriage, her mother's new attraction to alcohol, her tug-of-war attraction to both Morelli and Ranger, her job working for Ranger, and her new hobby as sidekick to Lula's bounty hunter...well, you won't be able to put the book down and you definitely won't be able to stop laughing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest yet","review":"I've been tearing through her books, relieved that I don't have to wait a week for the next story, like you do for a favorite tv show. And though I admit Stephanie's \\"love life\\" can get a little old, it's still funny and well-written. Every book has made me laugh out loud, but in my opinion, this was hands-down, the funniest, and a nice break after the anxiety of number 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fun Plum Caper","review":"If you are a fan of the Stephanie Plum series, then you can't miss reading this and adding to your collection. Ditzy Stephanie is suppose to be out of the bounty hunter business...off the streets and working for Ranger. She's still torn between Ranger and Morelli, still having her cars blown up, running around with Lulu and Grandma, and eating donuts. It is the same same...not as many laughs as some of the others...but a good summer read anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change","review":"After reading the other. books in this series it was a nice refresher for Stephanie to change it up and look for another job, Lula is over the top as always"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Wow she never seems to amaze me on how well she can get you hooked. Way to go Janet Evanovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"This writer","review":"I love her books, fun to read....I hate you requiring us to writeso many words.... pain pain too many requirements"},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief","review":"Well, slapstick is the only word that comes to mind with this latest by Janet Evanovich....as in overworked and under-funny.The same sight gags are used again and again making it lazy writing as well.I started reading, then skimming, and finally took it between thumb and forefinger to the local thrift shop. Hope they can get 50 cents for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've enjoyed the series ... but ...","review":"Stephanie was a caricature of herself. She didn't ring true this time around. She was too silly and her situations were too outrageous to believe. I've read better Plum fan fiction than what was delivered in EOT.In fact, after reading the entire series, I'm wondering if Janet ghosted this one. It was predictable ... but that's not a bad thing if the plot is fully mastered. The 4 missing men just didn't seem to be a very important element in the plot -- and that was intended to _be_ the plot. I think the author was more interested in creating slapstick-like situations than penning a story with twists and turns for her readers to both think about, and laugh.It's true, I had a few giggles; but overall I think the author needs to re-connect with the characters she has created. Here's hoping that Number Twelve will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're into slapstick...","review":".......you might like this book. It was too ridiculous for me and didn't even raise one smile or giggle on my part.Why did I read it? Got me. I continue to read Miss Evanovich's books although I know better. Guess there's part of me that likes her work. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"I love Stephanie Plum and this entire series by Janet Evanovich, and so I was eagerly awaiting No. 11. But---I thought this was the worst one of the bunch. If Eleven on Top had been the first book in the series, I never would have read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get a a response","review":"The cassettes ended before the book was completed. There should have been a third cassette in the box. I returned two cassette packages. You keep shipping out the cassettes which are incomplete. The cassettes end on page 200 of the book. Why would anyone pay for an audio that stops in the middle of the book? Problematic? No someone is asleep at the taping. Review review review pleeeeease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better the second time around","review":"I borrowed this the instant it came to the library last year and liked it. This weekend I had to do some plane travel, needed a book, and grabbed this off the news stand. I couldn't remember if the library one had been 10 or 11. As soon as I started it I knew it had been 11, but it was sort of like re-viewing a favorite episode of a favorite sitcom. I just smiled and smiled sitting there, waiting for my flights, occasionally laughing outloud, and enjoyed it a lot more than I remember the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleven on Top","review":"Fast pace and a lot of humor make this a fun read. Quirky characters and a strong, but not superhero, female lead and their misadventures draw the reader into the story.

His presidency is falling apart at the seams at a critical moment during this election year. Where to begin? Keeping America in the dark about 9/11. An uncessary war against Iraq. Publicly supporting his defense secretary who DIDN'T DO HIS JOB. And feeding hate, fear, and lies into the hearts of Americans all over. But there's hope. We have John Kerry.

I expect nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed the book. It tells of President Bush's whole life. I liked the photos of his childhood.

The only way we knew how to put them on our cabinets was 2 cupboards already had them on, so we just looked at those and went from there. Don't start this and think it will be a quick project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your cabinets whether you can use these","review":"I am an engineer so I think I know what I am doing when it comes to the installation. Unfortunately, my cabinets are too thick to use with the product and its conventional locking mechanism. With the extensions in, the device becomes too long. Ideally, you want cabinets to be about 1/8\\" thicker than the magnetic mechanism as the magnet is not strong enough to work through wood thicker than that. When I asked the company why they don't just ship a stronger magnet with the kit, they told me that it works for most people. Given the percentage of people complaining about it on here, I doubt that its such a small problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, worth the installation","review":"These tot locks are time consuming to install, but are well worth the effort! We have solid wood cabinets in our kitchen, and they work fine for us, so I am not sure what happened with the other reviewer.Our son never pinches his fingers in the cupboards and we have yet to lose the key. we just place it on top of the stove, and on our mirror in the bathrooms.tot locks have saved me a lot of clean-up and worry. I think they are wonderful"},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds good, but...","review":"I have several knobless flat cabinets in my kitchen so i bought this 9 piece set thinking it would be the best thing to keep my little one out of cabinets. I was wrong. The magnet did not go through the wood cabinets (which are average cabinets and the proper width per the instructions). You need to use a drill to make the hole for the lock so unfortunately I did not find out that the magnet key could not read through my wood kitchen cabinets until I had already drilled a dime-sized hole in the cabinet. You also can't use it on cabinets that do not have a divider frame. You can not possibly forsee these pitfalls until you've opened the package and attempted to install it, and then you can't return it. I ended up only using 2 out of the 9. If you just have to try it, buy the starter set and save yourself $18."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hole through my door","review":"This is a horrible product. I followed the instruction, and drilled within 1/8\\" of my door front, the slightest bit past and you will have a 9/32\\" hole through your brand new cabinet doors. This happened twice so far, and I only installed 3. I also had to make a shim to fit my door as well. I contacted the manufacturer and they said you will need to buy a stronger magnet, they don't make one. They also are going to send me a replacements set, so that I can put a few more holes through my door. Unfortunately they don't send replacement cabinet doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I was very disappointed with these cabinet locks. They were difficult to install and, once installed, did not work very well. The magnet was not nearly as strong as it should have been, and I kept having to move it to figure out exactly where the other magnet is so the door would open. We took the latches off and decided to keep only child-safe things in our bottom cabinets. We're much happier that way (and my daughter loves playing with the tupperware, lids, and kitchen towels, etc, that we keep in our bottom cabinets and drawers)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!","review":"I have a lot of drawers and cabinets so I figured it would be best to start with 2 packages of Tot Lok's. BIG MISTAKE!!! They are so complicated and time consuming that the packages are sitting in a drawer opened and in a million parts! They will never get installed. Whatever you do... do NOT buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of buying this","review":"I bought this since some reviewers saying it works great but I was just so disappointed when I opened the package.Be warned: it needs a driller to drill holes in the cabinet doors to install this. I don't have any drill tool, and the description on Amazon does not even mention this prerequisite. So if you don't have a drill and don't want to spend extra money just to install this, forget about this and look for something else. And I live in an apartment and drilling holes in doors could be a questionable practice with my landlord.And I simply don't think such product designed for children should need such drill tool. It needs much simpler installation.Also as other reviewers have mentioned, the manual is absolutely a myth. You probably need some good geometrical and craftsmanlike sense to decode and install the pieces.So I have not installed the product after it is opened. Not giving it one star is because I still feel this may work well if it is installed properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Bra","review":"Uneventful transaction w/ quick shipment!

The last 1/4 of this movie is actually kinda trippy, and like Carridine says in his commentary, seems like a totally different movie.This movie was released the same year as the upbeat STAR WARS---though here there's a scene of a dead horse being carved up!!! That downbeat nonsense is partly the reason the upbeat STAR WARS was such a hit.This movie takes place in depression era Germany----though David Carridine's character has lots of money for booze and cigarettes, which is the sort of unintentional idea Bergman wouldn't want his fans to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Wide And Say \\"AAAAAGGGGGHHHCCBBLLLRRZZT!\\"...","review":"GROWTH is a sci-fi / horror film in the tradition of FLESHEATERS, BRAIN EATERS, SLITHER, THE HIDDEN, NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, etc., where parasites invade the bodies of the unwary, mutating them into automatons of doom.

Unbeknown-st to them, this island was the site of a biological disaster 25 years earlier, resulting in many deaths. Now, something is loose and Jamie and company are in for a rather disgusting shock!

Ian Patrick Williams is pretty creepy in his roll as Mason and really show me how bad old Richard Riehle is in his role as the man who may save the day. Now if your a Nora Kirkpatrick fan like I am you may have to see this flick. Nora has been in a bunch of TV shows and I think she really is the only resign to see this film. Christopher Shand is good in his roll as Justin and I look forward to seeing him in a good movie some day. But two or three good actors can not save a bad film in this case.

Checked every case to make sure I wasn't missing any discs.My copy of Barnabas' pic was signed by Jonathan Frid in red ink.I own all 32 individual DVD Dark Shadows collections from MPI but I felt this special set would take up less storage space on a shelf.Another item I would recommend to all fans: Seek out the Dark Shadows Concordances by Kathleen Resch. Those books are outstanding to read along as you watch each episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTOR'S EDITION!","review":"I am a longtime collector of VHS, LD, DVD, and BD. I have many limited collector's editions in my library. This DARK SHADOWS coffin of the complete series is a crown jewel in the collection. The weight of the coffin itself lets you know you're in for something special. With a whopping 134 discs, it comes in a boot size coffin and seems to be very sturdy. It is not flimsy like some of the recent special releases from major studios. I honestly don't know if i'll ever watch all 134 discs but it has its nostalgia place in my heart. I remember watching DARK SHADOWS in my youth with my mother, and being completely captivated by its gothic location and supernatural storyline. This Limited Edition of 2500 is already sold out and I'm sure glad I have one. I urge any collector that missed the boat, to rob a grave if you have to, but get your hands on this edition. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Vamps before they were cool.","review":"It was bigger than I thought it would be, but very cool.

When Amazon put it on sale (as they occasionally do), I bit the bullet and forked over the cash - STILL a lot at half-price. I can honestly say this is one of the best presents I've ever given myself, and worth EVERY penny. The set is beautiful - contains every ghoulish episode, the quality is fine. Handy booklet with episode summaries tempts me to peek ahead, but I try not to ;-) Extra material on many disks is especially wonderful - insightful interviews with cast and crew. Great nostalgic fun, yes, but remarkably engaging all these decades later. My partner who never watched it as a kid is enjoying it just as much as I am. Hours upon hours upon hours of entertainment. My thanks to the producers and Amazon for making it available. Kudos to Johnny Depp, but...treat yourself to the one and only, original Dark Shadows. You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough about this.","review":"I used to come home from school back in 1968 (I was 11 years old) and watch Dark Shadows. I didn't see very many episodes, but when I saw that Nexflix was showing some of them, I watched and was again hooked. I debated whether I wanted to spend this kind of money, but I'm so glad that I did.I've watched a lot of episodes, and still have many more to go. Anyone who is a fan will absolutely love this.

I just love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Shadows, the Original series","review":"I'm only up to episode 63 but it was what I was looking for for years. It is long before Banabas comes into the series. It is fun watching the boom mic shadow crossing the faces of the actors. the flubbed lines, and the melodrama with a gothic twist. I have wanted the series for decades and finally have it. You have to see it to believe it. Watch Joan Bennet blow her lines as all the actors eventually do because of the short period of time they get to learn them.You also get the inside stories of the cast and how they worked together. I have months to go before I see it all but I am enjoying a truly one of a kind show in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing discs","review":"Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)Unfortunately there are missing discs. What a disappointment considering how expensive this set is. Amazon is apparently unable to replace discs #49 & #50 that where missing from the 'coffin'(episodes 453-462 & 463-472). I received duplicate discs #53 & #54(episodes 493-502 & 503-512). The box was also missing the packing slip. I would call this poor quality control. I called cust serv and was told that Amazon is 'out of stock' so I'm unable to get the missing discs or return the duplicates without generating a completely new order. I've ordered from Amazon since 2000 and this ranks as my most bitter disappointment during this whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"I Love this show. I have looked for years to buy the dvds. I did end up buying five of them. Then, I decided to wait until I could afford to buy them all at once. When the coffin came out I was soooooo soooo excited. I waited and waited and then one day I struck it very fortunate. They had a one day sale, then I purchased it. So excited when I received it. I have already watched all of the dvds and I absolutely loved them. I am very pleased. LIke most people, I also would run home from school so I could watch Dark Shadows. So, this was the greatest gift to myself. Thank you again, Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality","review":"I am so glad I spent the money and ordered this boxed set.

Besides the giant posters of Barnabas in my room and pouring through Teen Magazines filled with articles, I must have written dozens of fan letters to the wonderful actors and actresses in the series. What a time it was!Like the other reviewer who watched on Netflix recently, being able to watch only 4 seasons left me hanging. So this boxed set is a dream come true. Thank you so much MPI for making this available. It is very much appreciated! Stock up on popcorn and happy viewing everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting crimes, the telling is long and lacking","review":"While the crimes chronicled in this book are certainly great and unsolved, the descriptions lack power of delivery.

Cooper*) The murder of Serge Rubinstein*) The theft of artworks from the Brooklyn museum*) The kidnapping of Charlie Brewster Ross, supposedly the first kidnapping ever done in the United States.*) The lost archeological find known as \\"The Peking Man.\\"*) The Borden axe murders.If you are interested in unsolved crimes in general and these in particular, you will be better served by looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fruitabu","review":"My kids just love the fruitabu.

With no way to clean it, this product became suspect very quickly. The blades stopped turning,the washer melted and a request and email to customer service resulted in the usual endless and frustrating avoidances.I would avoid this useless poiece of machinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, funny, deep, beautifully observed","review":"Right from the luminous, haunting opening, this novel's heroine will stay with you for a long, long time. Alice is as unique and touching a character as any written by Jane Austen. I loved this book. And, by the way, the PW review above is stingy. Huneven's theological musings give this book depth and backbone. Just a wonderful, wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartlfelt characters that I was really rooting for.","review":"It took me a little while to get engaged with this book, but once I gave myself in to to these not-quite-appealing characters, I fell in love with them. And I couldn't put the book down. I think the book is a very accurate reflection of the modern American (LA especially) tendency to avoid all things religious, but helps show how we also all have needs that a proper spiritual guide can help us come to terms with. In addition to a good story, the book is an easily digested discourse on religion, spirituality, philosophy, mysticism, psychoanalysis, and friendship, all slipped into the story in ways that mesh very nicely. Now I want to read Huneven's earlier book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quintessential L.A. Novel","review":"With William James as inspiration, L.A. Weekly restaurant critic Huneven has crafted a deceptively simple but immensely powerful tale about the subjective nature of human experience. A judicious editor might have sliced about forty pages from this weighty tome but overall a wonderful read with characters that will stay with you long after you have put the book down. My vote for the film portrayal of Pete Ross goes to Vincent D'Onofrio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful author","review":"I found this author by accident and I am so glad. She is awesome.

As someone who simply hasn't ever been engaged with the art world, I still found this film to be gripping. The Mullican family history is like one out of a fascinating fiction book with characters who are eccentric and enlightening. The subtle and poignant brilliance of Lee Mullican is spotlighted and well developed in this film. The more I watched, the more I wanted it to continue. Filmmaker John Mullican, presented his father's fantastical life in parallel with the hard reality of sickness and financial struggles. Side note: it's well worth mentioning the original score and additional music are brilliant, as they grip you as tightly as the visuals and storytelling. Two-word review: simply beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, to be treasured and reread often","review":"This was my mother's favorite book when she was a teenager; she couldn't wait to have children and share the book with them.

Who knows. What language does she speak? Who knows. To what culture does she belong? Who knows. She's a generic stand-in. Her teacher doesn't bother in any way to try to teach her any English, yet she magically learns it just by hearing it. Just as one (sadly of many) examples, Mr. Petrie, the teacher, makes comments about Marianthe, informing the class that maybe someday Marianthe can tell her story \\"in words,\\" as if she has no words herself.

The well rendered story line had me guessing where he was going with this apocalyptic fable. Andrew's bumbling passive-agressive personality rivals Inspector Clouseau for compentence acheived through ineptitude. Andrew battles arch-enemy Jules Pennyman with an hilarious alliance of turtles, pigs and house cats. There is no literary precedent for Blaylock's magical story telling gifts.

He tells stories with the cantor, grace, and humor of Sterling Grey. His books always have a historical and mystical feel set in the real world. The unusual becomes common place and the ordinary becomes magical. After reading Blaylock you'll look at the people around you and wonder... just what are they up to?I've read a few Blaylock books before and was delighted to find that The Last Coin takes place in my home town, visiting places that I've frequented.

If one has no experience with kundalini yoga, it may take some time to become familiar with coordinating breath, mantras, mental focus, and movement, though it certainly is worthwhile. It just takes practice time to coordinate it all. There is plenty of material presented to work with. I have taken a few months of classes with a KRI (Kundalini Research Institute)certified instructor and find the book is helping me to bring the practice home for days I do not attend class. To find an instructor in your area is advised, as I believe the class structure lends itself well to using this book for home practice.For kundalini yoga beginners I also suggest the book,Meditation As Medicine: Activate the Power of Your Natural Healing Forceas it delivers articulate definitions of the benefits of yoga for the bodymind.

They also seem to think if you try to update it you are just messing it up. Many bands have tried to take a different approach and most of them get called posers and lame. I have heard this over and over about the Kingbees and I find it sad. They were not the Stray Cats, Rockats, Blue Cats, Polecats, Bop Cats, or any cats...the were the Kingbees and they played a form of 80's rockabilly with electric bass and with tons of energy. Rockpile probably would be a closer match to them and yet that still is not a good comparison. The stuff is a little dated sounding today and \\"Big Rock\\" shows it the most with some of the lyrics, but people really missed a great band that put out two really solid records that were different and kept things interesting. They were second sting I guess, a little new wave-ish, but maybe that was a good thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"thomas brussig gets real","review":"a fine newish book from germany.... brussig has a similar bite to philip roth... facing real issues especially the german fear of being german...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readers like us","review":"I started studying Germany a few years ago, including the DDR and some of its history.This book is an entertaining fictional story set in East Germany in the 1980s for the most part. Considering the typical american doesn't have any idea what is was like \\"behind the iron curtain,\\" and because I am interested in the DDR, the setting for the story was extremely well-suited for me.Besides that, being a liberal young male helped also, as the protagontist Klaus explains his every thought on growing up, puberty and misunderstandings about those subjects that are gradually straightened out as he gets older.His obsessive thoughts and little over-explanitory details get a bit tiresome as the story progresses (the story is written in the 1st person), but I was laughing a lot while reading this one.

Seems to be a major problem with the ratcheting mechanism...the dogs that are part of the mechanism bend very easily, rendering the ratchet unusable, and they fail under light loads. I have encountered no problems at all with the straps themselves, as they appear to be well made, and performed adequately. Out of the four units that came in the package, two have bent and are unusable, the third one fell apart, and I am afraid to use the fourth one. Someone could get hurt depending on these tie-downs.

There's no real intrigue at all -- all of the puzzles are either solved or they're not, none of them have stages or long-running consequences. It starts off billed as a search/rescue/explore, but in the end it's just explore-and-slaughter, which kind of steals any sense of accomplishment from the players. (Same players different characters rather preferred Green Ronin's \\"XYZ in Freeport\\" series in which you *do* rescue the guy they're hired to rescue.)The other thing about WotC mods -- it says it's for first level characters, but it lies: we had 6 of 'em (plus a wolf) in our party and had to rest and heal 22 hours/day. When we finished the end run as level 2s -- which took *hours* and involved a ranged-dice attack on the DM -- we only had half of the party left standing [less the wolf], one of them with 1 HP. The short of it is that it's only for first level characters if the DM is a complete sadist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure for beginning players","review":"I used to play D&D; many moons ago (and, no, I'm not going to tell you just how many, but it was a lot). I now have teenagers who wanted to try it. This adventure was a GREAT teaching module for my kids and their friends. It has pit traps, trapped doors, ambushes, riddles, more than one way through the dungeon, bits of treasure all over, and many different types of monsters. Beginning players CAN get through with hack 'n' slash, but they will be healthier (and richer) with a little thought and planning (and, duh, using Listen and Search, before and after entering a room and fighting a battle).I found this adventure very well crafted (and I enjoyed the little bits of humor included for the DM). I think players of any experience level would enjoy it and new players would find it a very good way to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Entry-Level Dungeon Hack","review":"This module is nothing more than a low-level dungeon hack, but it's really not a bad one.

By the end of the reception (four hours later) you could clearly see the tattoos.Also, I was told that the make-up would not rub off onto clothing if I used the special setting powder together with the cream...

Usually when singers (or rappers) make a movie, it is subpar. But the plot was great. Even though it focused on a fictional character, it mirrored Eminem's life (aka. Marshall Mathers). This is a good movie, and it does earn it's \\"R\\" rating with language and some sexual content. So it would not be good for the younger viewers.You will really enjoy this movie if you are a fan of Eminem or enjoy rap/hip-hop. All the music in the movie is rap/hip-hop and much of it Eminem wrote himself.

Eminem did a fantastic job of acting. Even though it was semi-autobiographical he was very good. I really had different feelings before I saw it. I would also recommend this to not just teens with a dream but also an adult (Like myself).Eminem really pulled all he could out of his soul for this role and it payed off. I hope this experience will make him see a different light and expose him to other more artistic roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cliched, boring, predictable movie","review":"The acting is deplorable. Eminem has 2 forms - Angry and violent and angry and thoughtful. This is a man's Cinderella story - rags to riches- Oh, the oppression! As if he was some tortured artist with a real message.The main problem with the hype surrounding this movie is that it misleads you into thinking that what you are seeing is something original, something that has not been done a thousand times before. It promises us that the film will be frighteningly realistic and distrubing, with performances so honest, because much of it is Eminem's so-called life story.The ending is so predictable you just wait there bored, waiting for it to eventually get there, and hoping that just maybe the film will surprise you along the way. It never does. This film is an embarrassment to film making!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a serious version of 'Cool as Ice'","review":"I had to sit and suffer through this movie because I was at a party where I unfortunately wasn't driving. The only redeeming qualities about this movie is when Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him, his retarded friend shooting himself, and the over-all terrible acting. It's funny because you get the vibe that they were really trying to make this a serious account when it couldn't be any further from the truth. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I never liked Eminem and I never will. I resent the fact that he's considered by \\"rap\\" fans (really just 12 year old girls and boys) as the best ever, that's b.s. The funny thing is, he didn't even write the battle raps in his own movie! Craig G did! Any true hip hop fan knows that he is a phony and over rated (I'd be lying if I didn't say he had TALENT, but TALENT does not always mean GOOD) Anyone who knows Detroit rap history knows that this is predominantly a hokey story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Debut By Eminem","review":"The 8-mile movie is very good and I have to give Eminem props for his performance in the movie.

This movie was so incredibly retarded they should have played this just on mtv never on VH1. Why did this movies price dropped to 1 cent on amazon? because this movie was stupid as hell eminem didn't really have a hard life his life was not perfect and who's idea was it to have britteny muphy to play as kim and kim basinger to play as eminems mommy *cough mommas boy! cough*.

For those who automatically pigeonhole rappers into unflattering catagories, this movie will force you to look a little more closely. The beauty of this movie is that is does not try to be beautiful. It doesn't reach, it doesn't glorify. It shows young men and women who just want to \\"get out,\\" something that the young adults of America readily relate to. It also makes a number of points that force rap's critics to take another look at the way that language is used in rap, and hopefully readjust their views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Had Expected","review":"When I first saw this movie, I was skeptical that Eminem could pull off acting, but I was wrong. Eminem did a really good job. Maybe it was the fact that he was basically playing himself and didn't have that far to stretch, I don't know. What I do know is that I was impressed with his performance.8 Mile is a movie about a down-and-out underdog who rises to success in the rap world through free-style competitions. Feeling that his life is going nowhere, he pulls through and gains the respect he craves.Although the storyline isn't the most original in history, the movie is entertaining and does inspire you to go out and be successful, no matter who tells you that you can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Slim Shady please shut up?","review":"To me, Eminem's music is boring, aggravating, poseur schlop. This movie is no better. This, along with xXx (aka zZz) and the Fast and the Furious (aka the Slow and the Timid), go under the category of brain-dead flavor-of-the-week \\"cinema\\". I quote a reviewer of Fast and the Furious: \\"Is this what 100 years of filmmaking has led up to?\\" It's not even worthy of any more of a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth hurts","review":"Like for our lil friend maxwelle or whatever down there. I think he's confused that this world isn't perfect. And Eminem shows it how it really is. How he was mistreated and needed to find the light and he did. I sence some jelousy in maxwelle but thats his opinion. But yes \\"8 Mile\\" Looks like a very powerful film and it will be enjoyed by other viewers besides his fans. Eminem wasnt brought up like Vanilla Ice, Britney Spears, Nsync, and Mariah Carey. Eminem is REAL. He's been threw the things that he sings about. Vanilla ICE grew up in a comfortable background with a lot things growing for him. As for our other pop stars, you can just tell they had life made for them. But Eminem had it hard.

The scenes of the mc contest and stuff is really good fun to watch too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't feel it was long enough and I had a fear thing going on. Those factory scenes really made me nervous. I listen to Eminem and while I obviously don't agree with everything he says, I think he's great.I thought this movie was just another rapper trying to make it on the big screen, but when I watched it...WOW! I think he is as good an actor as he is a rapper. Of course if you don't like Eminem to begin with, your opinion of him won't be changed.I don't expect people to understand or agree with me, but the movie is quite awesome. I, however, won't be letting my kids watch it until they are much older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Eminem act is okay, well he act like himself. Britany Murphy well she seem like a drug addict, I like her as an actress, usually she act good but this time she get so much on my nerves.

This movie takes you back to one of the golden eras of hip-hop. 1994-1995 was the year that hip-hop got re-invented to what we hear today. This movie portrayed all of the positive things in hip-hop. I mean the rap battle goes back to the old school Doug E Fresh and Slick Rick days. Very solid movie. Em did his thing. I mean his freestyle at the end was tight. I don't own the movie but for those of you trying to build a better collection you need to add this one to the list.

Mehki Phifer with dreadlocks dont cut it as well. Murphy is annoying as Eminem's girl and Basinger trys her best but cant cut it. all in all im sticking with what I told and im staying there. plus its let down also by that guy who shoots himself, hes so boring. it was like I was sitting there and when ever something stupid would come on id try to go but then right after a good thing would ome on and id stay and thats what is was like when I watched"},{"rating":"2","title":"8 mile dvd","review":"thank u for sending my son loved as he christmas present. he watched this movie every time it came on and now no longer has to wait for it to run on tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than I Expected","review":"A bunch of undereducated and unemployed (or underemployed) losers waste their lives (1) either rapping or hanging out with their rapping friends in hope something will rub off on them, (2) riding around aimlessly (3) bemoaning their fates as they do nothing to improve them. It used to be dreams of basketball success that mesmerized so many young black urban males and left them with nothing--apparently now it's dreams of rap music success that ensnare too many young black urban males (along with some young urban white trash) into worthless lives. The whole scene is just pitiful. Eminem can't act, by the way--he has exactly one expression: sullen. After seeeing this movie, I'm more convinced than ever that rap is nothing more than a cute vocabulary-based parlor trick. It's not music, and this isn't much of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good until I matured","review":"When I first saw this movie, I liked Eminem and his music. This was before Lose Yourself become a hit and his 3rd cd came out. I cant stand this movie anymore because it made me realize Eminem is out for sympathy and money from his fans, and they'd eat the crap that comes from ass. Eminem fans are sick, people who worship and like him are the dumbest people on the planet. He had talent and wasted it on a film about how hard his life was, even has 50 Cent's life story coming to a theater near you! Im so sick of Em and his life story, its been over played and so many other artist have suffered worse then Eminem. Who cares about the thousands of artist who suffered worse then Eminem in there life but they keep there mouth shut and dont release it to the public for money like Eminem does."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW...........NOT.","review":"Who is watching this stuff and giving it so much praise.

Hell I've been in plenty of gang fights my self and I know that after that many guys jump you, you end up with more than a black eye. My point, it just doesn't feel real at all.

This movie droned on and on forever. I was waiting for the good part but finally gave up hope. I believe this movie only gets good rating because people are obsessed about eminem's career and are bias on anything that he puts out. Thats a problem with people these days, but back to saying how bad this movie is well it can be summed up in a few words.It Sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a disappointment","review":"I am truly amazed at the number of good reviews and hype this movie got. Eminem should just stick to music,a nd please, no more horrid sex scenes! The best part of this movie was the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"What is the world coming to? To watch this poor excuse for a movie is to feel ashamed to be a member of the human race. M&M's character has a lousy life and an alcoholic mother, but is that any reason to turn to rap music? This movie has no plot, little acting, lousy, stilted dialogue and all-in-all is a load of unmitigated garbage. I feel sorry for those who worked on this picture. Now they've got it on their resume. You know what I'm saying??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"8 Mile SUCKS","review":"This movie sucked. Eminem sucks at everything he does. His 'music', if it can even be called that is just pointless ranting and everything and everyone that has done him wrong. Worthless actor, worthless rapper, worthless person. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why ?","review":"8 MILE, Was somewhat of a good movie. I thought the movie was trying to be too much of \\"PURPLE RAIN\\". I think Enimen wasn't even acting, if this was a somewhat of a true story then he really wasn't acting he just playing himself. The soundtrack is just awful except that one song they play all the time. The ending was dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 Mile is one the best movies of 2002","review":"Before I saw this movie, I didn't know much about Eminem, but when I saw 8 Mile, I knew where he came from and it changed the way I looked at Eminem. 8 Mile is the story of this young rapper named Jimmy \\"Rabbit\\" Smith Jr. who live on one side of 8 Mile, this cultural line that separates Detroit. He goes back to live with his mother who lives in a trailer with her boyfriend who is a trailer-trash loser and Jimmy's sister, Lili. He starts writing the song \\"Lose Yourself\\" and hopes to make it into a demo. He works at a factory and falls for his boss' sister. But the real story of this movie is that he enters the rap battles at the shelter near his house and faces the champion. 8 Mile is a lesson of hope, courage and inspiration. I truly recommend this movie even if you're not into rap music or Eminem, who gives a powerful performance. 8 Mile is a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than expected","review":"Having grown up in Detroit and having a friend who did the same job in a Detroit factory, I was saddened and disgusted. What a sick, twisted movie. And why Kim Bassinger lowered herself to appear in this slice of urban garbage I'll never know.And the lead character has a dog meets girl relationship while doing his job. This isn't anything worth noting in a positive way. It is an example of the bad role model as bad role model mentality that is being sold to the public, and a mother that's an immoral or amoral person who's the same.I never bought his music, only heard some. Don't waste your time and money on this. Minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie would not download. Buffering issues","review":"Movie would not download. It was very frustrating to watch.

I opened the mail box thinking it was another DVD and there it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eminem can act, as long as he's playing a rapper.","review":"He won awards for this? I mean, come on! That's like giving Adam Sandler an award for being Adam Sandler. Basically you hear profanity every 3 seconds. His mom calls him bunny-rabbit because of his teeth and thats why he hates her. Big-deal. Go watch American Beauty, Goodfellas, Scarface, or This is Spinal Tap instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Bad","review":"Picked up this movie after hearing all the praises and decided to find out what all the fuss was about. Simply put, this movie is simply aweful, the editing job of the film was horrible and there were some scenes in which made me go \\"what the hell was that?\\" What made it worse was that I didn't like the overall character that Eminem plays...simply put the main hero is just a wuss. The rap battles were alright and there were quite a few...but made me realize that the rap battles were all scripted just for the movie, which loses the credibility in when these rappers spit out their dissing rhymes. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"My head hurts...","review":"My brain, eyeballs, and ears all ached miserably after watching this vile piece of garbage. How anyone could enjoy a movie that glorifies the thug life, and demonizes decency is beyond me. If you want to keep your brain cells, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give credit where credit is due.","review":"First, I'd just like to ask moviefan2002 a quick question. Did you even see the movie? \\"Rabbit\\" doesn't work at the club, he works at a plant. Brittany Murphy is NOT a prostitute. There are a million other things that makes me think you didn't even see the movie, and if you did, you obviously weren't paying attention.Anyway, this movie was, in my opinion, very good. I even shed a couple of tears. It really helps you understand the way people live in Detroit (especially on 8 Mile Rd.), and hopefully it will make people think twice before they hate on someone they don't even know. (Eminem, for example.) I don't claim to know him, but I sure appreciate where he's coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Simply put, this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. The first 45 minutes is absolutely horrible. I didn't care about Jimmy Smith one iota, mainly because the first 45 minutes has absolutley no relevant dialogue. Most of the time I was dumbfounded at the lack of anything going on. Eminem's acting was alright but the script was either horrible or non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I'm a pretty big Brittney Murphy fan and I like Eminem well enough so I was optimistic going into this movie. What a let down and it justn't isn't because I'm not jiggy wit it either. This film just tanked all around and short of fire, I don't know what could have saved it. I just couldn't bring myself to give a Brittney Murphy movie 1 star. Maybe you might like it, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunny Wabbitz is played out, YKWIS?","review":"Can you believe M&M was bandied about for an Oscar nod for this? That would have been COLD, Vanilla. I was almost embarrassed to hate this film because it's actually too much of a joke; a vanity piece NOT to be taken serious. My eyes rolled back every time Kim Basinger appeared on screen. What a sad choice she made taking this part, but as actresses age, well, you sometimes have to take what you can get - that's the cold, ugly truth. And what about Em's \\"co-stars\\". Did the director tell each of them: \\"Alright, now in every scene that you appear with B.Wabbitz you have to act a fool - that is, obsequious and fawning beyond all measure, because you know, he's M&M\\". I give it 2 stars for interesting cinematography and that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving tale of Eminem","review":"To be perfectly honest....Im not the biggest Eminem fan but this movie which chronicles the period in Eminems life when he was down and out is a stirring, gripping tail of a talented artist discovering his potential. He battles homelife, poverty and quasi gangsters and ultimately becomes the winning underdog at the freestyle rap battle.So pick it up today even if you dont like Eminems music, youll root for this underdog thats for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST HIP HOP MOVIE IN A LONG TIME","review":"EMINEM PLAYS A RAPPER NAMED RABBIT WHO'S STRUGGLING IN HIS LIFE AT HOME IN DETROIT AND IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF IN DETROIT'S HIP HOP UNDERGROUND CIRCUIT. GREAT MOVIE FROM BEGINNING TO END. THE RAP BATTLES ARE GREAT, IF NOT THE BEST THING ABOUT THE MOVIE. AND PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MOVIE IS SOMEWHAT BASED ON EMINEM'S LIFE. EMINEM DOES A GREAT JOB PLAYING HIMSELF IN THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE INCLUDES APPEARANCES BY; PROOF OF D-12, XZIBIT, AND OBIE TRICE. FOR HIP HOP FANS, THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Sick-Looking People In This Film","review":"As I was watching this movie, I noticed that there were a lot of sick-looking people. The majority were 'blacks' and one 'white' guy. I don't understand why they didn't pick healthy actors. They seemed really sick. Also, I felt Mekhi Phifer's hairstyle was horrible. It was very distracting. I would change this movie for something else, but after 24hrs there are no refunds or exchanges from the store. On a lighter note, if you love hip hop you might like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 mile","review":"This movie is great it is my husbands favorite he had a obsession with eminem thanks for a great deal and shipping was awesome tha ks again"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie an rapper","review":"Good movie well worth buy. Eminem is the best rapper out there even tho some would not agree with me about that"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was an awesome portrayal of young, up-and-coming rappers. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the language was just too vulgar (200 \\"f\\" words if you can believe it). If it wasn't for all the language, it would have got a 5. But I still enjoyed the movie. Eminem is a good actor (if you can believe it, he does a phenomenal job!) and the rest of the cast supported him throughout the movie. ...check this movie out! It's very interesting, but keep your little kids far away from it. This is strictly for ages 16+!"},{"rating":"1","title":"8 mile","review":"8 mile will take you about 105 minutes to watch it. For me these 105 min were way to long and I was glad the movie was finally over - even though the morale story (if it had one) wasn't that bad.It is a story of a young rap singer who defeats his anger and obstacles through music.I didn't like it (almost) at all! Even Kim Basinger and cute Brittany Murphy don't look the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Everyone has been saying that Eminem is a terrible actor and that people have only been seeing this movie because he was in it. However this movie was actually very good, and still would be no matter who is in it.The only problem was that Alix(Brittany Murphy) wasn't really in it a whole lot, and she wasn't really a big character.Over all this movie was alot better than I thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story.","review":"The movie was pretty good, I mean Eminem is a good actor in this film. The story was alright A white rapper in Detroit tryin to make a career for being a good rapper. In the beggining of the movie Eminem is in a rap battle but then get's nervese. Although this movie is deffinatly a rated R film, and I am not talking about the bad words and the alchohal/drug use neither there is some scenes that have hardcore sex. It doesn't show anything but It is better to stay safe. but its is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot","review":"I was not very impressed with this movie. Unless I am blind, I didn't see a plot to the movie and if there was one it was weak. Kim Bassinger's character was not as good as I know she can do. And to top it off the movie just ended, it's like we just saw a few days of Rabbit's life and that was it.I'm glad I borrowed this movie instead of paying money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward movie","review":"Eminem is not an actor, and though I give him credit for not ruining it by trying to act in the movie and instead being himself, he sticks out when put in a movie surrounded by actors. All other characters appear relatively vibrant, bordering on flamboyant... like actors in a movie. And he seems like he's just a pedestrian passing through. I think this is an example of a poor idea given to decent cinematographers, to project the movie's tension to the viewer.In the end is a movie with an awkward feel, and I don't feel like I gained anything watching this over, say, just reading his story online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, marginally entertaining road to fame","review":"Eight Mile is a stylish, gritty and often explicative-filled movie that is sorta interesting if you are into rap or Horatio Alger, or want to see Michael Shannon beaten to a pulp by a young Eminem or see Kim Bassinger as a drug addicted mother. Let it be said that Eminem is not much of an actor. Still, the movie is bleak, brisk and upwardly mobile enough but I wouldn't pay more than $3 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a good film, well acted","review":"Despite the teenage angst, a bit of sex and lots of cussing this is a great coming of age film about a boy reaching beyond his surroundings and life and making something good for himself. Eminem is a brilliant song writer and in this movie he proves he can act too.I realize that lots of his music is controversial, but as I watched this for the second time recently, I also realized a lot of our kids are listening to him. Word for word. My son and his friend could sing along with much of this movie, so I think it's worth paying attention to what he has to say. Doesn't mean I condone all he has to say or all he does, just means I think he's worth listening too.The movie, if taken out of the context of who Eminem is and what he does, would still be a really good film, the fact that it's semi autobiographical really makes it interesting and entertaining at the same time.I highly recommend this film to any that aren't prudish and think it's worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone, certainly not for me..","review":"To some this movie may be as deep as the Atlantic Ocean, to me it's about as deep as a pot hole full of brown water. Frankly the rap battles became tiresome early on, Brittany Murphy was wasted in a boring role in which she displayed morbid facial expressions while being hunched by Eminem, also Kim Basinger's melodramatic part didn't help matters. As for rap superstar Eminem's acting, it was fine. Believe me I wouldn't have any problems bashing it if it wasn't. I was under the impression that this was sorta based on Eminem's life, it's not. Or if it's supposed to be, it's simply dishonest. So in closing.. if you like rap music with an undying passion or aspire to be a rap artist, \\"8 Mile\\" may be worth your while. Otherwise ~just say no~.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem's big movie debut","review":"Eminem proves he is an outstanding actor and makes the story unquestionable.B. Rabbit is a noone with plenty of ambition as well as his vocabulary intact, but when you're growing up on 8 mile it's not easy becoming anything, less alone a white rapper. He can't even bring himself to challenge the local rappers on stage during the weekends. In the middle of him trying to land his breakthrough he finds himself fond of the ambitious, but ditsy Alex (Brittany Murphy), but she turns out to be bad news for him. Will he stand the challenge of the Free Worlds Gangsta Boys?It's a good storyline (nothing new, but you haven't seen it 10 times before either).Brittany Murphy disappoints in this movie if you've liked her previous movies. This is Eminem's acting debut, but not his autobiography. It just goes to show he can both sing and act and IS truly talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 MILE","review":"AWFUL, never received the DVD, never got answers to my emails.AMAZON finally refunded my money.

Then all throughout the movie Em' and his homeboys roll through the city doing dumb stuff. But the ending is completely annoying, it needs a sequel on it to show how the rest of B Rabbit's life went on to be. Good movie, could have been better.

The score is great, and the direction isn't bad, either, but the writing is horrendous. Why must the characters stand around giving each other speeches? Michael Rossi, the new school prinicpal, is the worst. Every time he opens his mouth it's time to pull out the soapbox. Hardly a word of the dialogue in the movie is crisp or realistic. Dialogue such as \\"In a way I've always felt that way, but I'm just now realizing it. . .\\" pepper the entire film.

You weep with Selena Cross, with the incidents with her father, and you cry with Allison with her problems with her mother that we all go through at that age.

The interesting thing about this battle to me was how the Germans first assaulted the island with Fallschirmjager on a large scale.

Halfway thru the night the pad was wrapped up and around his shoulder -- that's not likely to catch any pee. My son is a calm sleeper.

Takes nice photos and is very compact, however I will never be able to use this camera again, since as of this week the LCD screen has fractured for the second time. The first time I sent the camera in (this was about 2 months after purchase) I naively believed that the camera was under warranty (as it was supposed to be) and the screen would be fixed. Canon told me that it was my fault the LCD screen broke - even though the camera was kept secure in a padded camera bag and was never dropped. I tried fighting that but Canon was resolute, so I ended up paying around 130 dollars for the repair. In order to prevent this problem from happening again I attached a 1/8th of an inch plexiglass protective screen over the new LCD. That worked fine until last week when out of the blue, the same problem of a crack in the screen appeared again. Not going to repeat the same mistake twice...

It has dents and scratches exceeding the description.Normal expectation is that the camera would come with at least a limited operating chip. It had none.The battery is also defective, retaining a charge for only five pictures.

This is completely contrary to all of the reviews I read. I did hours and hours of research before buying this camera (Thanks a lot, C-Net).Now, 13 months after I bought it, I find myself just arrived in Peru, and here for the next three months, with no camera, because the lens is jammed and the camera won't even turn on now. So, I either have to buy some weird brand of camera here in Peru for three times the price, or not have any photos of Peru at all. Actually, I can't even buy a camera, since I don't have the money for it, so I guess the photos will only be those in my memory.My advice... buy something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannon Powershot SD600 - amazing little camera","review":"The camera is actually amazing.

I normally shoot with a Nikon 35mm camera and a Nikon D70 digital camera using many \\"high end\\" expensive lenses. Most of my Nikon lenses cost much more $ than this camera did and I am impressed. I purchased this SD600 to use in my boat and other places where I did not want to carry my camera equipment worth many thousands of dollars and now I find myself using the SD600 more often than I ever expected. This camera can not replace my Nikons and telephoto lenses to photograph wildlife or birds at a distance, but I will be carrying this camera everywhere I travel for all those unexpected shots or when I just want to travel lightly and freely.

The camera was taken on a trip to Italy a week after it was purchased. It returned with hundreds of great photos.Note that it is worth purchasing a 1GB or higher memory card from the start.

Even though my camera is now 5 years old, it still takes clearer, sharper pictures than many of my friends newer cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Little Camera!","review":"The key to great pictures is having the camera with you when opportunities arise. How many times do you not have the DSLR when a great shot is available. For those of us who don't have time to go looking for photo ops, the key is to have a camera thats always with you.This one takes great shots in every kind of light (has ISO 800, is every bit as versatile as anyone but a pro could possibly need, and is one of the few in this size range to keep an optical viewfinder. That means that a single battery can last through an entire vacation if you use the optical viewfinder for daytime shots. I carry one spare battery, a 1 gig SD card, and can travel anywhere, taking hundreds of perfect shots, because the camera is always in a shirt pocket or on my belt, and I can go days without the need to recharge a battery. And if you replace your memory card with a high speed memory card you get the pictures taken even faster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best camera I've ever owned!","review":"If you're looking for value and picture quality, then the SD600 is a perfect choice.

Dropped this camera once inside my house on carpeting and that was it. It didn't fall hard and it didn't land with the lens out.

I fiddled with all the adjustments but any shot with white in the background gets washed out. Also, the colors are sort of washed out, too.However, the worst part about this camera is that the \\"shake warning\\" icon is displayed when using any amount of zoom.

What I wanted was a thin camera with good optics and a manual viewfinder. It has all of that. What it is missing is a lot of the controls for adjusting aperture and shutter speeds. You can control ISO however. It is good for a snapshot camera or for someone who mostly works in auto mode. The flash is too bright for near objects as I curretnly have it set up. I'm still trying to figure out if I can adjust that. I especially like the speed at which it comes on so I can capture action shots easier. I like it a lot, but it doesn't serve all of my needs. It does however work well on about 80 to 90% of the shots I take. It makes for a great vacation camera or a camera to carry on business trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This is way better than my old 3 megapixel Sony camera. Lots of various \\"scene\\" features. Makes very nice detailed pictures and the LCD display is nice and large. It takes short (well actually as long as you want/can fit on your disk) videos that come out really nicely.The only downside is images at night still come out pretty crappy. It could be that I'm a camera lighting idiot but I'd think that if there's a \\"night\\" feature, the images would come out accordingly. The bizarre thing is when you are focusing it looks like all lit up and stuff but when the photo's taken it's all dark. Yea that part I don't get. I'd probably have to delve deeper into this. However, it's a good camera, very compact and easy to use.The only thing to remember is to buy yourself an SD card. You won't be getting anywhere with the 16mb or whatever that comes with it. I bought myself a 2GB card, fits lots of pics & videos on that thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This little camera is so lightweight and takes very good pictures.

Even in daylight the pictures are blurry with noise. In fact, just about every photo I've taken has been no good. I took comparison shots with my previous camera -- Canon IXUS 4.0 -- and the IXUS pictures were better by a longshot.I was happy with the performance of my old IXUS, but was looking for a larger display. Unfortunately this new IXY is a big compromise on quality. Looks like my experience is out of the ordinary (except for the first reviewer), but I'd just like to warn people about this. I've always been a big Canon fan, and I'm unsure what to do about this camera since the warranty is in Japan only. Looks like I'll be taking the old camera on my next trip instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to be very useful","review":"If you only care about the quality of pictures taken in the day and don't want to zoom in or need more than 2 GB on your memory card, the SD600 will do the job. But I want to zoom in more than once, zoom out from normal, take pics in all lighting conditions, and use a 4 GB memory card. This camera will not let me do any of that. I decided it is time to buy a new camera when I was unable to use a 4 GB SDHC memory card on my last vacation. My mom has the newer SD1000 and it takes the SDHC memory cards, so this clearly is an age-related problem. Low-light conditions not only make pictures look horrible, but sometimes make picture-taking impossible, if you don't manually set it for a night or indoor shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A luck thing jumping price","review":"I purchased this cam for my wife in 2007, I wanted something inexpensive but gets the job done.

Oh, I would like to also add, I purchased this camera new for $213.51 on 2/5/2007, the price tag on it now is steep, more then double, no longer and inexpensive camera.

I used it non-stop for about 4 hours and the battery didn't even get low.- Huge LCD! (you can adjust the brightness)Cons:- The controls seem a little small at first. If you have big fingers, you might be frustrated until you get used to it.- The video recording looks good, but for some reason, the audio cuts out every few seconds. Which kind of makes it useless for videos. It's like listening to a cell phone call that keeps going in and out. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAMERA","review":"THE CAMERA IS VERY SMALL AND TAKES GREAT PICTURES. I HAVE HAD IT ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND HAVE ONLY USED THE VIDEO MODE A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT IT SEEMS ALRIGHT. THE BATTERY HAS A LONG LIFE,I HAVE ONLY CHARGED IT ONCE BESIDES THE INITIAL TIME. IT HAS ALOT OF FEATURES AND IS PRETTY EASY TO USE. THE DATE STAMP ONLY WORKS ON THE POST CARD MODE AND AT TIMES THE CAMERA IS ALMOST TOO SMALL TRYING TO ZOOM AND TAKE THE PICTURE. ALL AND ALL A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom is simply good","review":"Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoomis simply the best and easy to handle, operate by any one including kids.The features are fine.There is nothing more required for the worth of that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Cameras","review":"I have three of them and they are very useful for my work. The picture quality is good for the size of the camera. You can even do good videos. They only handle smaller capacity SD cards. For pictures, thats fine but for video, about ten minutes is all you are going to be able to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this camera!","review":"We borrowed a Canon PowerShot Elph camera from my brother on a recent trip to the Grand Canyon and LOVED IT! It was so easy to slip into our pocket and carry with us. The view finder made it easy to see how our pictures were going to look. Even our 7 and 12 yr old boys found it easy to work with. The picture quality was wonderful and we were more than pleased with the results. So the day after we got back from our vacation, we ordered the SD600 for ourselves - what a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This camera is an excellent product. Small and light, easy to handle and does great, great pictures. The big display is also awesome. I highly recommend this camera for all who are looking for high quality, but a small, light and easy to manage piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photography novice recommend this camera","review":"Great camera, sturdy, durable, and popular. At one point on my honeymoon my battery died and I was able to borrow someone else's battery for the perfect sunset shot! I look forward to figuring out the bells and whistles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"I've been using the camera for about 3 1/2 weeks and so far it's been wonderful! It's a great size for your pocket and the large screen on the back is fabulous to see how your picture looks while it's still in the camera. I've put it to the test in two extreme conditions, an outdoor winter picnic in Western New York and an indoor water park. It produced great photos in both of these extreme circumstances.it's a great camera for the money. This is my 2nd canon digital and I'm very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this camera","review":"I got this camera because it got great reviews.I am more than happy with this camera, it takes excellent pictures both day and night. What I like most about it is that you can take pictures without flash without worrying about being blurry. This camera is known for taking moving-target shots.There are lots of options and features with this camera, cant go wrong for $200. Excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own the tv cause tragedy thrills me","review":"This is an excellent camera. I've rarely used a digital camera before so this being my first one is really great for me. I know nothing about cameras so I need to work on messing around with some of the features but I'm not in a rush with the auto feature helping me take fairly decent pics. The quality is excellent and really sharp.The flash is what I don't like although it will be better when I know how to use it well.When I put the camera in my jacket pocket I don't even know its there sometimes because of how light and small it is.I couldn't decide whether to get two 2gb cards or one 4gb. The consensus I found was that two 2gb cards is best. Being that if the data got corrupted, you'd only lose half vs all of your work. The way I see it, I'd rather take my chances and go with the one 4gb card vs having the inconvenience of switching cards all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"Large viewing Screen for such a small (pocket-sized) camera. Great response time. From the off position... the camera turns on and takes a picture very quickly. Lag time from pressing the button to the picture being taken is one of the fastest I've experienced. Great for action shots. Lots of options including a 10x zoom for video (pictures are only 3x zoom)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice camera.","review":"Great camera .. takes a very nice picture and decent video. I didn't want to spend the money to get the extra stablization, but this one does a pretty good job. A stronger zoom would have been nice, too, but the camera is definitely a good quality and has lots of nice digital features. Stock up on SD cards, though if you're going record videos. They take up a huge amount of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"It's a really nice and sturdy camera. Pictures are almost perfect and often shows more details than you would like."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"Though some pictures are blurry at low light level, most digital cameras seem to do this (without Image Stabilization, that is). The wonderful 2 inch screen allows you to see the high detail images. Pictures taken up close at the face are high in quality; the smallest hairs are visible.The SD600 is much lighter and thinner than the SD550, which is sort of round and bulky.I love this camera no matter what anyone says. It was a great birthday present!Lucie Fama"},{"rating":"2","title":"SD 600","review":"This is my first digital camera- I love it - it does more than I could imagine...

With shipping etc it's just not worth it. next camera won't be a Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"generally good, but...","review":"As photocamera, it is rather average.As videocamera, it is worth moneyMain Pros:1) Very good video quality. In fact, it may well replace your old videocamera.2) Easy pushed buttons3) Big screenMain Contra:Photo image is a bit fuzzy for me. I tried different modes, and it is still fuzzy. Before, I had Kyocera 5mp camera and in similar conditions the image was much more distinct.That Kyocera camera was a bit heavier but of similar size, so the small size of the Cannon itself seems to be not a primary reason for the fuzzy image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Power Shot SD 600","review":"This is my first digital camera and I just enjoy using it. Very easy to use and has a lot of features that I haven't used yet but will one day. Love the size, quality and large screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera but a little complicated","review":"I looked around at several stores and looked at quite a few reviews before I selected the SD 600. I am not disappointed at all. My only suggestion would be to make sure you read the manuals (there's three or four). I had always considered myself tech savvy. I had fun just playing around and trying different things, but it wasn't until I actually read the manuals that I learned exactly what this camera could do."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't seem worth the price","review":"instructions were horrible for such a simple product.if you are used to opening your screen door easily, you will be disappointed.it definitely adds a lot of resistance when opening. despite getting the tension as loose as possible, my wife and kids all noticed the door was way harder to slide open.the pro is that you can adjust how slowly the door closes which is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"great voice not so great songs","review":"This guy has a great voice, unfortunatly his compositions do not make good use of it, and they lack a deep beat. it's good coffee house background music, but I bought the album for the song 'bad things' and unfortunately, if I HAD an IPOD, that would be the only song that made it to that media. I love his baritone voice, I'd love to hear more of it, but the rest of the album is kinda mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Rock at its Best!","review":"Loved it!

Most of the recordings you would think are being played by a black harlem band of the same period.This CD is a great little find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work from a new author!","review":"I found Mark Collantes' The Academy to be an excellent work of fiction. I have a very hectic schedule, and knew it was a great novel when I couldn't put it down. His characters are well developed and dynamic. They evoke passion from the reader as you find yourself rooting for cerain ones and loathing others. The plot pulls you in, but the characters make you stay. Overall, a great find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prairie River Book","review":"The whole Prairie River series in one of the best I've ever read. I've loaned mine out and have bought the whole series for other children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too \\"Techno\\" for my taste!","review":"This CD takes a great Cuban folk song and turns it into a techno dance number. While some may find that interesting I find it annoying. It does have some value though. The second of three mixes is closer to the traditional sound. And of course, its great if you want to dance to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else (A Drummer's Perspective)","review":"I bought this on the satisfaction of the first volume alone. I made a big mistake. If you want to see great drumming, I highly recommend you buy the first volume.If you want an unknown cover band with world class drummers who aren't given solos (just extended fills), then this is the DVD for you. There is very little actual drumming highlighted in this video. The best drumming is actually not shown so they could feature a voodoo scene. The Clark Brothers TAP routine was quite refreshing but failed to resurrect this purchase.I've rated it ONE star because ZERO was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointing!!!","review":"Vol. 1 was good. This 2nd Vol is HORRIBLE. You wouldn't even know that this volume was about \\"drumming\\" if it wasn't for the title of it.Not even worth wasting my time typing about it anymore......."},{"rating":"2","title":"great textbook","review":"This is the texbook I had in college. It was and still is great, but for one...being a textbook ...it is more theoretical and two, it lacks certain areas. Nevertheless, it is very usefull. I would complement it with a book that I have recently read: Heads In Beds - hospitality and tourism Marketig by Ivo Raza. This is very practical and covers the areas that are missing from Kotler's textbook like Loyalty marketing, COOP with Touroperators, targeting travel agents, creating promotional materials, development, etc. Combined, both books truly give a complete overview of the complex travel indutry and should be the foundation for people studying or working in travel and tourism."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!!","review":"WARNING!!! Stay away from MARKMONTANABOOKS at all cost! The seller is not TRUSTWORTHY and will RIP YOU OFF!!! I purchased a textbook from the seller in the beginning of February and needed it ASAP so I paid for express shipping which means I should of got my product at most 3days later.... 22 days later I finally received the product to just find out that he gave me the book that was not as advertised. If I wanted to give away my money I would of just gave it to a worthwhile cause like Red Cross! Hey con artist I want my money BACK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"Watch out for those sellers that have a very high satisfaction rate, i think its mostly sellers who rates themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Try to look for the low satisfaction rates to find what the real buyers think)......... You have to be really careful about who you are buying textbooks from, there are a lot of United Kingdom sellers that will advertise one thing and send you the book either extremely late or will gip you off somehow. I think amazon should work on taking out the non-trust worthy sellers from their list or they will lose a lot of customers. Not satisfied at all!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Area 51 real or fake","review":"The video of \\"Secrets of UFOs: Area 51 Base\\" was well done with alot of information to support the video. There was alot of people who I have seen in previous videos likeUFOs & Area 51: Secrets Of The Black Worldwho said the excact same thing and must have taken the video clip from this one and used it in this video. This video is in the same series asSecrets of UFOs: Roswell UFO Crashand some of the information was the same. It was produced and made by the same company. Overall, I was happy with the video and thought it was a good review and summary of what I already have seen previously. It is a must for any UFO seeker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up there with the best CDs ever issued","review":"Honestly, this is a real winner. Dramatic orchestral pop at its best. Also Great, but not mentioned in the review above, is Christy's 'Deep Down', from the film Danger:Diabolik. The great thing about the entire Canto Morricone series is that it focuses on his really great themes, such as 'malamondo', 'se telefonando' and 'metti una cena a cera'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected and fun.","review":"I bought this book at first because I too have a strange passion for Volkswagens. I was thoroughly delighted when I discovered that Mr. Nicholson had a great story to back up the VW obsession, once I got over the horror of destroying all those VWs that is. The strange cast of characters and their individual motivations are brilliantly woven together. The amazing thing is that even at it's most confusing and destructive I didn't want this novel to end. I look forward to trying his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Me (My Discovery Book)","review":"This book is excellent. I am a day care provider and order this book every year for the month of September. What better way to start the school year off then with a book for each child to learn more about themselves. This book teaches them about feelings, long and short, large or small, sequencing, putting items in groups, riddles, and manners. This book is great and easy to use. The kids love to have their own book that they can take home when they are finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"elmo toy","review":"Bought this as a present for my niece.

It was just as described ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby loves to hug Baby Elmo!","review":"We bought this for our 8 month old baby (even though it is marked as 18 months and up). He absolutely adores it! He will lie down next to it or put his head on Baby Elmo's tummy. He loves to hug him. It was a very rewarding purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much meat","review":"This book fell far short of my expectations. Not much meat for $40. Seemed more like a pamphlet than a book. I was expecting more design information that would make it possible for me to build my own expandable house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"This item is excellent, It's very easy to use, has some very good features like pronouncing words at the click of a button, which as you know the Bible is full of tough ones, also individual word meaning at the click of the same button. I find it an excellent value for the money I put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I purchased this game for my daughter and expected something much more durable. This is a very cheaply made product and design. I ordered it because my kids love matching games and this looked like a neat idea for the game. I was expecting more of a \\"flip\\" action and the pieces to be secured to the board while playing - However the game pieces are plastic pieces that you have to put the stickers on and they just lay on the board (which does not \\"flip\\" very well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memory game for young ones","review":"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves this game. She plays it almost every day and if she can't find someone to play with her, she'll sit and play by herself. It's better than your standard Memory game where you just place cards out in rows because the board keeps the discs in place while you play so your rows don't get all out of place. But the discs are small and I am waiting for the day that one goes missing. You do need to be very careful and put them back in the ziptop bag when you are done playing to keep them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great matching game","review":"My daughter LOVES this game. We have played it countless times. She received it for her 2nd birthday and at that age she was a little too young for it, but in just a couple of months she got the hang of it. She even likes to play it by herself. I would definately recommend this. I am very glad I bought it. It is one of my daughters favorite games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incendiary","review":"This book was excellent and a real page turner. The method of telling the story as letters to Bin Laden was brilliant as was the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could barely Finish","review":"I just had no sympathy for the main character. It started out so great, and then just went down hill from there.The woman had huge issues, and I could not find anything to identify with.I forced myself to finish it, and did not care for the ending either.My review is I did not like it b/c while a horrible thing happened to the main character, I never really felt anything for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant experience","review":"I purchased this book because of Little Bee. I wanted to read another book by the same author. I did not like the experience. To make up a horror to rival the twin towers was not what I wanted to read. There was no redemption in the characters. Interestingly, I shared this book with a couple of my more eclectic reader friends. They had the same negative reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Pleased","review":"Overall I couldn't wait to put the book down, reading it was a terrible experience. I had to read this as part of my college program and I can say that I would never want to have to examine it again. This book brought me into such a depressing train of thought, it made me feel awful inside and out. I honestly don't think I learned anything from the book and I couldn't connect to any of the characters. Unlike others the writing style didn't throw me off and neither did the bad grammar and punctuation, I purely disliked the story. It wasn't my kind of thing is all, some people will love it while others hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"I made it to the middle of the book and finally gave up. The author just lost me on all the unnecessary sexual descriptions he insisted on writting. The character is unlikable and most of the other characters were just flat out sick puppies. I have noticed that this book has a Book Club Readers edtion. Notice to Readers Clubs all over: don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time to read!!","review":"The cute writers turn becomes incredibly overdone! Character develpoment is poor and not believable! Definitely not worth your time to read! Just because Cleave wrote a great first book, does not, evidently, make him a good author!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentlessly Pessimistic","review":"Reader beware! This is a relentlessly pessimistic novel that does not have a single admirable character and very few redeeming actions. The letter to Osama is a \\"cutesy\\" device that completely fails to achieve its goal of imagining a futuristic, post 9/11 world because its characters are so horrific, if not psychotic, to start with. It is hard to blame terrorism on the complete unraveling of people who were crazy to start with. There are flashes of humor, and the theme of class warfare is clear, but these do not offset a horrifying point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read but...","review":"A clever idea and very cleverly executed. I found the book difficult to put down and some of the imagery is extremely effective. My only disappointment was that I found parts just a bit over the top. There were, for example, some things that I couldn't believe the characters would have been physically capable of doing. Also there were a few rather detailed sex scenes which I found a bit over the top. But setting those two thing aside this is a clever book, with some neat and satirical observations about humanity. I will certainly read it again and would recommend it - though you do need a fairly strong stomach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"utter drivel","review":"I have no problem with complicated protagonists, but this female, who has lost her husband and son in a terrorist attack on a soccer game the moment she is in the throes of passion with another man, is the least believable female character I have ever read. Her character's rambling speeches give street-smart insight into human behavior, life in London, etc. Yet in the next paragraph she makes decisions no woman would make, even if she is suffering absolute grief and PTSD> It just doesn't make sense. The nail in the coffin in this book is that none of the characters are believable. Unless they are all pathologically narcissistic (maybe that's the point??), and incredibly inconsistent about it, all of their interactions are utterly unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost didn't finish this one....","review":"\\"Incendiary\\" is a tale told as a letter from a London working class woman to Osama bin Laden. She has a husband who is in the local bomb squad (detection and dismantling) and a son, \\"four years and three months old.\\" She tells the story of a bombing in London and its impact -- on London and on herself.Though the narrator is not supposed to be that educated, the poor grammar and continual run-on-sentences make the narrative hard to follow. (Yes, I've heard of stream-of-conciousness, but really!) She is not someone we could learn to like, or even feel for that much, because of her bad choices. We almost find ourselves wanting bad things to happen to her. Though I'm sure this was not Cleave's purpose, this narrator actually comes off giving readers a poor opinion of working-class people. Also, the story was just plain harsh! Granted there was no gentle way to tell a story like this, but Cleave goes too far. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I was assigned this for a college English 101 class: be warned, it is full of sex scenes, terrible grammar, and a COMPLETE lack of morals. I am going to complain to my college; are we supposed to be LEARNING from this???!!! If you have doubts, read it yourself. The average good person will be disgusted by 'Incendiary.' This is the SLIME off the streets of London, the CAUSE of the stench from its back teeth - and the rest of the world, as well.Some try to say that this book is a story about survival: it's not; the main character is completely destroyed, and ends up almost murdering people and going LITERALLY crazy. One of the three main characters is killed by police for pretending to have a bomb. The main character sleeps around with anybody (self-proclaimed) as a way to deal with her stress.GO FIGURE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly intense","review":"If you want a cheerful novel, this isn't it. I couldn't put this book down even though there is the horrible event that can actually take place in the world today. The characters are flawed, without a doubt. Some are strong even though we the reader get to see their imperfections and insecurities. The rhythm of the writing, which is the voice of the main character who loses both her husband and son in a terrorist attack, takes some getting used to and adds to the tale as it's often a stream of thoughts. I found the book very intense, impossible to put down, and one of the best books I've read in a long time. As I said at the start, this isn't a book that's wrapped up all neat and clean with a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced Strength and Applied Stress Analysis","review":"I have taught Advanced Strength of Materials at three different universities and without a doubt this is the worst textbook that I have ever used or seen. The text was selected before I started teaching at New Mexico Tech and I did not have time to change before the semester started.

The first half of this film is just like any Bollywood movie...these two young carefree but upright people meet and somehow develop a very strong inner attachment to one another...aka falling in love. Then the film takes a more interesting turn by dealing with very practical matters like...the economic status that the two don't share. Shahrukh is from a poorer background while Rani is from a wealthy home...and his ego breaks easily. All the promises of premarital bliss turn into the harsh realities of \\"pick up your shoes\\" and \\"what happened to promises of making me breakfast every morning\\"...how the rest unfolds is a bit slow and you do lose a lot of interest by the end of the film...but it is still yet another fun adventure with a Bollywood couple for a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I am a huge fan of indian movies, which can be long and sappy. Even as a fan of long and sappy, I found this movie boring.

Reading this book together gives us the chance to stop in a very busy season and wonder about things bigger and more important than wrapping and running. The message that defines perfection is a life lesson we all need.I will be purchasing this book to give to my children's families as they marry and begin their own Christmas traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated, beautiful message","review":"One of my all-time favorite Christmas stories.

They were into the romantic prog stuff, but always according to a personal taste, which was helpful during their jazz excursion, by means of unusual instruments like horns, clarinets, trumpets and so on. Moreover in the istrumental track \\"Fase\\" you find a good \\"Frippian\\" guitar in between, alternated with classical breaks through; and naturally the english version of this album is equal to the original songwriting: in fact some english people told me that the english vocals are performed with a good english accent and it's OK for the international market...

Contact Susteen (Software manufacturer), and was told to upgrade to the latest version. Then I had a error installing latest version - contacted Susteen again, and was told how to by pass the error. Installed the latest version, and some of the feature start working half. Such as downloading picture from your camera. I cann see the files from the software, but cannot save them in my computer.

Maybe I am missing something here but the back of the tape promised that...\\"The authors show you how to link creativity to learnable skills; recognize the power that connects creativity with the universe;...recover confindence and courage in order to overcome hurdles\\". This is indeed a tall order, and I didn't really expect it all, but this tape delivers nothing! It is a poorly done recording of a seminar given by Julia Cameron and Mark Bryan. There is no real information given on what their idea's are or how to use their methods. There is just a lot inane banter and list making. An example, which was done several times over the course of the tape, is that they ask for you to write what an artist is over and over (we are talking ten times in a row!). This is all there is to the tape. I didn't find it helpful or even interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Content - Very Boring Don't waste 2 hours your life","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This was an awful audio book. I listened to one tape and it was very boring and I got nothing out of it.

Unfortunately, I don't think too many people are going to care. First of all there are no new games coming out for the system. The back-lit screen is nice, but it eats batteries (6 AA's last around 3 or 4 hours). And the physical size of the unit is absolutely huge. About the only good thing the system has going for it is the low price. But even with the low price I still don't believe it is worth the price of admission. The money would be better suited going towards a GameBoy Color (or a GameBoy Advance later on this year). The GameGear wasn't worth the money when it launched 9 years ago, and it still isn't today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you want to buy one of these today?","review":"I bought one when they came out, and they were better than the gameboy and gameboy color, but not gameboy advance.The GBA has a sharper screen, much better graphics and sound.It is smaller and more comfortable, takes less batteries and lasts longer on those batteries.

Otherwise these are newer and may have less of a chance of breaking due to age...Also:If you like the Genesis, Majesco makes a console called the Genesis III which is a re-make of the original Genesis (there was a Genesis II made by SEGA for awhile but due to competition from Nintendo, failed)"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"it is a large tapes up alot of bateres game system.

For starters, it's large, fairly heavy and requires six AA batteries (which it will eat in about 5 hours.) Almost all of its games are conversions from the Sega Master System, and they feel tired and lazy. There are some great games for the system such as Shining Force and Sonic, but most of them are very forgettable.I find the Gamegear to be near the very bottom of the portable systems totem pole (really only the Game.com is worse.)

My older son really enjoyed this and now my younger son does also.It is great for trips in the car and the screen is very bright both for daytime and nightime viewing.One caution, get the car adapter and a rechargable battery pack if possible.

Well it was THE most advance portable game console then, even rivaling the Super Nintendo in graphics. I respect Majesco's effort to remake this portable wonder but I personally do not think it will work to well. Here are the reasons.1. It's simply just to bulky. Can't fit it in a regular pocket.2. System is still great but with no new games coming out, the games kinda stink.3. Lack of style.4. Let's face it the Sony PSone is about the same size and if you get the battery pack and LCD screen it's only a little bigger. Hellavu lot more expenive though.5. Pretty poor durability. Don't get me wrong it can take a beating but the screen scratches VERY easily.Well, that's about it. If you are willing to dish out some more cash than go buy the PSone with all the accessories.

(You get audio but no picture)3) The case is not as studery & the brightness control is hard to turn.So if you have never used a GameGear before & want an inexpensive portable game system, than go ahead. If you want to replace a warn out, broken, lost one, than this would be an inexpensive alternative. But if you have the TV Tuner, and LOVE the classic game gear than you sould either look for a used classic one or get your's repaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best system","review":"I think Game Gear is the best hand held system invented. Unlike the Game Boy you can see the screen even in the dark, it doesn't matter if you have the light for Game Boy(color/advanced) the picture is still horrible. Game Gear's screen reminds me of a t.v. screen because you are able to see in the dark with out a stupid little light attachment. When I was about 7 my mom bought one for my brother and I, and we have had it for about 9 years now and they are still running perfectly, they were perfect for us because we use to bring them with us in the car and on planes and they made time fly by. Some disadvantages to it would be that it is a little larger for a hand held game and it does tend to eat up 6AA batteries but if you buy the adaptor than it is no problem to use, and since it is a older system it doesn't have new games like the newer system but for the games made for the system I think they are really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're in for a treat!","review":"If Majesco makes this in the same quality that Sega originally did, you will love this.

If you think that medicine is only driven by science, not ideology, you need to read this book. If you think that men and women have equal access to healthcare, you need to read this book. If you think that male and female diseases are equally well understood, you need to read this book.

But Satel allows Torrey, who most vilifies them, to define what survivors mean when they use the term (mental health) survivor about themselves (p 46). The National Association of Consumer/Survivor Mental Health Administrators (NAC/SMHA) is not a subcommittee of MadNation (p 46). Pat Deegan is not a Portland colleague (p 47). National Council on Disability (NCD) is the correct name (p 49). Subcommittee on Consumer/Survivor Issues is the correct name (p 53).

Since I like gadgets, I had to purchase. Works very well. Have to be a little careful when putting the blade back in the housing after cleaning, so one doesn't slice the skin between the thumb and finger. The positive is, you know the part between the blade and the housing can be cleaned unlike with some pizza cutters.

It is a waste of your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely a \\"better mousetrap\\"!","review":"This tool has earned a permanent place in my semi-infamous 35-pound toolbox of cooking and baking tools that has replaced my old knife bag. The lack of a lever/handle results in a more direct transmission of force, and so easier cutting. While uncooked dough is usually easy enough to roll through, we've probably all seen a cooked pizza that was not properly cut through. This tool makes easier work of pizzas, and I've also used it for cutting angular shapes out of sheets of rolled fondant. Despite taking it apart for cleaning on a very regular basis, it still snaps back together tightly and rolls without a wobble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, doesn't last","review":"I have owned 2 of these slicers, a white one and a red one. I love the look of this slicer as well as the ease of use and the way it fits your hand perfectly. I first saw this slicer being used by Alton Brown on the Food Network. It worked well for all the things he used it for, slicing pizza, herbs, noodles, pie crust, fudge, etc. The only thing it won't do is last longer than 6 months. Both of mine broke in the exact same place, right in the center where it supports the cutting wheel. When I got my second one I was extra careful with it thinking maybe I was too hard on the first one. It didn't matter, it broke in the same place. I wish Zyliss would build this exact same slicer made completely of stainless steel, I would pay $50 for it. Are you listening Zyliss? So now I must search for a new slicer, proably will have to settle for one with a handle so it will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after a couple of uses","review":"Everyone who I know had this pizza cutter loved it. However, this pizza cutter was difficult to open to clean. When I twisted it open, the plastic holder broke, rendering it useless. Will seach for a different design. I was disappointed. I like my other zyliss products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly made","review":"We bought this cute little pizza slicer because we make pizza once or twice a week and were drawn to the ergonomic design. The fact that it takes much less space in the drawer is a big plus as well.I'm sorry to say, however, that after 1 use it cracked on the hinge. We superglued it back together and were able to get 3 or 4 more uses out of it before it cracked again on the other side of the hinge and was no longer able to be salvaged. I'm not a very strong girl and am quite sure that the amount of pressure applied was average or below average. This product was a disappointment because we really were looking forward to having it, but we will go back to using our OXO pizza cutter that is metal all the way through and has continued to slice pizzas for many years. I'm sorry that I cannot recommend this product (really wanted to like it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"I used this pizza cutter for several months and didn't love the design. I found it awkward to use, but it was sharper and made much better cuts than my previous cutters that I stuck with it. It was really difficult for me to open and clean, but again, I made do. I was cutting a pizza the other day and it snapped mid-swipe. I'll admit, I do make more than the average amount of homemade pizzas, so it stands to reason that a cheap plastic product was bound to wear out sooner rather than later. I'd recommend this if you're the occasional pizza maker but not for someone who makes so many pizzas the cutter might as well live by the stove. I'm going to replace it with a more substantial cutter (and yes, invest more than $10 in it) that has a more typical design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to cut pizza!","review":"This pizza cutter is a better desogn than normal pizza wheels because your hand is directly over what you're cutting. That gives you much more leverage to cut through crispy crusts and control to cut straight lines, which I guess is only important if you really want to make sure your pizza slices are the same size.I like using this cutter so much, I use it to cut my kids' frozen waffles for breakfast in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"stock up, in case they stop making them.","review":"I love this pizza slicer! when ever friends are over and see me use it they want one. I love that you can pop the blade out of the casing to wash it too. Cutting anything with it is a breeze and takes no effort because if the styling. 2 thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design is difficult to clean","review":"This pizza cutter is more difficult to clean than other normal ones because the pizza (or whatever you are cutting) gets caught inside the housing. Although it comes apart for cleaning, it's way more of a hassle (and a bit more dangerous) than a traditional style where you can just hold it by the handle and wash the blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I do not like this item.

I find it wonderfully intuitive, nicely drawn, and as many of my readings are done for first time querants or who are simply nervous about Tarot in general, quite friendly. However, the book, as one reviewer pointed out, is a little too happy fluffy bunny. It ignores reversals and some of the fairy tales aren't quite right (the the Three of Swords, it states that Hansel and Gretel set out to explore the forest, not that they were deliberately abandoned by Dad and Step-mom). Of course, the stated purpose of the book is to help adults teach children how to read the cards, so I expect that has some bearing on the cheerfulness of it.

To read this book, you'd think that the army treated Black troops unfairly, disproportionately selecting them for dangerous situations against a people who were unconnected with them. By invading the south, hadn't North Korea proclaimed themselves enemies of people everywhere? Certainly the UN thought so!!! As for their treatment by the Army, the 24th had the same nco stripes, promotions and pay grades as anyone else. General Kean, 25th division commander, tried to get the 24th 'out' of combat, not put them 'in' combat. He said they were so unreliable they were a constant threat to troops on their flanks.

I traded it to a guy at the flea market as fast as I could after watching it. This movie is as mindless as the zombies in it. We all know that a good zombie movie can be so thrilling and scary. The best of the movies created a cult following and turned it all into a zombie genre. A movie like this could end up halting production of other zombie movies. I hope I never see another movie with someone carrying around a camera documenting action. These movies do nothing for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME ON!!!!","review":"Given that Mr. Romero has made four previous films based on the zombie apocalypse, it is puzzling that he decides to go the route of a plodding cast with no chance of being remembered. The strength of previous actors prevented the other movies from falling into outright farcical material; the actors were flawed yet endearing. This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept. It is my hope that better research can be done to prevent Japanese people from giving advice on killing zombies: Japan has a no gun policy, so shooting is out of the question. Oh. my goodness, this should be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of the Dead","review":"This is actually much better than Land of the Dead and a great addition to the saga of the dead for George A.

Like when national guards rob the people on the road and when hunters practice shooting on dead women and men with different kind of weapons. ''Are we worth saving''? The movie could be done much better in the same style. I have nothing to say about actors, but that they were okay. This movie gives away no atmosphere and it's an okay choice to spend 1 hours. I don't agree with the cover for the movie, where it says ''masterpiece''. It is Romero's worst movie to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst by far","review":"I hate to give 2 stars to a Romero film but this film is so bad,i love romero satire and criticism but he have to balance this like he did in his first 3 films,they had all that but they were scary too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAD high hopes for this film...","review":"Unfortunately, this film was terrible in all regard.

George Romero should have quit making zombie movies after he made \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". The acting is bad, the plot is lame, and is it really necessary for him to scum bag the Army National Guard?

At all. I couldn't relate to them, I didn't want to hear them talk, I wanted them all to die. And from there, we get what George Romero must have thought would be cute: a homevideo style chronicle of the start of a zombie outbreak. It was sort of interesting to watch at points, seeing the background reaction of the media and everybody posting to youtube and all that. But it ended at sor t of and never grew. It didn't provide anything new, and I mean if George Romero is going to plaster his name right there in the title he better back himself up with something that will make me think some more about the genre. Even a little. I didn't. It's all stuff that I've either seen on tiny low budget movies, read in novels or short stories, or hell even just read on a typo filled message board. It was so flat and uninspired.I did have some hopes for this film, but they were all dashed.

I at least try to look for elements that satisfy me, even if I know the movie is generally viewed as a stinker.This movie would just not give me five minutes without thinking something along the lines of \\"oh my goodness this is SO bad.\\"I think I even said it out loud a few times.And it all comes down to the acting, really. I hated the gimmick (a movie within a movie), hated the pacing, hated the same old OMG HUMANS ARE WORSE THAN ZOMBIES schtick.. But the acting! The lead actress in this one, I don't know her name (I will check now that I think about it, so I can avoid her in the future) delivered the WORST performance I have seen in a while. There was one decent actress in this movie, but she only appeared for the first five minutes.The few fun zombie slaying scenes were NOT worth the price of admission. Avoid this movie like you would a roving gang of zombies."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful attempt that could've been good","review":"Simply put--this starts out terribly and continues to spiral downward. You have college students making an amateur film that's, get this, a horror film. Strike one right there. Romero could've made this believable like Cloverfield did--make them doing something else, something normal, like simply filming a retreat on a camcorder. Plus, when the dead start to come to life, the band of students don't even act scared. The only normal response was by one girl who attempts suicide...and hey, what do you know, she comes back as a zombie. They go to a hospital, and no one's there. So what do they do? They scream \\"Hello?\\" Slap a big label on these losers that says, \\"Zombie dinner\\". I dunnno--normal people would be freaking out really bad if this was happening. But these kids stand around and say, quite calmly, \\"What do you want to do?\\" I'm givning it two stars because the first ten minutes are pretty intense. But that's all you get.

Living in the technological age, I get pretty tired of it so I really don't like it being the premise of this film. There were good jumps (when the zombie came up from behind in the hospital, still dragging the I.V. bag along) and tense moments, but the actors left much to be desired. I love the way Romero never divulges what causes the dead to rise, and the last few moments really make one think about humanity and just where it is headed.

I usually expect good things from Mr. Romero and I was curious as to how he would pull of the camera documentary part of the movie. Well the fact of the matter is that he did not pull it off. This movie is an interesting concept that had the worst scrip I have ever even heard of anyone writing. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Through the whole movie, the hero is pointing his camera at the action while his friends are being mauled by zombies. At one point the hero is yelling \\"CUT, CUT, CUT,\\" at a zombie that used to be an actor to try and save some girl instead of bashing it in it's decomposing head with the camera. This movie's only redeeming quality is that it is a great flick to watch while drinking with some friends and making fun of it, because it is absolutely terrible. The whole video diary format is just too limiting for a survival horror movie. Save yourself some cash and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie's horrendous! what a LETDOWN","review":"Maybe I should give this another star, BUT the three stars was the reason I had hope that it would be good, so i went out and rented it. I only barely got through 30 minutes then i turned this off. THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE. It would have been better if it was improv maybe like Blair Witch. And the thing that pisses me off about these movies (cloverfield) is that they SHOULDN'T BE 100% ALL THE TIME SHOT THROUGH THE EYES OF THE GUY HOLDING THE CAMERA. they should use regular shots sometimes. Wow, and the reaction and motivation was TERRIBLE. No one cried when they saw dead bodies, it's like they couldn't fathom what was going on.

The documentary style comes off as really corny and it just seems really unoriginal to me. And the satire?

Honestly, it is SERIOUSLY lame compared to earlier efforts. There are some well-done FX shots, but the pseudo-Blair Witch approach doesn't make it, the characters are flat, to say the least, and Romero's trademark social satire is out to lunch. One could say that the proliferation of zombie knockoff films has taken the edge off, but (let's face it) there is really no edge left anymore. And if DIARY is meant as a spoof, as some people insist, it misses the mark there as well. Forget the glowing reviews from FANGORIA and elsewhere, as those clowns have endorsed a lot of truly horrendous junk over the years.

Extra footage, about 30 minutes worth, not shown on television is included here. A fine keepsake for fans. Still waiting for the collection of videos, but this is a nice place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABBA: Behind the Music!","review":"This was the story I always wanted to see as an ABBA fan... what was REALLY going on.

Next three lots of scrap didn't come out so well. Despite carefully following the (somewhat minimal) instructions that came with the kit, and repeating the test several times, the eBay buyers informed us that we had made a mistake and they wanted their money refunded (naturally we waited until we received the returns and made absolutely certain the buyers had returned the exact same items sold.)

They scratch the piece and place the acid directly onto the piece if it bubbles then it is electroplate, if it rolls off then it is Gold as marked, really how can you just scratch the surface of anything and tell if it is actually pure or not, especially onto a black stone and be expected to tell what color its changing. What a waste of time and money not to mention the amount that was charged to ship, more expensive than the kit itself.

I currently own 7 Scooby Doo DVDs with 3 more on order. However, Reluctant Werewolf has got to be the worst Scooby Doo movie ever! It totally departs from the Scooby Doo formula of solving mysteries and unmasking bad guys in monster suits.Instead, this movie is about Scooby, Shaggy, Scrappy and Googie entering a road race with monsters. The whole movie is about the dumb road race from beginning to end and nothing else. The rest of the Mystery Inc. gang like Fred, Daphne, Velma and even the Mystery Machine have been completely left out.As a Scooby Doo fan I feel totally disappointed and cheated. I advise all Scooby fans to stay clear away from this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE - a repackaged movie from the worst in American animation","review":"My family is a big fan of the new Scooby Doo movies - we also love the original series.

Bad jokes, bad animation, stupid monsters, annoying support characters like Googy. (God forbid they even made Shaggy a little annoying this time.) Horrible, meandering plot, no mystery to solve, and no Fred, Daphne and Velma to help them even if there was one. And what's with Shaggy's ORANGE SHIRT? Shaggy should never be in anything but a green shirt and that's all there is to it. Even my three year old son who lives for Scooby Doo won't watch this one anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf","review":"A great classic Scooby doo movie than fans of old Hanna-Barbara storyline will enjoy. The only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is the one problem I always had with story concept. Dracula needs a werewolf but a midget werewolf is seen among Dracula's crew of monsters throughout the entire film. From kid to adult that always bugged me a bit. It a wonderful story where Shaggy wears his alternate red shirt and Googie his girlfriend is a great new character to the Scooby Universe.

My 3 year old was bored (that is not saying much), but so was I. The best thing I can say about this movie is that Shaggy makes an adorable werewolf. Very cute.

I am glad I did. I figured going in with low expectations would allow me to enjoy it. The cover is a little misleading in that it looks like there will be some sort of relationship between Eva and Christian, there really wasn't. It wasn't a cheesy romantic comedy, which I had thoughts of suckering my husband in to watch. I am glad I didn't b/c he would have been asleep very quickly. On the other hand it was a light hearted look of what happens when an old school traditional town (where the men do all the work and the women tend house, children, and bedroom) has the men removed (except the priest). It does not take itself too seriously nor should the viewer.

Compared to the original Matrix movie, these sequels are a disappointment - too long, convoluted script and sometimes ridiculous dialog, wooden acting, etc., but to make things worse, the sound quality on this DVD is very poor.

It is very difficult to catch the subtle tone inflections of the speaker. Have you ever tried to talk to someone with loud music playing in the background? You always ask them to turn it down so you can understand them right? And that is when they are speaking the same language that your are!

Often we could tell just by the opening whether it was time to change the channel for ten minutes or not.It's horribly tiresome that whenever Daffy appears on dvd in the last ten years the majority of the discs are crammed with this late material and not the work 1937-1946.I won't be purchasing this one but I hope Warners will collect the early best of America's second favorite duck on a future volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's \\"Daffy's Southern Exposure\\"?","review":"Still waiting for WB to release classics like \\"Daffy's Southern Exposure\\" and \\"The Hen-pecked Duck.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why doesn't Warner Bros want my money?","review":"The only reason that I will not be buying \\"Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl,\\" and the only reason for my 1-star rating, is because someone at Warner Bros decided to use matting to cover up the tops and bottoms of most of the cartoons on this DVD.For example, in the original version of \\"Design For Leaving,\\" Elmer Fudd is shown sitting on a bus, and we can see his face through the bus's window. But on this DVD, we can only see his mouth and the bottom of his nose.Warner Bros claims that their reason for doing this is because that's what the artists originally intended. I very much doubt this claim. Why would they draw Elmer's face if they never intended for anyone to be able to see it? Furthermore, none of the cartoons on the six Looney Tunes Golden Collections are matted, and no one ever complained about the fact that those cartoons weren't matted.I bought all six Golden Collections.

I was especially looking forward to \\"Design for Leaving\\" (the one with Daffy and Elmer Fudd and the modernized house with the \\"not the wed won\\" button). Unfortunately, the bulk of these shorts have been cropped to fill a widescreen TV. This is absolutely ludicrous! Much of the artistry of Looney Tunes is in the beautifully composed scenes, and much of the humor comes from the way the characters interact within the space. Now they're awkwardly zoomed-in and, in some cases, are missing essential pieces of the frame (which included sight gags and other storytelling elements). Why spend the time restoring these when you're only going to reveal about 65% of the frame? Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropping ruins toons","review":"Yeah, there are WB apologists out there who are just happy more Looney Tunes have been released on DVD. Yeah, there are some toon fans out there who say cropping does not bother them.But cropping two-thirds of the cartoons on this set was a completely unnecessary thing to do.

The top and bottom of the shorts have been cut to adapt them to widescreen format. This makes them unwatchable as bits of the action and animation are missing, the image looks cropped and you keep concentrating on the missing parts. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE viewing. Plus I must say the image restauration doesn't look as pristine as the Golden collection series.What is more unsettling is that Warner Bros keeps doing this all over again, tampering with content (censorship, cropping...) showing no respect at all for intellectual property but most of all no respect whatsoever for the customer. It is disgusting.Sadly I can't recommend the buying of this product and its sister : the Bugs Bunny superstar. The viewing is really uncomfortable, and the fan and collector is not respected by Warner. The product is not worth the money it cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an incredible letdown for Looney Tunes fans.","review":"Mandatory, inappropriate widescreen. No extras.

You know, before the 60's regime ruined him by turning him into a bitter, foul, Fowl. Pairing him with Speedy Gonzales & such other nonsense. Picture quality is pristine & the sound is crisp & clear.

Truman minces no words and is mildly profane when discussing various subjects. Tell me, Mister President, what did you really think of Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower?In their own small way, books such as this helped rehabilitate the reputation of Truman. At the conclusion of his presidency, he was not especially popular with the public or the leaders of the Democratic Party.

The original amount was $32.08 and When I received the refund, it was for $21.21. Quite a difference, especially when I had to pay for the return shipping. I would never buy from Technology Galaxy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful garbage","review":"The movie \\"Fist of Unicorn\\" is complete garbage, badly made and rottenly acted (at one point, there is a stuttering duel of all things). The fight scenes are not very impressive, despite choreography by Bruce Lee. In the English version, Bruce Lee is supposedly showing off to Unicorn Chan in the opening sequence but, wouldn't you know, they use a double! Unicorn himself is not much of an actor, but he is a graceful fighter.What is really pitiful is the DVD itself: there is no trailer for the film, despite user comments, only trailers for \\"Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth\\" (shown twice!) and other Bruce Lee rip-offs (even a trailer for a Ron Van Clief film). The documentary of stunt men who knew Bruce is translated by someone with a lazy drawl for a voice - you'll think it was intended as a joke. The only plus is the 72 photos of Bruce shown - for that, buy a book of pictures of the martial-arts master but not this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does a blind man sleep?","review":"I haven't heard this album yet, so I can't tell you whether it's good or not.

All characters are on a Ford production line in the 50's, hate their job, have no real friends at work or off, have dysfunctional marriages,no joy in life. A really gray depressing existence. The author's use of hyperbole to show what a terrible life it is to be \\"On the Line\\" comes across as communist propaganda. I had to read this for a masters history course. If you don't have to buy this don't, unless you like being depressed by your reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I just finished watching this movie. It is slow, yes, but it also lacks any REAL plot line, PERIOD. The actors lack skill except for the lead Jasmine who may have potential with time. The scenes did not connect and were extremely choppy. It is my strong opinion that the other reviews MUST be connected to the producer/writer/actors in order to give any kind of positive review. This movie is truly sacrilegious, blasphemous, and disrespectful to the Church and God. I am not a \\"holy roller\\" but feel that there should be some things that are respected and not mocked.

I am so so very sorry i paid a dollar to watch this thing.

Reading this series of books has spanned over 30 years for me, and now my kids are enthusiastically reading and enjoying all the antics of the Chalet school girls. While other school stories of this era were avoiding all mention of the terrible War, this book \\"jumped in boots and all\\" and made the lives of these characters come to life as the real events of the world and the fictional lives of these characters were intertwined.

In addition, the story which could have been interesting instead was turned into a big circle which went nowhere. The characters were meaningless.The author tried so hard to pile layer upon layer of deceit that he ended up piling layer upon layer of schlock instead. There is a reason why you've never heard of this book. Basically, I think this book was an attempt by the author to show that he had been to Poland. I'm sure the Poles were happy to see him leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, watch the little hands","review":"The reason books like this one are so great are the moving parts that entertain kids so much.

A good review of alot of what happened but not terribly complete with the whole story.This movie makes you realize how talented Michael Moore is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cause, bad movie.","review":"The content is good, Susan McDougal is a hero. Some good footage but this is a poorly made movie with campy ganster movie footage and stuff from old westerns spliced in to mock and provide a little movement.Its good to recount the whole whitewater thing but so much is left out.

I am grateful that someone has told the story so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WELL DONE DISCLOSURE OF POLITICS FOR WHAT THEY ARE","review":"I am an independent, and this film gives an in-depth look at the campaign by the Republican right to destruct the Clinton presidency. Now any story is going to be told through a particular perspective, and this one is no different. But pro-Clinton does not necessitate it as propeganda, all films have an agenda. Overall, it is informative, cohesive, and eye-opening. I am generally disillusioned by the majority of political culture and this film illuminates the grim reality of how distorted the priorities of the powers-that-be can become."},{"rating":"2","title":"BONUS feature is alone worth 5 stars","review":"Many DVDs list bonus features which take up less screen time to watch than their description on the back cover takes to read....NOT the case on this DVD. The Bill CLinton appearance and speech after the screening of the movie ...which is shown as a bonus feature....is a Half hour speech which covers a great deal of territory and regardless of your take on the movie or subject matter is GOLD as a document of a President that is loved and hated as much or more than any President in recent memory. As an American ...it is certainly a worthwhile investment at a much larger price than Amazon.com is asking."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hunting of the President\\" missed the mark","review":"The material was powerful, Morgan Freeman's delivery was great. However, the cartoon/old movie clip material was frustratingly off-point and distracting.

He used his office to get others to lie. The two people caught up in that drama that were telling the truth(Starr and Tripp) were savaged. Clinton fixed a court case in order to deny his accuser a fair trial and these umphs make a movie to garner sympathy for the slick one.

To think that millions, 65 million exactly, was spent on trying to undo Bill Clinton's presidency.

The rest of the albums tracks are made up of a couple of pretty boring and predictable political rants. Not that I don't agree with the politics, but as far as music goes, these tracks don't do much for me.

I was so impressed with him that I eagerly looked for more books narrated by him. Being a Stephen King fan, I was thrilled to find Mr. Muller has also read several of his works.I read the Breathing Method years ago and was intrigued and impressed. Hearing Mr. Muller's interpretation has only added to my love of this novella. He is an amazing narrator!! I cannot say enough how much he adds to the experience of reading. He makes it a very personal, visceral experience, as if he is an old friend, sitting reading to you right in your living room. You will feel as though you are in the story. If you like King, you will love this version of The Breathing Method...

Instead it's just simply \\"okay\\".

It's like he couldn't decide if he wanted to be more hardcore or more mainstream so instead he ends up being neither.

A blessings to anyone who would read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I gave this a 4 only because I assumed this was a \\"how-to\\" book, more or less, and it turned out to be more of a \\"motivational\\" book for (unassisted) home birth. Well, there's one other reason, I didn't care for the emphasis on only having Dad present, as opposed to a midwife as well. Mrs. Griesemer made it seem like husband/children were the only ones women had present at birth throughout the centuries which simply wasn't the case.If you want an unassisted home birth but are nervous about it because of what others are saying, I do recommend it. It's a good book to make you more comfortable with home birth in general (assisted or not). But it's not a \\"how-to\\" book. Other than those two issues, I did like the book and found it helpful with my own (assisted) home birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this book but...","review":"This author had a very strong bias due to living in a state without a strong midwife system. All the points she made against midwifes (based on anecdotal evidence) were never backed up like most of the points in her book. A lot of her points all stem from the fact that there were only 3 available midwives for her birth (one who was to be out of town during her due date, one who was too far away, and one who she had a personality conflict with.) The remainder of her anecdotes focused on ONE midwife who had never attended a birth where the mother was in a particular position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book! Highly recommended","review":"I must admit, my first thought upon hearing that Lynn Griesemer was writing a book about unassisted birth was, \\"What more is there to say?\\" (I had also written a book on the subject).

Lynn's book is full of interesting insights, tips, observations, suggestions, and stories about this most intimate \\"act of love.\\" I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning not only how to take their own birth into their hands, but their own life as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book deeply rooted in reality about birth","review":"This book is a definite must-read for any woman that is thinking of conceiving a child or who is already pregnant. This book is not \\"on the fringe\\", despite its slightly shocking title. ;) It is a book for all women (and the men who love them) about how to go about getting a birth that is satisfying for the couple, as well as ensuring the most safety for mother and baby. It is a real book that tells the truth about what you're really gaining, and missing, when you leave the OB and the midwife knocking at your door.One thing I really appreciated was the chapter devoted to men's experiences of birth. This is a topic not covered in many other books, and definitely not in this kind of detail. Every woman knows that it's one thing to talk to a woman about birth, and a total other thing to talk to a man about what they want. It is their baby too, and this book is written for the couple.I will be buying this book for all my pregnant friends to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unassisted Homebirth ; An Act of Love","review":"This book is wonderful resource for parents searching for an alternative to the fear-based obstetricly managed birth culture today. Lynn Griesomer does an excellent job of presenting the pros and cons and reasons for and against this contravertial method of birthing.

His profanity just takes away from the album having a chance to be a hit, in fact it's a major turn off.

It's future jazz at its most profound and sublime, with sweeping strings and Jocelyn's vocals soaring above them and the broken beat rhythms.

I reload his site about 20 times each day and am thoroughly convinced he has the best news and politics site on the web. I also like his radio show.That being said, however, this is a horrible book. Completely disorganized. Highly repetitive. Very little to say. (Evidenced by the fact that the last 20 or 30 pages are merely copies of e-mails sent to him by readers).I know Drudge is intelligent. Anyone who saw him fend off the sharks at the National Press Club luncheon can vouch for that. But you wouldn't know it reading his book. If he writes another book, I doubt it will sell 1000 copies based on this performance.Bottom line: Pass on this one.

This book reads as though Drudge had a book contract to fulfill, was down to a deadline, and just cut-and-pasted randomly from his hard drive. If there is a pattern to what he has written here, it was not discernable.

I think after a read of Drudge's book one would conclude that at the very least a good high school education could've done him no harm.

Fact-checking, Drudge grouses, is a tool of suppression.He's so successful he'd be due a little respect -- if he weren't so irresponsible. That, in fact, is what's so damning about this book: a sleazy, quote-bending interview with Gore's nanny; smear after smear thrown at legitimate news organizations.

I hadn't given it enough thought that it was being canned by entertainment types and owned by corporations. No wonder Ted Turner can control anything and everything, he owns half of TV, and also owns portions of the movie business. He can't afford to offend his advertisers or Jane so the news can be controlled if only for AD revenue and not to offend the liberals. It made me depressed to think about now there is a 60 day period to test the networks that gives them liberty to endorse candidates and therefore present the news however they want whatever slant they want to give to it. Will we ever be able to decipher the truth without bias? TV doesn't think we are able to make a good decision so they have to tell us how to think and how to vote. I don't like it.

In reality, Drudge has less credibility than the National Enquirer. He cannot tell the difference between rumor, tall tale, paranoia, or truth. He splats them all out there.

Hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but this book is too hard to read. disappointing","review":"Sure the character of Matt Drudge is unique and reminds one of Walter Winchell, and I have read his website sometimes, although his politics are not mine. But after I bought this book I tried to read it three times, and even just tried to skim it a few times. I failed. Didn't it have an editor? It's layout and style just do not match my reading style. I recommend you thumb through the book at a bricks and mortar store before deciding to purchase it. What I did read was not interesting.

One of the things you catch right away (impossible to miss with the constant repetitions) is a huge \\"who cares what ANYBODY thinks about me or what I do\\". Unfortunately, this seems to bleed through into his attitude toward those reading his book as well.

It doesn't tell you how to write a speech or do's and don'ts about writing toasts. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book for this, buy The Best Man's Handbook. It has way more useful information on speeches and toasts than most speech books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get it to work","review":"I purchased the performanceplus replacement for Canon CL41 color cartidge.

The second time I bought two sets, the black ink only lasted about a week before I had to change it (same use, 10-20 pages). The replacement worked fine though so I thought maybe it was just one dud, not the norm. I recently bought a fourth set when it was time to change cartridges again. I had the same problem I had the second time around. The black ink cartridge only lasted a week (again, with only 10 prints max). I had to go out and buy a canon cartridge to replace it.At this point, I would say it's not worth it if there are this many duds floating around.

Hurt's accessible playing and smooth, gentle vocals hold up well over time. This is a different side of country blues---a bit folkier. Compare Hurt with Henry Thomas \\"Texas Worried Blues,\\" recorded in 1927-1928, and you find a very different, evolving kind of music.I think this is an Italian import and there is one flaw in the recording----the low E string sounds muffled at times. While some of the songs seem a little low energy, the guitar playing is flawless. These are satisfying recordings, though, I think, not the best place for someone to start with MS John Hurt. This CD is probably more for serious collectors. I'd start with the 1928 Okeh recordings or Vanguards \\"The Best of Mississippi John Hurt.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"size?","review":"Really cute, but double check the sizing.

Interviews are not isolated to the US, but also include Great Britain. It is well-produced and raises a number of questions regarding the complex causes of farmer suicide, moving far beyond the usual suspects of isolation and financial pressure to consider from a scientific and statistical perspective the neurological and psychiatric effects of certain classes of farm chemicals, without being preachy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Pefect, looks and sounds better then ever","review":"First off I own several of the old VHS tapes and was able to do a full comparison and this set rocks!!!The video is near perfect (I didn't see any green blotches) smooth rendering and obviously taken from the original film.

In cases like mine it's actually better that it doesn't have a frame. As for a dust-catcher/chalk-holder, you can make one for ~$5 from your local hardware store.If you treat it right, it's a great chalkboard.

In the 38 years, they've managed to make a mill that looks just like our old one and doesn't grind pepper worth a damn. You have your choice between grinding half peppers or a grind so fine you can't see it. I took it apart and can tell no difference between the two mills, but there's really a great difference. The old one infinitely adjusts between coarse and fine and you don't have to crank the handle forever to get all the pepper you want. The new one is pretty much worthless.

It did the job . . . for awhile. The handle has a square hole that fits onto the grinder shaft. Unfortunately, the square hole became round eventually and wouldn't turn the mechanism.

The musical ability of the members of this band is unparalled. I have been a big fan of DT for a long time. I have been listening to this album for about four straight months and I still love it. I can say that in the two cd set, each one of the cd's by its self would be a little weak, but if you put the two together, \\"WOW\\" incredible.

Hey Dream Theater, here's some advice: ITS ABOUT QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY. Stop making 40 side-project albums a year and just concentrate on writing good DT songs. They don't need to be 20 minutes long, and they don't need a 5 minute solo from each musician, thats what concerts are for. Learn how to write decent lyrics too.

It doesn't get any better on disc 2; \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" hijacks both Pantera's \\"By Demons Be Driven\\" and Tool's \\"Ticks & Leeches\\" and \\"Solitary Shell\\" is Peter Gabriel's \\"Solsbury Hill\\" just with different lyrics.

They are one of the few bands playing that gives me some hope that the industry can recognize talent once in a great while. Being this is a DT album, I had tremendous expectations when I first started listening to this CD.Unfortunately, history will probably record this effort as their collective low point. The album is good, but it is not up to DT quality. Take the first disc and use it as a coaster for your beverage. Sip on it while you enjoy the second disc. Not, that it is a masterpeice, either. The whole album has the feel of a band which came in the studio each morning trying to wing it. Confident that their sheer technical talent would carry the day.I can only hope that fan comments will force them to go back to the studio to correct this study in mediocrity.

And with the emergence of Transatlantic and Liquid Tension, it only adds to the magnificence of musical creativity. I also really enjoyed the Mullmuzzler CDs. I was fortunate to also see John Petrucci in concert on the G3 tour last year. Wow! Great stuff! Jordan's Feeding the Wheel is a great piece of work too!

As opposed to the side projects which are pretty amazing.I can't wait to hear John's solo album to see what he's keeping back.Remember these are great musicians with great ideas but who I believe need new possibilities and new challenges.Also the production has too much drums and too much mindless keyboards.

They are a generous band, bettering themselves with every album, and never fail to provide melodic, inspired, virtuoso music that puts most other bands to shame.

Some reasons I love this CD:1. THE PILE-DRIVING RHYTHMS IN \\"Glass Prison\\"2. The piano solo and amazing fretboard pyrotechnics in \\"Blind Faith\\"3. The psycho-solos in \\"Misunderstood\\"4. The drum/bass acrobatics in \\"The Great Debate\\"5. The Lyrics of \\"Solitary Shell\\"6. The haunting voices and incredible bluesy solo with hospital background noises bookending the fourth track.7.

There are few instrumental runs that are remniscent of the progressive intensity that Dream Theater is renowned for. Most songs don't commit themselves to memory even after continual re-play; the lyrical content reinforces the stale \\"insanity\\" theme that has been \\"done to death\\" by other artists.

This is a background of sound for guys to play over.Nothing original and nothing impressive like tracks 8 and 9 form Metropolis 2. No melody like was so evident on I&W. Send them back to the studio and do this over!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure how to say it...","review":"This double studio CD is the worst effort from Dream Theater I've seen. You would be better off burning the 26 dollars you might spend on this. The lyrics are poorly written and make tired subjects (even \\"The Great Debate\\") seem even more tiresome. The music on all of the tracks (except \\"The Glass Prison\\") reeks of synthesized orchestral sounds used in only the most trite ways conceivable. When the music does get away from the awful Trent-Gardner-esque synthesiser mess, it is merely a repetitive, goal-less rehash of the last few Dream Theater CDs. And for Christ's sake, Portnoy lists himself as playing \\"Lead Drums\\" in the booklet. Do yourself a favor, buy another copy of Awake and hope they never play any of this stuff live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped boredom just filling a slot","review":"This double CD is a major disappointment. I don't know why, but I do tend to agree with some of the reviewers who said that DT was trying to branch out and go mainstream. I don't see anything on this album going into the radio charts. ... There are some highlights on this however... disc 1 isn't all bad... it's actually pretty good. \\"Glass Prison\\" is a cool song with great musicianship and a kind of Metallica or new Megadeth feel. \\"Blind Faith\\" is the most typical Dream Theater sounding track on the album so it's also quite good as well. Next comes \\"Misunderstood\\" which is also pretty well written and a more sombre sounding effort, followed by \\"The Great Debate\\", a song about stem cell research with a definite Tool sound ... All in all the first CD isn't bad. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dream Theater album!","review":"I will be honest with you, I did not like this album when I first heard it. In fact, I wanted to smash it with a baseball bat, but I do believe everything deserves a second chance. When I listened to this album again I was completely floored by the agressive manner in which the band was playing. This album is heavy and immensely dark. I don't care if the songs are 30 minutes each, this band pulls out all the stops with this album. From epic songs to more straight-forward progressive metal songs, Dream Theater did a fine job of constructing all of the songs. By far better, to me anyway, than anything they have done. For those of you who enjoy extremely dark progressive metal then \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" will be an outstanding addition to your music collection. Oh, and guitarist John Petrucci absolutely rips on this album (as usual)."},{"rating":"2","title":"2112 move on over","review":"having been a rush fan for over quarter of a century (yikes!) I never expected to say this, but disk 2 of 6DOIT has knocked 2112 off my top spot of greatest album ever. This is a true masterpiece. Buy it and you will be hooked.Steve"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sky is the limit","review":"No, they don't have limits. Their musicianship is certainly not limited because they can do anything. Having their own sound but audaciously picking styles of other master musicians here and there. Can't limit themselves to 5 minutes songs, they just need to extend them over 10 minutes. No limits to their solo acts too.Disc two is my favorite with the \\"Goodnigh kiss\\" and \\"Solitary shell\\". There is two song titles that I hate to see on an album, \\"Overture\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" because I never like them. \\"Overture\\" on this one is no exception.Disc one was the reason why I bought this album. Particularly for song \\"The great debate\\" that I heard somewhere?? As always, the etheral part caught my attention. Nice disc too.Can't describe them to well as there is too much to say about them. You need to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but...","review":"I have been a huge DT fan for a while now, and have heard pretty much all of their previous material. I had some pretty high expectations from 6doit, and when i first heard it, i though it met, or even exceeded those expectations. However, after listening to it 3 days straight (or something like that), i found that I no longer liked a lot of it as much. Moral - it's good, but a lot of the originality (we're talking prog standards here) and the stuff that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end was missing.Some tracks were extremely cool...Misunderstood, Solitary shell to name a couple. Worth a buy if you like DT already, and don't mind something a little off the usual DT track.Oh yes, that 40 min thing - is that really ONE song?? I think that if it were, then all of SFAM should be one song too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best DT album to date.","review":"I've been a DT fann since '99 and to my knowledge, instrumentaly, this is their best album yet. Most people don't a preciate DT simply because to the untrained ear, it sounds like a bunch of guys playing as fast as they possibly can paying no attention whatsoever to the time signiture. But, to a musician like me, it's a work of art. Unlike previous albums such as Awake, all the sections flow together nicely. It doesn't sound real choppy or unplanned. Rudess and Portnoy are both amazing. Portnoy uses the paradigm shift fill at least twice on the album wich is kind of funny to a drummer like me. The lyrics aren't quite up to par, but considering that about 70% of the whole thing is instrumental, I can live with it.If you aren't a musician, I wouldn't recomend buying this, but if you are, than your ears are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best without a doubt","review":"If there was ever a band to receive credit for their work it would definetly have to be Dream Theater. SDOIT is just simply their best work yet. Unlike other bands unable to capture and improve their music style, DT has once again proved that they can still come up with songs that make you think and head-bang at the same time, songs which are worth listening too. Unfortunetly bands like these are the ones that do not receive the credit they deserve. If there was a real grammy award DT would have at least 4 by now. DT is the kind of band that makes u want to learn how to play an instrument and pushed it to the next level so N'sync, limpbizkit, metallica, britney watch and learn how the pros do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different.......","review":"This album is very interesting. I listen to alot of Dream Theater, and this is VERY Different from their other albums. It is very good song styles, but anyone who liked their last album, \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", will love this one. The first album in this two disc set is sory of a dark music. Almost like MegaDeth and Metallica at parts. My favorites are \\"The Glass Prision,\\" and \\"Misunderstood.\\" The second album reminds me of Liquid Tension alot, because they have Jordan Rudess (keyboardist) playing alot of solos...which is nice. \\"About to Crash\\" (second song on second disc) starts off alot like \\"Biaxident\\" (Liquid Tension). The second album is totally opposite the first, not dark sounding and happy most of the time.This Album is a great buy, even though its written differently from other albums, but they took ideas from previous albums that were coold, and made them AWESOME! I encourage everyone to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn these guys are amazing!!","review":"Dream Theater have to be the most unpredictable band in the universe! This album is incredibly deep. The heavy songs are awesome, then out of nowhere, a soft melodic song takes you on a journey. The musicianship is on a level that only Dream Theater can attain. Since every Dream Theater album is excellent, I will venture to say that this is DT's most adventurous and inspiring undertaking so far. This album will never get old!! It will give you chills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"This is not a CD for true Dream Theater fans. For everyone who remebers the good ol days of \\"Images\\" and \\"Awake,\\" this album falls way short. The cd has a few moments, but not enough to justify ownership. The band sacrafices much needed melodie for Pantera style riffs and self-indulgent soloing. What I have come to appreciate about the band -- strong melodies, nice grooves, and the utmost of musicianship -- is all but completely missing in this current installment. This CD doesn't represent true progressive music, that which DT has epitomized in the past. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"A double album that someone should have picked through for good songs and made one album from. For me Dream Theater are completely hit and miss. This is a terrible miss. Its still got a few good moments. My problem with Dream Theater is that I wish they were instrumental. Their song writing is mediocre at best and I really don't care for most of mister LeBrie's vocals. Of course, prog rock is full of people who can't quite sing good enough for the rest of the music.In this case, the whole second CD album is so cheesy it sucks. The first CD is ok, but tries to be more than bad prog-metal and fails. Sometimes they try to be Tool. Sometimes they try to be someone else. Dream Theater should try to be themselves more. Its at those moments such, as in Metropolis, that they really shine and the reason I will always give them a listen when they make something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst since FII","review":"Even FII had some redeeming value... this album is terrible. Dream Theater has lost the feel that Kevin Moore gave them and Jordan is no saviour. The songs meander off without a goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm absolutely speechless!","review":"Just when I thought DT could not get much better musically, they write \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\". I've studied Dream Theater with their melodic chorus' to their tight metal riffs, and have found this new album to have it all. I recommend this cd to absolutely anyone. I have purchased tickets for their Denver and Phoenix concerts, traveling thousands of miles, because I know they will be playing music from this album. BUY IT!!! You won't regret. DT RULES!!!!!!!Tyler"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strange CD","review":"This CD sounds like a bizarre mix between Geddy Lee's solo album, Anthrax, Queensryche, and Zelda videogame music. The first disc sounds nothing like Dream Theater. If they're exploring new grounds, they better return to record pieces like the second disc, which is very good. It's a good CD, though I recommend you see them live. The experience is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first disc is decent....","review":"but the second disc is a masterpiece of incredible quality.

I do however feel that Jordan's MIDI work at the beginning of disk 2 leaves much left to be desired. I think Michael Romeo did a better job of programming the MIDI parts of The Odyssey than Jordan did on this album. However, I must say that Jordan is one of the most pleasant people one could ever hope to meet and is also by far the most talented and precise keyboard player I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good DT album","review":"This is very good DT album which compromise 2 albums of the finest albums of progressive rock music ever along with The superb Octavarium.This album is highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album deserves its five stars for the second (self-titled) disc. For anyone who feels skittish about listening to a 40+ minute song, just get over it and jump in. As for disc 1, not bad at all. Love tracks 1 and 2. The rest is semi-lackluster (imo).Bottom line: Amazing record"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterwork of black metal","review":"I can not get enough of this CD. Every song stands apart, brilliant and dark. The musicianship is amazing, Hellhammer is at peak form, as is Blasphemer. Track 2 and 8 are both very good, I must say in their defense.GDOW was an interesting album and would've been a lot better had it not been for that Carnival barker voice taken on by Maniac. The music was remarkable, precise, and insane. This album brings us closer to Wolf's Lair Abyss, yet is still breaking new barriers in black metal.I have always enjoyed Maniac's warbling style of black metal shriek, and it is still present on this album. However, he incorporates more blow-torch vocals (i.e. DEAD!) You can't go wrong by buying this. And don't download, support the goddamn band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This cd is in the corner growing dust mites. I have had it for awhile and tried my hardest to get into it. It bores me to tears. The vocals are absolutely pathetic. For a \\"top notch\\" death metal band, Chimera fails to impress me. The music is spattered all over the place, making it a big heap of crap and a mundane listen. Die hard Mayhem fans will enjoy this, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for about 2 listens","review":"Then this album becomes one giant snore fest. The style throughout the album is the same, the songs are so blast beat laiden that it almost dosnt register that your at the next track. The vocals are probobly the best part of the cd there very good. The drumming tho I love most of hellhammers work is boring. Not a recommended album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant Black Metal Megamasterpiece!!!","review":"For me to give this CD 5 stars, is doing it an injustice. Yes, this CD is that good! I would rank this in the top 5 Black Metal releases of all time. Where can I really start with this review? Well, let's just say that you get absolutely no filler and the songs are both memorable and powerful - with all instruments absolutely crushing the listener. The darkness of all the old Mayhem material is here but in much higher clarity and with infinitely better song writing. I would say this is one of the darkest most crushing albums out of any I have ever heard. I would go into detail about each song here if it were important to do so, but every song is so good and so memorable that it is not necessary. What is necessary is for all Black Metal fans to buy this CD immediately and all others to cower in fear. This is a MUST OWN CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently good","review":"From the first note to the last, Chimera is one of the best black metal releases. Containing the essential BM ingredients of hyper-fast drumming, shredding guitars, and raw vocals, this one ups the ante with solid production and a technical sensibility that showcases the bands' individual talents. Combine this with very well crafted songs and the results are a disc that doesn't just survive repeated listenings, but demands them. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The New, New Mayhem","review":"Mayhem took a huge turn when they reformed in 1995 and released 'Wolf's Lair Abyss' - and they've done it again now in 2004 with 'Chimera.' They've taken a turn for the better, as this album takes everything that was bad about 'Grand declaration of War' (which was a lot) and turns it around completely to make a solid Black Metal CD which should please new and old fans alike. The album is pretty solid, with plenty of variety in the songs. The only taint on this album is the song 'Dark Night of the Soul,' in which Mayhem tried (perhaps a little too hard) to experiment with out-of-the-ordinary timing in their riffs and thus created a pretty un-even song that isn't a very good listen. Other than that though, the album is very good and I would recommend it to all fans of Black Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic, Emotive","review":"After thoroughly enjoying their first release, was more impressed with this sophomoric release. Includes some tasty orchestral arrangements. Lyrically emotive and clever, musically adventurous, waiting to see what will come next. My only criticism would be that one song drags on longer then it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"daughte loves it","review":"I bought this barbie for my daughter.

On the other hand, the only thing I really liked about it was Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy From Mars, but it's worth reading the whole book for this fantastic story. Daniel Pinkwater has an amazing style of writing: as Jules Feiffer said in the foreword, he takes a small idea and expands it, and adds to it, and soon it grows into some thing else completely, which seems perfectly normal when compared to the first idea. His tab A does not fit into slot A the way it's supposed to, blah, blah, blah, blah ... just read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy two : one to keep; one to share","review":"Gotta agree with everyone else.

Now, I'm making my friends & relatives read it to, but I don't need to make them read once they started.-Alec Turnbull, 6th grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinkwater: the choice of a new generation!","review":"My only complaint about Pinkwater is that he makes me want to live in a Chicago that never existed, where the Snark shows 24-hour double billings of obscure films, and where you can go to Beanbender's on Lower North Aufzoo Street and get the best beer and baked potato of your life. Where the Chicken Man shows up wherever you least expect him. Where talking lizards take over late-night TV (although that's in Lizard Music, another book). However, the mere fact that I have this complaint shows how well he's done his job -- he's made his books so much fun I want to be able to live my own version of them.If you loved these books -- and I think you will -- try his collection 4 Fantastic Novels, of course, but also try his collected NPR commentaries, Hoboken Fish and Chicago Whistle (originally two books, now available as one).P.S. I started reading these books when I was around 12. I'm still reading them at 24. Tell you anything about how good they are?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the last Guru rocks!","review":"This is an amazing, funny, incredibly random book with five comical masterpeices. Though I agree with the other reveiwers that alan medelsohn, boy from Mars is very good, my personel favorite is the last Guru. the idea of a self-made kid millionare is VERY intertaning. These books are, as I said earlier, random, and A Young Adult Novel is possibly the most random of them all. an example; the Dada's(the main character) beleive dishwashers should rule the world. Weird, isn't it? Any way, no matter wich story you read first, you'll laugh and have a great time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read. Again, again, again, and again.","review":"The five novels in this book are genius. Alan Mendelson, boy from mars, takes youn through a boy going through being the new kid, goofing off with another weirdo, the wacky Klugarsh Mind Control, and... well I just can't give away the rest! I have to say i have a soft spot for The Last Guru, its so just... cool what happens to the boy :). This is an EXELLENT book for anyone to buy, I've read it so many times i tore off both covers and three pages. A great book to love and read again, again, again, and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation","review":"I've read many pinkwater books before including his current trilogy, these old ones just as good if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if HE'S the sane one?","review":"I loved Pinkwater when I was eleven and I love him at least as much now. He treats his readers with respect, rather than talking down to them, and he is one of the funniest writers I've ever read, for any audience. His characters are some of the best in fiction, and his ideas are far-fetched enough to make anyone wonder a little about the fine line between brilliance and insanity. Having five novels in one volume was almost more excitement than I could handle. A warning to kids: you may want to keep two copies of this one around, because you'll never pry this book out of the hands of the adults around you. A warning to adults: once children are introduced to Pinkwater, there are reading flashlights to be confiscated in the middle of the night. One last note: Pinkwater has written for all ages, from some wonderful picture books to at least one book of essays for us grown-up folk who have loved him on NPR. Try them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great subversive","review":"Since I first read The Big Orange Splot I have been a Pinkwater fan. Although a lot of his best stuff is out of print, and Chinwag Theatre is not widely available on public radio, Pinkwater hunting is worth the effort. This collection helps remind us all that \\"normal\\" actually ends up being very strange, and the stranger, the more interesting. This is a great book to get into the hands of boys who need affirmation that they are just fine the way they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinkwater's genius is in the details","review":"What makes reading Pinkwater's books such a rare treat is the details---you really never know what you'll read next---what bizarre movie will be showing at the neighborhood theater, what odd TV show will be on late at night, what weird teacher you will meet at the new school---it's so unusual to find truly imaginative and surprising reading like this. And unlike so many books that give lip service to diversity, it really exists in these books----it's not wrong here to be overweight, to live in the city and like it, to find school truly useless.

I had to keep looking on wikipedia for the release dates.When writing about specific songs, he seems to enjoy what I consider the weakest tracks of each album.The kind of language he uses makes it also not fun to read, with lots of strange, pedantic words. I CONSTANTLY read Rock & Roll books, and I don't think I ever had such a feeling.And to make things worse, I got the Spanish version of the book, with a different (totally uncool) cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Grace","review":"They have such a great combination of voices.

Doesn't anyone listen to lyrics? The lyrics of \\"How You Live\\" by Point of Grace are very sweet, but it is not always sweet to follow Christ. The song is decidedly NOT Christian, but it states that your lifestyle is what is important.How You LiveFor a Christain, the important thing IS \\"who\\" you know - that being Jesus Christ. HOW we live is not \\"it\\" for a follower of Christ. His teachings and life all focus on the fact that we cannot win our salvation by our own works. \\"It is by grace you have been saved,\\" St. Paul sates in Ephesians 2:5. Apparently Paul was not referring to the \\"Point of\\" variety.HOW we live is only a result of the power of His sacrifice for us on the cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular","review":"The music is annoying, it's hard to understand the lyrics, and it almost seems as if they are just doing this to make money.

This is a heartwarming tale of nature, family, and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great art","review":"All the Places has been a favorite now in our family for over two years. I've given it to several friends as gifts, and for many of them, it has become a favorite, too.When my older child was two, and I started to go to the library regularly, I was aghast at what I found in the children's section. Too many picture books had dumbed-down language, ugly pictures, or both. This book is a gem: the language is beautiful, and so is the art. In fact, I like the art so much that I might buy another copy of the book, and cut it up to frame some of the pages!This is a book I don't mind reading 100 times - and I bet I've read it more than that, as both my 2-year-old and my 4-year-old request it as a favorite out of our huge collection of children's books. Definitely one of our top 10 choices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sweet story that a child can identify with","review":"I like this book very much and know that I will read it over and over to my grandchildren.

The little boy relates in a positive and meaningful way with his parents, grandparents, and his new little sister as the story is told of the three generations living together on a farm in the mountains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely In the Top 5 of All Children's Books","review":"Almost everyone else has said it already--this is as good a book as you can read to your kids. Not, contrary to what an isolated review suggested, stilted at all.

All of our children love it and so do we. It really takes you inside the world of this family and how much they enjoy the little details about where they live and how much they care for one another. My wife cried the first three times she read it. I can't even begin to describe how amazing the pictures are. I tried to find other books illustrated by the same person but had no luck. This is easily the most beautifully illustrated book I've ever seen. We just bought another copy for a birthday party this weekend. This will definitely be our new book to give to people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Love Story","review":"The first time I ever picked up this book I was totally captivated by the story and enthralled by the paintings. When it came to the words \\"my sister is born\\" I got so choked up I couldn't read the words. Even when I read it now My children always ask Mommy why are you crying?

The motor just can't seem to handle frozen drinks very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"he did better with Gradiva....","review":"In this small book Freud takes a mistranslated childhood memory of Leonardo's--one in which a kite (Freud thought it a vulture) opens the baby's mouth with its tail feathers--and makes a case for a genius born out of wedlock left alone too much with his mother, and therefore prone to homosexuality. Lame.As always, though, Freud at least arrives in the ballpark, even if he doesn't understand the game. Initial memories are often strangely prophetic, even when constructed out of fantasy; and so perhaps the fantastic kite--known for its interesting flight configurations--suckled the young Leonardo's latent inventive urges, or even symbolized their later expression.Note: in this study first appears Freud's use of the term Eros, which he later makes such a fundamental part of his theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT!!!!!

It has an easy to use \\"chain\\" system which allows the scripture to explain itself and is extremely easy to use. As far as quality goes, less than 40.00 for genuine leather Oxford Bible, it is a steal. A joy to handle and a bible which will be in my hands many decades from now. Good font for my old eyes, though I prefer about 12 pt, this one seems about 10 but with good type set, good contrast with the paper. I do not understand the \\"heresy\\", \\"fringe\\", \\"inaccuracies\\" stuff. If your desire is to study God's wonderful word which we are blessed with, this Bible is an effective tool.

If you desire to nit pick, write your own bible so you can't complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Something Better, More Faithful","review":"The only good thing about this particular study Bible is that it comes in the English Standard Version. The Scofield Bible notes represent a combination of ancient heresy (see note on Genesis 1:1, which can only be verified by ancient Gnostic sources), and the worst of twentieth century dispensationalism. Despite many fundamentalists who love this study Bible, it in no way represents the serious, orthodox position of the Reformation. Don't get it. Spend your money on something better, like the Reformation Study Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and incorrect","review":"Two major problems make this book more harmful than helpful. The first problem is that it is incomplete. The text chosen does not include the deutero-canonical books, and therefore is unusable by about a billion and a half Christians.The second problem is that the annotations follow the theological assumptions of the dispensationalists, a fringe group known for its inaccurate theology.Bottom line is that this book is unsuitable for any sincere Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scofield Study Bible","review":"I must admit that if I had more choices of a study Bible in the ESV then I would not have chosen the Scofield study Bible. The binding and overall texture are fine and Scofield teaches sound doctrine but it's the content or rather lack of it. The setback is there are not that many study notes.

There is some minimal evidence of touching up, but really it's like the arguments about the proper edition of \\"Ulysses\\" - fascinating to scholars but barely of interest to anybody else. The First Folio is the most important Shakespearean document, containing as it does the _only_ text of Macbeth, amongst many other marvels, and if (like me) you work in the theatre it's highly unlikely that you're going to want anything more beautifully put together than this. Highly unlikely, too, that you'll be able to afford anything more elaborate than this. Mr. Moston and his team are to be congratulated. Scholars may quibble but they're only scholars.

I couldn't get past it for days I would replay that song.The record is produced by Brown Banister who has produced for Amy Grant for years. The music tends more toward synthizers and is more pop than that last album. I prefered the production on Love Life and Other Mysteries which was more open and featured more guitars. The girls wonderful harmonies have to compete with the big production on this new album.This is still an outstanding album that proves once again that contemporary Christian music has achieved a level of quality that is as good as or better than anything available in mainstream music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely God-inspired!","review":"This is now my favorite Point of Grace CD. It really helps me to tune in to God. Almost every song on the CD is unique to the group. There aren't any other songs out there like these. They are all wonderful.

Oh, the talent is there, these ladies can SING, and sing good. But the lyrics and music suffer. The words have been said a thousand times before, and paint life in a nutrasweet mix. The music is blatently aimed at those who listen to Christian AC Radio, and aimed at not rocking the boat. I'd love to hear these women sing some blues, some minor keys, entirely a capella, hymns (although they do a good job at rendering hymns). Anything but the same old song. Since CCM is aimed at the saved females, this stuff sells like hotcakes. If \\"secular\\" radio is Coke, this is diet-caffiene free Shasta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invincible Armour","review":"This is one of John Liu's best,however, what a pitty that there are 5 scenes that have been deleted and this does not make sense for me.

Many thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Invincible Armor was one of the best videos in the Wu-tang collection. It deals with one of the most deadly forms of Kung fu, the eagle techinque. It tells a story of a man who is looking for the killer of his master. Upon looking he discovers an ancient technique called the iron armor, which is almost impossible to break. Until he learns the iron finger which allows him to expose the one weak point on the killers body. A lot of fast paced martial arts and very well thought out fight scenes, along with some inevitable flares of comedy.Overall, Invincible Armor is one of the best kung fu movies ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"invincible armor not so invincible","review":"Man, did I waste my cash yet again on Wu Tang garbage. I thought I had found a movie I had been looking for for many years, but what I found was heartache. This entire series is a total grab bag. I've found excellent movies and I've found tripe. Well, maybe tripe is too nice a word.The fighting was fair at best; I think the director was more taken with the lead's ability to hold his foot straight up over his head. I don't even remember how many times they showed that stunt in the movie. The best thing about owning this video is the homo-erotic picture on the back of the protagonist searching for the bad guy's weak spot. Probably not worth the money, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing key scenes","review":"I had heard many good things about 'Invincible Armor', and was happy to find this video on Amazon.com.

Their second CD \\"lost legends of surf guitar 2\\" has less surf oriented tunes with more hot rod songs, it makes me wonder if I should bother buying the third CD of this collection. The pyramids had one of the top surf tunes in \\"penetration\\" but the two pyramid tunes on here just sound like copies of that tune with the same minor sounding desending riff.

However, without any biographical information on them (sorry a list of names at the end of the book doesn't do a whole lot of good) and without knowing how those students were picked (i.e., whether they can be considered at all representative of their class and school), we are left not knowing how much weight, if any, should be given to their feedback. It appears as if the \\"Correction\\" review was simply an attempt by the author to increase the overall rating of the book by including an additional 5 star review. Pretty transparent, and I second Sai Li's recommendation to get your hands on the AAMC's MSAR book which is the only guide to medical schools officially sanctioned by the American Association of Medical Colleges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"Sai Li is certainly entitled to an opinion, however negative, of our book.

There's no way to know for sure, without either dying or getting a reading from her myself with validating information, whether she's right or not. I go with what's in my heart.

Bob the ghost told me that Francine has been REALLY fed up with playing second banana to Sylvia, who's raking in the cash while constantly making up stuff that Francine NEVER TOLD HER! Can you believe it! So I asked Bob to put me in touch with Francine, who told me that she's most certainly NOT talking to Sylvia any more and is in negotiations to publish her OWN tell-all book! (And get her OWN manicurist for awesome nails, even better than Sylvia's talons!).

After reading it the second time, I was just awestruck by how much this book affected me. I have read most of the life after life books by numerous authors. Some are more believable than others but Sylvia Browne's is one of the most believable yet. It is easy to read and understand and you can actually visualize how things probably appear on the other side. One of my favorite parts is the appendix which lists the categories of Life Plans that we use when scripting our earthly incarnations. It is interesting to see how one specific category will jump out at you giving you a better understanding of why your current life is the way it is and also why other people in your lives make the choices that they do.

In great detail too. In fact, I believe she would be an excellent author of books for children, which probably is the most difficult writing there is.I must say, the tought about whether or not I'd had to go to the bathroom in heaven never bothered me.I strongly believe in spirits. Or more correctly: I know there are spirit(s) watching over us on a constant basis. I also believe strongly in Syliva Browne's ability to make money on people who should rather seek their own answers, read - and digest what they read, but not take everything as a truth for the sole reason that it comes from a psychic person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Still not sure if I'm a true believer but great read.

I don't want to bash anything or anyone who advocates spirituality. But my rational mind just can't get beyond some factual errors this author makes. She makes a statement early in the book about \\"the Salem witches who were burned at the stake.\\" They WEREN'T burned at the stake, they were hung. Since she makes such a case for her Spititual Guide knowing the causes of death of various people, this error really was quite jarring to me. Also, at the beginning of the book she says Francine died in 1520. Later on she says Francine's life came to end in 1598. Which is it? And why would she make such an error if she has been communicating with this spirit for over fifty years? (Also, where is her editor!)

At the age of 18 she married she married a silversmith and, less than a year later, gave birth to a baby girl ... One early morning a messenger arrived from a nearby village to frantically announce an approaching army of Spaniards who were ultimately to bring about Francine's demise - she was killed by a conquistador's spear in the Spanish invasion less than a week later, using her body as a shield to save her child's life.\\"This account is consonant with Brown's claim that Francine died in 1520.

Her self-deprecating humor comes through loud and clear, and is entertaining in itself. But to take what she says as \\"gospel?\\" I don't think so... Certainly documentation for what \\"The Other Side\\" looks like, etc., is limited to those who have experienced it through near death experiences or psychics like Sylvia. But these folks are human, which means they are fallible, which means they are offering us their own perspective on the subject, which can be colored by their interpretation. Did I enjoy Sylvia's book? Yes. Do I believe she is sincere? Yes. Do I believe in life after death? Yes. Do I think \\"The Other Side\\" is as Sylvia depicts it? Hard to say, but I'll find a way to let you know after my fifth (and final) exit point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Try","review":"Sylvia Browne at first sounds convincing in telling what happens after death. She explores the \\"eternal life\\" of the soul in a more than casual tone. Her \\"spirit guide\\"named Francine was one thing, but the buildings and record halls and the rest of what the place looks like, belong more in fiction than what is being marketed here to people like myself after the loss of a loved one. The illustrations are pure fantasy and seem to come staight out of Roman Empire meets new age with a little bit of Escher.

That's obviously the way it's meant to be in the divine plan. Maybe we, as a human race, are not yet ready for the information in this book. It's all a question of humanity's growth. Just as a five-year old isn't ready to hear about quantum mechanics and the structure of the universe, so we (or at least the masses) are not quite ready to hear about details of life on the Other Side and our soul's journey beyond the veil of death.

For the enlightened few, it will be music to the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life on the Other Side Review","review":"Sylvia Browne does an excellant job describing exactly what the title inferes, Life on the Other Side.

Sylvia explanins how she \\"knows what she knows\\" Skeptics will be convinced, and believers will nod in agreement. Sylvia uses humor and biblical references to back up her beliefs, and I, for one, am looking forward to returning home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comforting","review":"I've just lost my husband and daughter, and this book has given me great comfort.

I have purchased nearly all the books she had written. Her insight has helped me tremendously in understanding the purpose of life on earth and what lays a head for us in heaven. I do have to admit, to fully embrace her books you must be open minded. Those who are closed minded to the possibilities of hereafter, will not find delight Browne's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Excellent!","review":"This is one of the very first books that I had ever read of Sylvia Browne's, and I had a hard time putting this one down. I can truely say that reading this book was life changing for me. It made a lot of sense to me and has helped me put my own spiritual views more into perspective. I no longer fear death like I once did, (not like I want to die tomarrow or anything, but it did put my soul at easy with the idea). This book was very enlightening and well worth reading. If you open your mind and your heart, you will truely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disalussioning","review":"Most of us want or need something to hold on to in regards to our afterlife. Especially when we've lost someone so dear to us. In reading this book, I was so swept away with the beauty of it all. I read the Bible but cannot seem to be able to grasp it with a real understanding of some things. So, when Ms. Browne came out with this book convincing us of her authenticity, I read it avidly. Then I decided to look further and went into her web site. Was I ever thrown for a loop. If a person truly has a genuine insight into such things, how could they possibly cheapen God and the afterlife with her moneymaking propaganda for her specially trained psychics, tarot card readings, all this garbage you see advertised and the streets in abundance. I am totally disappointed with this book. It is a phoney trying to fill our minds with this beautiful Home we will return to and making a fortune off of our gullability. How sad to use people in such a way."},{"rating":"1","title":"To hard to believe","review":"I recently lost my father and turned to Life on the Other Side to help me feel better about where my dad is now. The book made me feel worst. Sylvia goes into to much detail about reincarnation. Some people might feel otherwise but I want to know my dad is with my/his family on the other side, not with a bunch of people I don't know from his previous lives. I also thought the detail of Heaven and spirit's jobs on teh other side was a little to hard to believe. How could Sylvia be the one person alive that knows exactly in great detail what heaven is like? I used to be a fan of Sylvia but I think she is a fake. I believe she has soem abilty to connect with spirits but not as much as she claims. I would recommend John Edward and James Van Praagh books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Sylvia has done it again.

This game is insane, with intense realism and amazing graphics. Admittedly this games story is a little hard to follow, but if you want a great story go play ff7.

The thing doesn't end there, someone tell 'ya that is a short game, well it's true, but if you play this game twice after a long time you'll notice that the scary moments are strong and sadistic than ever before.

Anyone who has ever been at a lan party knows all too well how cd's/dvd's either get lost or broken at events like a lan party.

Then we'll change to a 5/4 and add some downtuned guitar to play the first two frets REALLY FAST. Then we turn on 4 different effects pedals and make the guitar feed back. Vocals... we need rapping, and some guy that exhales constantly. More time signatures are needed to get us some respect, so we'll have to swap through 12/4 and 7/16 until the song is over 15 seconds later.

Then they \\"played\\" for 30 seconds, then played for 20 then 30. The best way I can explain it as loud sounds. At one point it sounded like a black board scraping. Possible the worse music I have ever heard. As I prayed for it to be over I was watching the guitar player and the drummer. They are the reason that I gave this cd two stars.

Some idiot out there will think we're innovative and talented.\\" I'm not sure that these guys even know how to play their instruments, to be honest. I saw them live, of course they were opening for another band, and I almost walked out of the club because I just couldn't stand to listen to them \\"play\\".

The band is really for anyone who likes arty,but thrashy bands like The Blood Brothers, experimental bands like The Mars Volta,and anything by Mike Patton should check this band out right away.Note though,the band is much more about noise,impact,and intensity then musicanship and message.All the tracks have something(or 2)special about them and they don't all sound alike.The bands is not for everyone but to those who just to listen to a band that makes commerical metal sound like kids bop,or just want to listen to music that annoys the crap outta everyone else,this album is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"aha!","review":"I have listened to this band for years now, and I could never think of a way to describe their sound until the other day when I saw them live.

And I guess I would have liked it well enough if I were a true beginner to yoga, and just looking for a stretch-out-and-relax experience, rather than a workout to go with my mind-stop. But this was just pitched too low & slow for my taste. This may be because I've learned everything I know from much tougher tapes (e.g. Bryan Kest & Baron Baptiste) & have gotten used to that pace. Also, the production level here is SO nonexistent, which might attract some people but just makes me a little less motivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Inflated reviews","review":"I was not impressed at all. I noticed that all of the previous reviewers are direct family and personal friends of the author, and many of them had submitted multiple comentarys in an attempt to inflate the total number of reviews recieved. Not an objective commentary on the book's merits at all. After reading it, I found the storyline incoherent and having a tendicy to ramble on and on. a good spelling and grammer check of the text before it was released would have been a good idea. Simply put, it is just another vanity peice put out for the sake of ego. all this book does is rehash many of the same old, tired and over-worked themes we see in dozens, in not hundreds of the typical sword and sorcery, fantasy cliche's now out in paperback. Nothing original to be found here at all. Certianly nothing \\"life changing\\".

The arrangement of topics within a chapter makes no sense to me. Topics of primary importance are relegated to the chapter end in a \\"A Deeper Look\\" section. My students told me that they could not figure out how to do the problems by reading the text.How useful is that?!

My son is small framed. He hates this potty-says it is hard. When he does use it 99% of the time the guard fails and we have leaks under the seat onto the floor. This is with adult assistance even. The seat may be okay for girls but not boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for little boys with bad aim!","review":"We were given this potty chair as a gift. My son will ask to sit on it, but as soon as he does, he'll start to whimper, because it's just too uncomfortable. The couple of times he's stayed long enough to actually go potty, he has leaned back, and scooted his bottom forward, making the little splash guard on this seat useless! He pees right over the top of it, and it gets all over the floor. This will NOT work for us! I'm searching for a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty Chair for Boys (especially twins)","review":"I was given a normal potty chair and when I was at Babies R Us, I bought the Baby Bjorn Large Potty Chair. When my kids got old enough they both fought over the Bjorn potty and dismantled the other one. What I liked about this one is that it has a non-slip edging around the corners and thesplash guard & basin are one piece and can easily be dumped. My kids are only at the wee wee stage so they pull the basin out of the chair and walk it to the toilet and dump it themselves. So easy to clean and I highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO HAPPY WITH THIS POTTY!!!","review":"I knew Baby Bjorn was genius when my son used to use their contoured bib (fyi- the only bib you'll ever need - easy to wash and dry and catches everything). Now I know their potty chair is the best, too!I started out with another brand potty, but the bowl and splash guard were so small that my son's little parts just hung over the front edge. The Baby Bjorn bowl is bigger and the splash guard is high enough so he doesn't even have to hold his parts down.When he's done, he pulls out the bowl, flushes the waste down the big toilet, and I just do a quick Lysol cleaning to it. It's so great, I'm buying a second one for the house or to take in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"bjorn potty a big disappointment","review":"I bought this product since it looked simple and easy to use. However, I was quickly disappointed with it. The potty slides away when my son tries to sit on it and the bowl pops up when he tries to get up from it. This leaves a big mess on the floor. It is also more expensive than other potties. Definately not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Chair!","review":"Easy to clean which is a very important function.

It must be uncomfortable because it always leaves a red ring around his bottom, even if he just sits on it for a couple of minutes. It also sticks to his bottom and when he stands up to get off the potty, the bowl comes out too and spills the contents all over the floor! : ( I have had to clean up several messes just because the bowl comes out so easily when he stands up. Baby Bjorn would improve this product by padding the seat a bit and having the bowl latched into place so it wouldn't come out so easily and spill its contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for both of us","review":"I bought too quickly and got the wrong potty! NOW, I think that the potties that also act as step stools are a great idea. This potty only has one use. If your little one doesn't take to it, it's a waste! ALSO, my daughter tried her cousin's cushie musical toilet topper and loved it! She likes going on the big toilet much better. This potty was a waste of money for us, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not excited anymore","review":"After reading reviews of multiple potty chairs, I was excited to get this one! Everyone raved about how unique the design was, and how easy it was to train a child. The actual potty seat insert is so difficult for my daughter to sit on, because of the design of the built in splash guard. The seat is not anchored to the chair in any way, so the entire seat can lift out (or be lifted in the case of a curious child). There are no arms, so my daughter is turning herself sideways to get comfortable and avoid the splash guard. Wouldn't recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for simplicity...","review":"I bought this potty because of it's simple design & apparent ease of use. But every time my son gets up from using it, the bucket part comes up with him! So I have to quickly grab it & hold it in place while he gets up. As you can imagine, this causes quite a hassle for us both & has discouraged him from wanting to use it. Back to the store with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for girls","review":"I wouldn't recommend this potty for anyone. It is very light and has nothing to keep it from sliding around on a hard floor. When my daughter sits on it, it usually moves around, sometimes causing her to lose her balance. Also, b/c the splashguard isn't removable, she sat on it a few times, which really hurt her. I finally turned it around, but since it's not made to fit that way, I really had to jam it in there, which makes for not-so-easy removal to empty it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this!","review":"I am insane when it comes to researching products for my toddler and knew all the pros and cons of this potty chair. However, I love the Baby Bjorn line and have never been disappointed before, so I bought this one even after ready several negative reviews. I really wanted a simple chair for my 2 year old daughter. Well, she loved the idea of it too, but was frustrated by the shield on the bucket (as apparently most girls are). She kept trying to turn the bucket around so the shield would be out of the way, but it doesn't fit that way. The chair does slide around as well, but we fixed that by positioning it in the corner. After 2 days of trying, she just couldn't overlook how uncomfortable the chair was. She's an average sized two year old, but it still was a tight fit. We returned the chair and, after much deliberation and testing, purchased the Graco soft seat potty chair. I do not like the Graco brand usually, but so far that chair is doing the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for my twin boys....love it!","review":"I waited until my guys turned 3 to potty train. I like this chair because it is easy to move...we take it in the minivan, to the park, in the bike cart...etc. It is very stable, easy to clean and very portable. My guys both use it by themselves with ease. Now they have started to use the big potty, but I will hold onto the Baby Bjorn for the next siblings. These are the first and only potties we used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy to use potty","review":"I bought this potty awhile back after reading lots of reviews and love it. Initially I liked the simplistic design and the fact that there are no gimmicks, just a potty. Now that my 22 month old son is potty training I am so thankful I bought this one. It is so easy to clean and he seems to find it comfortable to sit on. This is my fourth child and I wish I had had this one with my other kids because there is almost no way that liquid is going to end up anywhere other than in the potty! Other potties leaked because we would remove the splash guard since they tended to pinch. This splash guard is built in and doesn't seem to bother him one bit. I don't see any problem with a little girl using it, either. In fact, my niece used it the other day and had no trouble. The only drawback I can see is if you have a very large child, but otherwise, I love this potty and would recommend it to anyone with a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to clean but not easy for my son to use","review":"I bought this because I thought it was nice and simple-easy to clean and no leaks. However, my son won't use it. He won't sit on it because it is uncomfortable-not enough seat and hard splash guard. So then he tries to pee like daddy and it slides away. I am going to return it. The problem is, I can't find a good one for a boy which is comfortable, easy to clean, doesn't leak and is like a \\"real\\" adult potty for imitating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Difficult to Sit On!","review":"I read the reviews and bought this potty chair, figuring that based on other users' opinions my daughter would love it. However, the high splash guard on the front makes it very difficult for her to sit down. You cannot just back up and sit, you need to be directly over the potty to sit down. She has turned the bowl around, placing the splash guard to the back, but then she cannot sit back and get comfortable on the seat. Perhaps it works for those with boys - I wouldn't know - but I cannot recommend it to parents of girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great simple design","review":"We purchased this potty seat online and couldn't wait for it to arrive. My 19 month old daughter instantly tried to sit on it and fell into the pot- the rim around the pot part is very narrow, and therefore there is really no place for the child to sit, so she ends up in a weird squatting position. Also it does not have rubber feet so it slides around on the tile. The \\"pee guard\\" is not detachable, and she gets hooked on it everytime she tries to sit, which shifts the pot too, and sometimes even lifts it out when getting up. The whole thing seems very unstable and she has given up on it. As you can imagine, we have too. We are going to try a potty that has a seat with a bowl that fits underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to receiving this product for my toddler, and couldn't wait to have her use it. However, we soon learned that the design is very poor. The potty chair slides all over the floor, leaving my poor daughter falling down and scared to use it. The cramped seat design also forces the bowl part to come out when she stands up. This is a very big disappointment for a Baby Bjorn product! I also bought their little step stool for when my daughter can step up to use the toilet, and that thing does not move at all on the floor! Baby Bjorn should have designed the potty chair like their step stool with the rubber on the bottom, and it would have been a much more useful product. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple is better","review":"This is the best toilet seat. The fancy ones with all the parts are always falling apart and difficult to clean; the ones with removable pee gaurds are annoying (the ppe gaurd is always getting lost). It is a great height for most kids so their feet are not dangling (if the knees are not up a little it makes it hard for them to have a stool). After flailing with the \\"bells and whistle\\" ones we now have our two useing this one! Good luck! p.s. I also like the idea of the black basin but our also came all white but that is ok with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for toddler with meaty thighs","review":"My daughter is 2 yrs old and in the 75th% for her height and weight. She is by no meats \\"fat\\". The problem with this seat is that the deflector, meant for boys, is not removable and is way to wide.

As if this were still the 19th century. Sadly, as anyone who is not incredibly sheltered and nave should know, the 21st century has been characterised by non-white privilege even in so-called white countries. I can't believe how foolish and nave most of the other reviews are - this book is dangerous as it distracts from the emerging reality of global black nationalism and white disadvantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"George Lipsitz may have a decent point here - that whiteness comes with advantages.

They create their own strawman to knock down by creating their own social, or racial constructs that they can proceed to debunk.

This is the same issue I found with Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests (also by this author): poor editing leading to unnecessary repetitions and the appearance of odd paragraphs that seem to free float with no relation to the paragraphs preceding or following. Kaegi knows his stuff and it's well researched, but whomever does his editing does him a disservice. The publisher ought to be ashamed to have let this one by. There are literally instances of adjacent sentences repeating the same point just with different word order. Great opportunity for someone to write and equally well-researched biography and pair it with even a rudimentary amount of copy editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academic Fustian","review":"This is a disappointing book. The author contrives to make the amazing, dramatic events of Heraclius' reign banal, even boring. No doubt the source material is sparse and unreliable and this is some excuse. Regretably there is no serious attempt to assess the military resources and tactics of the participants in the struggle; the Avars come on to the scene and depart from it undescribed. The question of how Heraclius managed to maintain his army so long in the formidable mountains of Eastern Anatolia is not adequately addressed.The reign of Heraclius is very important; its consequences reverberate down to the present day, but unfortunately it still awaits treatment in extenso by a scholar who is endowed not only with diligence but with literary talent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"This compilation is commendable for some reasons and open to criticisms for others.Mr Hvorostovsky has a fine singing voice, unless he tries, as he does in some of the arias, to overdo it, inking and darkening it to scarce effect. A pity because where he keeps it light and soft, the lower voice of an accomplished baritone is ideal to trasmit the sheer sensuality of these pieces.His pronounciation is excellent and he gives the impression of perfectly knowing the words he is singing.A serious flaw lies in the choice of arias: it is never wise to mix sacred with mundane pieces, nor to juxtappose Handel's or Vivaldi's (who both require an individual compilation) opera excerpts with chamber pieces designed to entertain a small audience. The different styles clashes horribly even if the singing technique is distinguished.Orchestration is heavy and the sound engineer has not done a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dmitri's voice to dream by","review":"Beautiful arias.

Now the zoom lens mechanics work but the camera doesn't recognize its already fully zoomed and assumes it is actually not zoomed at all so consequently stays in the fully zoomed mode. Canon support was useless since 1 year has passed since purchase. It has never been dropped or bumped so there is no error message that would be displayed if either of the aforementioned had happened.

I've been a die-hard Canon SLR fan for a long time, but my first digital was the Kodak Z7590. I was looking for high mega-pixels and the Kodak had the best optical zoom available at the time (10X). I was deeply disappointed in the quality of the images produced by the Kodak and am thrilled to have replaced that camera with the Power Shot S3. It is fantastic! Would highly recommend it!The flip out LCD image finder is the best improvment over the S2 and I love the fact that I can add lenses to the camera at some point as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC CAMERA!!!","review":"I was given the S3 IS by my father when he upgraded to a Pentax dSLR and I've found it to be unbelievably easy to use and take very good, hi-res pictures. It is extremely simple to focus, unlike the S1 IS, which lacks the laser focus the S3 IS has. I've had the opportunity to do a lot of different types of photography with it, too, which is great--everything from low light to hand held shots of the waxing moon (super clear) to catching my daughter running around outside or at the beach, photographing birds at the local Audobon Society property, sunsets and sunrises. This seems to me to be just one step before having a DSLR--it has so many great functions and at this point in it's \\"distinguished career\\" is at an all-time low price on the website!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Widespread lens error makes S2/S3/S5 a bad buy.","review":"Search the Web a little for \\"Canon S3 lens error\\".

I have been involved in photography for 30 years and have owned a few different cameras in that time. This camera is definetly one of the best I've ever owned. I have experimented with most of the features and find the Stablization feature very helpful, especially when shooting sports at maximum zoom, or extreme close-ups in Super Macro mode. The colors are excellent and the high resolution allows me to crop a photo and still retain clarity. It is easy to use if you are an experienced photographer, but I would recommend to the beginner, to purchase a good book on Digital Photography, since the users manual may not be informative enough, to fully utilize this camera's many features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camara-Terrible Viewfinder","review":"I am generally happy with this S3, but as I have gotten older, and my eyes are dimenishing, I need a quality viewfinder. This one is electronic and suffers a clarity that I do not have in my other cameras- a digital rebel and old sureshot. At times I have taken pictures not knowing its focus, only to be pleasently pleased later on. The LCD is also not as good as I would wish. I think the IS is unbelivable, and its movie capabilities are amazing for its quality. I do not want to sound negative, but this has been my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed!","review":"I took my time upgrading from my last digital camera and researched several before buying this one. It is not for a first time user, or someone not interested in a feature rich camera. For example it has a flash but the flash is manual, and it is a bit bulkier than a most. But if you are thinking some day you want to upgrade to a true digital SLR, this is a great and cost effective first step or alternative. The ability to easily try out many cool features and add additional lens capability is great. What I love most is the fabulous zoom capability, and the fact that this camera also shoots movies with sound and does a great job at that too. It will take standard AA batteries or rechargable and for all it's power, the batteries seem to last a good long time. Downloading images to my laptop is effortless, something I struggled with on my first digital Fuji camera. For under $350 this camera is worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"The only reason that this camera is not top rated by me is that the instructions on use are difficult to understand.

So I was pleased with the service as well.But, it's kind of bulky for day to day use. I ended up buying a little camera my wife could stick in her purse.

The movie function is extremely good with the ability to use the optical zoom when shooting short movies.The biggest drawback with this camera is the lens cover - which keeps falling off, when carrying the camera using the neck strap around your neck. Especially when you are walking around various sights in a park for example. The lens could very easily get scratched because of this. I am very surprised that Canon overlooked this. If you are thinking of S3 be aware of this, verify if this is resolved in S5 if you decide to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I always do a lot of research before I dive into any purchase.

So the depth of field you can get is modest at best, particularly for closer work. As a minor complaint, I find you can't capture RAW images with this camera -- as a first-time digital photographer I didn't know anything about the uses of this format, so didn't know enough to look for it in a camera.

It can take point & shoot shots on auto mode, or you can explore further with p mode, tv mode, and others that offer more custom settings.I ordered and received an adapter and some filters from another site and I am looking forward to using them.

In other words, the inage appears in the middle and black lines on either side. I contacted Canon and they said this is normal. I have a hard time believing this.

I just returned my Powershot S3 IS because it did not do what I needed it to do. The ability to take macro photos is critical to me and this camera, despite claims to the contrary, does not have any real macro capability. The reviews on this page did not mention the macro mode in any substantive way--and now I know why.In macro mode, the zoom function is very limited. Only about a fifth or less of the 12X zoom can be used. After that, the camera will not focus. The field of view is about the size of a sunflower, if you are shooting flowers. I couldn't figure out how to shoot objects the size of bugs or coins without cropping. In supermacro mode, the zoom is unavailable altogether.This may be a very fine camera for other purposes, but if you want to use the macro mode, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected customer service","review":"This isn't a review of the S3 specifically, although I just got one; rather, it's a review of Canon customer service. My S1, which purchased about 3 years ago, recently broke. However, Canon had issued a consumer advisory on the particular problem I experienced and, through the advisory, offered to fix the problem even if the original warranty had expired (which was true in my case). Anyway, I sent my S1 back and after a couple of weeks, Canon sent me back a refurbished S3. While not brand new, I was very pleasantly surprised: the S3 is clearly a significant upgrade over my S1. Considering that my camera was 3 years old, the trade off was more than worth it.I'm looking forward to using the S3, since I was alreadly pleased with the performance of the S1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around camera","review":"I was debating on whether to upgrade to a digital SLR or go with a high-end digital. In the end, I decided I wasn't likely to lug around a bunch of lenses. So, I chose the S3 IS, because with a 12x zoom, it's like having a telephoto.The camera takes great pictures, and has a lot of great auto settings - high speed, night, etc. I love pairing the AV mode with telephoto to create artsy photos where one item is in focus, and the rest is blurred.While the LCD is smaller than some, the ability to flip it around more than makes up for it. Not only does it allow self portraits, but you can tilt it up to take ground level photos or tilt it down to take an over your head shot.The video is also great quality, and you can zoom while filming and take still photos. However, if you take a still photo, when you plan back the video, there is a one second freeze where the photo was taken.I really can't think of any negatives. I'm very happy with this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad CCD problem.","review":"There are many complaints on the internet on the S3 IS CCD ceasing to function. I sent back my S3 IS and they claim there is no known problem with the S2 or S3 IS. Well my government S2 IS did the same thing. I can buy a new CCD on line for $18 so it seems they are willing to have a bad reputation over this little money.

Even though this camera has a lot of bells and whistles to utilize all of it's capabilities (along with a comprehensive manual), only a few settings are needed for taking fantastic pictures. I mostly have been using just the AUTO and SPORTS settings, as I purchased this camera to take action shots of my sheltie running around with my Mom's sheltie. In addition, you could definitely benefit from purchasing a high speed SD card for this camera (I am using a 4GB 150x Transcend SD card). This Powershot will take full advantage of it, believe me. I also like the separate button for taking movies--another task that this camera excels at (640x480 @ 30fps). The articulating screen is also quite handy, especially for taking pics in crowds.

He also took a passage from the Institutes that Calvin was addressing the Catholic church and applied it to Calvin to support his claim that Calvin was anxious. I tried three times to get something out of this book and failed all three times. I appreciate Calvin too much to keep this book in my library.Also I crossed referenced some of his notes he claimed he quoted Calvin from and found discrepricancies. If you want a secular oppion of who Calvin was not based on his Theological mindset, then read this book. Otherwise disreguard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No whiz, no fizz.","review":"The prose in this novel is undeniably Olympian-somewhat on the order of Ruth Rendell on her best days. There perhaps, as they say, lies the rub. The plot is indeed exceedingly thin and it takes forever to wander to its ill-fated and unsurprising conclusion. If there had been even slightly more genuine creepiness (as opposed to merely dark and watery imagery) or plot intrigue, I would have felt justified frittering away the hours it took to consume this book. As it was, I just wanted it to be over long before it, unfortunately, was."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but...","review":"This is a well written book with one problem: no where in the information contained on the back of the book do the publishers mention that this is not a typical murder mystery, but a murder mystery with supernatural characters. Unfortunately you don't know this for sure until about halfway through. As I am not interested in the supernatural, I did not particularly enjoy the book. Also, Pyper has a habit of forgetting to use pronouns and strating sentences with verbs that gets really annoying after the 50th time. e.g. When normally aone would right \\"I drove to the store.\\" He writes \\"Drove to the store.\\" Sometimes he goes paragraphs without a using a subject in his sentences. Finally, this book is at best borrowing from a far superior mystery novel of the supernatural called, ironically, \\"Lost Boys\\" by Orson Scott Card, which is a far superior book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad movie","review":"Reading this book was like watching one of those awful Hollywood Freddie/Chuckie movies. I also wonder if the author ever parcticed law. His bio says he went to law school, but the main character, a lawyer, is like a caricature from Court TV. I ended up skimming the end, but I guessed it early on. Very a la Hours, by Michael Cunnigham, no insult intended to the latter. On the plus side, his descriptions of settings were very good. Maybe a decent beach book."},{"rating":"2","title":"On a par with \\"The Secret History\\"","review":"Imagine Stephen King, but with subtlety...Okay, I can't imagine that either. A better comparison is Donna Tartt's cult novel, \\"The Secret History.\\" In both cases, I found the book by accident, never having heard of the author; became entirely immersed from Page One; and felt a sense of loss when it ended, like finishing the last morsel of a favorite dessert. Pyper's Lost Girls is eerie, witty, richly atmospheric, and keenly suspenseful -- though the suspense is less a result of wondering whodunnit (or whatdunnit!) than it is an eagerness to see how the answers will effect the book's protagonist. And what a protagonist. Pyper's antihero narrator is a proudly immoral, self-absorbed lawyer, whose determination to free a likely murderer is exceeded only by his concern that he might run out of cocaine. Entirely against your will, you find yourself feeling empathy for the guy and yearning for his redemption. A fabulously diverting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not overly impressed","review":"I enjoyed the creepiness of it and must admit there were times I actually felt my heart pounding a bit...and I was jumpy around the house for a little while...but it still can't be classified as \\"horror\\", it isn't really satisfying as a mystery, it's more than just a story. I guess, for me, it just left a whole lot to be desired.The main characters were very one-dimensional.

He is sent to a burnt out little town in Northern Ontario to defend a man accused of killing two teenage girls. Then the atmosphere grows eerie as the bad dreams and hallucinations begin.This novel owes as much to Dicken's 'A Christmas Carol' as it does to the works of Stephen King. The lead character at first seems to be an anti-hero, but by the novels end the reader believes he has transformed into a halfway decent human being.I would recommend this horror legal thriller hybird to fans of John Grisham, Stephen King, or Ruth Rendell.Also Recommmended: 'Julian's House' by Judith Hawkes and 'Something Dangerous' by Patrick Redmond"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to enjoy this book...","review":"There's an interesting premise, a potentially fascinating set of characters, and a grisly set of deaths all based in an atmospheric town. It should have been a good read. And, it almost was. But...The atmosphere and foreshadowing overwhelm the characters and the story. The tension and the mood is laid in so heavy-handed a manner that it's distracting. It became a chore to plow through this novel to make it to the end (though I did, for whatever reason...). The few 'mysteries' were incredibly predictable. The descriptions were so dense that it was tough to remember what happening in the story, and the caricaturization was so distracting that it was impossible to care at all for the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and seductive","review":"Incorporating the best of Scott Turow and Stephen King, Andrew Pyper has created an unusual and compulsively readable novel in LOST GIRLS. Attorney Batholomew Crane is a young, coke addicted attorney assigned his first murder case. It's Barth's job to get a teacher accused of killing two of his female students off. No matter what the cost, Barth intends to get his client an acquittal. As Crane digs deeper into the case, pieces of which may be tied to the town's history and to a long forgotten, shameful episode in his own past, Barth spirals further and further away from reality. With prose so beautiful it brings to life the desperation of Bartholomew Crane as he slowly suffers a personal breakdown and redemption, and the cold, white desolation of Northern Canada, LOST GIRLS has a creepy atmosphere that compels you to keep turning pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the Genre","review":"I actually read THE KILLING CIRLCE before unearthing Pyper's first book.

She's spent a lot of time with a magnifying glass observing the ants. It is facinating watching the ants tunnel.

The other big problem, which I didn't understand, was some of the ants fell down the front of the hill and could not climb back up.

It's nice to read the other reviews and know I'm not the only one to ever listen to it. Back then, in the late '70s, I saw Horslips live at a club in Portland, OR. Toward the end of the show, soon after they started King of the Faeries, the lighting system blew a breaker or something and the stage and most of the audience was dumped into blackness. The sound system still had power and the band never stopped. They didn't even hesitate.

Highly recommended, even for those who like good sound. These deliver rich base, and are good for mp3 listening as well as dvd watching. In fact, for the price I just might buy a spare.

Ute Lemper and Ruthie Henshall bring together flawless performances that stand out on the cd. Unlike the Broadway cd with Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking, this cd is very energetic and beautifully sung. Ute is very funny and strong in singing. Ruthie is hilarious particularly in her Roxie Soliloquoy. My personal favorite song on this cd is \\"My Own Best Friend.\\" I highly recommend this cd even if the lyrics don't come with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Roxie! Dull Supports.","review":"Ruthie Henshall is younger than the Broadway Roxies' with a wider vocal range. She's also a fine actress and her comic talent shines on the recordings of \\"Funny Honey\\" and \\"Roxie.\\" Ute Lemper got great reviews for her acting and dancing but I find her singing voice irritating. I find the supporting roles pretty sad. Mary Sunshine is awful, Mama Morton sounds like she's doing a bad Marcia Lewis immitation, and Amos sounds far to nasty to be a sympathetic Mr. Cellophane. Billy Flynn plays up the comic side of the role and the chorus sounds fine despite their odd American accents in the dialogue scenes. Overall a fine recording. Worth the price just to hear Ruthies' Roxie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and avoid this soundtrack!!!!","review":"Ute Lemper and Ruthie Henshall and the rest of the London Cast of \\"Chicago\\" sound like they are singing opera rather than Musical theatre.

When I saw what was available here, I thought I would get a professional, stage version with some really great vocals. I have heard Ruthie Henshall sing before, so my expectations were high. I was really disappointed with this version. The singing was weak and the tempos on some of the songs just did not sound right. The vocals on the movie soundtrack were better and the American accents on this version were strange and affected.I would recommend the movie soundtrack to fans of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The former review is for the wrong book.","review":"Hi folks I just wrote this to caution you that the former reviewer is inadverently reviewing the MECHANICS book by the same author.

The historical information is correct, but as far as the information on religion and culture is concerned, some of the information is incorrect. Captions for the photographs/drawings used in the book could have been better as far as dates of the photographs and proper identification of the subjects. Several of the captions are incorrect. What I found most offensive was the use of a photograph of our very sacred Sha'la'ko ceremony. Overall this book was poorly written, an example from the Customs section on page 25, \\"Among these are the June Rain Dance, held in August,...\\" The editors needed to be more thorough in researching the topic.

Two, use the character generator CD-ROM that comes with the PHB. Three, download one off the internet. Four, create your own sheets. All of these options are, for all intents and purposes, free. I found a much better sheet online that has a lot more room to write things, so I don't have to squint to see what I wrote.

The 32 sheets or so in this product aren't even going to get you started, especially when so many of them are unusable because they're a class that you never play.

Mommy shows up just in time to rescue him when he takes a tumble off of the giraffe, teaching Bobo that sometimes it's OK to be small.Tall follows the same approach as Hug, with a minimal use of words (small, tall, fall, Bobo, and Mommy) and a journey through the jungle where he encounters some familiar friends. Alborough's artwork is wonderful, and Bobo's facial expressions are just as endearing as they were in Hug.Tall is a delightful book for young children; and anyone who's a child at heart will find this book hard to resist.

He also discusses the effect public outcry against the war in Southeast Asia had on defense and exposes the bureaucratic wrangling that plagues the defense budget.Although it was written some time ago, the political forces he mentions are very much active today and affect our war against terrorists.

The plot moves a little slow at first but once your into it, it grabs hold and won't let go.It's unfortunate this disc has no extras, as I'd be interested in seeing a trailer for this director's other movies. Also the quality of this DVD is lesser than most other companies (even without the sound error)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but technical problems with sound","review":"Subiela is great like usual, but unfortunately I could not enjoy this movie like his other ones since the sounds cuts off on the second part of the film.

Harman Kardon receivers incorporate a number of innovative circuit designs that significantly improve the sound quality of the receiver and the rest of your system. My father had been using another name brand receiver for a number of years and had been quite happy with it, but it eventually conked out. We replaced it with a Harman Kardon receiver and were both struck by how much better his whole HiFi sounded and the receiver was the only component we'd replaced.

Just a slight movement from the male plug (that goes into the radio), would cause the radio to be unusable.I found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radio's headset socket. The problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much, not allowing a good \\"seat\\".

It clearly explains that when a child is ready to learn spoken language she can also learn to read. This is because the same pathways in the brain are used. Actually a child learns to read more easily as a baby than she can as a 6 or 7 year old.A baby doesn't learn to understand speech and to speak by learning phomenes, the fundamental elements of speech. I baby learns to understand and speak words. A child initially learns to read by word recognition. Learning the alphabet slows the process for a baby. After they read they can learn the alphabet and phonetics, they will be valuable then.This book was first published in 1969. In a rational world it would have revolutionized education by now. Compare the invention of the transistor and the changes it has made in our world over the last 45 years. This book should have had a similar impact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressive as the review","review":"I've read through this book although not the whole page and find it over-rated.The REAL contents are really little and there's no useful info until Chapter 7. All it does is just tell you WHY it's important to start baby to read early(like i don't know that) and it is POSSIBLE(maybe back in 64\\", people didn't think it was possible..but hey, this is 2005, there's no point putting half of the book on justification now to convince modern parents). I think this have to be one of the most over-hyped books for decades!It's not the whole book is crap. It DOES have it contents, but which is not too special and probably any child expert can give you a hint or too...and sometimes, common sense.All in all, i'm not impressed. Definitely NOT a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may be surprised by early reading","review":"I used an older edition of Doman's book over twenty years ago to teach my children to read. My first son started at twenty months, my second at fifteen months. Both were reading fluently before age 2 1/2 and speed-reading by age 3. Their childhood was enriched by their ability to read widely and at length. Both have been exceptional students. I would recommend Doman's book highly. Doman insists that teaching very young children to read can only succeed if carried out with great pleasure. Doing so is not difficult"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"Even if you don't \\"believe\\" you can teach a baby to read, this book is well worth it. It gives you advice on how to encourage your baby to improve and you to improve as parent. Those who criticize the technique obviously never read the book. The author encourages any baby the opportunity to read regardless of the technique. The only reference to phonics is that it is not needed, as your baby will know how to read before phonics can be started. The only complaint I have is the parent/baby relationship is always referred to as mother and son. Though up front the author says that sexism is not intended, it would not have been that difficult for it to be rewritten not to imply it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, logical books ever!","review":"I picked up my first copy of How To Teach Your Baby to Read about 20 years ago.

As a teacher, I thought this was just more bull. Little did I know that it was written by a doctor who had worked with brain-damaged children, and could teach them to read. I learned a lot from this little book, and have referred it to many people. The concept is quite easy, and fun. Serveral years later I was lucky enough to find the VCR to go with it! Both are superb.

Ja Rule is a perfect example of a formula m.c. He has realized what type of records he needs to create that will boost record sales and make him money. That's why every single he has released has the same format of a pop/r-n-b sounding track and an r and b singer singing the hook. It is a shame that a lyrically talented artist has to go to waste in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Point black-capitalism is stagnating the growth of true hip hop. There is a group named \\"Smylez and Southstar\\" that released a song that uses the same sample of Ja's song \\"Mezmerize\\". Aside from the hooks and the flow of the m.c.'s the songs beats are nearly identical. Now that's creativity.

It seems evident that he will never be album to reach the lyrical height that once had on his debut album, \\"Venni Vetti Vecci\\". Now filled his songs full of R&B beats with nothing but average women singing the hooks, Ja Rule has surely put out another bad album. In every song, he either takes someone's style, song or flow. Good Hip Hop is dying off and Ja Rule has played a big role in that. No one why the whole rap game has been dissing you (50 Cent, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, DMX and even more).

However, with this \\"pop\\" album, he just had his last stand. Ja reminds me of MC Hammer. A rapper who believes his own hype and then sells his soul for the chance of pop success. Now in a desperate move, he's trying to attack 50 and others to prove he's a \\"thug\\". But he's only digging himself in even deeper because no one believes him. If you ever question why his songs are being played along side Britney's, J.Lo's and N'Sync's and not Biggie's and 2Pac's, it's because he did it to himself.

Jeffery \\"Ja Rule\\" Atkins is at it again this time creating a painful/street hybrid album unlike any of his earlier outings. Ja, annoyed by the whispers of him being a softie and selling out, returns with The Last Temptation LP which takes him back to his birthplace:the streets. Ja's first single 'Thug Lovin' is the normal thug ballad he is known for, but the fun ends there. On 'Connected' he journeys to the westcoast,'Pop N****s' finds him killing back in the street, and 'Murder Reigns' releases his pain with anger and sadness at the same time. Guest apperarances include Nas, Ashanti, and Bobby Brown. This CD isn't quite a classic, but is definetly his best yet.

Em has consistently showed the hip hop world that no one can dis him and get away with it. How many enemies does Ja want? X don't like him, Jay don't like him, 50 can't stand him, Em will tear him apart lyrically. Bad news for the little guy and his whole crew.

All the song's on his album are whack the only song worth listen to is the pledge and there's only two people on that song i want to hear hint...(it's not Ja Rule and Ashanti). If he wants to go pop he should call himself a pop singer, and instead of Chuck B. on his songs maybe he should use Britney S. He's about as hardcore as late night movies on cinemax. The only bold move he did for this whole album is using a dophene Like Bobby Brown the \\"King Of R&B\\" on Thug Lovin.

The one positive on this cd is the track \\"Connected\\", this song alone is reason to at least listen to the cd once.

Does he think no one will notice that he is just remanufacturing the same song over and over. Ja should just release an R&B album where he is singing on every track because you know that's all he wants to do.

This album is no different than the previous ones he put out. It's garbage, trash, and most of all, lacks of creativity and originality. His wannabe gangsta click \\"murder inc\\" doesn't help either. They put out videos that they copy from notable mob movies like the \\"Good Fellas.\\" Ja Rule still doesn't know who he really wants to be, Tupac or DMX... This is so depressing.

He's gotten worse with each album afterwards. Doing all these songs with female R&B singers are bailing him out with the top 40 mainstream public but pure rap fans have lost all faith in him whatsoever after ...album. Now it seems that 50 Cent's dissing of Ja Rule is justified, ... even during the halftime show of the Eagles vs Bucs game the fans in Philly all booed him off the field. He was that bad, the guy can't sing so I don't know who he is trying to fool and now he can't rap either. If you want to hear some real rap from the streets listen to Nas' last two albums (Stillmatic & God's Son). I also recommend Phrenology from The Roots.

He sounds like he has a bad case of strep throat, but it gets much worse when he attempts to sing. His rhymes are whack commercial trash that sells, and when he attacks others rappers, he just makes more of a fool out of himself.And it's rather a shame that a talented MC like Nas had to guest star in one of his songs here. I mean, he uses Ashanti and Bobby Brown, isn't that enough to make his tripe sell?The beats are lame and rehashed beyond belief as well.Definitely one of the worst rap albums to come out in the 21st century, only to be paralleled with 50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\" following three years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"yo","review":"everyone do not hate on ja rule because 50 cent hates him. your all just a bunch of followers and mainstreamers if you do. hate him for the poppy crap that he puts out. incase you didnt know 50 cent has became ja rule with whack poppy crap. listen to smile, pimp, 21 questions, baby u got. all trash. boycott those music."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Cant get any worse","review":"Ja...A lil advice...Go back to the Venni Vetti Vecci Days.....U ...

Everything was pop and singing, not rapping. \\"The Last Temptation\\" is the same thing. The only songs that I do like in this album are:Pop Niggas (produced by Neptunes),The Pledge (remix) w/Nas & Ashanti,The Warning, and Connected w/Eastwood & Crooked I.

It came back to life on and off a couple of times before I pulled out every cable and boxed it up. While it was working it sounded very warm. powerful, and the imaging was great. This unit gets hot, much hotter than it should. I've since read the reviews at audioreview and wish I had before purchasing this receiver. I think H/K dropped the ball on the avr45, avr65, and avr85. I went to Circuit City after XMAS and saw 6 returned AVR's on the shelves, 45's , 65's and 85's. That told me something. I was willimg to live with only one optical input, no DTS and no A/B speakers, but not after the gremlins took hold of it. Sounds like a processor problem throughout the line.

As long as author Pat Conroy is around, however, we need not be concerned. This is a wonderful, lyrical, poetic novel that alternates between the protagonist's present day conflicts and his childhood in the Carolina low country. It's hard for me to think of a novel I like any better from any age. I wish I could say the same about the movie. Despite a noble effort by Nick Nolte in the lead role, Barbra Streisand sinks the film version, as director and female lead. I wish I had never even watched it so as not to intrude on this otherwise perfect gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is complete genius!","review":"I am a devoted reader, and probaly have read more books than I can count.

Conroy writes what he knows and he creates characters that are so rich in humanity and a story so deep in conflict yet he writes with a magical prose. Years after reading this book, some of the images are still indelibly imprinted in my mind. He reminds me of modern day Tennesse Williams in his portrayal of flawed, tragic Southern characters. Truly a wonderfully gifted writer. I decided to write this review after perusing through a list of Conry books to find my next one to read. Forget the movie, read the book first then see the movie. It will only richen the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was nothing......","review":"I read this book shortly after it came out. It is the kind of book that will make you burn dinner, miss appointments and neglect hygiene, you can't put it down. I had the sense all through this book that it was somewhat autobiographical, There is alot of symbolism, and pure Southern, particularly Charlestonian, culture that Ms. Streisand completely neglected in the disappointing film version of this great story. Nick Nolte was perfect for the character he played, however. Very southern, very Charleston. This book is graphic in it's violence and tortuously painful in it's hardest parts, but so real. If you're not Southern, you might not be able to fully appreciate the subjects he deals with. But, it's one of my absolute favorite books of fiction, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Not Good","review":"I really did not enjoy this book.

I finally took it off my Kindle and decided I won't be coming back to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"gripping, but not great literature.","review":"Prince of Tides would have been a much better read if it didn't show its age so badly. Conroy's fixation on politically correct themes (the white southern boy constantly emphasizing that he's unfairly labeled a racist) and the classic disfunctional family model (abusive father, enabling mother) easily allow you to place the publication date smack dab in the middle of the eighties. If these two themes hadn't been hammered at constantly throughout the book, it might make it more enjoyable to read 10 years after it was published.The dialogue also needs some work. Tom Wingo is simply too clever in the biting exchanges with his mother or the witty sarcasm which so successfully woos the icy therapist.

Because things finally begin to take off at about 100 pages in, I am trying to stick with it, but other temptations are many.

This author being from the South, writes in a style that many southern authors use. He tries to use as many words that an average reader will have to search the dictionary in order to find their meanings. Just using plain simple english will not do for these writers.

He creates characters with immense intensity and life, regardless of how flawed they are. Prince of Tides is not a joyful book. While there are uplifting scenes, there is a pervading sadness. The topics of suicide, abuse and despair bestow a melancholy that cannot be redeemed regardless of how many inspiring anecdotes Conroy includes, though there is an underlying hope that timidly presents itself. I found Prince of Tides to be Conroy's darkest book, but as always, I appreciate his extraordinary writing. He narrates Tom Wingo well, exploring the history of his troubled family. Between his abusive father, his delusional and infuriating mother, his unfortunate brother, his suicidal sister and the tragic things that happen to them, it is no wonder Tom is a deeply unhappy and conflicted man. The history of the Wingo family is splendidly detailed and instilled with a magic that only Conroy can convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the book...loathed the movie...","review":"What was Streisand thinking when she made a movie of this book?

This novel proves that English language can be beautiful just like the romantic languages; it just needs to be handled by the likes of Mr. Conroy. More than a novel, this is a poem that unfolds in front of us like a fierce, blazing explosion of vivid colors of a New England autumn. The unforgettable voyage that a lucky reader is taken through is filled with colorful images of the world of tides, of the Carolina sky, of the Colleton marshes, of the riveting fireworks in the sky that makes savannah cry out \\"oh mama, do it again!\\" and of very many more.

I was well into the book before I realized/found out that this was fiction. I was really mad at the author for making me such intense emotions for someone that wasn't real. Now of course I realize that the fact that someone can write this well is because the characters aren't really just fiction, they are part real, part fiction, part day dream. The Prince of Tides should be read by anyone with a tragic suffering childhood, it really helps to see that someone understands. I'd imagine that someone that had a wonderful upbringing and was bestowed with love and affection just might not \\"get it\\" but even such a person couldn't help but be touched by this story unless they owned a dead heart.

I found Tom, the central character, to be a whiny, self-centered, self-pitying, sarcastic person. I found that the dialogue did not ring true. Conversations between Tom and Susan were annoying to read when each character said the other's name in almost every sentence. Savannah as a child did not sound like a child; she spoke as though she were an adult. Tom's incessant whining about his horrible childhood was irritating. Lots of people had worse childhoods Tom, get over it. And his \\"humor\\" was just not funny to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"A real snoze. This book drags on for way too many pages. If there is a plot, it is lost in the many, many pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book of all Time","review":"Never has a book has such an inpact as this brilliant, beautiful tale. I was completely transported to the Street of Tides and the mkarshes of South Carolina. The tragedies and triumphs were expressed so amazingly, and the prose was so lyrical. The romance was wonderful, although my favorite part is the relationships between Tom, Luke and Savannah. The movie is excellent in it's own way, it's impoosible to turn this masterpice into a two hour film. Pat Conroy is a genius, and his outlandish situations (the bengal tiger) and outrageous charachters have a huge lasting impact. There's so much to learn from this book. It's a long read, but I never want it to end. This is a book to read and study over and over, and I think it's the best novel ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Life Altering","review":"Having grown up with a single parent who was half Henry Wingo and half Lila, The Prince of Tides has deep significance for me. Prior to reading this book, it was inconceivable to me that a brown immigrant boy growing up in tropical Hawaii could have so much in common with a self-proclaimed redneck on a Carolina sea island a generation earlier. Never has a story, fact or fiction, come as close to portraying my life as Tom Wingo's.Unwittingly, Mr. Conroy has helped me understand my own life, in turn precipitating and condensing years of self-discovery (and the oft-accompanying torment) into the time it took to read the book. I am now on my fifth reading and Tom's reflections and evolution continue to help me be a better husband and father.This is not a perfect work... I wish it were so easy to forgive and forget in real life. But it has truly been a life-altering experience for me. Thank you, Mr. Conroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very overwrought!","review":"Mr. Conroy has never met an adjective he didn't like. I had seen and disliked the movie years ago, but came upon the book recently and thought I'd give it a try, knowing that Babs could easily have ruined it. Well, it was better than the movie, but not so great as the breathless reviews here suggest. The plot careens out of control (domestic abuse, insanity, class warfare, football, Jewish psychiatrist-temptress, neurotic violinist, twins, Vietnam, the atom bomb--oh Lord, it just never lets up for a second), the dialogue is hilariously unrealistic, and the author is one of those self-indulgent types who just loves every word that pours forth from his brain and is in dire need of a good editor. There are some good short stories buried here, and the bones of a decent book, but it boggles my mind that anyone would call this overwritten tome a life-changing experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince of Tides Audio Book","review":"Excellent book - epic, quality writing. Product arrived in perfect condition, and timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most morose, depressing, well written book I've read","review":"The summary above says it all for me. I love to read the writing; Pat Conroy is a superb story teller. But he can't seem to get out of the deep south intercoastal nor cast his lead characters as anything other than white trash. In \\"Prince\\", I made it through two thirds of book until I realized that it simply became more depressing as I progressed. Don't read this book if you need uplifting. But do read it if you are an unabashed Pat Conroy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is hard to understand the success of this book.","review":"All novels require a suspension of disbelief, but this one was too much for me. It uses the hoary device of Freudian analysis as a means of structuring the story. The great traumatic secret that this analysis eventually uncovers is so over the top as to be funny rather than horrifying; one would like to know what Flannery O'Connor would have thought of it. As much as others love this book, for me almost everything in it rang false."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing story","review":"I read this book cover to cover. It is compelling, but it is also an upsetting story about the most disfunctional family in history, who has the most terrible and uncontrolable things happen to them. It gave me nightmares, and made my family look the the Cleavers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"I baught the audio version.

You will absolutely hate your self if you spend even 5 minutes listening to this extremely anoying dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal, turgid tripe: a soap opera disguised as a novel.","review":"If this is what people now call literature, the English language is in dire state. Conroy's prose, though occasionally poetic, is all too trite. The novel's dismal plot is cinematically melodramatic. It is hard to imagine such a group of characters actually existing. In short, this book does little but satisfy the unintellectual reader's desire for entertaining escapism. The words literature and fiction must not be confused..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I hate that some people may judge southern writers by the crap Conroy writes. Carrying a dolphin from SC to Florida in one night? Was it wrapped up in a wet blanket or sloshing around in a bath-tub? Don't remember. What foolishness Give me a break. The crap about the tiger...who does he think he's kidding? Does he truly expect us to take his writing seriously? Does he take it seriously? Or does he simply think anyone stupid enough to buy his work will also believe it? Save your money for a bag of bricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFINISHABLE","review":"I looked at the reviews and decided to give this author a try. The worst rating I can give a book is \\"unfinishable\\". This book was well within the category. The story is shallow, like a bad TV miniseries, steaming with fabricated drama and endless references to tired cultural cliches. The writing is breathtakingly childish. There is no sense that any editing took place. The author makes obvious and inappropriate use of over-the-top vocabulary. These are words never seen in common usage, the kind of thing you have to look up in a dictionary. To what end, I am unsure. In conclusion, it's a very poorly written book with a weak hyper-dramatic storyline.......unfinishable, to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored. The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent. The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read. The dreadful ending just caps it all off. A real waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stories, one short and fun, the other long and boring","review":"I found this book unnecessary long, the story of Tom Wingo in New York is very exiting and naturally appealing, but having such long background on his southerner childhood was extremely boring, not to talk about the almost insulting stories about the white porpoise and the older brother fighting against the world. I think the author tries to explain that Tom Wingo is a looser because he had such a terrible childhood. Fair enough, but I think the explanation went on too far. To me the whole book is about Wingo blowing his last chance in life, and then blaming it on his childhood. I think a looser is a looser even if he/she had a bad childhood (like many of us have)."},{"rating":"2","title":"madideas","review":"I've never been to South Carolina, but after reading Pat Conroy's masterpiece, I feel like I'm digging for oysters alongside Tom Wingo. Mr. Conroy's works are so rich with description and emotion, it takes me months after reading one of his novels and I'm still fully absorbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I liked this book. It was a little dysfunctional, but in a good way. It had a slow start, but worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Read It","review":"Okay, everybody get off your pedestals. Let's admit it: Conroy is an amazing writer. His grasp on words and the images he weaves make me jealous. Also, I don't see why some critics have a problem with the anecdotes Conroy places in the middle of the story. Newsflash: a book does not have to be boring to become a classic (i.e. Emily Bronte)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will never forget the Prince of Tides","review":"Like the greatest of novels...this one sticks to you forever. To those that give it four stars I say \\"quit being so self-important as to feel like you need to find fault\\". I would ask them what greater novel in the last 75 years has been written. Better yet...write one yourself.I read a lot and have rarely found a work that grabbed me and never let go. I'm writing this review 13 years after I read it for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern beauty of a novel","review":"An excellent novel. Pat Conroy is obviously a master of the English language with an expansive vocabulary. Writes both the southern and northern ways of existence with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary! a true masterpiece!","review":"What a truly magnificent piece of art. Thank you Mr. Conroy for sharing this jewel with me. It has touched my soul and therefore is now a part of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEEP EXTRAORDINARY NOVEL","review":"Well, I read this book because I needed one novel to analyze for my thesis work, then I discover the extraordinary beauty of the South. Conroy portrays the Wingo\`s suffering in an undescriptible way: I never forget this book. And I truly recommended it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow... I am now a Conroy fan for life!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OK!!! I admit it...when I started reading, I kind of cheated; I listened to audio selections of Conroy's southern drawl, each syllable enticing me to read this beautiful prose for the full literary effect. After hearing the begining of the cassette chocked full of mystical words, I struggled to not only memorize all that he said, but to merely shut the book. (Eventually, I realized that sleep is essential.) But I found my self sucked into Tom Wingo's stories, the horror, funny and reflective. If you loved this book, full of unforgettable description and gripping action, may I suggest reading Boy's Life by Robert Cormier? I will reread this and I suggest you should too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Having discovered Pat Conroy's literature is one of the best things that have happened to me. This is the first book I read from him and I am always trying to find other Conroy's books.I have also read Beach MUsic and, more recently, Lords of Discipline. Both of them deeply moving. You can learn so much by entering these characters'lives. By writing such stories, Pat Conroy makes us better people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic from America's best storyteller","review":"Conroy is an American treasure. All of his novels touch the inner-spirit, and bring back memories from my childhood on the ocean. His writing takes you places with beautiful prose, and his depth of character only makes you feel empathy in times of sorrow, and joy in the good times. Tom Wingo will live within me my whole life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prince of Tides is the best novel Conroy has written.","review":"I have read all of Conroy's novels, and The Prince of Tides is the best, followed by The Lords of Discipline. The Prince of Tides hits you on so many levels, it is so vivid and real. One of my favorite moments is when the mother ushers in the moon for the Wingo kids - marvelous! The movie leaves out the title character and is way off base. I think the book would be better served by a miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul-stirring novel opens your eyes to the South","review":"It was wonderful- I have read Prince two times now and it is just one of those novels that you can't put down. Luke and Lila were the main characters to me, rather than Tom and his sister. Their depictions were soul-stirring and moving. A fabulous read for those who are close to their siblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Conroy Book","review":"I first read this book on a rainy road trip 5 years ago-I actually hoped that the rain wouldn't stop. This book just completely sweeps you up-you become so involved with the family and the tragedy of their lives-it's beautifully written and full of suspense as well-I recomend this one to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This DVD!","review":"This transfer is dreadful: video glitches; torn frames; grainy and contrasty transfer'etc. I got a better copy TIVOing it from cable on a recent broadcast. Avoid at all costs, and wait for another version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie -- Atrocious transfer","review":"This transfer is a pan-and-scan from an analog videotape. The tape has a variety of dropouts and creases. The video varies substantially in level, and the sound is bad. Whoever did the transfer didn't even have the gumption to kill the color. The movie is black and white, but it crawls with crosscolor on any high-frequency detail. It's a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A psychological thriller, Repulsion is ahead of it's time.","review":"Repulsion is different from other horror movies because it is mostly a psychological thriller, a rarity in the genere. It was amazing how Polanski used the apartment as a metaphor of Carol's subconscious. Although it is not a work of art, even though many people think it is, this movie provids plenty of thrills for a Friday night when a person is home alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT FILM...poorly rendered","review":"A beautiful young woman (ravishing Catherine Deneuve) with a \\"repulsion\\" toward men, slowly sinks into madness and murder. Creepy and terrifying, this is among Roman Polanski's best work. The film is ***** all the way. It deserves far better treatment than this murky pan-and-scan DVD version that looks like it was video taped off a late night TV showing. Let's hope somebody at Criterion thinks it's at least as worthwhile as \\"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\\" and \\"The Blob.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cures insomnia, at least ...","review":"Boring with a capital B. A coma patient could've played the lead role. Deneuve's character has the personality of a fencepost. Nothing happens, and you fall asleep. FAIL.

Unisom is much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo o o oring","review":"The sound track is so bad as to render most of the dialogue useless if not downright irritating; it might as well have been produced as a silent film. Much of the artistic photography is obscured by film blemishes.The storyline is neither terrifying nor artistically appealing; just dreadfully long, dull and pointless,creating in the viewer an ever increasing sense of impatience for the thing mercifully to end! I gave up after 58 minutes of exasperation downright anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT STINKS!!!","review":"This is a review of the Criterion Release, and the only good thing I can say about it is that the print looks quite good, up to Criterion's usual standards. Thankfully I rent before I buy an expensive Criterion DVD, so I'm not out the purchase price. How bad is the movie? After watching this I had the urge to stick the DVD in my broiler and watch it melt. My wife and I are fans of Polanski -- we love Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown, so we figured there must be something worthwhile about this film. We were SO wrong. It's interminably slow. Tedious. Pretentious. Stupid. It has moments that are laughably bad. It contains some of the worst music in a movie, ever. The characters have no personality. It makes no sense. It's not scary. There's no suspense. IT JUST STINKS!!!! Save $30 and 105 minutes of your life by not buying or watching this turkey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cover art","review":"I am disappointed with Criterion's artwork for this. A real lack of effort, if you ask me.I can picture numerous stills from the movie that would've served excellent duty as cover art.I'm thrilled this is being released in the first class Criterion way but I feel they dropped the ball with the cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, yet intriguing.","review":"This movie is very good and is definitely a \\"disturbing\\" film. I love how Carol (Deneuve) rarely talks and how she very slowly and grdually goes completely mad.There is not much music in this film - except occasionally a flute will play LOW notes - slowly. It's kind of creepy. The scene where she slices the man to death with the razor blade is insane. SHE DOESN'T STOP! Thank God that this is in black and white! Also, since there is rarely any music - all screams and gory sound effects are heard clearly. But it's not too bad.Definitely one of the greatest films overall of this century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great - This DVD release is HORRIBLE","review":"Don't buy this. Seriously. Someone is bound to release a better version. This is PAN AND SCAN, cropped at 1:33, and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape...Like a 3/4 inch VHS. There are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film. And no it's NOT the print. The film is fine. It's the transfer. cheap, cheap, cheap.The compression is abysmal (notice the obvious scan lines on the titles) and the sound is piss poor. How is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the US? Disgraceful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home alone with the rabbit ...........","review":"There was a general warning about this movie in 1965 that anyone who was just remotedly slightly \\"off\\" should not see this work, I believe that it still applies. Beautifully photographed in black and white we watch the gorgeous Catherine Deneuve [a somewhat dreamy beautician by day] slowly go insane over the course of a \\"home-alone\\" weekend, it turns into a surreal nightmare, splitting walls [cracks appear] dead fertility symbols [the fly infested rabbits in the kitchen] and that man behind the dresser.......she also tends to bump off a few visiting males in a rather spectacular way. You can still hear the razor slicing though .... no, its better to watch this one.Most of the movie is without dialogue, purely a visual experience, the proof of real cinema. no words, just that beautiful maddening face.Yvonne Furneaux [\\"La Dolce Vita\\"] plays the sister, John Fraser, the lover.Disturbing, still disturbing, an excellent companion to \\"The Tenant\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic horror film features Deneuve's finest performance","review":"Repulsion is simply one of the greatest masterpieces of modern horror on film. The tale of a beautiful, but disturbed young woman's descent into dementia is one of the masterpieces of 1960's cinema. Catherine Deneuve shines in the role of the alluringly beautiful, but demented Carol. This film has all of the spellbinding and chilling horror of the original Psyco. This film is, in my opinion one of the top 10 films of the 1960's, and one of Catherine Denueve's finest performances. The viewer will remember this film long after seeing it. This is truely a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sincerely tried to get into this one","review":"If Catherine Deneuve hadn't been as hot as she was, I wouldn't have gone the 50 minutes into this that I did. This flick roared along at the same frightening pace at which paint dries. It's remeniscent of \\"Eraserhead\\", but if you were to remove anything remotely interesting in Eraserhead , whatever was left would be Repulsion. Normally I enjoy the bizarre and the wierd but this was just flat. Like trying to spot your hair growing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferably Boring","review":"I was very dissappointed by \\"Repulsion\\" after the rave reviews the film received. The film suffers from a definite lack of plot. Admittedly I am not a fan of so called \\"character studies\\". I did not find this film at all scary or exciting or anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant film; unwatchable tape","review":"REPULSION is a classic suspense film, worth of watching over and over again to capture all its subtleties. However, this specific tape is of such poor quality that watching the film is almost impossible. The video is smeary and indistinct, but worst of all the sound is so muffled that nearly all of the dialogue is rendered unintelligible. Please see this film; however, make sure you don't make the mistake I did of renting/buying this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE waste of money DVD release...great film!","review":"I need to say that this is a fabulous movie and an obnoxiously horrible DVD.I own the Criterion Laserdisc...which is properly formatted at 1:75 NOT the full screen 1:33 that this is....and the \\"digitally remastered\\" title is a crock....the image is full of junk....the laserdisc is much much better AND ..has a commentary track by Polanski and Denueve and an interview and Polanski short features.....Heck the old Criterion LD just kicks this crappy DVD in the butt! For about $10 you can do worse but I'd much rather see the studio that owns this get nothing for their shoddy work and be forced to put out a PROPER release...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I truly enjoy this film. I heard of it from Cynthia Freeland's book \\"The Naked and the Undead,\\" a feminist perspective of horror films. Maybe because of this I was more prepared for what to expect. I thought her analysis was intriguing and I sought out the movie because of it.I think the movie is a great film. Weird, strange, at times disgusting--of course. But I still like it. I also like Rosemary's Baby.As for the DVD itself. My copy does still have the scratchy/grainy effect of film, but I happen to enjoy that. I also do not have HD, so maybe my taste in technology is lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"Deneuve is absolutely gorgeous and a great actress as well. Carol is so heartbreakingly innocent and helpless. Even when she resorts to murder, you feel bad for her and view her as uncorrupted thanks to Deneuve's performance. The movie basically captures a vision of a innocent but disturbed mind that has been neglected by society...her sister is callous and blind to Carol's mental state...Her handsome admirer is in love with her beauty and sweetness and also fails to reach her....she is silently screaming for help but her cries are unheard until it becomes too late...i am surprised that this movie was directed by Roman Polanski (a big womanizer) as it presents such a sympathetic portrait of a lost, innocent girl.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD release","review":"This film deserves 5 stars, and that's what I give it. The region 1 DVD for this film is horrible. It's pan and scan (fullscreen, 1.33:1) and has poor quality. The film was shot in 1.75:1, not 1.33:1!

Am I ever thankful I could fast-forward through much of it. Acting? Plot? Cinematography? Screenplay? Are you kidding me? This was without doubt one of the worst excuses for a film I've seen in recent memory. Even transporting myself back to the time of London in the '60's, I saw no evidence of the attributes upon which others so lavishly heap their praise. Deneuve is practically catatonic through most of it. I am simply shocked and appalled by the professional critics and filmgoers who see this as a masterpiece, and terrified that this is what passes for great cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Most terrifying\\"??? Awful!","review":"I'm a huge fan of the film Rosemary's Baby and was excited to finally watch this. What a horrible film! It was billed as \\"the most terrifying film ever made\\". So what happened?

It involves a reasonably attractive woman who becomes mentally deranged and decides she's repused by men, then withdraws from her job and boyfriend, and ultimately kills her boyfriend and landlord. At times it becomes difficult to determine what is real and what is imagined. I'd hope the ending would bring resolution and meaning, but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the scariest, most disturbing, or a masterpiece","review":"This film is more annoying than anything else. Saying it is a masterpiece because it is Polanski's first film in English is like saying \\"not bad...for a girl.\\" It is clear he did not understand how to use language in the film (probably why there is so little of it). And suffering through Carol's zombie-like states is mind numbing and makes the viewer want to slap some sense into her.Agreed, Rosemary's Baby is one of his best and can be classified as one of the great psycho-thrillers but comparisons to Hitchcock can only be made to say that Polanski is a student of the Hitchcock method, but never quite surpasses it in any film. Repulsion is an interesting start, but a bad film by any standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and just plain outdated. Don't waste your time.","review":"Every watch what you thought was a good movie back when you were 10 and then saw it as an adult and realized what a terrible movie it was? Repulsion is a movie that for some reason was considered great in 1965 but in reality by todays standards it would never have been released. The movie is just awful and more importantly, boring beyond belief. There is nothing here worth watching.

The pearls I received on both earrings are NOT Round or Oval for that matter. Both pearls look like a two piece snowman. The pearls are eggplant shaped and have a crease/groove running around them about 2/5 the way down from the top of them. Look at my uploaded photos to see for yourself.

Too bad there's a visible hole through it so he can see.When the opening sea battle is shown, the 'Queen Anne's Revenge' is shown about 100 yards astern of the French ship she's pursuing, but suddenly fires a broadside.The dialogue is so bad, I expect the scurvy dogs to say \\"What up?\\" and \\"Far out\\"(kind of like inThe Count of Monte Cristowhen Luis Guzman as Jacopo says \\"Okay\\"), but they at least should have used \\"Larboard\\" rather than \\"Port\\".This makes me want to send the makers of this film the Black Spot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploiting Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"This film has no story line to speak of.

I've also had a fair number of scanner paper jams.Negatives: The printer is *very* slow, even when printing b&w Word documents. I've also had problems with the b&w cartridge - it doesn't seem to do well with certain brands of cartridges. Finally, every few weeks, it just stops printing for a day or two.

They claim to support XP, but they hardly even try. Their drivers will not allow you to connect to an XP machine by parallel cable - USB only (XP does support parallel connection for printer - HP doesn't.) Because the USB connection is a non-standard printer port (DOT4 instead of LPT1) it is completely useless for remote desktop and for legacy apps (forget printing from DOS to this.) The software contains tons of foistware and maybe spyware (why does is want to communicate out through my firewall??) and it drains processor power at all times- even w/printer off or unplugged.

That unit offered all the same features as this HP K80, but at twice the price. Despite that, it was only mediocre at performing its tasks, save its poor performance as a scanner. The K80 on the other hand is an excellent printer, fast, clean and quiet. Its fax features are also topnotch, with the 33.6 faxmodem allowing for 3 seconds per page faxing. The scanning clarity and speed is the best of any sheetfed unit I've seen, and copying with and without enlargement is also pretty darned amazing at this price.However, what really makes the whole pkg so nice is the software that runs quietly in the background and only pops up when needed.

I purchased a fairly expensive two-stage filtration system that mounted under the sink thinking this would be the greatest tasting water ever. I was wrong. The water still had a metallic taste. When I tried a Brita Pitcher I was extremely impressed. They are the only company that uses silver oxide pellets in the filter, which act as a water softener and work well with hard CA water. I've since moved to GA where the water is much softer, but these filters make such a noticable difference it is incredible. If you change the filter every 5 weeks or so you will be very happy with the results. I've been using the same pitcher for about 7 years now and it is still in great shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"major design flaws","review":"Sharp design, only problem is they put form over function when designing it. First problem, if the water hasn't drained completely from the upper (non filtered) basin, and you try and pour the pitcher, the unfiltered water pours out with the filtered water. Second problem, when you fill it up, if you let the water overflow the basin, the first thing it does is drain into the filtered basin. In the older round designs, the upper basin was water tight with the lid on, so you could pour out filtered water before the upper basin was empty. If you overflowed the upper basin the water would got over the side and not into the filtered basin. This allowed the user to set it under the sink and not have to stand there for 30 second to shut off the water. They took a definite step backwards with this design. It's really amazing that in the year 2005, such bad product design is still making to the store shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita Riviera Pitcher with digital change filter indicator","review":"The digital change filter indicator was the attraction to this pitcher however I find that the hinged cover over the pouring lip tends to stick.

They really need to address this design flaw. If you are considering buying a Brita pitcher, you should consider choosing a different model, with a different lid design. I also agree with others in this forum about the electronic filter change indicator -- it counts off the days despite usage. And it was difficult to accurately set it.

We have been so disappointed! Unlike other reviewers we find the thumb-tab reservoir opener easy to use. But ergonomically the pitcher is a disaster. When full, it takes two hands to pour water, one to life it and one to steady it. it is just so heavy, and the narrow design means it is unbalanced when pouring. The little lip on the spout does often stick, so when the pressure of the pouring water finally opens it, it is with a gush.Despite this model's hefty pricetag, we will have to buy a different Brita. if narrow, we'll get one with a smaller capacity, but I'm leaning towards the old-fashioned round design.

The chrome look fit in perfectly with the kitchen of my new house, so I thought I was making a solid decorating decision. I have regretted that move every day since. This pitcher, although functional, leaks. It leaks from the front when I pour water into a glass--to the extent that I can only pour over the sink because it ends up everywhere. When I fill the reservoir and lift it to put it into my refrigerator, it often leaks out the back. I don't recall ever encountering such a poorly designed product. I mean, it's supposed to hold water. You would THINK they'd design it so it doesn't leak. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with the pitcher that would cause it to leak; it simply isn't well made.

Since it is just me and my husband the filter timer is useless to us. It counts down weeks, not gallons used. Since it is just two of us we don't use nearly as much water as a family of four would, so our filters should last longer. Also, the taste wasn't all that great. I'll be the first to admit that our tap water is pretty bad, but the filters didn't seem to improve it as much as I had hoped. We also had a hard time pouring water without the whole top lid falling off. The design isn't all that great. Overall I wasn't that impressed with this pitcher.

Now I need to figure out what to do with the 15 filters I purchased.The early Brita pitchers were great and kept any UNFILTERED water from entering the filtered water compartment of the pitcher. This Riviera 64-ounce waste of plastic allows the tap water to flow directly into the \\"filtered\\" water compartment if you let the water to be filtered go beyond the fill line.

In my short time with this pitcher, it has met the expectations I had. The two piece lid fits securely to the top and does not fall off or lift when holding it.

Why it only gets 4 stars are two-fold:1. No individual ink tanks like Canon and Brother. Much more expensive in long run for HP.2. No direct B/W prints. I haven't needed to do this yet but I'm sure it will be a pain to scan and then print in greyscale. I'll probably just use the Canon.Overall, I am very pleased with it's performance and colorization.

Furthermore, the time it takes to make a copy (color only, of course) is ridiculous. Tip: place document on glass, press copy and get a good night's sleep.You can print documents from your computer as black and white, but you can't make a copy of anything in black and white (unless it is black and white). Try making a copy of your notes from yellow legal paper or white paper that has the blue lines or a document with any color. If you look at most original documents (credit card statements, letters w/letterhead/logos, financial documents, etc.), you will notice they have color - especially the entire background is usually color.

It's absolutely ridiculous to me. And the author of this book, while playing slight of hand, much like a magic trick, knows nothing of the actual facts and evidence of the case. It is always disturbing and sad to me when I see so many of my fellow citizens all too eager to point the finger of blame at people so easily, without the facts, simply based on hocus pocus, half baked psycho babble.

I found the book fascinating. His line by line analysis of the ransom note intrigued me and the entire book read like a \\"who-dunit.\\" None of us want to believe that parents could be capable of such a horrendous crime, but it happens; ask any social worker or experienced cop.

At first I thought that Hodges had outlined too tall an order for himself in proposing to find the killer's 'fingerprint' in her written words, but I soon found that notion to be incorrect. After a short while I found myself using Hodges' method to make my own analysis of the note, jumping ahead of him and the book's pace.I now have new insight into understanding all other forms of written communication with this hidden message/meta-message theory in mind. As an author myself, I am quite impressed with this book. My daughter, who loves the true crime genre, also was thrilled to find the clues that are obvious, once you have the eyes to see them.Now I'm even MORE amazed that the Colorado police have yet to indict a suspect.

I was expecting to find a systematic study of the ransom note, instead, I found what others had already written about: a baseless \\"this means that\\" without any consistent application. What this means for me is that the method that Dr. Hodges used on the ransom note cannot be applied to other written statements, or even other ransom notes. There is no reference point to work from.Perhaps it is because I was expecting a form of Statement Analysis (under whatever term) that I was let down, but I did not find any technique used that could be applied to other cases.I believe the ransom note is a fake, and it was written by Patsy Ramsey, but can say why I believe these things, and can use principles in analysis that can be repeated to all statements.

But this is no re-hash of an old form.

High praise - and utterly unsubstantiated - but this album will show you what happens to talent when it is brought up under the equally compelling forces of two very different traditions. This sounds so effortless and genuine. It doesn't have the forced perfection of the material done with Ry Cooder or the naivete of some of the desert bands (Tartit, e.g., which is also great) or the smoothness of Habib Koite and Bamada.

I also like the fact that the cover just states passport in gold lettering. If you are traveling internationally it is not always a good idea to be IDed immediately by tour guides or those who might glimpse the cover of your passport as an American. The UGLY AMERICAN syndrome still exists and my daughter was told to state she was from Canada, if the question came up in casual conversation, when she went to France. I like the fact that this is just a passport cover. I think keeping credit cards and driver's license and tickets all together can be organized, but if a pick pocket gets the one item, then everything is gone. The price is great too!! Shipping was fast also. Overall a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting the Insides Flaps to be also made of leather, but to my disappointment it was Plastic.

Especially since it was a fraction of the cost of similar covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good, adjustment mechanism maybe improvable","review":"As someone who has completed a fitting and turning apprenticeship I rate these quite highly and as pretty good value, and as recommendable. However the adjustment mechanism could possibly be improved by not having the adjustment nut bear directly on the arm fitting that the thread passes through - more expensive calipers have another fitting in between to improve the relationship between turn of the adjustment nut and change of the caliper gap. However I think that with just moderate care in use these tools should be able to meet any requirement likely to be asked of such tools in nearly all workplaces. This said I have not yet subjected them to extensive testing in repeated long-term use. I'd have given 4.5 stars but it wasn't available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died too soon","review":"Was good till it died in little over a year - the warranty only covers 1 year. Perhaps I made mistake by carrying it around in a hard case one too many times. Tried all the steps LaCie tech service suggested, no help. It's simply dead. Will be my last Lacie for sure. A slick look counts for very little if it can't do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT purchase this hard drive!!","review":"To those people who said they haven't had any problems with this hard drive: just give it a few months.I bought the hard drive advertised here back in December '05 (about 6 months ago). It was working great until one day I turned my computer on, and lo and behold, Windows gives me the error \\"The drive is not ready; its door may be open.\\" (A great error message for a hard drive, by the way, Micro$oft.) I can't access my data anymore - it's all down the tubes.Buy this hard drive at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet but fragile","review":"I got this on the recommendation of a college professor. We needed hard drives for class and I had no idea how to choose one. I should have checked Amazon first, because the reviews are accurate on this one. Another girl got the same drive, dropped it at a low height on a cushioned surface, and lost everything. She couldn't even turn it on. I learned to handle mine like a half broken egg. Even with all that extra attention, I somehow managed to bend the tiny metal prong inside the end of the cable that plugs into the hard drive. The other girl generously gave me her cable. I've long graduated from college and I haven't unplugged the cable from the drive since. The drive itself stays in one place. I'm considering buying a different brand just for peace of mind, but I'm too lazy to do the research and legwork of transferring all my files onto a new drive.

We set the puzzle out on a small table in the rehearsal room for anyone to work on. A small group of intrepid puzzlers reportedly stayed up until 3 a.m. to finish it, then took it apart and started again! My only complaint (minor) about the puzzle is that too many of the pieces SEEM to fit together when they are actually not matched to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Ordered and received this item.It was NOT in an EPSON carton or package. Nor was it in a sealed plastic wrap around the item.I have no idea as to the use-by date or if it was refilled or what.Because of that, I returned it.

It is high quality, made of thick wooden pieces, well-made, good quality paint. It comes in its own wooden tray to hold all the pieces when play is over. The construction of the farm is a bit of a puzzle, but a diagram is included.Very durable and colorful, unconsciously educational by enabling puzzle assembly skills, recreation of a farm setting, and the highly colorful pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good :)","review":"My son wanted a farm for christmas. He is 9 but he has poor motor skills and likes toys that are designed for younger kids. He liked the farm but was frustrated that he couldn't put it together by himself... kinda disappointing considering the toy is designed for children much younger than my son. so if you are buying this for a 3-4 year old be prepared to be part of the fun. i really liked the idea of the puzzle barn for my son, but there again I was disapointed since he couldin't do it him self. My one year old liked the farm. over all i guess this is one of those toys that is a toss up some kids like some won't over all quality seemed really high. no paint has chipped off (but we have only owned this a week) and the animals seem really durable :) i guess time will tell but for the price its a nice set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bechi can't be stopped","review":"Gino Bechi has been one of my favourite baritones since I first heard him in \\"Ballo\\", and this compilation of songs does not disappoint. Bechi had an enormous voice, capable of expressing unmatched fury and power, but he also had the most delicate mezza-voce of any baritone in memory. The songs in \\"Strada\\" showcase his versatility. Note the marked contrast between the unbridled desperation of \\"Pecchè\\" and the lilting suaveté of \\"Al telefono con te\\". Bechi's rendition of \\"O Marenariello\\" remains one of my favourite music recordings of all time. A must-have for any serious opera listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little thing!","review":"I purchased this a few days ago because I was tired of waking up to a nasty alarm.I wanted to be awakened to music.From a good-sounding unit,which my former alarm clock/FM was not.This unit has a very substantial feel to it.A nice heft. Easy to program.The directions were complete,but really...set-up was mostly intuitive,and took me less than 5 minutes.It comes with every adapter you will need for whatever iPod you have.You simply attach the proper adapter,dock your iPod,and it is charging and lulling me to sleep .The sound is amazing from such a little thing.Of course,you cannot blast away Hendrix with it because it is,after all,a little stereo with little,albeit good,speakers.And an adorable little subwoofer! Genius!It seems the company who makes this product has put a lot of thought into its design,function,and sound.I'm very satisfied,and actually surprised at how good it sounds.And the price was great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the bucks.","review":"I like this radio/alarm/iPod charger/Speaker system. It really delivers what it states. I don't know how well the radio is, as we get poor reception in my building at work. I just know that I does what I need. I can listen to my music, charge my iPod, listen to the radio (kinda) and use very little space to do so, all at my desk. I fully recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for the Alarm Clock!!","review":"Okay, so this is an awesome product if you ALREADY HAVE AN ALARM CLOCK!!! I bought it for college so I'd have something to wake me up, but this alarm clock is so unreliable I have to use my cell phone!!!However, It has fairly good speakers to listen to your ipod which is nice. It is also very good looking and STURDY!! I already pulled it off of my desk and it was like nothing happened. It is high quality stuff. Just the electronic stuff is very confusing.So, if you're looking for a place to charge and listen to your ipod and for something that will not break, this is your product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Grabber!

Very reasonable for a product that works so well! I hope they are never discontinued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amp does the job!","review":"This amp really performs. It has ample power for small venues such as the small church where it is primarily used. It has 8 different effect/reverb combinations that can be managed with a level control and has a 3 band EQ to work with. I suggest not using the feedback control unless absolutely necessary because it limits some of your instruments clarity ( it does what it is designed to do but you have to decide ). I have not used the mic input as yet and can't comment on it but have read good reviews about it. I like the portability at 31 lbs. and can slide it into the back seat and go. The ONLY drawback so far is the fact that it has no way to tilt it back to get the sound up. I have to lean it against a wall or use a small 2x4 to angle it. They do make a small stand for it to accomplish this however. Al the reviews from my congregation are good so far. This Amp has alot of bang for the buck. Great for acoustic guitar users. Looks great too! Gofer it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Simmons winner","review":"I stumbled upon one of Simmon's books 'The Devil Earl' on a discount rack in a used book store several weeks ago. Since then, I have been able to get ahold of several more of her books and with the exception of one that I did not like I am hooked. Simmons style of writing provides strong heroes and stronger heroines. The combination, with her style of writing, is dynamite! I just finished reading 'The Gentleman Thief' ( and with the possible exception of it not being as 'racy' as her other offerings), I was not disappointed. The book was great. Some of the scenes are so funny that I almost made myself sick laughing! The book is basically a lighthearted romp (although there are some tense moments) with two main characters who are made for each other. Simmons has a nice style of writing that will keep you reading. I'm not much of a fan of Harlequin, but Simmons is definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmons does it again!","review":"Deborah Simmons has got to be the biggest buried treasure amongromance authors that I know! While perhaps not as fabulous as TheLast Rogue of The Vicar's Daughter, *any* lover of witty and sexy regency-set historicals should love The Gentleman Thief.

Someone stole a necklace from the hostess's bedroom during a party. While Georgiana investigates, one of her suspects assists her. She jumps to conclusions too fast, but eventually succeeds in solving the mystery. I wasn't surprised or delighted. The heroine was a little too syrupy sweet for me. The story was half solving the mystery and half developing the romance. The ending was cute.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: Bath, England, probably regency period. Copyright: 2000. Genre: mystery regency romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I was misled by the glowing reviews into buying this book. What a mistake! We are told over and over again how clever the heroine is, but what the story shows is that she is uterly devoid of intelligence and common sense--hence the disasters she keeps on creating. The story is full of improbable scenes. I, for one, would like to know how the hero and heroine, after falling into the water in the Pump Room, manage to get home without being observed by anyone, or have their servants notice that their clothes are ruined and thus make a fuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot spray it","review":"I do love the smell, but have no idea why it did not work no matter how hard I pressed the sprayer!!!!!And yea...

I boughtthe audiobook versions just because they said Ender on them. The abridging was, IMHO, not done by anyone with a love of the story. I noticed virtually every word that was missing or changed.

In my opinion, it is a perfect first book for anyone who is interested in learning more about holistic health or holistic parenting. It is interesting, informative and easy to read. One of the more surprising and enjoyable qualities of the book is the clarity and familiarity of Sneyd's writing style. It makes the reader feel as if they were sitting down over coffee with a childhood friend and sharing what they've been up to the last decade. Sneyd has obviously been on a voyage of discovery and has shared her experiences with insight and good humor. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is curious about holistic health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"I cannot begin to state the reasons this book is immensley helpful and, in my opinion, IMPERATIVE to have.

Like the Junglee Baby Hattori,Junglee Baby Hattori Survival Knife, this knife is of good quality materials and is constructed very well. Fit and finish are as good as they need to be; this is not an art piece.The sheath leaves quite a bit to be desired, but then how many of us ever use the sheath that comes with the knife. With this one I am paying for a good knife, not the sheath.The part of this knife that really counts is the blade; that is Japanese made AUS-8 (8A) steel from Aichi Steel Corporation, just like the originals. And, it's cryo treated. (note: some very early Trident blades were 440C steel)The handle material is strong sturdy and very lovely black Micarta. The Trident is the only SOG Vietnam Era knife that comes with Micarta.

Several times in my attempts to stop the leaking by tightening it the device popped off and water splashed in my face. It's doubly frustrating when you sit around and think about how easy it is for these dicks to make this product so that it will fit snugly on the faucet and not leak. This contraption costs about 30 dollars which isn't that cheap in my quarters. So I got it back to where it was to begin with but while I was trying to fix it I noticed how easy the whole thing comes off.

The actual water filter works great but the way it attaches to your sink will eventually fail and end up spraying you or completely falling off. The attachment parts are plastic and if the threads don't get stripped while you put it on the first time, they will eventually wear down and then there is nothing you can do except shell out more bucks for a new one - mainly just for the little plastic threaded connector.
