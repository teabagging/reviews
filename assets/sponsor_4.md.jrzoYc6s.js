The next thing I didn't like was that they don't give you time to get used to the step you are doing before moving on to the next. The movements aren't explained very thoroughly at all. I also thought that they should have shown more closeups of each of the exercises instead of just showing a group shot almost constantly throughout the workout. Not only was the routine poorly choreographed and narrated, but the music was bad too. After 20 minutes of trying to do this video I decided to turn it off. All I can say is, don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good diversity","review":"The illustrations in this coloring book are beautiful, with 30 masks from many areas of the world.

It is definitly NOT about the entire culture of al-Andalus. It is not about those who worked and suffered to pay the courtier lifestyle, the dependend farmers, the craftsmen, the merchants, etc. Their music, dance, food, workman skills, etc. is completly neglected. It is no wonder that Ms. Menocal wonders why the court culture was destroyed. Maybe a lot of people were not willing to pay for it any more. Worse, it is not about the international musicians and dancers, the gitanos who breathed life into Spanish culture.

This work appeared like an apparition and foots the dialectical bill. Telling the tale of the Christian Spaniards almost peaceful coexistence with Islam during the flowering of a great Islamic culture, this work shows the complexity of the Christian phenomenon, and is a reminder that we might judge Christianity not so much by modern standards, though we must, as by the standards of social chaos to which it was sometimes able, as here, to contribute some stability, advancement, and culture. Indeed, one would never anticipate from this book the bloody wave of genocide and slavery that the descendents of these peaceful Christians would one day bring to the Carribean and South America.

But with attacks on Islam and Muslims coming from all sides, it's not surprising to see this kind of bias. Yes, Arabs (Muslims) of (Al-Andalus) were not special people, but they had a special gift (Islam). These people without Islam are nothing. Like Omar Ibn AlKhatab once said: \\"We are people (desert Arabs) were honored with the gift of Islam, If we seek honor without it, we will fail\\". And it's that simple. So the golden age Muslims lived in Al-Andalus, was not due to tolerant Arabs but rather tolerant Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"If you have trouble with Insomnia, this is a good remedy.

There are two countdown clocks at the bottom of the screen, the total workout clock and a forty five second clock for each exercise. This is still my favorite ab workout after five years because there isn't any 'core conditioning' crapolla- just eleven solid floor work exercises. The workout is led by Jamie Brenkus and there are two other participants, a man and a woman. It's set outside by a lake.8 Minute Arms isn't as good. Because I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser, eight minutes for upper body is just silly. I guess you can get results if you use heavier weights but... An earlier reviewer pointed out something that I had been wondering about- what's up with Jamie's Beetlejuice garb? Anyway, if you're a beginner or if you're short on time 8 Minute Arms could work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"I have been doing the 8 minute ab tape for a little over a year (with a 4 month break not of my choice) and i love it. I can do the tape whenever I feel like. The only vise is that for the first few times you do, you may want to have somebody watch your form to make sure you are doing it right. If you really want to see results, you must change you diet to that of low-fat (fat seems to go straight to the abs for some reason) and burn the fat already surrounding the abs since the muscle is under the fat. You could do this by some cardio type exercise (swimming, jogging, ect). I highly recommend this tape. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love 8 Minute Abs","review":"Tough 8 minutes but definitely worth it.

The movements were done too fast to provide anything but momentum. Again, there was no information provided regarding form or modification for beginners other then beginners were told not use weights. It ended with no stretching of the muscles which could result in injury.

I'm not one who likes to exercise, but I decided to give this a try, and I loved it! Before I know it, the time is up! The countdown clock is a nice feature so that you can see how much time you have left. The 8 min bonus arms is a nice bonus. It works for beginners up to advanced. You can do the exercises with what weight you feel comfortable. If you liked this one, you should invest in 8 min buns/legs. It works incredibly good and you really feel the burn! And with only 8 minnuts how can you go wrong!

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So little time!","review":"I was first introduced to 8-minute abs when my roommate borrowed it from a friend. By the end I could really feel my abs burning! This is a great tape, combining the abs and the arms, which are also good exercises, not just for the arms, but the shoulders, chest, and back as well. 8 minutes is so short you can always make time. I like to modify some of the moves (especially the ones to work the lower abs) now that I have been doing the tape for a while. I also own the 8-minute legs & buns tape, which is good for legs, but the exercises for buns are pretty repetitive and didn't feel like they were working very well. The music is pretty cheesy, but the instructor is very encouraging and goes slowly enough so that even a beginner can quickly pick up the exercises. This video is well worth the little time and money that you spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast workout, and you can feel it the next day","review":"You're not going to get as ripped as the people in the pic on the box, but you will get a nice bit of toning and in just 8 minutes. This program is great for people who don't have a lot of time, and helps to start the workout process. If you do it consistently you will build up a nice level of tone. You will have to chose another program after that to really continue on as you will reach a point where this doesn't help too much any more. But it is a great starter program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very effective, quick workout","review":"I ordered a few exercise videos for toning and this is the one that I keep going back to.

Couldn't be happier with this tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner/intermediate workout!","review":"The 8-Minute Abs video is a great way to get started with a home ab-workout.

I only wish that I had done this sooner. The tape gives clear instructions and excellent views of all the excercises. As a novice to crunches, this helped a lot. After a week of using this tape I was able to extend the workout and mix it with the upper body workout without the use of the tape. The routine produced plainly visible results within 2 weeks. The greatest result is the way it changes your posture. If you work at a desk, you'll never believe the difference it makes. Be aware: If you haven't done these kinds of excercises before, you're likely to tire out your neck before your abs the first few times, but this changes quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Kid Yourself","review":"I don't know how I convinced myself that an 8 minute ab workout could possibly accomplish anything, so to save you the trouble, it won't.

And the arms section is even worse..2 guys in spandex capris holding tomato cans and 1 girl who is too weak to hold those, tell you that if you do this every day you will see instant improvement.

A universal thread: childhood scars that carry themselves into adulthood. Who hasn't been on the receiving end of a sucker-punch? While I admire Gutkind's honesty, oftentimes at the expense of too much information, I am not convinced that, as a middle-aged man, he's really dealt with any of his demons. In fact, his writing style seems overly structured and forced, and the book reads more as an in-your-face comeback to all the people in his life who've wronged him than a work of literature. And I'm still left confused as to what this problematic genre of creative nonfiction really is, which is perhaps a good thing.

As a newly diagnosed Type II diabetic, I was lost in a sea of misinformation and apprehension until I discovered this book. Pulling no punches, he hits home in a straight forward easy to understand conversational manner. Make no mistake, this plan is not easy, at first. But, if getting control of your blood glucose and being in charge of your health is your goal, this is the book for you!

It is mostly the opposite of ALL others I have read on how to control Type 2 diabetes. It concerns me that Dr. Bernstein suggests no fruit. No carbs either. Ok, what's left besides protiens and fats?

I'd like to address the content of the book. I rate this book high because it was well laid out and easy to read. It begins with a chemistry of digestion, laying the groundwork for his theories. It then goes into typical foods. One is provided with a clear simple list of no-no foods. Then one is led into sample menus so you can clearly see how flexible the diet is or is not. There are several chapters specifically geared to unique situations. Then a chapter with recipes. A couple of appendices.

Tony is my favorite character because he found all the facts before the other people in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exciting Book","review":"The Windcatcher by Avi is a very exciting book. It tells people to never give up, just like Tony Souza, a young boy trying to find a treasure. Tony is trying to find the treasure before some very bad people do. Tony goes through a lot of trouble trying to find this treasure. Long ago, there was a man named Little John whose job it was to keep it safe while it was on the ship. He lost this prize in a giant thunder storm. He was the only survivor from the ship when it sunk. He died on a deserted island and the treasure remained lost. For many years people had searched and searched for this treasure, but it had never been found until now. By the end of this book, Tony finds the location of a sunken ship and he believes that he might just have found the long lost treasure. The question you all want to know is....does Tony Souza ever find the treasure? Well, you must read the book to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read!!","review":"Do you like adventure? Well if you do, you should read the Windcatcher by Avi. The main character us Tony Souza who is 11 years old. He has $300 that he earned from selling papers and he wants to buy something. He sees a boat in a store and it is called the Snark. To Tony a snark is an imaginary animal. He buys the snark and his parents say that he is going to his grandmother's house for 21 days for boating lessons. He discovers a myth about a treasure and Little John. There are these bad people that are looking for the treasure. His grandmother is scared because she thinks that they will capsize Toni's boat.

Upon arrival, he learns from a girl named Chris how to sail. Out on his own, he comes across a mysterious couple who are diving for the treasure to steal it from the state. They suspiciously warn him to get away. Determined to find out just what they are diving for, Tony continues to follow them. While spying, he is found out, and runs away, to find his sailboat missing. Lost at sea, Tony goes through adventure and pain to get home. At the end he is found by the couple who bring him to his grandmother's house. This book definitely makes you want to continue reading it.

He randomly buys a sail boat when he is greedy for money. It doesn't sound like a purchase a kid would make."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"The first chapter, a roaring historical account of a storm at sea and a soon-to-be-lost treasure, almost seems to be tacked on as an apologetic for this slow-moving sea tale. The excitement starts late as we read chapter after chapter about sailing lessons and grandma admonishing Tony to be safe. Now, we're all for stories about Portuguese grandmothers, but this is supposed to be an adventure! Once the action starts, more disappointment. We want our protagonists to drive the story forward with ingenuity and bravery. Tony, however, is more of a screw-up who does incredibly stupid things and stumbles across plot points by accident. For a more satisfying sailboat story, tryThe Lion's Paw, an old favorite that still engages today's nine year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windcatcher","review":"While written for school age readers, this story will entertain all ages, especially those interested in sailing and summer culture.

His dad is tall, skinny with short brown hair and the trainer is tall skiny, with short blond hair.My opinioin on this book is read it. it is a very good book. and the reason I read the book someone else told me to read it and I did.

I could not put it down and read well into the next morning. The background information and private political insights were very informative.

Kind of a cross between Def Leppard and Extreme - the type of album not often found in Christian music. Great vocals from all the band members, great music, good variety of songs..It is ashame that on their second album they went a lot more slow, wimpy, and less 80's rockish.

It does not explore in any detail the harsh, negative consequences that extreme environmentalism causes.

The framework itself is timeless though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for any gov't or business leader.","review":"Natural Capitalism is truly a mind-boggling read. The picture it paints is that we could totally turn America, or even just your city or company, around in very little time, from being wasteful and inefficient, to being streamlined.Numerous incredible examples are given throughout the book of companies and cities and countries that have questioned the status quo way of doing things, and by doing so have increased profit, decreased waste, and generally made the quality of living and working so much higher.Natural Capitalism is a well researched and cited book.

I could tell that from the beginning, Ms Jordan tells the story in the first and third person, often switching between characters until you are confused. She also begins explaining a setting or person and then rambles off into another story again confusing matters. The only thing missing is the story from the dogs point of view. I don't particularly like the \\"heros\\" Barry and Dee, they seem to gloat on each other a bit too much, and if you don't care much for them it's hard to enjoy the narriation. The ending was a bit out of thin air, including an interview with the Major that was dropped on the reader in suprise. I also found the relationship between Joyce and Gabe hard to beleive.

The characters weren't really interesting or likable and the point of view kept shifting. A good book should make you look up and realize you've read far beyond the chapter you had meant to stop at. It was all I could do to make myself pick it up again to read more and I could barely make it through a page or two before I got bored with it. I got it at a library book sale for 50 cent and I feel I spent too much.

The pair I am reviewing here were continuous to the top edge, which I wanted. It is a more polished look, until the gaping at the top of the boot screams 'Pretty Woman'. For me, the closer fit looks better than the really loose up top fit. Probably a matter of preference, but the boots do look wonderful. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me!","review":"Purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots. Thought they would be the thigh highs I was looking for, just for casual wear. They were very large on my leg, and loose from bottom to top. Just didn't look right. They were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing. I tried them on several times with different looks but couldn't find a reason to like them. So, back they went. The shoe part also looked very wide with a pointed toe that was huge. Not a good looking boot, and I wouldn't even wear them for costume since they just didn't look right. Glad that others found them acceptable and that's all that matters. The silver ones appear to look great, but I now know how they look.

A Must Read","review":"Nelson Demille is my favorite author and this is my all time favorite book! Very well written. After the events of 9-11 I thought of this book and how the terrorists were integrated into the US society. This is one to keep and re-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"This was the first DeMille book I've read. His style and ability to draw the reader into the very midst of the action is a rare and appreciated quality. This book resonated with me completely; perhaps because I've always believed there might just be a \\"Charm School\\" out there. After this book, I went back and read each of DeMille's books. This one remains among the top 2 of my favorites by this author. Don't let this one get away, it will interfere with your daily functions because you won't be able to stop reading - then you'll want more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"an engrossing read","review":"Unsure what to make of the title, I was unsure what to expect from \\"The Charm School.\\" A bit to my surprise, the story started off quickly and gained speed right up to the end. Likeable characters and a powerful narrative catapulted the storyline along and left me wanting more.A book which could only have been improved upon with a more complex plot, this book is recommended reading for those who enjoy a good fast paced novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Disturbing Book","review":"You have to give Nelson Demille credit. He has written another outstanding book. I have read two of his books and have recently bought two more because he has proven to be an outstanding author. The subject matter of \\"Charm School\\" will really make you wonder if a plot of this magnitude could have really been pulled off with the Russians and the Vietnamese working hand in hand.This book will certainly make you think. Once again Nelson Demille has written a spellbinding book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly captivating and fast paced thriller.","review":"I've just lost an entire weekend because I couldn't put this book down. It met my criteria: spys, dangerous foreign setting, fast paced, unpredictable ending, and the more I read, the faster I had to continue. Nelson DeMille has become a \\"must read\\" for me. I was thrilled to find this book after having read Plum Island, Gen's Daughter, and Gold Coast. It is my new favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read.","review":"I read a book a week and have read every one of Nelson DeMille's books as they came out. Charm School is by far the best, though everyone is great. I am surprised it took this long for one of his books to become a movie (General's Daughter). Charm school would be a great movie. Read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charm School","review":"This was one of those books where my wife became jealous because I was glued to the book with the exclusion of everything else. It is really the ultimate thriller that keeps you on edge from page to page. International intrigue, KGB Vs. CIA, who are the good guys and who are the bad, all make for a great attention getter. My congratulations to DeMille, a fellow Long Islander, for another great book. Sorry I didn't read it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I have liked other Demille books like The Panther and Plum Island but not this one. The characters are superficial and irritating, the ending unsatisfying and frustrating, which just left me with a depressed feeling, and even though I can suspend reality frequently when I read, this book was so contrived it was hard to stay with the story. I felt I needed to state my opinion here because I was fooled by all the positive reviews out there and am sure others were also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and fast paced, iffy romance","review":"I can't add much to what many other reviewers have said, but I was just a little disappointed in this thriller. I didn't give it 5 stars for two reasons: the disappointing ending, and the one dimensional character of Lisa. I didn't take off stars for this but as an aspiring novelist I found it odd that there were limited physical descriptions of the characters, especially Seth, Tom and Lisa. I thought Lisa was a simpering idiot and Tom's falling in love with her was unrealistic, explained only by the dearth of available single women. I also found that the rescue phase took too long. (I found the same thing in Babylon, so maybe it's me).The insights into Soviet ruled Russia and the threats that even those with diplomatic immunity lived under are appalling. DeMille does a great job of bringing that world to life. A very good read - Exciting, especially the beginning chapters,well written, a couple of cardboardy characters and a less than satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Charm School","review":"A page turner even though it is a bit wordy, at times, and, in so many instances, unrealistic, including the female character. All that being said, it was a great story with a wonderfully interesting and different \\"premise\\". It kept the \\"midnight\\" lights burning for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Be prepared to stay up all night reading! This is may be the only book I've ever read that I HAD to finish (I couldn't put it down!) And, it kept me on pins and needles to the very last page. That is quite a feat! My hat's off to Mr. Demille."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Charm School","review":"This is one of the better books I have read. I have read the Charm School at least twice a year since 1991. I recommend it to anyone who loves spy novels. When reading this book you can actually visualize the characters and all the action! I always felt this could have made a great movie ... maybe better than the General's Daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Train Recommendation","review":"I overheard two people discussing DeMille's books on the train ride home one night. I was finishing a book myself and decided to try one of his. They couldn't stop talking about The Charm School, so I decided to try that one. I was completly captivated by the entire novel. I was sad when I would get to my destination because I did not want to put it down. This book draws you in and you can see a vivid picture being painted for you. It felt as if I was watching a movie. Sam Hollis is my hero. I hope there will be another Hollis book in the future, I am dying to see what is going to happen next. I was so sad when the book ended. This is MUST read! I am currently searching for another DeMille!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cold-war stories ever.","review":"No cold-war story has ever gripped me more than this book. It is shockingly realistic"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Give Up","review":"I'm one-third of the way into the book, and I've decided not to spend any more time on it. Wooden characters, stilted dialogue, confusing sense of location and time...I give up. And at this point in a novel, I hope for at least a little of the \\"Can't put it down\\" feeling. Instead, upon each reading it was \\"I'll give it one more chance.\\" I'm confused by all the glowing reviews, including my friend saying it was the best book she's ever read. Apparently the action picks up past where I am in the story, but writing style will still be the same, so I'm out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately one of the most intrigueing books I have read","review":"DeMille is in a class by himself, this is my first book of his to read but definastely will not be the last. I am looking forward to reading all his books and see if the others can compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeMille is a gift to all readers","review":"This is the kind of book you truly cannot put down. It's gripping from beginning to end. DeMille has a way to bring books to life with human experience and scenery. I always appreciate the history he adds about where ever the story takes place.I haven't read a dull book yet from Nelson, and I hope he continues writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for DeMille-ophiles! - Jennifer Hammond","review":"I've passed around several of my DeMille books to fellow teachers, who have also fallen in love with his writing. He has a flair for setting and detail that actually makes you feel as though you are \\"there\\" and enlightens you without boring you. DeMille's military background flavors his novels without overkill, unlike other authors with similar backgrounds.My favorite thus far is Charm School, followed by The General's Daughter, Plum Island, and Spencerville. I'm currently on Word of Honor, so this ranking may change!If you want a novel that will keep you up reading all night long, go get Charm School!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest book this avid reader has ever read!!!","review":"How can you describe a book that is so involving, so incredibly readable, so interesting that it inspires you to actually began trying to learn to speak another language? Nelson DeMille so thoroughly describes Russia and Russian culture that I have decided I want to learn to speak the language. The Charm School is really the Sugar Ray Robinson of Novels. Meaning it is in a class by itself. I have never before felt so much feelings, tension, joy, horror, etc than when I read this book. I truly felt like I had lost a friend when it had ended. I will most certainly read this book several times over and must say that I envy someone who is reading it for the first time. Aside from being an incredible storyteller, DeMille must get all the credit in the world for the awesome amount of research he had to have conducted in order to write such a multi-layered story. He is a true genius and we are lucky to have discovered him!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspense filled fast-paced book all the way.","review":"The charm school is an exciting and fast-paced action novelwhich develops in the heart of the KGB capital of the world.MOSCOW.Filled with espionage, intrigue and an insight into the secret service are just some of the features you will find in this magnificentthriller. From the workings of the KGB to the counter-intelligence of the CIA, you will find it allin the confines of the CHARM SCHOOL.Demille is a masterful story-teller, who can narrate complextales of intrigue and spies so clearly that you can envision thecold terrains of siberia as you read this wondeful book.I would not give away any part of the book, since it is allso wonderfully written, and should be experienced first handby anyone interested in a good book.This one is a MUST MUST Read for everyone !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read, a classic in its class","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading the book but was quickly drawn in by the breathtaking pace of the action. A young man ships his American car to Western Europe and travels into the murky heart of Soviet Russia - Moscow, having made a stop at Borodino where strange things start happening. There are minders everywhere. Even in the hotel for the foreigners where he is staying, intrigue is seeping throughout the place. Sadly the U.S. Consulate is unable to prevent his murder, and that's when the pace picks up even more. A sinister school is uncovered where Russians are trained to act as \\"perfect\\" Americans so they can infiltrate the U.S. You will be watching your back with the protagonists, anxiously awaiting that Finnair flight out of Moscow, and kissing the ground upon their first safe landing in the West. There was a bit too much violence for my liking but the book is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid Cold War Story","review":"I admit it: I'm baffled by the other reviews describing this book as a page-turner. I managed to force my way through the first 285 pages before I gave up on it, and skipped ahead to see if there were any interesting turns of plot that might have made it worth the while to keep reading. Nope, no surprises.I did enjoy some of the observations about Soviet life, which were interesting from a cultural standpoint. However, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the story moves at a glacial pace. There are many long scenes composed entirely of dialogue that doesn't advance the plot.As you will see by reading the other reviews posted here, most readers found something very different in this book. However, I found it much less enjoyable than a Fredrick Forsyth thriller, or even an Ian Fleming novel. It's just too bland to be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting but far-fetched","review":"I happened to read this book just before I read The Years of Crisis: 1960-1963, by Michael Beschloss, a 1991 book on the actual contest with the Russians. It was so much more real and was just as tense an expperience, even tho I knew how it would come out. I was some annoyed by the protagonists of The Charm School, very much impressed with the importance of religion--and eager to commit adultery every chance they could, and never a hint that the religion to which she was so attached had anything to do with whether she should commit adultery or not. But the book holds one's interest, even if on reflection one wonders if the time spent reading it was well-spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre read","review":"The passage of time has greatly diminished the entertainment value of cold war era Soviet Union bashing. xxx xxx xxx"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing Finish","review":"Don't get me wrong about this book.I thoughly enjoyed reading about the first 400 pages (paperback), but the idea came upon me that it could not possilby have a happy ending. I was right.I put myself into the mind set of the author, diligently researching his material and saw the creeping issue about how to end the novel with all parties, particularly the reader, being happy. I couldn't. Once he set upon relating this tale, I guess he couldn't have a happy ending without it passing to the genre of fantasy.The reason I gave it so low a rating is that the author would have you believe that American intelligence services are more ruthless than the KGB. By far.If you can drop the book after the first 400 pages, do so.A disturbing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold war thriller with stereotypical characters","review":"Demille's books are always a good read, and The Charm School is no exception. This is the first one I've read, however, where the main characters didn't have an iota of a sense of humor. (Minor U.S. Embassy characters were hilarious in during a farewell party scene, but that was the only bit of humor in the novel.The main characters are so serious, earnest, brave...and dumb. They do things that brave, serious, and intelligent people would not do. To think that an Embassy Air Force attache and a USIS information officer would not arouse KGB suspicion when they are doing essentially consular work (i.e. handling the death of an American citizen abroad) is just silly. What kind tradecraft is this?The ending while a cliff hanger is unsatisfying and not plausible in the era of Iran/Contra, Watergate, and other failed coverups. An interesting sequel would be the exposure of the U.S. Government's disposal of the Charm School and its aftermath."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great concept that loses itself","review":"One of those long books that grabs early and devolves into \\"oh, please\\" plot twists that make you wonder if the last hundred pages are worth the effort. They weren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"Charm School was slow and dull--it reads like a second draft. The dialogue was stilted. The characters are flat. I kept reading only because I thought the book would get better; it didn't. It's hard to believe this is the same DeMille that wrote The Gold Coast, Plum Island, and The Lion's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic - Cold War Thriller","review":"It is a great book. I picked it up for a plane ride and could not put it down!! This book got me started with Demille and I have read them all. If they ever make a movie of this one, get Harrison Ford and Demi Moore to play the leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minute detail equals big pay off.","review":"I struggled through the first 500 pages of this book. Demille is one of my favorite authors but the details here were too minute. Then just as I was about to give up the book just took off. All of sudden those details helped to create one of the most chilling and horrifying books I've ever read. I agree with the reviewer who said do not read the author's forward. I think that made it hard for me to get through the details. As a DeMille loyalist though, I look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I've been reading for over 35 years, and I can count on one hand the number of books that I haven't finished - this is one of them. I gave it until page ~175 or so, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I know I'm in the minority here, but the story just did not grab me. I thought it was slow and lumbering. I thought that the characters were undeveloped and stereotypes. I did not like the way he portrayed women - there wasn't one that was intelligent and thoughtful. The main female character is portrayed as naive and slutty (sleeps with her boss).The first love scene was about as exciting as thinking about polar bears mating. Actually, polar bears probably have more chemistry.From what I did read, the plot seemed pretty predictable, although from reading the other reviews, it seems that the ending may have been a surprise. Sorry, it wasn't worth the torture of reading this for another 400 pages to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good story","review":"Ive read lots of books on the old soviet union, and this is one of the better ones.The plot is good and the storyline is not too unbelievable.I liked the first half of the book best it was kind of hard to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea for a spy story very poorly done","review":"A very fun premise. It was so fun, and the beginning of the book so compelling that I was caught up. I waited for the characters to come to life, waited for an editor's touch to enliven the leaden prose. After hundreds of pages, when Our Hero is up to his neck in trouble, I stopped waiting. I was worn down. I didn't care what happened next; it wouldn't be worth the effort of further suspending my disbelief. Verdict: a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read the Authors New Forward","review":"What was he thinking? He gave away the entire plot in the new forward. In it he also suggested that The Charm School was the best Cold War thriller ever (that's an eye-roller). Even if the mystery hadn't been blown in the forward, the plot is run of de mille (sorry). Another Demille book where a middle aged police/ military man who recently lost his wife attracts an attractive young girl with a daddy complex. Mrs Demille must be wondering what that's all about. Furthermore, all of the characters are jerks so it's difficult to care about any of them. If The Charm School were 300 pages shorter it may have deserved 3 or 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for tinder, not much else","review":"the horrendous quality of writing and nonexistant character development in this book completely overshadow the interesting premise of a russian counterintelligence school that trains deep-cover spies. set in the waning years of the cold war, the author creates fantastically awful, overbearing spy v. spy nonsense, offensively sexist characterizations of human relationships, and sensationalized visions of life in the diplomatic corps.a one word summary of this book would be \\"pathetic.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Middle Age hero with ex-wife + young attractive intelligent woman + saving the world from the Soviets= boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charm School A+","review":"DeMille like Clancey write books that have enough curretn and real information to make the believable.

Please read this book!","review":"This novel was recommended to me by someone who said it was her favorite book of all time. I can see why! DeMille does not disappoint. His writing is vivid and realistic and his characters are rich. Only Lisa Rhodes, the female, was a bit off the mark, but what can you expect from a man? He did a good job at making her believeable and likeable considering . . . The plot was excellent and the element of surprise was present.

It made it awkward to read and many pages, in groups or individually, continued to come apart. Obviously, the pages are completely dried out.

What was more surprising is that the psychologist's evaluation/assessment seems to fit one of the types perfectly. We have already adjusted our approach signicantly, with results already apparent. What we thought was a stubborn, rude beligerant little boy, is actually a very sensitive feeler, who is actually very remorseful over innocent mistakes. By reading this book, parents may become more aware that what appears to be ADD, or a learning disability may be a minority personality type, or a child trying to \\"live out of type\\". It is fascinating to learn that a lot of your child's supposedly weird charecteristics are actually normal for him, and that he may just march to the tune of a different drummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"Like all parenting/advice books, you have to pick/use the parts that make the most sense to you...and this is one that I've gotten the most out of, by far.

Get this book to understand your kids, but get ready to realize some things about yourself in the process. You may or may not like what you discover about yourself or your kids, nevertheless, you will have the key to unlock the door to a whole new world of understanding yourself and others.

What I was looking for was solutions, how to prevent, advice, and tips on how to keep toddlers, children, and teenagers from being materialistic, spoiled, or trapped in one the \\"seven deadly sins\\" he was talking about in the book.

The author's answer is to push your kids harder, but not too hard....spend more time with your kids, eat dinner with your kids, pay attention to who their friends are, hold them accountable for their actions etc. Basic common sense. I was really put off by the idea that if the parent can't be around, they might think of hiring a good nanny to do the job for them. I might also add (all on my own, not in the book!) think about going to church regularly, check your child's homework everyday. Model good behavior. One parent might even consider a part time job or staying at home instead of both parents working full time. I know, a novel idea in this day and age.

Unfortunately, this book doesn't really provide much insight into the situation. It's full of contradictions and doesn't help you understand how to walk the line between caring and indulging.Many of the excerpts from real interviews with teens seem manipulative, with quotes selected to prove the current point the author wants to prove (which changes according to the chapter). What's lacking is any real context or analysis of the quoted teen's situation.Ultimately the book provides some food for thought, and can be read in a few hours, but it's irritatingly simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Training: Successful Aniaml Management Through Positi","review":"I found this book very informative.

It goes further to give equivalents to some of the proverbs in several other modern languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Meets The Eye","review":"If you already own at least one personal finance book then this mediocre one will not tell you anything you haven't already seen, heard or read.If you're looking to buy your first money book, then skip this one. It only gives a generalized overview of important topics and will leave you wondering \\"What steps should I follow to take charge of my finances?\\"Go with one of the classics instead, such as Andrew Tobias's \\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need\\" or Jane Bryant Quinn's \\"Making the Most of Your Money.\\"\\"Talking Money\\" is just a lot of hot air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Pay For Old Advice and Destroy Trees?","review":"I've seen Ms. Chatzky on the Today show for years and years so I thought this book would be fresh and original. Gosh was I mistaken. This book contains nothing but the same old information that she's been eagerly sharing free of charge for years and years. (You can get the archives of these previous talks on Money magazine and the Today show's web sites for free!)She contrasts herself to Suze Orman who has also run out of fresh material. Unless these women can come up with something to add to the conversation they should stop writing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"same advice, all over again","review":"the same old advice we hear from all the financial gurus out there gets dusted off and trotted out yet again. while chatzky has an engaging style she fails to tell readers anything new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Original or New Here and Not Well Written","review":"Contains nothing but a rehash of the same advice that Jane Bryant Quinn, Peter Lynch and other real money experts have written in their earlier and far superior books. Jean Chatzky and her cadre of researchers and writers obviously are just cashing in on this lucrative self-help book trend but don't be fooled, you'll just be wasting your money with this redundant and derivative book. Stick with Jane Bryant Quinn or Peter Lynch instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Dull","review":"Poorly written book by a marginally knowledgable person. Miss Chatzky doesn't uncover anything original or even interesting.Instead she just repeats old money sayings and tries to pass them off as helpful.

This book had potential but it totally misses the mark because you walk away with almost no usable information.What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Own for Solid Financial Advice","review":"I have enjoyed watching Jean Chatzky on the Today Show for years. In fact, I worked with her on the show and have seen first hand how she prepares for her weekly segments. Believe me, it is not as easy as Jean makes it appear! This book deserves a spot on your bookshelf as it is a great daily reference guide to the world of personal finance. What I like best about the book is unlike other financial-oriented books, it is not boring and is loaded with Jean's witty personality. Jean has a knack for explaining complicated financial decisions simple to understand. My only question is: When is she releasing her next book? I am truly looking forward to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for great price","review":"This is a great begginers cue, is has a good weight and lenght.

We all want to motivate our kids to succeed in life, but how much is too much? When do we push and when do we back off? Dr. Taylor, through examples, research, and his own personal wisdom, walks this delicate line, showing the pitfalls and dangers of both sides, and leads us to creating a healthy, balanced and purposeful life for our young ones. In the highly competitive world we live in today, no home with children should be without this important work on their bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books for teaching numbers!","review":"I love using this book, along with the CD to teach the kindergarten students the numbers.

I mean come on a 50\\" plasma for under $1600 you can't beat that. The images displayed with this Plasma are very clear the settings are easy to manipulate. The color, tint, sharpness, etc...were easy to control and optimize. This PDP is HD DNIE. However, it's maximum resolution is 720pi, but for 720pi it's picture and performance are unrivaled. I used the HDMI to DVI conversion wire to connect the Satellite receiver to this plasma and I had no synching issues whatsoever, though I had read that there would be synching issues with an HDMI to DVI conversion wire I did not experience that.

They said that a book was no longer available that contained all the Nation's Presidents' paintings that they had on display. I figured I'd find an old book, but was very happy to find a book that contained most all of the paintings I saw, plus a better description of each of our leaders while they spent a term in office. I was impressed to see them up close at the museum, knowing the artist was just as close. Now I have this book as my souvenier and historical reminder of all our presidents images - done by a reknown artist - and their history. It's just what I'd asked for at the museum. They could sell a lot of these books if they had them on hand.

From the perspective of my purely avocational and rather unsystematic interest in history, I'll simply say that I found much of value in this book. I accordingly consider it well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I can't understand the positive reviews for this turkey! I bought this when it came out, and it sounds more like Pretty Boy Floyd or Britny Fox than any glam-punk band I've ever heard. Even the band hated it! The songs as written aren't that bad; the production seems to be the culprit here. Four of these songs were re-recorded for their second album, \\"No Lunch\\", and the improvement is phenomenal! That album has much earthier production, and is better played. Avoid this, and get their other two albums instead. At least they actually SOUND punk! This band was basically an updated Dead Boys, but this album is simply 'Dead'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"The smoky, mysterious ambience of \\"Songs From The Tin\\" is completely gone. What appears to have happened here is that some entity-corporate or maybe (God forbid) the group-abandoned the sound in hopes of getting mainstream radio play and sales. This project has inane lyrics and unremarkable melodies. I listened to the disc several times to see if I just wasn't \\"getting it\\" but ultimately stuck with my first impression.I was very happy to see another release from Da Lata and certainly want them to succeed as artists. But I'm sorry I paid full price for this CD without hearing the disc first.

Within 7 months the four cameras (CVC6993R) had night vision failures. The IRs would not switch on because of a mechanical auto IR filter cut failure.

You would be far better off with another brand if you want something reliable, which is an absolute for a security system."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRIGHTENING TOY","review":"The first reviewer was correct, this toy is dangerous. First of all, it makes a hideous, loud cracking noise every time you push the buttons to \\"pop-up\\" the teddies. My baby was frightened by the LOUD abrupt snapping/cracking noises. Secondly, fingers and skin will get pinched by the red hats. I would not recommend this to any child, at any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Bach, less pleasing Jacobs","review":"Bach's cantatas are so beautiful but this particular recording doesn't do them justice. Instrumentally Chiara Banchini does a good job but Jacobs leaves much to be desired. His sharp and pinched - especially in the high regions - voice is discomforting. His lower notes have more warmth but not much is sung in that register. If you're not a Jacobs fan, don't be deceived by this set's affordable price and go for one of Scholl's Bach collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Stories","review":"If you're looking for faith, hope and love, this is the book for you.

They are built sturdy and will handle the amount and type of garden hose that the manufacturer claims. They are not very fast when rewinding but it will rewind. the only problem is the hose will flatten out when rewinding, thus the next time you use the hose and only unroll a little bit of the hose instead of the entire reel, your water pressure isn't the greatest, due to the compacting of the hose when it was re-wound.

Well, they sent me the exact same one. I called customer service again, they said they'd correct the picture. In the picture, if you see a hose reel that has a top on it and is enclosed, it is not what you will receive.

This feature was part of an earlier model that I purchased a year ago, and I liked it. The reel that I just received has the same model number (15061) but is not enclosed (the wound hose is open to the elements) and, more importantly, there is no rewind hose guide. The instructions tell you to guide the hose onto the spool during rewind -- much less convenient in my view. Also, the Amazon description says that it includes mounting hardware, but the recent model does not, and says as much on the packaging. Obviously, Hydro Industries has cheapened their product, but the Amazon description has not been updated -- buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a while","review":"Worked for a few weeks.

First, it's impossible to tighten the wing nut that attaches the desk to the stand enough to prevent the desk from flopping back if you add much weight. Second, the desk shelf is only an inch deep, and as you add sheets of music, before long they begin tumbling to the floor. And third, the telescopic stand has a tendency to collapse under weight unless the nut is tightened as much as possible, which can make it difficult to loosen to adjust the height.

Since he's even got his name embedded in the title, he can be everywhere all at once. I guess some people are impressed with hype, could use even more of it than is dished up every day in our culture. I, on the other hand, could have used some recipes that didn't involve cooking for family reunion size crowds.

So why did I find this book annoying? It's not a real good cookbook in my opinion. First off, EVERY recipe has a yield for 8 persons. How many times do you cook a great meal for 8? I never do. And some of the ingredients are 1/4 cup, tablespoon, etc... which ends up 1/16 if you divide by 4. Plus some of the ingredients are not normal, which I really hate. I was looking for a grilling cookbook where I can use ingredients I already have on hand. No menu suggestions either.

As the Italian Food Host @ BellaOnline, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and truly appreciate good food, whether it be international or American. Most of the recipes in this book that I have tried, I have enjoyed, although since almost every recipe prepares enough for 8 servings, I had to divide the recipes in half. I thoroughly enjoyed the Jerked Chicken with Mango-Cilantro Relish and Barbequed Red Onions, but felt the Barbequed Chicken Quesadillas with Grilled Tomato Salsa to be too much work for the final product. My recommendation would be that if you are already a fan of Bobbie Flays, buy this book because you will probably enjoy it. If you have never tried one of his recipes before, buy his first book Bold American Food instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else","review":"As much as I like stack the deck styles, this book was a bust for me.

As one who normally ignores the biographical \\"bite\\" genera, I was very surprised at my inability to put \\"Children\\" down. There is a stealth hook to this story, one that inspires by helping us put our own problems into perspective and goads us to try harder. It is sweet without being sloppy; sure without being arrogant; certain without being too predictable. Golabek and Cohen have created a song in this book that is both primeval and polished, a moving tale many chapters of which could have expanded into books themselves. Richly rewarding. Somebody give us the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Parents and their children.","review":"This is a story which every parent should read to their children.

Except that I hope you will read this book if you haven't already and that you will share it with any young people you know. Mona Golabek has written a sincere, heartfelt memoir of her mother during World War II, enriched by both musical and family values. Ms. Golabek's memoir clearly shows how great music has the ability to sustain and nourish the soul in desperate circumstances.

I have to say now that I agree with the 1 star reviewers. I love Mozart operas but this production ruins it. I bought this as an introduction to opera for my two young children but it is too dark and there is too many closeups. I want to see the whole stage all the time. As another viewer mentioned, the closeups and varying camera angles are maddening. During the overture, there is constant scanning of the audience's faces - way boring. And during the movie, going back to view one particular girl's face, totally worthless.

All the technical and production comments are accurate enough,but also,(and more importantly),1)This opera is written in German and I'm a big believer in performing great operatic works not only in their entirety,but also in their original language, 2)AND most importantly for myself,the opera is intended to be a comedy;yes,but a BLACK COMEDY! This production turns it into a FARCE,(which is why children probably love it so much).If the kiddies saw this opera as intended,(regardless of choice of language),they would probably go running and screaming to dive under their beds and shake! The evil Queen really IS EVIL! More like in Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' than say, Jareth in 'The Labyrinth',(as a reference only). I think one is able to get a little more comfortable with Bergman's Queen than Mozart intended.

Upon the recommendation of someone who is clearly no judge of opera, I rented this - fortunately. The looping was most disturbing and the voices were inadequate - and that's being complimentary.The Tamino was quite beautiful asleep - awake, he was less so and even more boring, a pale Prince Valiant with neither voice nor animation.As an admirer of Bergman, I cringe over this travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collaboration between an old master and a new one","review":"Ingmar's Bergman's film of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute proves that film makers are not all complete narcissists: Bergman filmed a performance of Mozart's opera in a small Swedish opera house (and the performance is in Swedish, not the usual German) and he kept to the performance with laudable restraint. There are some wonderful shots of people in the audience as they wait for the curtain to go up, and the camera returns to one little girl several times during the action, but otherwise, what you see is the opera that the audience saw. It is a good staging and a lovely performance of a curiously moving opera that no one seems really to understand. The three children in a hot-air balloon, the good spirits, are especially moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Sex, Madness","review":"Although the costums lack the flamboyance I wolud have liked to see, this opera has an excellent camera & actor performance(several times I forgot this was opera and not a movie).

The actors are expressive and their voices are fantastic. The dragon is cute as can be and Papageno adds a lightheartedness. The sets are elaborate and beautiful.Being of Swedish heritage I love that it is sung in Swedish.A pleasurable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, unless you care about the story.","review":"It's pretty, and the singing is competent. But too much is cut from the book. Dialog isn't just there to waste time between musical numbers; you have to develop the story. I realize, of course, that people generally go to the opera simply for the music, but as a composer of opera myself, I can tell you that the story is the most important part of the piece; without it, the music is pointless. And even when the music is Mozart's, you can take out large chunks of dialog simply because they're not sung and still expext the piece to work as a whole.For a truly wonderful video of Magic Flute, I recommend the Metropolitan Opera recording from the late eighties. This is the production that set the standard for all contemporary productions to follow. Right now, it's still VHS only, but it's still more than worth it. And it respects the story as well as the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great poster!","review":"Rat Pack (At the Sands) Music Poster Print - 24x36 Poster Print, 24x36 Movie Poster Print, 24x36I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan and I grew up wishing I could be cool enough to be a member of the Rat Pack.

Additionally, at least two versions of the \\"second edition\\" exist, and while they are not differently marked, the examples and problems are different.If you need a book that will describe the aspects of design WITHOUT providing accurate details, this is probably a good book for you.

Hall was brilliant as David Fisher, but he's even better as Dexter. It was always weird to watch him in Six Feet Under, all conflicted about his sexuality, and then see him as a serial killer on Dexter - it's quite a contrast. During this discussion, Michael C. Hall shares his personal thoughts about Dexter vs. David. Hearing it come straight from him on screen was so much more satisfying than the reviews and producer interviews I've read online. There's just something about seeing all the actors up there describing their characters and relationships that takes the TV experience to a whole new level. Definitely worth the $20 if you enjoy the show at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but...","review":"I ... found Fowlie's over-literal translations ugly and lame. But I think this may be deliberate. The unbeautifulness of the translations forces you back to the exquisite French original. It's a joy to have these poems as Rimbaud wrote them, and a bilingual edition is a must for the non-French-reader. If you want a beautiful English translation, I recommend reading Paul Schmidt's in conjunction with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"-->Don't Buy This For The English Translation!<--","review":"Wallace Fowlie first published this book in 1966 and his English translation is quite biased even for 1966. His sanitized editorial of the original French poetry is sad. You can pick up a French dictionary and perform a similar translation without knowing any French. He has lost all the imagery and beauty of the original work. It looks like the work of a student in a first-year French class.Fowlies' biographical sketch of Rimbaud in the Introduction is incomplete. He skims over Rimbaud's homosexuality and his relationship with Verlaine as \\"troubled, and at times tragic...\\". Hardly a thorough and accurate reflection of Rimbaud during his most prolific period. Maybe Fowlie's overly cautious attempt to not offend his readers led him to filter out the imagery in his attempted English translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fowlie did a terrific job in translaing Rimbaud.","review":"Fowlie did an excellent job translating the works of Rimbaud. And as for those few words that he could not translate, some things just can't be translated. Some things are, in a sense, better left alone. But not Rimbaud. Regretfully, I can not speak French, so I am greatful for this translation. I feel like Rimbaud at times, a young man trying to cope with life as it comes to everyone. In my life, there is alcohol, and women, and food. And also the occasional person whom you find unusually attractive. And, like Rimbaud, I began writing poetry early. It wasn't too long ago, maybe 4 years, when i was 14. I feel a lot of confusion and contentment and love. I see all those things in the works of Rimbaud. And I am glad there was such a well translated version for me to have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the letters were intersting","review":"This book is another where the translator took it upon himself to rewrite the 'colors' in the work.

The pieces are matched by color and shape. Each shape is slightly rounded making it easy for little hands to grip. In fact, the whole sorter is easy for my babies to pick up and study due to the light weight and the design of the bars. The shapes also have rattles inside which my babies love shaking. And of course, when you roll the sorter, it makes a lot of noise because of that. The twist off ends also work well to keep the shapes in. I was originally going to buy a wooden sorter but was drawn to this one by all the positive reviews. The wooden ones I had looked into all had some sort of issue (poor quality, top came off to easily, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful and Versatile","review":"This product is colorful, durable, and so versatile. My baby loves to shake the different shapes, each which have a different sound, shape, and color. She enjoys rolling the sorter. She now loves filling the sorter with all sorts of toys, possibly because she can still see into it and the sorter is a great size for holding and filling. She now even puts the shapes into the sorter with some help, and I am sure that when she gets older she will enjoy doing this on her own. This toy has been a huge hit, and she is not even a year old yet!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great birthday gift for a 1 year old!","review":"I gave this to my friend's daughter for her first birthday and she loves it.

He loves it and spends lots of time playing with it. Its well constructed and durable. My son likes that all the shapes make noise ad enjoys banging them together and putting them in the holes.I have 2 small issues with the toy though. I wish it didn't basically have 3 flower shapes. They could have used a square,a moon or even a trapezoid to change things up but they didn't which is why I took off one star. Also I wish the holes were just a smidgen bigger. Sometimes if my son doesn't get them in perfectly straight the shapes go in the hole but get stuck half way through. I have to help and push it through for him which frustrates him.All in all its a good toy and I'm glad we have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves It!","review":"This is a toy that my son has been playing with since he was six months old. The pieces are perfect for him to hold and shake. He also enjoys rolling the base around with the pieces inside and with it empty. The pieces are very sturdy and easy to clean. He hasn't learned how to put the pieces inside, so there is much more that he can learn to do. I would highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy that lasts!","review":"We've had this toy for over 7 years now. Each kid loves it just the same! They love it! It's durable and more thought provoking due to it's dual-sided sorting. My only qualm about this toy is that in order to get the shapes out of the sorter, you have to unscrew the top (or bottom as they both unscrew). Small ones can't do this themselves and they keep handing it to you over and over again to take them out. You can't leave one side unscrewed because then they tip it over to put in a shape and it falls out so each time it must be screwed back on. The positive value of this toy far surpasses the annoying negative though so don't take this as a reason to not buy the toy. It is a durable, wonderful toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shape sorter I have seen","review":"This shape sorted was purchased for my oldest child's first birthday. He also has special needs and was in PT and OT at the time. 4 years later and after 3 kids, this toy is still much loved and looks like new.We have also had/used many shape sorters and this one is by far the best. It is appealing to younger and older children, younger ones may need more help getting the 6 differnt shapes to the right holes, and the older ones like to flip it back and forth getting all the shape in then opening it and starting over.As far as quality, this sorter is made of a hard plastic. So even during those early Teething years, this toy will show NO teeth marks. And the hard plastic allows for it to easily go in the dishwasher for cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"This is by far the best 12-string electric for the money as far as I'm concerned.

I like the simplified tone, volume and pickup selection. It frets easy and stays in tune. The finish is great, Grover tuners, the pots are quality and the factory set-up was perfect.

Having become a huge fan with their release of 'To Hell With the Devil', I wasn't sure how to take the band's break up a few years later. My hopes were uplifted when I heard that Michael was going to release a solo album. My expectations were that the music Stryper produced would be continued with this solo record. I was a little let down when it wasn't. In my youthfulness, I quickly got rid of Michael's solo album and continued to hope for Stryper's reunion. Now that Stryper is back, I decided to give Michael's solo album another shot. For those who have never listened to it, do not expect the 'heavy metal' sound Stryper was known for. I would consider Michael's first solo album to be more 'pop/rock' than 'rock/metal'.

Ahh, to have more authors of Flexner's caliber. James Thomas Flexner does an outstanding job of presenting to the reader the real Washington.

This is a highly recommendable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding biography of George Washington","review":"I believe the book to be well-researched; it bring Washington to life more than other biographies about him. It caused me to view Washington with more regard to him as a man, rather than a historical figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent biography for our nation's first President","review":"I am currently reading biographies for the Presidents of the United States in order. I chose this book by Flexner as he is one of the more recognized biographers for George Washington. I did not wish to read a multi-volume biography, so this one was excellent. This was a great book to start this adventure with as it was not too long, but long enough to maintain the important details of Washington's interesting life. This book read like a novel, only growing tedious during the descriptions of his multiple failings as the commander in chief during the Revolutionary War. For anyone with an interest in Washington, I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know why I think Washington is the greatest President","review":"I have always considered Washington a great President, but knew little about him. From reading the book: 1. I was amazed how often Washington extricated himself from difficult political situations simply by being forthright and honest. 2. I never knew the large role he played in the Constitutional Convention. 3. I learned he purposely wanted to step down as president to demonstrate our new govt could continue peacefully (this \\"experiment\\" was all new). 4. I now appreciate his large role in guiding the new country. Its beginnings were more tenuous than I had thought. While reading the book, I often wondered if the country would have survived without Washington. I easily read the book. I would put it down after finishing a chapter and usually find myself reading again withing the half-hour. The facts were well supported (documented), but not a dry textbook presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexner is gone; his monument to Washington remains.","review":"This year sadly saw the demise of this remarkable independent historian and biographer in his nineties after a long and accomplished life. His moving, sensitive and humane account of the life of George Washington remains as a monument to both subject and author. He makes Washington not only human, but lovable.

I liked the unbiased way the author wrote about Washington. However, I think that someone who is more familiar with the history of that time would enjoy this book more than someone looking for an informative yet easy read on George Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best Single Volume Life of Washington","review":"Flexner is considered, along with Douglas Freeman, to be the great Washington scholar. His four volume biography is a masterpiece of scholarship and historical writing. However, most readers will not have the time to plow through such a large work. Fortunately, Flexner wrote this fantastic book. He has managed to condense the essence of Washington's remarkable life into this single volume. It is every bit as informed and well written as the larger work, and for the curious, by far the best single volume biography of G.W. Every American should read this book. It's impossible to study GW as presented by Flexner and not be impressed. There is a reason why men such as Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, Adams, Madison, et al deferred to Washington. In these pages you will learn why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid, Factual, One-Volume Biography","review":"This biography of the U.S.'s father figure was very informative, and gives equal attention to the important points of Washington's life. Flexner did a good job of highlighting the key parts of Washington's career: his war-time service, and his activities as President. This book does pass fairly quickly through Washington's childhood and adolescence, which I wished to have learned more about, but it is a 1 volume summation, so that should be expected. The author was very fair and objective in this book. While he sees Washington as having been an average, if not below average, soldier, Flexner does show Washington to have excelled in other areas such as leadership and management which became very critical to his success as President. So for anyone looking for a reasonably quick cover of Washington's public career, with a shorter background of his private life, I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Blah","review":"This is not among the worst of the many novels featuring Edgar Allan Poe as a character, but that hardly makes it good. Unlike many novelists who write about Poe, Moore obviously made some effort to research his life. Unfortunately, many of the sources she used are now considered outdated or otherwise discredited, ultimately giving her story the same lack of believability found in most Poe novels. Most of this book is, let's say, \\"accurate but fake.\\"Unfortunately, \\"Fever\\" works even less well as a novel than it does as biography. Moore's attempts to make Poe sympathetic have him come off instead as simply pathetic. The writing and characterizations are universally dull. And I'm really, really tired of novelists endlessly depicting Virginia Poe as the eternally infantile, bland \\"child-wife\\"--an outmoded depiction no reputable Poe scholar endorses anymore.Someday, someone will write a historically accurate, well-written biographical novel about Poe. That hasn't happened yet, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!","review":"This book will be beneficial to any chiropractic practice.

Since these kind of bookshelf stereos are becoming more obsolete, I am happy to have this one. With all the sound quality of the Sonys I have owned (I've gone through a half dozen) it will please me if this just hangs on and does not become a disappointment in functionality.

Right speaker stopped playing and was producing loud noise instead. Since it was too late to return the unit to the store, I had to take it to the warranty repair shop, where they fixed it in 8 days.Unfortunatly 2 weeks later the same problem returned and I had to take it to the same shop again.

It is approximately the same width as the cable box(when all 3 pieces are setup next to each other) in case you were wondering. It has great output, sound will fill the living room, our attached kitchen, and can be listen to while in other rooms of our 1000sq condo, I have enjoy listening to the CD's and FM radio. It doesn't not include the cable necessary to connect other devices, like an Ipod, but someday we will get around to buying that and then we could play the Ipod on the stereo too. The tape deck is on the top of the system and out of the way if your don't need it.

Hookup was nice and easy. The sound quality is good and can really rock the house with volumne. The CD changer is cumbersome when inserting the CDs (or else I just haven't figured it out yet). The remote is complicated and I find because of that I do not use many of the features available. It was difficult just to figure out how to get all the CDs to play once through. I think with time and practice it will be easier but until then I do not like the remote and unfortunately that is the only way to use the stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact size, nice sound","review":"We purchased this unit for background music at our store about 800 square feet.

Often, hilariously so. But sometimes I wondered if he was still on drugs, because he was way off on a tangent. But other times, I laughed so hard I hurt myself.

But you will laugh, regardless. Only from the brilliant mind of Mr. Carlin will you hear/read such observational gems!!I gotta wonder if having a sense of perception and observation like his is a blessing or a curse. I guess he is still about as \\"counterculture\\" as counterculture can be nowadays, but he is also has an incisive, intelligent mind, make no mistake! And he is politically incorrect not for shock's sake, but because he has his b.s. meter on at all times and isn't afraid to comment on it. Not all of the material translates well to written form, but if you can \\"hear\\" it in his voice, it is like having Carlin the Master give a command performance just for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I ever read!","review":"George Carlin is at his best in this book.

To the average reader, this book would be just another funny man's book. Believe me, George Carlin is one of the smartest people around.

If you want to laugh quite a bit, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common-sense philososphy","review":"While it made made laugh out loud about every third page, I think it a bit limiting to refer to this as a book of Comedy only. There is more truth in a lot of what Carlin says than possibly even he realizes, and certainly a great deal more than any of our so-called leaders spout forth on a regular basis.

All others amused.","review":"Having been a huge follower of his work, I've heard just about every monologue he's ever done. I first heard of this book when he went on the radio promoting it as the material he might not live to deliver. Sad to say, it isn't. Most of the book is rehashed material from his old performances and are jumbled about in the form of disjointed, unrelated one-liners that are too forced to be funny.On occasion, he falls back into form and begins new rants in his classic outrageous style, but these moments are brief, occupying maybe 10% of the book. The whole debacle left me feeling like I had just watched a rerun of his tv show where he tried too hard to be funny and ended up caging the comic madman that he truly is. This book makes Carlin seem like a profane Dave Barry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nutty Misanthrope","review":"\\"F@#$ hope.\\" That's how George Carlin describes his worldview in the preface of Braindroppings. \\"...if you think there is a solution, you're part of the problem.\\" Then he goes on to describe himself as \\"a joyful individual with a long and happy marriage\\". I think Carlin still excels at what he does best, joking about our misuse of the English and about things we all experience in everyday life that we never discuss. Still, read this book only if you desire a depressing, incoherent rant. A manic Andy Rooney.All this leaves me wondering where Carlin's performance-related bombast ends and his real feelings begin. \\"When I see children today, I think of tomorrow's f#$%ed-up adults.\\" This can't be the same guy who narrates Thomas the Tank Engine stories for kids' TV. Or can he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"George is an Unhappy Camper","review":"I have been a George Carlin fan for years, but was extremely disappointed in \\"Brain Droppings\\". It is the most mean-spirited book I believe I have ever read. George's stand-up comedy has always shown how we can laugh at the absurdities of the world. In this book, he has turned it around and attempts to show how we should hate the world. In the recent trend of comedy \\"stars\\" writing these books of wit, this book was one I was definitely looking forward to reading. Instead I left with the feeling that George Carlin believes everybody (but him) should be \\"phased out\\".

So much to laugh about, think about. Just when I think, Man, he's nuts, he starts making sense. I've always enjoyed his comedy and now his cynicism, this is great comedy.

Finally, I got tired of skimming the uninspired (something I don't think one should feel compelled to do when reading a humor book). Out of fairness, I admit I haven't read the second half of the book yet, but I'm not so sure I will.

Where once he could find the humor in daily life, he now finds only cynicism and obscenity. There is little insight and less laughter in these musings from a tired and discouraged old failure at life. There are some good sections in the book. His \\"I CAN'T RECALL\\" and \\"A PLACE FOR YOUR STUFF\\" show some of his former talent. Some of the \\"Short Takes Part 1\\" do so as well.

If I had purchased it, I would have demanded a refund from the publisher. This book shows that Carlin, one of my favorite comedians in the Seventies, is now just a tired hack. He is an awful writer. Worse, he no longer knows what is funny because he is sorely out of touch. As a fan of comedy I have witnessed the sad demise of his talent. Case in point: When I saw him perform live 15 years ago in New York he absolutely killed. But when I saw him perform live in Cleveland back in 1993, he was just going through the paces: giving an impersonal show and rushing off the stage as if he had a plane to catch. Out of respect, I would never pay for him again. Carlin is like a champion prize fighter who stayed in the ring too long. He should hang up the gloves; the pen; and the microphone and leave his fans with pleasant memories of what he once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a book is worth a penny...","review":"...it tells you something about the quality of the material.Yes, the book is funny, in Carlin's usual \\"shouting in your ears\\" way. But it gets old after a chapter or two.Borrow it from a library for a good chuckle, but not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I read Last Words and I really liked it so I bought Brain Droppings. I found this book to be very mean-spirited. George's personality doesn't come through in the book like it does in person. Brain Droppings seems to be a list of his notes on what he might put into his live act. If I had to guess his book was written to pay his huge tax bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be the delivery...","review":"It must be his delivery, because this book just isn't funny. Bought it for a long plane trip and after a few pages it just made the trip seem longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to hear, poor to read. Sorry George.","review":"I was sorry to see how poorly Carlin converted to text. The old material is not so bad, but much of the new material seems rather repetitive and redundant. His proposed solutions to numerous problems are all the same violence that ceased to be shocking years ago. There are few worthwhile sections, the best of which might be the criticism of misused phrases and terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love George, but don't buy his book...","review":"George is a great comedian, but reading him is a big disappointment. You miss the timing, facial expressions and enthusiasm of his stand up presentations. Cosby translates well into books, George doesn't. Save your money, and George, if you read this, you owe me a beer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!

Unfortunately, George Carlin has gotten old and grouchy.How sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best comedian ever","review":"What an exceptional man! I loved every piece of his \\"Brain Droppings\\", and what a brain indeed! He has been a big inspiration for me. I love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for TRUE George Carlin fans","review":"I say a must for TRUE George Carlin fans because some of the content of this book may seem like the hysterical ravings of a madman. A true George Carlin fan will recognize this as insightful yet brutally honest observations of the current situation of humanity and society. I felt that the book was \\"laugh-out-loud\\" funny at the beginning and slowly fading to smiles and snickers. Some of the content is from past stand-up routines and a lot is simply one-liners. But it is all funny and certainly worth your while. It is also a very quick-reading book--I finished it in two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could have lunch with ANYONE....","review":"It would be George Carlin. I could just sit back and listen to him go on forever.Only drawback to this book was that every so often there was these pages where random thoughts were stuck in...didnt dig those to much...but hey, its George."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Carlin Brain Droppings","review":"Book arrived on time. Good comedy for anyone OVER the age of 21. If you know Carlin you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROFLMAO","review":"If you know George, then you can hear his comedic voice coming through this book loud and clear. Extremely insightful, interesting, witty, and hilarious are some of the words I would use. I would also have to throw in angry, critical, sarcastic and downright blasphemous. My favorite part in the middle of all this humor and anger, two short sentences in small print, like the voice of a child: \\"Why is it like this? Why isn't everything different?\\" After you read that, you know this book was worth much more than the asking price, whatever it may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great actually","review":"I love George Carlin, but this book is only so so. It's just not his greatest work and I find most of his fans will find it disappointing. There are the occasional funny parts, but it's just not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff...but ABRIDGED!","review":"I bought the \\"unabridged\\" cassette version of this, but when I got it, I found it was actually \\"unabridged EXCERPTS,\\" which is the kind of oxymoron that you'd think Carlin would despise.Having said that, this is a great supplement to the book, because as most Carlin fans know, at least 50% of the joke is in his delivery; so it's good to hear this stuff actually performed by Carlin himself. But you still have to buy the book to get the entire work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time On This Book","review":"It completely escapes me why any intelligent adult woudl find much of value in George Carlin's Brain Droppings. To borrow from Mr. Carlin's style of writing, the droppings from this book are more likely to have emerged from the other end of one's anatomy. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of an Era is finally at hand!","review":"This piece of pitiful piffle has only two barely noticeable and recognizable highlights: the classic \\"Baseball and Football\\" and \\"A Place for my Stuff\\" routines, superfluously updated for the young and ignorant '90's dwellers. I recieved this pile of paper for my birthday in '98, and it was by far, the most disappointing put-forth effort by any modern entertainer that I have ever heard of. I refer to it as such because it ended up as fire-fodder, and the front cover came in very handy as a dartboard. However, I managed to salvage the two aformentioned sections with the classicly humorous material intact. My thoughts on this bitter old man's career dwindling into the inevitable downward spiral as it has gradually has happened is this: the guy has lost it for sure, he is completely out of touch, and should give up further attempts to entertain (I use this term loosely) the general public any longer. Give it up, G.C.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He Is Quite a Character Alright!","review":"I would generally agree with this reviewer.\\"I think Carlin still excels at what he does best, joking about our misuse of the English and about things we all experience in everyday life that we never discuss. Still, read this book only if you desire a depressing, incoherent rant.\\" A manic Andy Rooney? That would be kind. Carlin is not nearly as bright at Rooney. I thought this guy was so brilliant when I was in college....and wasted a lot of time listening to his antics.In adulthood, I see him as an immature, insecure, and angry man, who has a complex about how intelligent he is. Enough said. He can be witty, but he seems captured by the dark side:( and has not really grown out of his adolescent angst problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not remotely funny","review":"I have to admit that I didn't read the entire book. I probably read about 1% of it but that is all I could stomach. I picked up the book because I had run across quotes from George Carlin on the Internet and thought they were very funny. I put the book down not because of the type of humor or the vulgarity -- I enjoy both in a good comedian. The problem with the book is that it simply is not funny. It's boring. It's so boring it hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRAIN MANURE .... ZERO stars","review":"...There are about 20 pages worth of laughs. The rest is gross, obscene, pointless, garbage.Hey, I don't mind the occasional foul word and raunch. Not at all. But this was beyond raunchy into just sickco....with no point, therefore not funny. Gutter humor.I checked out a copy at my library and I suggest you do the same. No one deserves money for this kind of trash. It should of never been published..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no fool like an old fool","review":"What exactly does an old millionaire have to whine about? This book, which I acquired for nothing, unfunnily tries to answer this timeless question. Occasional clever Carlin quips are offset by pages of venemous, unfunny rants. One good grouch deserves another: \\"The covers of this book are too far apart.\\" --Ambrose Bierce"},{"rating":"1","title":"His incites are not very cleaver","review":"With all the controversy surrounding him, I expected more. I honestly could have sat down and made up a lot of his material myself. Because of his views, I expected to gain some new incite or perspective.

If you have a large breed dog, go with something better made."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use","review":"Most of the pooper scooper type products I have seen in the stores have a spring-type action, causing too much hand and arm pain. I have six dogs and am in need of an easy to use product. I am able to clean up the whole yard in very little time with this. This also comes in handy while picking up regular yard debris such as leaves and random sticks. This is the only pooper scooper I ever want to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This item arived unwrapped in a large box and was so bent out of shape I tried to use a hammer to put it back to shape and finally just took it apart .Very poor packageing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky to Find Them!","review":"I have looked EVERYWHERE for this style of pooper scooper and it seems most major pet supply retailers are now carrying the separated version, kind of like a rake and dustpan. Those, however, do not work well if you have mulch or rock in your yard. I would highly recommend this product! I even bought two just in case :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pooper Scooper, Rake","review":"I love this because it has a wide rake for picking up feces. However I am left handed and this wasn't working well for me with it bolted together I took the bolt out and of course now have no issues using this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy. Invest your money elsewhere.","review":"The rakes bent after a couple of uses, then they fell off after a couple more uses, making the product completely useless. Also, I found it to be small. Definitely not a sturdy product. I would invest my money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get all the poop in one scoop","review":"I've used this for 6 months and finally threw it out. My dog poops across the street and I find it's difficult to get all the poop in one scoop. But the worst part is the scooper and rake didn't line up very well so it was hard to keep the poop from falling out as I walked the poop to our trashcan. Perhaps ours was faulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeth bend very easily in grass","review":"The handle, fulcrum, and scoop body are all fine. However, the teeth bend very easily, leaving a gap between the scoops, which makes picking up poop a challenge. Yes, you can bend them back into place, but not the most appealing thing to do when they are covered in dog poo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Five-Star Scooper","review":"Over the years I've had as many as 3, and now 2, Irish Setters who delight in leaving me lots of poop to scoop. I've tried all manner of scoopers and, for me, the scissor-type is just so much easier to use when cleaning up in the yard and in the run, where the poop can either be in sand, pea gravel or on cement blocks. The Four Paws scooper is so solidly built that I got a 2nd one that I use for garden clean-up chores (piles of wet leaves in the fall, grass clippings, and pruned stems, twigs and small branches) -- beats the heck out of bending over to pick all this stuff up."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy pooper scooper","review":"It's very rickety and hard to maneuver. The tongs bend easily. We ended up separating the arms and using them as a shovel set. We will be finding a new scooper soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that easy to use","review":"I purchased this product because I had a cheaper rake and shovel, but the pieces were cheap and fell apart. I bought this item, but I did not realize that the rake and shovel were not separate pieces. I found it difficult to use and the dogs waste did not stay on the shovel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umm, it works?","review":"I've become something of a scooping expert with this product. As long as you take it easy and don't bend the aluminium too badly out of shape (can be bent back, but then you have to get close to the poop!) it's a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately very cheap","review":"I got this scooper. Have 3 goldens and doing it by hand with a bag in our yard can become back breaking. I purchased this a month ago. It worked Wonderful for the first month. Well yesterday I was using it and the handle SNAPPED in two. I would understand had the product been mishandled and left out in rain and such, but nothing. I am past my 30 day return on Amazon. I have contacted the company that makes it and no help there. Told them I would write a bad review on the product and they didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing design","review":"The rake and the shovel of this scooper are bolted together in the center making it difficult to use. It is like trying to pick up dog waste with really long tongs - more pinching than scooping. After pick up, it was really difficult to dump the waste into our Doggey Dooley. We removed the bolt and it now works slightly better but the shovel has a high rim on just one side which still makes it difficult to use with a Dooley. Finally, after using this product, I've decided rakes aren't always a great solution for dog waste, stabbing the waste or, if it has rained, just combing through it instead of scooping. Yuck. Years ago, we had a scoop with a solid shovel, not a rake. I'll be looking or one of these instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap material","review":"have had the blue handles snap on each one I have purchased. not sure why i bought the second one after the first broke. should have just thrown the money directly into the garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all","review":"The prongs on the rake bent back in the first use. I have not used it since. I am pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We ordered this item after seeing a lot of positive reviews and were VERY disappointed. It is poorly constructed, feels cheap, and the scissor design is not well executed in that the rake and scoop do not line up so it does NOT close - making it impossible to actually pick up the dog mess. We returned it immediately and ordered something a little more expensive and of better quality. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"pooper scooper","review":"I did not find this pooper scooper to be of good quality. it is very clumsy to use and would probably only be good if you didn't need to use it very often. If I hadn't used it I would probably have returned it. Don't buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor function","review":"When this came in the mail I realized that the two pieces are joined together and have very poor function. You can't scoop well with it and regretted the purchase. I should have bought the kind I've used before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is an example of buyer beware; you get what you pay for -- or less. The metal scoop sides and bottom are flimsy, already bent while in the box; you have to straighten them so the two sections of the scooper can semi-close. With sides straightened out, the bottom of the scooper didn't meet all the way across for you to grab those doggy remnants without leaving some behind. My dog is only 34#, and this scooper left more mess to clean up than when the little job began. Even if your pup leaves very dry stool, you'll have a mess to contend with remaining on the ground, and on the scoop. I'm ordering the higher priced scooper right now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best Pooper Scooper","review":"Having bought one of these in the UK 5 years ago & having 6 dogs, I was anxious to replace it, but it was nowhere to be seen in my country. Thank goodness Amazon.com had it because it is the very best of its kind. The original one has been used twice a day, every day for 5 years & has only just given up, even though we left it outside in all weathers....amazing ! It picks everything up effortlessly from any surface, if you have any kind of flexibility or back problem I would highly recommend it too. Maybe people in wheelchairs would find it a little too tall to operate effectively,but the handle length & scissor action is perfect otherwise. Thank you so very much Four Paws, I know it's a bit strange to get overly excited about a pooper scooper, but you make the one downside of dog ownership a little bit brighter with your excellent product.....thank you !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Scooper","review":"The rake and scoop are great for getting droppings out of the grass! This is well worth the money. It's what I was looking for locally and couldn't find! It's better than scoopers without a rake that tend to make a mess and not scoop. My ten year old cleanes up after our miniature schnauzer and lab, and it's quick, easy, and so simple to use. My six-year old wants one of her own to help out! I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars = 8 turds. It stinks.","review":"This scooper would work great if scooping up very firm poops from a hard dry surface. It is terrible with grass - especially if you keep your grass on the longer side. When you scoop, it flexes, grabbing grass and leaving most of the poop behind. The scoops do not line up so you are likely to drop what you picked up. Then if the poop isn't firm, you gotta use a stick to get it off the scoops. Gag me! I would rather teach my dog to use a litter box than use this scoop!

Which means that you will have to use the alternate method and install it verticaly on the back end of the sider. This looks tacky and doesn't really work all that well.

Barcelona is a complex mix of Catalan, Spanish, ex-pat, and tourist culture. If you want a \\"living abroad\\" guide try Culture Shock Spain. It's not perfect but it gives some good basic info. The movie Barcelona is also worth seeing. If you are a tourist and just want the basics, try The Rough Guide to Barcelona. Once in the city get the free magazine Metropolitan (in English). I lived there before Greta arrived, but I know some of the same people so our experinces may intersect at certain points. I was living with a Catalan so my experiences were mixed Catalan and ex-pat.

This book TRULY answered one, of those questions. After Jack Mullen found out his brother's brutal death was being labeled a suicide/accident, he plunged into action. The middle of the book made me want to read more and more! By the end of the novel, however, we are only given a speculation. After reading the whole book, I wanted to know why Peter Mullen was killed. The reader knows how the murder happened because we are told from the victim's P.O.V. in the beginning of the story, and the reader can basically figure out who the killers were.

I cannot believe it made the best seller list except perhaps on the strength of James Patterson's name. Nothing about the plot isbelieveable..the characters, the \\"story\\" the ending...it is just totally unreal. This is amateur night, folks.There is not one person in this book you can like, let alone relate to. The more you find out about the so-called \\"victim\\" the less you care \\"who done it\\" except it is no secret.

I read it about half way and just couldn't take it anymore. It took me about a mth to get that far. It normally takes me less than a week to read a book that size if it is captivating enough. I usually try to force myself to finish a book even if it turns out not to be too interesting, but I just couldn't do so this time. There was really nothing in it to captivate me and keep more coming back for more. I eventually had to just give up and move to more interesting book. In the process, I discovered Harlan Coben.

The quality of writing in The Beach House was not up to par with his other novels, which leads me to believe that Mr. De Jonge wrote this book and Patterson added a few touches and put his name at the top, just to sell the book.

I would be pretty mad if I had actually paid for it. I found it hard to believe that this book was actually written for adults. What's the deal with chapters being less than 3 pages long? I thought the point of a chapter break was to switch gears some what in the story line. I will say that I almost found it interesting until the completely moronic trial at the end. I'm sure it will be turned into a dumb movie staring Ashley Judd or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Great Literature, But . . . .","review":"I'm an avid reader who tries to read at least a book a week.I read \\"Beach House\\" in an afternoon and an evening; I couldn't put it down.Obviously, it's a little on the trashy side--some of the descriptions toward the end are a bit sick--but it was also a relief from some of the really serious stuff I'd been reading.(Were this a movie, I would rate it X. I don't recommend it for the squeamish, prudes or kids. I may have to take it to my office so that Kimball Ross, my good dog and reading buddy, doesn't pick it up.)It's a fast-paced novel--I detest using \\"read\\" as a noun--and I was surprised how quickly I devoured it. Yes, it held my interest, and to me it's almost like a comic strip or cartoon. In an earlier day, would it be called pulp fiction?The only thing that really bothers me--and one of the reviewers pointed this out--is that I'm not sure I completely understand the killer's motivation. Maybe there was nothing to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page turner-but","review":"I, being a fuss budget, was annoyed early on in the book when it was written that the seas were rough due to the remnants of a Hurricane already up to letter G on Memorial Day weekend in the Northeast.

The writing also seemd to be a different style from his past books; which might be due to the additional author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Misleading In Order to Boost Summer Book Sales","review":"I just finished this one, and I am annoyed with the authors. What does this book have to do with a Beach House? Very little, and that very little is contrived. It's insulting to the intelligence of Patterson's regular readers. Patterson and DeJonge's title is a blatant [misnomer], chosen in order to sell vacationers a hot, summer beach read. The title should have been \\"Vigilante Justice,\\" and that would have at least alluded to the plot. I suggest you save your money on this one--you will see lots of unread copies lying around beach houses this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real depth.","review":"I am a James Patterson fan and have read every one of his books. Unfortunately, this one isn't one I would recommend reading. There are too many characters thrown out all at once, and it's hard to keep track of who's who.His books usually flow and have lots of twists and turns, this one did not. I found myself reading it only because I was hoping it was going to surprise me in some way with an amazing twist.I hope his next one is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book not the audio tape or cd","review":"This was the first James Patterson book I have ever read, and I thought it was just alright because the ending was implausible. The story was very interesting until then. I also made the mistake of buying it on cd so I could listen in the car. Gil Bellows voice has sort of a whistling sound when he pronounces \\"s\\", which can get to be annoying. Additionally, it would have been nice if he learned to pronounce the names of the towns and some of the other words before he recorded this book. The main character, a native Long Islander, would not mispronounce Ronkonkoma or Patchogue as Mr. Bellows did, MANY, MANY, times. The story was very interesting (until the end) and it kept me going through the poor narration. I love Gil Bellows on the Agency but I was disappointed with his narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss Something? __ Dumb Book","review":"I really did not enjoy this book.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing With No Credibility","review":"This was a really disappointing book. The plot strains crdibility to say the least and gets worse as the book progresses. The climax is totally unbelievable and there are so many loose ends that you have to laugh. Character development is so thin that you have to wonder if the book was based on a cartoon strip. Finally, while the book has about 350+ pages, the type is large, the spacing is generous, and there are so many blank and half pages that one could envision this \\"book\\" being written over a long weekend. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Summer read","review":"This is one of the emptiest books written by Patterson. It has glaring holes that leave the reader frustrated. This is a cheap attempt to capitalize on people's interest in how the rich live and reassure them that they wouldn't want to be rich. Save your money unless you want a quick read that leaves you empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't read another Patterson book","review":"I don't know whom to blame for the terrible writing plot and writing. Patterson or DeJonge. The hokey cable TV trial was the epitome. Patterson's novels remind me of those \\"Starving Artist\\" commercials on TV sold out of hotel conference rooms over a weekend. Those are assembly line landscape paintings where one guy paints the clouds, another paints mountains or streams, etc. Garbage, just like assembly line novels \\"written\\" by Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson you need to go it alone!","review":"This co-authorized James Patterson book is painful to read. I only made it to page 100. Larger than usual print, and chapters only 2-3 pages long. Too much skipping around on characters. Not up to his usual mystery style of book. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I liked this book because i crammed it in the night before i was due to have read it, no my english teacher did not assign it, she let us pick out books. when she had us tell whether or not we liked the book or not, i said i wouldn't recommend it and she said \\"no, not to anybody who has a brain\\"- this book sounds like it was written by an 8th grader, i could write a book better than this one. Patterson uses very little descriptive details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This was the first james patterson book I have read and I really enjoyed it. The book is fast paced and it is one that you will not want to put down. The only disapointment was that there was really no surprising ending. I was waiting for another shoe to drop and it never does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless story, worthless characters, worthless read","review":"This rates as one of the worst books I've read in a while. What showed promise in the first couple chapters as a good whodunit quickly turned into a story that was totally implausible, involving characters I cared nothing about, and that includes the grieving brother of the murder victim. The epilogue could not have been less credible. It didn't help that there were many annoying inaccuracies about the legal system that could have been corrected with minor research. All in all, the only saving grace is that this book was a quick read, with short chapters that one could complete at a stop light. At least I didn't waste that much time. Unfortunately, I did spring for a new hardback. Borrow the book or buy a used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a day","review":"That's what this book was. Like everyone says its a quick read, only because of the type set and the number of blank and half pages. Or maybe because it's written on a third grade level.

I think most people would find this a worthy addition to their summer reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"his worst book","review":"I have read and enjoyed most of his books, but this was a complete disappointment. It sounded like it would be a \\"Grisham-like\\" legal story, but that was not the case. This was nothing like Grisham, whose key strength is compelling characters. The problem is this is all plot, and reads more like an outline than a story. There is no depth to the characters, they are all cardboard cutouts and it is way, way over the top. Definitely did not get my money's worth with this one. Wonder if it is too late to return?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Day at The Beach","review":"Accustomed as I am to quality work from this author, I was highly disappointed by the effort.

(he can do much better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as exciting as watching grass grow","review":"What a disappointment! I saved this book for vacation, wished I'd left it at home or better yet, on Amazon's shelves.

I have always looked forward to his next one. Unfortunately, he has taken to co-writing. I was a little put out by the last one, but at least it approached his previous standards. This one is so terrible that Patterson should donate the entire proceeds to his co-author, who, obviously, has no furture in writing and should look elsewhere for his occupation. What could possess Patterson to write such a stupid piece of trash is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Sorry folks but I couldn't get past page 50.

Very hokey and far below the quality of his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I was suspicious when I saw there were two authors to this novel (is that EVER a good sign?), but I bought it because I enjoy Patterson's novels so much, especially Alex Cross series. I struggled through about 60 poorly-written pages, and just put it aside unread. Life is too short and there are too many fine books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"This is the first Patterson novel I have read, and I guess I shouldn't have started with The Beach House. The story was basically unbelieveable and it read like a hurried made-for-TV movie along with the very short chapters and the simplistic plot. But maybe that is what he was after when he was writing it. The story starts off with a murder and our \\"hero\\" is off and running - trying to find out who would kill his brother. Along the way, he finds all kinds of terrible stuff about his sibling and fights with all the big wigs in the world. Wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds me of Brad Meltzer's The First Counsel","review":"Similarities - the young lawyer mixed up with really high placed bad guys (White house and corporate honchos - hmmm...how timely!) who are way out of his league.

I wouldn't agree at all that it was in anyway boring nor should a child even handle this book. Yet I thought it was probably a closer to non fiction, rather then fiction. There are some real sick puppies out in the world, maybe Patterson was sharing a little of his research into a bit of fantasy. Who knows? It was a very easy read and I read it in an afternoon.I thought it was Exciting and at times quite sad. James is such a prolific writer, he can write from vast story lines. The thing is that people need to be open to all his talents, he is not Committed to Alex Cross, thoses are just a handful of his books.The Beach House, is an outstanding novel and I have told many to pick it up, you will not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the motive?","review":"The book wasn't all bad, in fact it was enjoyable and easy to read, however the plot was incomplete.

But instead of an enjoyable read I was submerged into some kind of sick and perverse world. The characters were unlikable and the dialogue was inane. Mr. Patterson must have had a high fever and was delirious when he wrote this. I've enjoyed his previous books but Beach House was a downer. Maybe a tidal wave will take the house out to sea. My greatest fear is that this becomes a series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the marketing in the world won't make this a good book","review":"This is the book that will make me stop and think the next time some publishing behemoth pushes another 'sure' best seller.

I thought that the LA coroners' office was doing the autopsy on Peter's body. To believe that this man was not murdered and it was an accident was to far over the top. The kangaroo trial at the end of the book was so ridiculus that it was laughable. Hopefully, the next Paterson book will be much better than this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Good Read","review":"This book is a very fast read. Enjoyable.

This book reads well and is enjoyable until you hit the last 80 pages then it becomes almost silly!!<spoiler>To get revenge the main character kidnaps eight people and holds a mock trial on live TV??? Sounds like a bad Saturday Night Live skit then a novel by a popular author. It's just one of those books that you enjoy/love and then hate after you finish it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindergarten Doodle","review":"Reading \\"Beach House\\" is basically like ripping a band-aid off, you just want to get it over with. For beginners, as you progress through the book, the story line gradually becomes less & less believable.And then there is the writing, which quite frankly, was written with the maturity of a 5th grader. The chapters' range from 1 page long to about 3 pages long. There's literally about 200 chapters in this book. And, for lack of a better word they're all pretty \\"silly,\\" although this wasn't there intention. Mid-way through the book I was anticipating the words to be written in those big block letters that kids in kindergarten use when they're first learning penmanship. James Patterson should personally reimburse anyone who spent a dime on purchasing this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable. Literally.","review":"Mr. Patterson, what happened???James Patterson is one of my favorite writers but this doesn't even seem to be HIS work. Who is the co-author DeJonge? Wife? Child? It's as if someone else wrote the book but James Patterson put his name (and image) on it to get it to sell. Or, more likely, James Patterson wrote the first half of the book and let someone else write the second half. The writing is that ... disjointed.The Beach House starts with interesting characters and (I'm assuming) the intention of weaving them into an interesting plot. However, midpoint, the book's writing slowly coasts into implausible events led by one-dimensional characters and concludes with an even more implausible ending. Yes it was short, easy read but I was left staring at the last page, thinking, \\"What in the world was THAT?\\"James Patterson, stick to writing solo. For your fans.

Here's my cry: GET ME REWRITE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like it","review":"Patterson, what are you doing? Answer: coasting. This book was obviously written quickly and by and for the numbers. The first half is a page turner, but what could have been a decent mystery/thriller is ruined by the implausible and sloppy second half. Please stop reading here if you don't want to know an ending plot point (even though it's a dumb one): Two of the main characters turn out to be HIV positive, and both have slept with another main character (for one of them, this is implied, as they are blood-related)who has, in turn, slept with the narrator. Wouldn't it occur to the author to explain this, or for the narrator to worry a bit, or get tested? Just an example of how cardboard these characters are-- if the author doesn't care about them, why should we?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Step Up From the Soaps","review":"This book is a page turner but it is so horribly written, with such a contrived plot that it is just one step up from the soap operas.

I didn't like any of the characters, especially the grandad Mack, who was supposed to be so \\"good\\". He was irritating. The \\"trial\\" was implausible and it's result just made glad the book was over. Why was nobody angry at the character Sammy who was one of the childhood circle of friends? I never felt drawn into life at the Hamptons and wondered why it was set there and not in Bevery Hills or some other rich people's town. I only hope that the disapointment with this book that I and others felt is due to the writing partnership here, no offense to Peter De Jonge.

Way to stereotype, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Book. Ever.","review":"I consider myself a fan of trash fiction like James Patterson and I generally enjoy most of his work.The Beach House, however, was one of the worst pieces of garbage I ever read. From the annoying way that the protagonist communicated directly with the reader, to the inane conversations he has with friends, to the completely ridiculous ending.I can honestly say that this is the WORST book I have ever read, the only reason I even finished it was that I was stuck on a plane with no alternative. It was that terrible. James Patterson should be ashamed of himself, and I want my 5 hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-hyped","review":"This book seems to have gained popularity only because of the setting in the Hamptons.

You should be able to complete this \\"epic\\" by the time they call your name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I do not believe for a moment that James Patterson had anything to do with the writing of this novel.If by chance I'm wrong,........please, please, Mr. Patterson, stick to writing of Detective Alex Cross.I found \\"The Beach House\\" quite infantile and was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and unrealistic","review":"This was a real disappointment. The situations are contrived, the characters are unrealistic and either cloyingly good and well-intentioned or unremittingly evil. The plot is pedestrian. Not even good beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste--don't bother","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was the most corny and predictable plot I have encountered since middle school. I had never read Patterson before, but having heard such great things and seeing that he is always on the best sellers list, I decided to give this a try. What a complete waste of time. I thought it stunk a few chapters in. but continued because I thought it would get better. It never did, and in fact, it got worse and more unrealistic as the plot went on. The latter parts of the book are cheesier than a soap opera. I don't want to give anything away in case someone out there is crazy enough to want to waste their life away, but the ending is absolutely ridiculous. Please don't buy this book. Do something productive with your life and read something that you won't have figured out in the first 10 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book on CD","review":"I listened to Beach Road on CD and I must say that I did enjoy the book. I thought that it was interesting the way the story played out. Honestly I was surprised by the charater Loco turned out to be. I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson is NOT John Grisham","review":"But he tries to be in this book. It doesn't work. The usual twist and grabbers aren't there, the \\"courtroom\\" seen is fine, but it dosen't keep you at the edge of your seat like most of his writings. Either wait for the paperback or get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover (or synopsis)","review":"When I saw this book in the store and read the set-up for the plot, I anticpated a great read. Instead, this book was so bad I almost wanted my money back. I felt cheated. The dialogue was wooden, characters one dimensional and unbelievable. The story lacked credibility in the early stages -- one would have to believe that the entire town and a prestigious law firm for no motive whatsoever was involved in a massive cover-up -- and then amazingly became just totally absurd.My morals don't permit me to reveal the ending of this book (or any book) but if it could save one person from reading this book I might make an exception because it was so ridiculous. What were they thinking???P.S. If I could give this zero stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks like a dead Mackeral","review":"Wow this book is bad. Sets new standards. I had to find something to read before a flight and grabbed this one in the rush. Actually, the first chapter is not awful but the rest is so astonishingly bad that I couldn't stop reading it through the conclusion that was predictable from page 12 or so. If you have a short attention span, hate character development, and want to fit in with the crowd this one is for you. Yikes!!, a #3 bestseller!?! That gives me the fantods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Classic by James Patterson","review":"I would highly recommend this book. It is another classic produced by Patterson. I read it in less than 2 days, could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"Although I am a fan of James Patterson,especially the Alex Cross series, I could barely get through this novel. The plot lacked depth, and the ending was predictable. The style of writing was also not worthy of a best selling author."},{"rating":"2","title":"nobody does it better","review":"As always James Patterson can keep you up all night with his amazing storys and the unexpected twists.I would defenitly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is, without question, the worst book I have ever read. Even for a light summer reading experience it is a piece of junk. The depth is shallow, the plot entirely predictable and the writing mediocre. You can see the next plot twists chapters in advance. If I had written like this as a sophomore in high school, yes high school - not college, I would have been given a D. This was my first experience with James Patterson, and it will be my last. I would rank this somewhere below drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of His Best","review":"Read several of his books and kind of enjoyed most. This last one was hard to get through. Good plot delivered with no substance. To flat including the so called \\"romance\\" which would've been better left out.Hope his next book is more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Next Time","review":"This is the first James Patterson book I have ever purchased. I hope he does not make writing like this a habit or he won't be a best selling author. This book was really good half way through ,but after that it just got ugly. Even though I did not enjoy this book as much as I would have liked to ,I always give authors a second chance. I just purchased Four Blind Mice and I hope I am not wasting my time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no!","review":"Starting this book with zero expectations after being so disappointed in Violets are Blue and the recent Murder Club series, I was hoping at least that it would satisfy as the midless summer \\"beach book\\" that it was billed as. If you're looking for a book with a ridiculous plot, character development bested by most sixth graders' efforts, and a complete lack of believability and attention to detail, this is your book! Forget willing suspension of disbelief, this is just an incredibly sloppy effort from a writer who used to define the page-turner genre. Skip this one. Personally, I won't make the mistake of reading Patterson again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a prize for finishing this book","review":"I got the pleasure of kicking it around the room while yelling, (...)The characters are cartoons, the plot trite and contrived, the shocking wind-up so lame that General Hospital actually lifted the \\"best\\" parts of the final chapters. The sex reads like a gross-out jokes book, and the violence is not even interesting enough to be considered gratuitous.The only explanation I have for this miserable work is that somebody had a contractual obligation to fulfill and was feeling a little passive-aggressive.Skip reading it. Go straight to the kicking it around the room part."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an insult to any intelligent reader","review":"The book is extremely weak. It takes the reader through a plot of interesting characters with a somewhat believable story until the last several chapters. At this point it seems that a six year old was consulted to define the end of the book. It makes no sense and becomes extremely poor. I was so angry that someone would expect me to believe such rubish that I did not finish reading the book. I would not even recommend it as a free gift to anyone. I will never buy another book by this author. Back to Grisham!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I got this book from the library which is the only way to go if you want to waste your time. Silly plot, no character development, and not even a good beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach House","review":"I just preordered Patterson new book, so I have not totally given up on him. What a waste of my time and money \\"Beach House\\" was. I thought I was the only one that did not like it, until I read the reviews on this page. I'm so glad it wasn't just me who thought this book was awful. Do authors get lazy, or just need a room addition?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Wet","review":"This novel starts out promising with likeable characters and an intriguing plot. But the first clue that the authors (yes, plural, why does it take two people to churn out this stuff?) are taking a day at the beach instead of working hard at quality writing comes with a hurricane three months out of hurricane season. The story then degenerates into the improbable and from there to the implausible and finally to the incredulous. Nothing in the second half of this book could possibly ever happen in real life. If you like stories that resemble some aspect of realism, take your towel to another beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment!","review":"The plot was shallow, the characters not developed well, and the double spaced large type and empty pages convinced me that this was a case of fooling the reader into buying a real book. Very amateurish, not at all like other Patterson books. Do we get a refund for no customer satisfaction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson is delusional.","review":"I read on Patterson's website before this book was published that he was excited about the Beach House because of the exciting, groundbreaking courtroom action at the end. Trust me, nothing was exciting or groundbreaking about it. A good courtroom drama has quality characters and twists and turns. The only thing changing here is the setting. If Patterson would focus on writing good characters, the twists will come. I can't say I reccommend this book unless you have a few days to spare and 20 bucks to blow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This is the second best book I've read this year, second only to \\"Conquest of Paradise: an end-times nano-thriller\\", a book very similar to \\"Beach House\\" in its level of suspense. This is one of Patterson's best. I simply couldn't put it down. The level of suspense keeps you hanging onto each page from chapter to chapter. Intrigue lurks around every corner. Mystery, love, tragedy, deceit, mayhem and suspense drip from every page. You simply won't want to quit reading this one, and I guarantee you won't get bored. An excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach House","review":"What colossal TRIPE! I cannot believe that the author of \\"Along Came a Spider\\", \\"Kiss the Girls\\", and \\"Jack and Jill\\" is responsible for this waste of print. The characters are predictable, the plot immature and totally unbelieveable. But, then again he did write, \\"When the Wind Blows,\\" a poor attempt at the Dean Koontz style. \\"Beach House\\" is the pitiful result of trying to emmulate John Grisham's style except it has none of the characters, story, etc...Truly Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile writing and plot","review":"... effort by best-selling author, something I might expect from a teen-aged writer -- plot is ridiculous, dialogue is a joke.

Bad - waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy Read","review":"If you're looking for a fast-paced journey into the world of the rich and their East Hampton digs 'The Beach House' is for you.There is a reason this book is number one on the top-ten list.It's because it's fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I GIVE UP!","review":"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE LAST JAMES PATTERSON BOOK ON WHICH I WASTE MY MONEY!! WITH ONE EXCEPTION, HIS RECENT EFFORTS HAVE BECOME DULL, UNBELIEVABLE AND BORING.

NOW, WE DO THE SUFFERING...AND PAY FOR IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it.","review":"I almost bought this book when it first came out. Glad I didn't. Very disappointing from this author. Very badly written with no substance. Probably the worst book I have read in the past year."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the 50-cent table","review":"My favorite author has run out of steam! His co-author does not, repete, does not have the Paterson style. After sampling this \\"tandemly\\"-wriiten book, it becomes obvious that this is a time-waster. Even the editing is bad. I didn't feel guilty about not finishing it. It's headed for the community library's monthly book sale--fifty cent table."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed","review":"I've really enjoyed James Patterson's other books, esp. the Alex Cross series, so I was looking forward to cracking this one open. I am so disappointed. I made myself finish the book, even though I really didn't care what happened to the characters. The book is VERY choppy, the plot is a bit ridiculous, and the ending is... well, I expected better of Mr. Patterson. Maybe because it's jointly written it's not quite as good as his regular stuff. Hoping that the next one I read meets my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just Bad","review":"I won't bore anyone with a plot summary. I believe you can find that in the publisher's notes above. The setting of the story (the Hamptons) is very interesting. The characters of the story are intriguing and the character \`Maclin' in well written. The plot has promise but the book degenerates into predictable melodrama. The circumstances of the story move from being suspect to outlandish. Somewhere around chapter sixty-three, I started wondering if this was a screenplay for a soap opera.Save your time and money. There is a lot of fiction out there that is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your for a quick fix-easy read, this is for you....","review":"....if you are looking for a book with substance where you feel for the characters, any type of emotion is elicited, or you get so into it that you can't put it down...KEEP AWAY. The book starts out in the first person of the main characters brother and then switches from first to third person constantly. You feel no emotion toward the main characters and the writing is quite shallow. However, the last 50 pages (out of about 300) is relatively suspenseful and somewhat interesting. It almost seems as if Patterson knew the book was flat, so he added illicit sexual escapades to make a weak attempt to reel readers in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This one was truly a disappointment. Patterson & his co-author started out well enough and continued just fine until about halfway through. Then, it's as if the deadline was looming and he just had to come up with something to finish it up. It was just a little too \\"out there\\" for me. Just started \\"Judge and Jury\\". Hope this one is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quick Read","review":"I needed a book for a train trip and this fit the bill. I liked the way the small chapters kept me more motivated to read. The book is interesting and quirky. I never expected the \\"dramatic turn\\" of the ending.

Then nothing happens for 100 pages and the ending is totally ridiculous.

The large print and short chapters made it a very quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously not really written by Patterson","review":"I'm crazy about Patterson's books - can't wait until the next one comes out. But this one - I read about 25% of it and gave up. Ho hum, not worth finishing. It is very obviously Patterson letting another writer \\"do his thing\\" and use his name and fame. Didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense in the Hamptons","review":"I was reluctant to read a book co-authored. I feel a lot are doing this to get the secondary writer started. I was surprised.

The writing is immature and juvenile. The characters are poorly developed and incredibly shallow. The addition of the ever-present and always stupid local town cop does nothing to help this offering. I have long been a Patterson fan and can only suspect that this lightweight invention differs from his customary style because it is co-authored.In conclusion, if you never made it past the ninth grade you might find this book a challenging thriller. If, however, you have some appreciation of a truly fast-moving chill thrill, that is well written, AVOID THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Mr. Patterson! WHAT HAPPENED?!","review":"ABYSMAL! \\"Beach House\\" was a slow-moving, transparent book with precious little character development. The men of the Mullen family are unlikeable. Apparently one of them's been up to no good because he gets murdered. His brother and grandfather attempt to prove he wasn't a victim of accidental drowning.Of course, Brother Jack Mullen has been sleeping with Dana, scion of only THE wealthiest and most powerful family in East Hampton (the Mullens are lower-middle-class townies). See where this is going? Boredomville. Dana is a phony. Her parents are behind the murder. Bad rich people. Virtuous poor folk. Sickeningly predictable.Mr. Patterson, you write far better fiction when left to your own devices. I anxiously await your next Alex Cross novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach House - Not my favorite by a long shot","review":"I just never got into this book. I'm an avid fan of James Patterson's books... I've purchased so many at airports across the country it is almost comical.But this one never really drew my in like most others. There just wasn't enough depth to any of the characters and their relationships to each other were missing something. And the ending just did not make sense. I didn't feel there were enough clues to lead me to say \\"aha\\" at the end.Short story - I was disappointed. I won't quit reading... just disappointed in this yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not cheering","review":"The jacket of this novel promised I would be cheering at the end - but I wasn't. The concept here is that a young lawyer, frustrated by a justice system that has allowed his brother's killer to remain free, kidnaps the parties involved and televises a multi-day trial of his own in order to convict the killer in the court of public opinion.This is just ridiculous. The final \\"courtroom scenes\\" are hard to believe, and the notion that the authorities wouldn't be able to trace the source of the television signal over course of the trial is preposterous. It is impossible to believe that such a hair-brained idea could ever work and no reasonably intelligent young lawyer would think that it could.Of course, in Patterson's novel it does work (that's where the cheering comes in). Patterson has written some decent novels but this isn't one of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Midly entertaining","review":"Patterson's book The Beach House is a mildly entertaining read, which just about managed to hold my attention throughout. The characters are convincing and at first its interesting though I thought the ending was a big letdown which didn't do justice to Part One - it was highly inplausible. I only stumbled across it by accident - It sufficed as a timefiller but I wouldn't advise towards buying this book.Daniel O'Carroll (14)Cork, Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to James Patterson?!","review":"Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls, Cradle and All, some of James Patterson's first books (or least the first ones I read) were all excellent! I was hooked! The character development and believability of his story lines kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. The last few novels, however, have become more and more mundane and lack imagination. The Beach House will be the last book I buy or read. The characters are boring and contrived as is the plot. Actually I find it downright silly! Why is James Patterson writing so poorly these days? What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An endurance test","review":"I don't think I've ever had to suspend disbelief as much or as many times as I did while reading this book.

And it did, consistently!I went ahead and finished it anyway, hoping for something redeeming toward the end. I assure you that that 'something' never appeared.I work in a library and this book was in the discard pile so I took it home. Now I see why it was there in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning","review":"I enjoyed this novel. I like Patterson because his books are so fast-paced. He accomplishes this by writing short chapters that make the reader \\"read just a little bit more.\\"I must warn you that this book contains adult-orientated material. I consider myself to be a liberal kind of guy. However I wouldn't want my child, under the age of 18, to read this novel. It contains twisted sexual situations that many would find offensive. The X-rated parts though are brief and don't make up a large part of the book.If you can stomach such content, I recommend this fast-paced and fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I found this book to be a waste of time. It was predictable and very far-fetched. In his desire to create a happy ending for the book, the author allowed credibility to fly out the window. The dialogue was downright silly at times... No one really talks like this! Flowery language belongs in romance novels, not mystery books. When I was finished with this book, I felt a mix between bitter and relieved. Try something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach House","review":"Was very disappointed in this book. I have read all of James Patterson's books and look forward to his next one. I felt this book was very boring and slow moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach House Comic Book","review":"The best part of this story it its plot. That's being charitable since the fate of The Fixer is anticlimactic and nearly irrelevant to the story's conclusion. The last half of the story, while it has plenty of action, is right out of a Marvel comic book.I must conclude that this book was written on contract and the last part was done in a hurry to make a deadline. Patterson is a better author than this.All this said, the book isn't totally useless. It can serve as a bad literary example in nearly every aspect of modern storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Patterson fans only","review":"Some close friends of mine gave me very stong reviews of this book and encouraged me to read it. I finally got around to borrowing a copy from the library, and I was excited to get started. By the time I finished, though, I felt very disappointed in what I had expected to be a great book... at best, I'd say this book is AVERAGE.The plot was somewhat unbelievable and overly dramatic; reading it felt like a low-budget tv soap. The characters not very interesting, and the ending was downright stupid. I would go into more detail, but spoilers would negate any remote reason to spend time reading this book.For the Patterson fan--sure. But if you're just trying to kill time (i.e. reading for general entertainment purposes) I'd say pass this one up for something more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a show stopper","review":"I am admittedly not an avid (novel) reader. A book needs to \\"suck me in\\" within the first chapter, or its in danger of being tossed aside out of distraction with life, but I was stuck in an airport with this book and for a change, got beyond the first chapter as a result of lack of options. The writing was not stellar, and seemed to lack maturity. The read was quick, thankfully, but it didn't really do much for me. The characters were not particularly well developed and the story-line was average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"As a former Long Islander I loved reading about the places that I spent time.

Did I just waste three hours of my life reading that?","review":"I agree with the review about kicking the book around after I was finished. You never really care about even the main character, Jack; except for the fact that you felt sorry for him because his brother and subsequently another relative dies.I am literally thinking of pulling out my hair because I \\"had\\" to read the book for a book club I belong to. ARGH!! I'm going to pummel the guy who had us read this junk. I agree, it is very adolescent, and I was rather nauseated when they put the romance in.Someone earlier, mentioned that the events in this book could happen in real life. Very implausible.

I enjoyed all of Beth Saulnier \\"Alex Bernier\\" mystery books ... but See Isabelle Run was just not the best I've ever read. It seemed so fake and so predictable. I like it when I can't figure out who's done it ... with this book, I could figure it out all along. The plot and dialogue is reminiscent of a movie you might see on the Lifetime Network. Isabelle and Mac seemed exactly like the couple in the Alex Bernier books.Elizabeth Bloom should have stayed single in Ithaca! Getting married and moving to NYC are not boding well for her writing. Bring back Beth Saulnier and the Alex Bernier stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll like Isabelle","review":"I liked this girl Isabelle, and I was rooting for her all the way through this entertaining read. I liked her self-deprecating humor mixed with some determination and backbone. I enjoyed the premise of the book, however unrealistic (being dumped by her fiance leads to a pity job offer that goes bad, big-time). I was entertained by the picture of corporate America that emerges, a bit skewed, and I especially liked Isabelle's enjoyment of life (loved her choices of activities for her dates). As a whodunit, it's not too complex, and yet the story was interesting enough to keep me reading and trying to work out Isabelle's next move, and how she'd react to things.

Further the books deals in antiques that only the top .00001 percent of the population could actually buy. Nor is there anything about the business end of things, like how one becomes a top line dealer.Instead of focusing on real tips and experiences acquiring items that a serious (middle class) collector could hope to acquire, they focus on items that most millionaires would find expensive.Don't expect this book to have any relevancy to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book & History of the Keno Brothers.","review":"I highly recommend this book to both furniture collectors and all antique dealers.

His songs seem instantly familiar yet they occupy a pop music space we haven't yet entered. Bobby's voice is a major part of that space. To my ear, it hovers somewhere between the aforementioned Costello, Bruce Springsteen's and Bob Dylan's. It's a voice perfect for pop songs and Bobby knows how to use it beautifully to get the hurt across in gems about flat-chested girls, panties and love gone wrong.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the best follow up to read is \\"relationship Pain\\" by Ralph Schillace, Ph.D. \\"Relationship Pain\\" is an in-depth, clearly written consideration of romantic, family and workplace relationships. The author uses clear examples, case histories from his practice and understandable ideas.

So, if we learn how to love from what we see, these experiences would make my husband and I relationship retarded.I had high high hopes for this book(I love Dr Phil's show), but when I continued to read and answer questions I could not help to think when is this book going to get to something that is going to help me, or change the way I relate to others. It never came. I apparently answered all the fill in the blank questions wrong.

In fact, they depend on it. The problem is: the proverbial crack starts doing the thinking for these people.If you are into secular humanism, self-help, and basic atheist or agnostic, \\"I'll do it myself,\\" philosophy, you will love this book.Temporary fixes are not only [...], they can be infinitely more dangerous when unsound psychological devices built on modern culture dupe one into believing in one's actual happiness (with oneself) with one's significant other; when the reality is: the relationship or one's identity could not be corroding any faster.

You can't go wrong with this set of books to help any struggling couple to renew their relationship and bring them closer, and so they understand one another. It gives you skills to learn how to talk to each other with less defensive mannerisms and reactions, how to control the yelling that inevitably happens (with me anyway!) and the name calling issue! It teaches you how to treat one another with love and respect and to realize the other isn't your enemy, who you need to have your guard up with...they are the one you love and want to be loved by.

I didn't buy it then, but I kept thinking and went back later to purchase it. It is one of the best books I have ever invested in and have since recommended it to many people I have encountered. If you are willing to do the hard task of really looking at yourself and how you have impacted your relationships then this book can be an eye opener. It certainly was to me and was key in saving a marriage deeply in trouble. Following the book takes a lot of discipline and the ability to take a long hard look at yourself and your behavior; I did and didn't like what I saw. It did, however, help explain years of behavior patterns and helped me to break them and in essence find myself in the process. I highly recommend this book as one part to finding a healthier relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can do what it says if you let it....","review":"Dr. Phil's self-congratulatultory writing style aside, the actual nuts and bolts of this book are exceptionally insightful and helpful. It will force you into a phase of honest appraisal of you and your partner. It's not a \\"quick fix\\", nor should it be. It requires that you actually read it and do the exercises within to find it's reward. But personally, I think it may very well be one of the best self-help type of books out there. I also purchased the accompanying \\"Workbook\\" but think you can buy yourself a ruled notebook to the same effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I enjoyed doing all the quizzes in the book. I found them helpful in that I got to see my relationship for what it was. It also helped me see what I need to work on as a partner and as an individual. I gave it 5 stars only because I didn't get to see how the final exercises that actually involve your partner went. We broke up ( not married) before completing the book. Maybe that doesn't seem right, like isn't this book supposed to help you SAVE the relationship, but sometimes the best thing is to split up. This book helped reveal issues I was too afraid to address and thereby improved my relationship with MY self.

This one is centered around relationships and while he takes the subject serious, the frequent anecdotes are refreshing and even inspiring. Relationships can truly work. I really recommend this book...I'm sure everybody can get something valuable out of it. Another book that is also very helpful on the subject as it teaches that in order to have great relationships, and to love others we must first learn to treasure and love ourselves properly, is Dietmar Scherf's \\"I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression\\" also available at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read \\"Life Strategies\\" don't bother","review":"If you've already read \\"Life Strategies\\", you'll find this very heavy on repitition, not just in terms of general themes (e.g you have to insist that others respect you) but even the case studies and examples McGraw uses. It seems as if he took the core of \\"Life Strategies\\", added on one good additional chapter, and proceeded to publish. If you haven't read McGraw's other book, you'll certainly enjoy and benefit from either of the two. He's straightforward and certainly in your face the whole time. In both books, he could be more expansive on how you get things done, even if you know what you want to do. Using the previous example, it is one thing to say \\"insist that others respect you\\", but how you get insensitive folks to actually do so is more difficult, so more elaboration on the actual how to's would help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard work that pays off.","review":"Dr. Phil has a knack for getting right down to the important stuff.

I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps are wacky...we returned it!","review":"We were hoping that this seat would work for us as due to its moderate size, Consumer Reports recommendation (this is actually a more deluxe version than the one CR lists), Baby Bargains rating (B+), and great price. We also liked the easy recline for rear facing (although we did have to tinker with the installation to ensure that my 7 month old could sleep well without her head flopping) and cup/toy storage holders. BUT, the straps were twisting constantly, did not adjust uniformly (one shoulder strap would sometimes loosen more than the other), and the crotch strap, while adjustable, was already way too tight--no way that this seat would be able to grow with us (if only this strap was abit longer...); the harness closure was also difficult to open and close, or at least not as smooth as our Graco Snugride infant carrier. We returned it for the Britax Roundabout (at double the price..ouch!) but the ease of use is like night and day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Great Seat","review":"I am not sure what other people do, but I have to disagree with all the parents out there that feel this seat is a hassle. If you actually read the directions, it tells you how to adjust straps to fit your child. I have had this seat for my 9 month old daughter, she outgrew her infant seat at 6 months! It is currently rear facing still, and she has no problems falling asleep, even on short trips. The straps don't tangle on me like others complain of. If one side is tighter than the other, push on the release button and pull the side of strap out to make even with other side. Do not let reviews of parents who \\"can't figure out and read directions\\" sway you from making a great purchase at a great price, and a CR best buy. $200 Roundabout car seat, come on....you can spend the extra $100 on something else for your child to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad leg straps","review":"I bought this car seat after reading the Cosumer Reports findings that it was so safe. When I saw it it the store, I was pleased with how comfy it looked. But I didn't bother to check the location of the leg straps in the store. Once I got it home, I realized that the straps go over the baby's thighs, not his hips, so it digs into his legs. I can't imagine this is safe if there is an accident, plus it held his legs down making him very uncomfortable. I returned it for the Triumph - which seems to be working very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read all the reviews before buying this seat and thought that it would be impossible for the harness straps to not equally tighten on my child. What a disppointment to find out that it is very possible and happened every time my 8-month old was put in this seat. For a couple days, I did what another reviewer suggested and pulled the straps tight in the back before pulling on the strap between my child's legs. That worked fine, but how can I do that once I turn the seat to forward-facing? Or does the problem suddenly disappear once the seat faces forward? We decided to not take the chance. Instead, we did what other reviewers suggested - we took the seat back and bought the Roundabout. What a great product that is! Our son loves it! He cried when he was put in the Titan, but he hasn't complained at all about the Roundabout."},{"rating":"1","title":"KICKED IT TO THE CURB!!","review":"Like some parents I went into Babies R Us without do any research on car seats. I picked the car seat that was mid-priced and looked comfortable. My daughter who is 6 months old grew out of her infant car seat at 4 months. I had the same problems as some of the other parents. I could not get the straps to work for anything. I tried shifting the belts around like it suggested and found it nearly impossible. While I was trying to figure out the straps my daughter just screamed! The straps were either too tight or too loose. To me it wasn't worth it. I returned it and spent the money on a Britax Roundabout. I love the seat; it's really easy to use. I feel my daughter is safer now with the Roundabout because the straps fit nice and snug on both sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I bought this car seat for my daughter a month ago and I just returned it. At first I really liked it. It seemed really comfortable and roomy but the more and more I used it, I hated it! The straps gave me so many problems when I tightened it-the right side was always too tight around my daughter's shoulder and chest and I had to adjust them over and over each time I put her in it-very annoying! Also, I have to agree with the other parents that the straps lay weird around the hips. It seemed like my daughter was really squished around that area. I wouldn't get this car seat. The price is ideal but it really isn't that great. I just bought the newer model of the Graco Comfort Sport car seat and the ratings are really great on it. It got an A in everything on the consumer reports whereas the Evenflo Titan received a B in everything. I should have done more homework before I purchased the Evenflo Titan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to take it back...","review":"We bought this carseat for our second child after she outgrew the Graco infant seat at 6 months. She's been riding around in it for 3 months in the rear-facing position and, like other reviewers, we found it was nearly impossible to tighten once we put her in it. My husband finally figured out it was the angle she was positioned that did not allow for the strap to tighten. My daughter is very long so her shoulders are very high above where the shoulder straps loop through the seat. We resolved to tightening the straps by pulling it from the back. Anyway, after the straps easily twisted and we found that she just wasn't sitting comfortably in it, we decided to return it and bite the bullet and pay extra for the Britax Roundabout. My son is in the Britax Marathon which is really bulky when traveling, but once you have a Britax, it's hard to switch to anything else. It's unfortunate because I really liked the design of this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a pain to use daily","review":"Bought this seat, put baby in & adjusted the straps. Only one side tightened, and I had to reach under the seat to slide the strap over to tighten the other side. I figured I'd only have to do this once so long as I kept the straps in that same position. The next time I put him in the seat, one strap was very tight and the other very loose. I reached under again to even them out. This continued to happen every day or two. Returned it and bought the Britax. So far, I'm really liking it better as far as convenience goes. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"We bought this seat as a second car seat for around town. The reviews here convinced us that the more expensive seats are worth the money if you do a lot of car travelling. The installation on the Titan was very similar to our Graco infant seat base. Very easy! However, once the seat was installed (rear facing) and our daughter put in it, tightening the system was nonexistent. We couldn't get the strap to actually tighten the shoulder harness. I think it might be made to pull straight out, like with a forward facing seat, rather than the pulling up that you have to do with a rear facing seat. We tested it uninstalled and it worked fine. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work when installed. Anyways, much too difficult for a car seat, regardless of what CR says. Also, I did notice that the straps twisted very easily. We did end up returning it because we couldn't get the system tightened when installed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great;A bit to graphic about explosions though.","review":"\\" Steaming Through Smoke and Fire; True tales of Shipwreck and Disaster on the Great Lakes\\" is a good book' Though sometimes it makes me feel a bit disgusted when it tells about flying flesh, and sad when the Captain's pet terrier goes down with the ship.

We see her going to the library, reading all the books there. We see her hoping with her father that a big impressario will discover him and take them out of their poverty. We see her dreams shattered when she realizes she might have to leave school.Garner is not the only gem in this movie. A beautiful performance by Dorothy McGuire complements Garner's. James Dunn won an Oscar for his finely etched performance as Johnny Nolan whose dreams nearly destroy his family. There are also fine performances by Joan Blondell and Lloyd Nolan.

That allows the acting to shine--and the acting is amazing, supported by a terrific script from a series of newspaper articles that weren't written as a dramatic structure. The sparingness of the environments in the film highlights the stark situation this family is in, and the father and kids (and aunts) optimism provides strong contrast to Dorothy McGuire's BEST performance (and first film!). Her arc in the film is powerful, and is represented visually in a straightforward way that NEVER gets in the way of the story. The emotional release at the end is almost overwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT ON REGION 1 DVD BECAUSE. . .","review":"Like many who have taken the time to write about A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN I too would love to have this title available on DVD.

Yes, cooking in microwave ovens probably should be avoided especially by health compromised people but they are very much in use in Russia today- they were reinstated ten years before the copyright date. And I doubt that microwave ovens render meat protein useless. Also, Dr. Young seems to have too many proprietary interests which of course raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and, therefore, the validity of his dietary claims.I tried to confirm a few of his stated \\"facts\\" by trying them myself;I could not.

We were given teeth to bite things and lived for thousands of years by eating plants AND animals.

I have, in the face of repeated complaints about this approach, stopped recommending books which let you know from the outset that half science, half religion are part of the message.

If you aren't a vegan and/or like fruits, legumes, grains, meats, dairy...well you won't find anything but a starvation grazing plan.I respect people for their choices of being omnivores(w/ meat, fish, poultry, nuts, dairy w/e as protein source), vegetarians (ovo and/or lacto) or vegans, since it's their choice....but don't try to force it on me. To camouflage a book as a \\"balance your diet & reclaim your health\\" pH resource into a vegan diet, is nothing more than a desperate scam.

The author explains the reasoning behind his claims and has done extensive research on this subject.I have just been diagnosed with Lupus and the treatment options are limited. I have been following the program set out by the author for 6 weeks now am feeling the benefits. I have more energy, seldom need pain relief medication, sleep better and am getting my life back.

I have not fully read the book, went straight for the food lists and to the store. The ph diet is helping quite a bit. My husband, my grown kids are doing it with me. The theory behind this diet makes sense. The first week we all noticed the increase of energy from the food change. We've lost some weight, but for us it's most important to eat well for our health. Recently, I ate carbs and non-list items (acidy foods) which I would eat everyday, and I felt woozy, shaky and wanted to lay down! My husband had the same experience when he ate acidic foods as well. We will continue with the diet. I would have to read more on the book, and do the exercises outline.

If people today would open up their minds to the \\"natural\\" way, we wouldn't have a ratio of 1:3 for cancer or 50% of children would be healthy and not overweight, parents would start realizing all the pop, koolaid, cookies, chips, sugar and candy is only hurting the childs body with the number one disease in children Diabetes!

Instead of using his or any supplements though we have chosen to eat concentrated whole foods because we know the body recognizes and utilizes whole foods better than nonfoods which taken in large amounts become at their worst druglike and are fragmented at best.

OK!!The author's diet advice is based upon his claim that Louis Pasteur's germ theory is wrong and instead germs spontaneously appear based on what we eat - WOW!This book is a joke, based on junk science, superstitious belief (AMULETS!) and is a waste of time.

I think if it were an option I would have given it more like 3 1/2 stars. my favorites are definately:1) \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\"2) \\"It's Time To Dance (Because Boys Will Be Boys)3) \\"It's Better If You Do\\"4) \\"The Only Difference Between...\\"hope this helps someone :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of those albums that still hasn't gotten old","review":"How can someone write a review saying how \\"crappy\\" an album is with out backing up their opinion? This is one of those cds that when you first hear it, it sounds a little too much like the very annoying Fall Out Boy, but as you listen more and more, you notice huge differences, especially in lyrics. It really sucks when a band like Fall Out Boy has huge talent in everything except that the lyrics just whine and complain, thank God, Panic! fixed that problem for a truly indie, catchy, near perfect album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fever I want to sweat out.","review":"ohh myyy godd. now all mighty P!ATD followers. dont hate me for saying this, but this sounds all the same. the only difference is the synthesiser. i give ryan ross credit for the lyrics (wich are very provocative) and i give brendon M'd parents credit for making him so fine. the voice is good but it all has the same tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix","review":"Once you listen to P!ATD and then go back to other music, you realize just what a great mixture \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is.

P!ATD managed to put together a great CD with a wonderful mixture of different and addicting beats that will never leave you bored. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"I have been reading through these reviews and had to add in my views. First off, just so you all know, this was not another MTV ploy. This band was actually formed by the members and written by the members. No one else. No executive producer put together a bunch of people and called it a band or group.But this CD is great. I love how it is set up with \\"Introduction,\\" and, \\"Intermission.\\" It's different, we need that.I find every track amazing and thought filled. I say this is a must have CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great? great? this is great?","review":"Creativity can only do so much, kids. Sure its fun and catchy and new. But so were the beatles before Sgt peppers. But thats not why we remember the beatles. Thats not why their great. They are a GREAT band becuase they actually brought sophisticated songwriting to mainstream music in and after Sgt Peppers. This isnt sophisticated songwriting. nothing happens in these songs. They dont move or develop. no solos, riffs, or instrumentals of any kind. the music relies entirely on its catchy lyrics and singing. thats not greatness, thats barely listenableness"},{"rating":"2","title":"A <u>Fever</u> You Can't sweat ((out))","review":"I really think that they are really good band, and i think that their songs are pretty well written and i really enjoy listening to them. for those of you who think that this band is soo bad personally, i think you dont have that great of taste in music...therefore you dont understand good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh..","review":"Like the techno beats you kiddies?

Sure, some of their songs are catchy, but the only thing seperating them from every other run of the mill \\"emo\\" band is their rhythm section. The lyrics are awful, the synth is just plain annoying, the guitars are simple punk-pop fare, and they're so obviously latching on to the dance-punk craze it's not even funny. If your favorite bands are Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, by all means, buy this album. But if you want your bands to have a little more substance than style, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neo-Emo: The Dawn Of A New Age","review":"I thought Fall Out Boy was bad, but I have found something worse. I would also like to say that emo is dead and has been replaced by the worst kind of pop-rock.This is the perfect recipe for bad music and is basically a joke. This band is basically trying to use Fall Out Boy's strategy mainly to attract teenage girls without an attempt at good music.First of all, what is up with the song titles? I see no reason for a song to have a title more than 5 words, just another reason this band is a joke. Then, there are the extremely immature and gimmicky lyrics only having the point of being catchy and have no artistic value. Then these \\"musicians\\" dont even play their instruments that well and have no originality at all.These guy do know the perfect strategy for getting girls and making money (its obviously working), but they are a disgrace to music, as they shamelessly do not even make an attempt at good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"P!@THAD IS TEH SEXXXORZ LOL","review":"so, i just bought this cd, along with my unrated awesome edition of napoleon dynamite, VOTE 4 PEDRO, and now i'm totally hip and all the make-up drenched girls who think they're Joan Jett, but in actuallity have no clue who Joan Jett is, so let's say, who think Karen O (OH MAN THE YEAH YEAH YEAHS ROCK SO HARD, THEY'RE SO ORIGINAL AND GROUNDBREAKING!) is a god, and guys, think i'm awesome.oh man, i can't wait for someone to make a chuck norris joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"this band is as punk rock as a pink dress stay away at all costs!","review":"its been said so many times on here that this is just a boyband posing (VERY BADLY) as a punk rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother with this album.","review":"This album is terrible.

This band is far from legendary, and they only have one album out! The music is just rehashed from already rehashed pop-punk and just tries to look unique with their lengthy song titles concepts taken from real screamo bands like City of Caterpillar, An Albatross, The Number 12 Looks Like You, etc. Don't expect this band to be around much longer. We seriously didn't need another copy of \\"Under The Cork Tree\\".If they do make another album, expect it to be an exact replica of this album. Usually, I don't care much if a band sounds similar to one another, but if it's trendy pop-punk or radio rock which I already hate, it needs to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the good music!","review":"This band really sucks, after hearing fall out boy i was like man can music get any worse, then panic came out and now i just dont know what to do. if i could give this negative stars i would, what has happened to the good music, like the smashing pumpkins, nirvana, pearl jam, led zeppelin, weezer, pink floyd, rush, the list goes on. This is a really bad album, i listened to it once and i sold it right away, so dont make the same mistake i did and go buy it, listen to real music. i know i sound harsh to all you panic fans out there but seriously, come on!!! panic at the disco, what is that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"blown away","review":"their like nothing ive even heard before the beats are original and the sound superb i listen to this album over and over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"I saw this band on TRL (sad to say) and their video premiered on the show and I loved the song and the video. I found out that Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy signed them so I assumed they would be a cool band. I bought their CD the same week I saw them on TRL and I love it. I put it on every night when I am on the Treadmill. It just makes you want to dance and is very unique. I am so happy with my purchase and I hope to see more of this bands work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"P!ATD","review":"While browsing through underground music I came across this band. Panic! at the disco. I gave them a chance. Listening to the vocals I thought they sounded like fall out boy, with catchier beats that just make you want to dance. I went out and bought the album, and of course fell in love with it. There is not a single bad thing I can say about this band. There wasn't a song I didn't like, or wasn't stuck in my head for the next week. Buy this album! You wont be disappointed with their great beats and amazing vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Fall Out Boy!!","review":"When I first heard one of their songs I really thought it was Fall Out Boy but then I was told otherwise. It didn't take me long, however, to simply fall in love with this cd. They are very straight foward with their lyrics and I absolutly love that I can dance to the songs. I have found myself singing number seven over and over again. Everything about the cd is so good regardless of the fact that it's kinda of creepy how much the lead singer sounds like fall out boy. I completely recommend this Panic! at the disco to anyone who loves to dance and is ready for some in your face lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, humourous and self-aware - popular music at it's best.","review":"This has to be one of my favourite albums of recent years.These guys have taken a lot of unfair criticism for their style but they are very smart about what they do - they know what is popular while still retaining their own distinct sound.I love that synthesizers are making a come back. The synthesis of rock and electronica is done perfectly - I just wish they had kept their demos for the album too. They are more fun than the album versions are are more electronically influenced.Perhaps I'm biased because I am primarily a fan of electronic music, but I really do think these guys have created the perfect blend. They don't overdo the electronic elements so people who are not too keen on that kind of sound won't have to hear it for long.Again, brilliant album. We can only hope the sophomore effort exceeds their debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"I write sins not tragedies is a masterpiece","review":"When I first heard this album, I thought, \\"what the heck is that\\". I'm a big Radiohead fan so this was definitely not my type of music but after hearing the above titled song over and over again on MTV, I bought the CD. Now it's a fixture in my boombox. It's definitely not Disco music as you might think by the title. It has a unique sound in every single song. Some of the instrumentals just blow you away (song 11) and I just hope we begin to see more music from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out","review":"Panic! At The Disco is a relatively new punk-rock/indie band that realeased their album last Setember. The CD has catchy tunes that not everyone will like, because everyone has different tastes in music. The lead singer Brendon Urie, I admit, does has a similar voice to Fallout Boy's Patrick Stump. The difference is that Brendon has a better range of vocals. Say what you want about Panic! At The Disco, but I think this album was pretty good. Better then other debut albums from select main stream (as of now) artists I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? A New Fall Out Boy CD?!?!?!","review":"Sorry to say this but when I first heard a song from this album the first words out of my mouth to my friend was \\"Did Fall Out Boy come out with another new cd?\\" because Panic! At The Disco sounds exactly like them. I've done research and asked a few other people who've never heard of either band before to listen to a track from each without telling them they were two different bands and every single one said that they were the same band. So there you have it kids... despite your attempts at trying to cover for this bands lack of origionality they get the lowest rank I can give them for being a FOB copycat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Such A Sin","review":"There's a certain bourgeois charm these teenagers adhere to, as if they know the world is their oyster if they play coy enough - but they really don't care.

Perhaps, this caught me on a good day, but it's not as insulting as it could have been and a lot more fun than the new one from that other Las Vegas \`Vegas' act, The Killers. My grade: B-"},{"rating":"1","title":"FOB rip off much???","review":"I enjoyed about 4 songs on this album...the rest sounds IDENTICAL to fall out boy. When i put the album in my stero I could have SWORN I was listening to FOB. I must admit a few of their songs that are very original I do enjoy. After looking at the book though The lead singer and the Lead Guitar man have so many other instruments under their belt I can see this band being so much BIGGER and BETTER if they run as far away as possible from Peter Wentz. Too much talent to be run by a man who wants a carbon copy band."},{"rating":"1","title":"pshh","review":"its hard to find a more cliche poppy rock band out there right now.

One of the CD's I grabbed was \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\". I'd heard some good things about Panic! At The Disco and I was completely ready to like this album; until I listened to it. What I heard didn't impress me. These guys are basically a pop-punk/emo fusion with a dance beat. Someone else who posted a review here mentioned their use of instruments that don't appear in the genre often, and that is true... but I somehow suspect that has more to do with the producer than the band. The last song on the album was the most interesting one, but it almost reminded me of \\"Mr. Bungle\\"-lite; genre changing just for the sake of it. From the looks of the comments here I'm pretty well outside the target demographic for this album, so that might explain my dislike of it.

The Band is a group of Guys in their late teens (Brenden Urie, Ryan Ross,Jon Walker/Brent Wilson, and Spencer Smith), who act themselves. The lyrics are full of truth, laughs, and well Big Words (seriously what other band uses a word longer than 7 letters in their songs?) I Bought this because of the song The only Difference and found out soon after that The Only Difference is only a tidbit of their orignality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music that makes my mouth drop (in the bad way)","review":"I am really in favor of experimental vocals, new instruments, and timing change-ups... but there are those who accomplish such variations gracefully and innovatively, and then there's Panic!.

Maybe the beats are catchy... and maybe there is some decent instrumentation - but holy jesus does that voice make me want kick my radio in while driving. This stuff is really meant for kids 13 and below, so I don't expect too much. But when you have two friends in their mid-20's giving this album some credit, I had to check it out.

It's absolutely amazing.To start, I'm afraid I have to say that Panic! At The Disco is a bit like Fall Out Boy. But only a little. Pete Wentz would hardly use as many cusses as this group, and never starts off a song with \\"the poor groomsbride is a whore\\". Both are equally talented groups.I Constantly thank God for Esteban, I Write Sins Not Tragedies, Intermission, Camisado, and Lying is the Most Fun..are my favorites on the CD.

Don't consider this a one. After those years of hatred towards them, I realized their talent. Probably because they were so mainstream at the time they just bugged me. I won't take back that the main reason they are famous is because they are a bunch of pretty boys. I also don't take back saying that the reason they are famous is because of Fall Out Boy, because it is. They got the easiest way into show-biz. However, they do have talent. Their instrumental line-ups in their songs is very interesting. And yes, they are theatrical. The singer's voice still bugs me, but it's alllllll good.

At the Disco is a refreshingly different band in a day full of copycat rubbish. While they do sound *familiar* to some other acts out, there is one thing that separates them from the rest - dance beats. \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is an album of pure dance/rock energy belted out by a bunch of guys who are still too young to even drink.A definite buy for fans of Fall Out Boy, Motion City Soundtrack, and the like simply because it offers something that is really unique to the whole emo/pop/rock scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"P!ATD","review":"So; even though they where signed without ever playing a show, Panic! At The Disco sound more rounded, experienced, and muture then bands that have played together for years.

They don't really sound like any other artist which is good, very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live! At the Disco...","review":"I was at a Fall out Boy show the day this album came out, and Panic happened to be opening. They were so amazing live that I ran to the lobby to buy their cd. Though Brendon's vocals have been compared to Patrick Stump's, there is certainly a distinct difference, and live, it is even more noticeable. Urie uses raw power behind his vocals--he didn't even really need the microphone.The album itself is well-crafted and a slight variation on the usual pop-punk/ emo genre. Ryan Ross' lyrics are clever and often, a little unbalanced, the hooks are like heroin, addictive to a fault, and the entire experience really makes you want to dance.I think that we can expect terrific things from Panic! At The Disco, despite the inevitable crtical fallout (pun intended) they are receiving.An honest and true effort, should leave you smiling and tapping your toes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"It seems to work well after two weeks.

We argue and we don't speak for a while; but we're forgiving and are always friends because we love each other. We're closer to each other than we are to family members. These friends are who we are or were. Each Friends episode is funny no matter how many times I watch it. I love these characters.

How were we to know the names of the solo dancers??This set of tapes is definitely not worth the purchase price of $100. In fact, it's not worth $50.

When I get stuck, I like to go to a reference and read about a topic and then hopefully see an example. Then I apply what was shown to my project.This book is very awkward for trying to learn this way mainly because the examples are way too complicated for demonstrating simple operations. I really think to get the most from this book you need to start at the beginning and work your way through - like you would do in a classroom setting - I'm guessing this is what the book might be written for and it might me a fine book in that setting.My interest was to use the book as a reference to quickly learn solutions to specific problems I encounter while working on my own projects.

This is a very well-researched, thoughtfully written biography, by an author who was not only a good historian but also a good writer. Robert E. Lee's whole life is laid before us in very good order, and it is interesting to read about Lee's life during the years other than 1861-1865.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because Freeman does not glorify Lee, although it is evident that he has a high opinion of Lee. However, Freeman does not disappoint his readers by dwelling on Lee's weak points. He actually does point out his faults, but he does it objectively, and fairly, instead of pouncing on Lee and tearing him apart.This is the perfect biography of Robert E. Lee to buy if you want to know just why Lee is such a great figure in American history. It is fair, thorough, and very well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abridgement good but is nearly all military details","review":"This adridgement of Freeman's four-volume biography is certainly a popular necessity - it opens the work up to a much broader audience that would find the original too intimidating an investment of time or money. Freeman's elegant, descriptive prose is preserved and has aged remarkably well.The chief failing of this abridgement is it's imbalance in focus. It has been reduced to a study of Lee's generalship rather than a true biography. Fully three-fourths of the book is a thorough, tactical description of his four years of battle in the Civil War, with the other 59 years of his life serving as mere bookends. While these military details are fascinating and are certainly required reading for students of the conflict, the end result leaves one feeling rather at a loss for who Lee was as a husband, father, and citizen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagiography at its worst","review":"I got through the first three volumes but it was hard to take. Freeman is not at all objective. According to Freeman, the South lost, rather than the Union won. When Lee lost it was not because the Union defeated him but because Lee had a bad day, his lieutenants blundered. While Lee won many battles because of the incompetence of his Union opponents, Freeman fails to recognize the bravery of Union soldiers. Grant gets denigrated at the expense of Lee. Sheridan and Sherman are dismissed and Meade gets lost in the battle of Gettysburg; he didn't win; Lee lost because of Stuart's disappearance, problems with Longstreet, etc. This gets quite tiresome. No doubt Lee was a great general; he was not God and he was bested by Grant.Freeman fails to give credit where due. After three volumes, I gave it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fautz","review":"Its a pleasure to read it, but I am not content with paperbackbooks.

All along I had been tugging them to come loose from the shoulders (like the Graco infant seat). I re-read the manual, but it's just poorly written.All in all, I do LOVE the seat and so does my son. It fits well in my 2003 Ford Explorer with one exception - the latch strap sort of blocks the knob/lever on one side.Otherwise, I'd recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Car Seat","review":"I have had this car seat for about a week and love it.

She seems to be really comfortable and sits in it like it's a Lazy Chair. I love the knob and lever system for tightening/loosening the straps. It's so easy. It's also really easy to adjust the height of the straps. No problems here I love this car seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"Unfortunatley after hearing such wonderful things about this seat, I have to disagree! My husband and I truly came to hate it and ended up returning it for the Britax Marathon. The #1 reason we bought it was for safety and seeing that it was rated in the top 3, but was cheaper than many of the other top rated seats, we logically went for the Evenflo. However, the crank was always stuck and we had to squeeze our son's arms through the loops to get him out because it NEVER released properly! Also, his head always tilted down when he slept, not to mention how bulky & heavy it is.We like the Britax because of many reasons, so if you can, I would splurge for the Britax right off the bat! It's sooooooooooo much easier to use, plus the fabric is stain resistant and easily removable. The Evenflo fabric is nearly impossible to remove if you need to wash it.

Because we use a Fischer Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, it's a little snugger than a regular high chair, and the bottom of the bib impeded his movements somewhat. He also didn't like how the bib attached to his neck; he was really bothered by it. We were really disappointed because we thought it was so cute and were excited by all the good reviews.

Once I went away for a week and had to pack twenty bibs, and then they were disgusting by the end. I realized I needed something like this. I haven't been disappointed.

I purchased this when we first started the rice cereal, my daughter is now 2 and we still use daily. She LOVES soup, and the pocket catches all the broth that dribbles down her chin. I've now purchased one for all my neices and nephews as well, and my sisters love them too!!!! I also love that it's dishwasher safe, and for just a small mess, I just wipe it with a baby wipe. I HIGHLY recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that it's not flimsy but doesn't always work well with a high chair table","review":"My son is only 10 months old. I think he'll like this more when he's older (when he's taller so it doesn't crowd him in his high chair. What I do like is that it catches liquids like water and pureed food well since it's not a flimsy cloth bib. It's also easy to put on, although my little one does sometimes like to chew on the bib right beneath his mouth.Pros: catches food well including liquids because it's not flimsy and it's easy to cleanCons: it's hard silicone so it doesn't fit well on a high chair if your baby isn't tall enough to clear the tray.If you're looking for other feeding items I recommend, visit my website, AllMomsArePerfect. In the post about baby registry items from 3-9 months I talk about some great things my little one loved when it came to feeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"This bib rocks","review":"This thing works exactly as advertised. You do have to make sure you lift your kid's chin and get this thing kind of snug--otherwise, it's too loose and gives little ones the opportunity to chew on it. If they can chew on it, it's too loose. When snug, it's perfect--not a drop on baby. It washes up easily right after by hand and I towel dry it (I don't think I would want to put this in the dishwasher or leave it dirty for a while). It cleans so easily by hand it only takes a few seconds anyway. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy to clean","review":"Easy to clean, catches the mess. Won't be big enough to cover the entire front of a toddler, if your toddler is a messy eater. Our son can pull it off but as long as he's occupied with food, he will leave the bib in place. Be careful not to pinch the skin around your baby's neck when putting it on as it can happen because its rubber. It can also pull hair too."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, but my kids hate wearing it","review":"I love the *idea* of this--a wipeable, washable bib that catches the crumbs and big chunks of food instead of letting them get all over the child and the highchair. But both my children have hated this and refused to wear it. The stiffer plastic is a lot less comfortable than a regular cloth bib. So it stays in the drawer except when we're completely out of regular bibs. The cloth ones are stained and gross-looking, but at least my kids don't scream about wearing them and yank them off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design and NOT \\"soft\\"!","review":"There's nothing soft about this bib. I mean, sure, you can bend it but it's still quite hard and uncomfortable for baby to wear. The design is seriously flawed. My 10 month old pulled it off with one hand, hated the feeling of the stiff-feeling plastic coming between him and his food. I honestly don't blame him. The design might have worked a little better if it were longer, but the \\"food catch\\" part gets in the way of his arms... how annoying! He can't even reach for his food without bumping the bib around! I am a Baby Bjorn fan, they make great products, so this is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit my son's neck!","review":"I purchased this bib after seeing my nephew with it. He wasn't able to put it into his mouth like soft bibs. However when I received it the bib wouldn't fit around my son's neck comfortably. The string of balls that's suppose to wrap around and clip into 1 side wasn't long enough. I don't understand how this is possible when my son is only 7 months and is lean and tall...not chubby. I wish they made this bib in different sizes since it's wonderful in theory but just didn't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I used this bib from the beginning","review":"This is the best bib that catches all. I got it after getting tired of cleaning up spills where other bibs have failed. I find the soft bibs with pockets useless in catching food/drink. I wish I knew about this one from the beginning. It's a must have for a parent of a baby/toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bib!","review":"This is the perfect bib for a toddler.

We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"2 problems with this bib. 1) It only covers a small area (even on a 12 month old). 2) The biggest problem - my daughters hair gets stuck around the \\"pearl\\" strand that clips into the holder piece to keep the bib on. She does not have a lot of hair. I bought 3 of these and will donate the 2 unused ones. I really prefer Bumpkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"My children despise this bib","review":"I thought that as they grew longer in the torso, it might work better for them but both still refuse to wear it. The plastic closure is quite uncomfortable for them. I do like that it's easily washable and catches food so nicely but I had to give up on trying to use it for my two. In fact, I think I am officially inspired to freecycle their Bjorn bibs, considering how hated they are. Amazon reviewers generally steer me right but in this time for mine, it was a fail. Ah well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy but not functional","review":"My daughter hates these bibs , they appear uncomfortable even at 17month. It hits the tray of her booster seat and pushes up against her neck. These are also by no means SOFT !!! They are hard, very hard and do not roll up which make them annoying to travel with. All is true about the easy clean, stain free, dishwasher safe, which is what I wanted but overall I wouldn't buy these again or recommend them to anyone. I have loved baby Bjorn products in these past but these don't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for older infants","review":"My 9 month old is terrified of this.

I purchased this when he was four months old. It fit then but was very uncomfortable looking. I tried it the other day again since he is starting to feed himself now and like the idea of being able to just wash it in the sink. He is now 9 months old and it does not fit at all. it would not fasten and he would not leave it on. I love the concept and if he was not so chunky it would probably be a great product. My son is 23.6 pounds at 9 months to give you an idea of his size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and cleaning","review":"I recommend this bib for everyone. It is very practical and easy to clean. Your baby will love the color, no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Invention Ever? Yes!","review":"We have tons of those plastic covered bibs and they always get ruined when we try to clean them. Then we found this thing and holy crap is it awesome. We've actually thrown away all the plastic one's and just use this. It catches all his food droppings, his water spillage, and it is ridiculously easy to clean. If you have a kid that eats you need this right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is too small for our 11 month old","review":"It seems too stiff and somewhat small. My daughter immediately pulled the bib off when I tried it on for size. The latch/neck thing does not stay secure on a wiggly baby. We only tried it on and did not use it. Just does not work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the design concept","review":"I liked the design concept of this bib and bought 3 of them but.... I have four grandchildren I have tried this on and not one of them will wear it! What a shame because it cleans up so great. The rigid design is too easy for them to lift up and protest until I take it off. We are better off with fabric bibs with sleeves which they think are just part of their clothing and they don't protest them anymore than they would a shirt. This bib is just too obvious to them and with 20 grandchildren I have found that not one of them appreciates a bib as much as I do! Great idea though."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 7 month old can take it off!","review":"I was very excited about receiving this item. I love the color, the material and the easy it's to clean. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks using it, my 7 month old baby was able to pull it off easily and that was the end of it. I haven't been able to use it ever since. Also, one day I was feeding her carrots and the white part got stained even though I washed it right away. I'm back to the bibs with bottoms. I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bib!","review":"We got this bib for our 7 month old shortly after she started eating baby foods. We love it. It catches literally everything and keeps her outfits clean. The thing that I like best is how easy it is to clean. You can just wash it off in the sink, wipe it dry and you are ready for the next feeding. I highly recommend this product. We have it in pink, green, and yellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never buy another bib","review":"This bib is the best one I've found. It's worth every penny I paid for it. It catches absolutely everything, and a lot of it! I haven't tried other molded bibs, but at this point I will never have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Bib","review":"Love this bib. It catches EVERYTHING- solid or liquid or somewhere in between (baby can also reach into the lip and pull back out whatever just fell in if he or she so desires). Very easy to clean- rinse out, wipe out or toss in the dishwasher- no nooks or crannies to worry about. Not too wide in the shoulder area so it fits the smaller-than-average baby along with the larger-than-average baby. The adjustable neck closure is a wonderful and unique feature that I have not found in any other bib. Only suggestion for improvement (and only reason for not giving it 5 stars)- it could be just a little more flexible for easier transport in the diaper bag and for easier fit when using highchairs with higher trays- although both are still totally doable as is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"This bib is not worth the money. My girls take it off immediately. It's very stiff around their necks and it doesn't fit with a high chair tray. I purchased it because of the great reviews, but I can't imagine how it works for so many people - we really dislike this. Glad I only purchased one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Review, Reply to Person Concerned about Plastic Content","review":"To the mom concerned about the plastic content in these bibs: I contacted BabySwede to ask about this, and here's the (very prompt!) reply I got:Thank you for contacting BabySwede.

After purchasing many cloth bibs covered in plastic with velco closures, finally stumbled upon this awesome product. Super easy to clean and catches plenty of messes. Will definitely be recommending to my Mommy Group friends. Must have product for feeding time. Don't waste your money on nasty, mildewy plastic-covered cloth bibs. ***Only complaint is that LO figured how to can pull it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for self-feeding toddlers","review":"This bib was a little too big for my infant when we first purchased it, but beyond his first birthday, it's our favorite bib. It catches everything his little hands drops, washes up easily and even goes in the dishwasher. Must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this bib","review":"I purchased 2 of these bibs and really wanted to like them, but ending up returning them and keeping the Bibbity bibs instead. The pocket on this bib is fantastic, and catches most of the dropped food. However, I ended up returning these bibs because as other reviewers stated, the neck is too rough. The material is a very hard plastic, which is fine for the bib, but not for the enclosure around the neck. My son didn't seem to mind this bib around his neck, but I chose the softer material of the Bibbity bib instead. This bib did stay in place around my son's neck, but when he pulled on the bib, I thought he was going to get a mark on his neck from the hard plastic. This is an ok bib that could be great if the neck enclosure was changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby won't wear","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old granddaughter, and my son said she won't wear it!! They said it was hard plastic! So, I bought three Bumpkins bibs, and she wears them everyday!! No problems. So, will stick with the Bumpkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly Toxic Plastic!!!","review":"I have been using these for almost 2 years now (although after about a year we had to replace them, but that was to be expected with all the wear and tear of multiple meals a day for months on end). I actually LOVE this product.However, there has been a lot of information about the toxicity of plastic products recently. Supposedly plastics with the codes 1, 2, 4, or 5 are safe. The rest are supposedly not good. These bibs carry the code 7. So I threw them all out :( Better safe than sorry. And I feel sick that my child has been wearing these for almost 2 years, and often right next to her skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made out of Plastic #7, the worst!","review":"First, this bib is made out of one of the most dangerous plastics you can buy (#7). I didn't realize this until after I purchased it.My daughter couldn't stand this big because it always got stuck to her hair in the back where it snaps on. I would not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bib, worth the money","review":"These bibs work really well. They catch more food than the pocket bibs I have and clean easier. I bought two, but probably could've gotten by with just one. The only drawback is that sometimes my 10-month old son realizes he has it on and gets annoyed by it, which distracts him from eating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it","review":"As a mother of twins, I do too much laundry as it is. I cannot imagine my one year olds feeding themselves without it. It saves food from landing in their laps and then you just rinse it off in the sink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bib EVER!","review":"Literally the best bib ever. It catches all the food your toddler misses their mouth with...even has a little trough for those spills when drinking from a cup. Cleans easily with a wet napkin or wet wipe. No more moldy smell of the cheaper competition. We buy these for all our friends with toddlers because they are so awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby yanks it right off","review":"Baby is able to tug straight down on this bib and it comes right off. Super frustrating! In search of the other plastic bib that has a more locking-like closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for strong babies","review":"My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds. I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I was really excited about this bib, but it has been a giant FAIL. First, my daughter, who is 18 months, can easily pull it off. The plastic strap that holds it on was secure at first, but became quickly misshapen and now is not secure at all. A gentle tug unfastens the bib. It stays on my daughter for about 30 seconds, at best. Second, the large cup-catch area at the bottom is so wide and inflexible that my daughter can't lean forward at the table. It's like she has a plastic wedge between her and the table. This infuriates her (understandably so) and then she just rips the bib off. What's good about the bib is that it's extremely easy to clean. If it stayed on, I suppose it would also catch a lot of food. But due to its design flaws, it's unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely perfect!","review":"I scoured the stores for a bib that would keep my 1-1/2 year old's clothes clean along with the floor beneath him. I fed him a crumbly scone this morning and, I kid you not, not one crumb fell on the floor or in his chair. The bib had about a 1/2\\" layer of crumbs in it though! Perfection at it's finest! It's not big and bulky like others I have seen, the clasp is durable and quick, it cleans up with a swipe, and if I need a bit more protection for messy foods like spaghetti, I just combine this with theBABYBJ?RN Eat & Play Smockand voila, my son could be wearing a tuxedo and he would stay clean. Thanks again BabyBjorn for a well thought out, beautifully designed product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't imaging using anything else","review":"This bib works perfectly for my 6-month old, who's just getting used to having solids put in his mouth. It rinses off in two seconds and catches everything. I can't imagine using a fabric bib, or one without a nice, open pocket like this one. Baby would have half his dinner in his lap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wearable For Baby (great otherwise)","review":"Both my girls complained that this bib hurt them. They have tried numerous other types and brands of bibs before, and this is the only one they said hurt. Both of them refused to wear this bib. Neither the fastening strap that goes around the neck or the plastic bib material are soft. The fastening strap around their neck especially bothers them. The stiff bottom part of the bib pushes into the high chair tray and makes my daughters' uncomfortable.The bib is a breeze to clean and the pocket is by far the very best of any bib for catching and holding fallen food or spills. The colors are attractive and the material durable.I hope Bjorn can find a way to redesign this bib so that it is actually soft and comfortable (wearable), while maintaining its excellent function."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kids dream toy","review":"This version of Mr. Freeze is the best that has ever been made.

Mr. Freeze's body is only a robot and his head moves about on it's own on robotic spider legs!?! What kid wouldn't love that.

This is an audiobook version of someone reading the book Jazz 101 BUT THERE IS NO MUSIC INCLUDED. He references many artists and albums and even specific tracks and recommends that you go find the music as a supplement to what he is describing in the book. The book itself is wonderful and very succinct and easy-to-follow for a newcomer to jazz but I cannot get over the disappointment of having an audiobook about jazz that does not have any music on it.

James Elroy did it really well in White Jazz and LA Confidential, and the effect much more of a tour de force.Also, it seems strange that no one has picked up on the inconsistencies in the book. The sheriff fought in WWII? Moss fought in Vietnam but is currently 36 years-old? That would make sense if the book were set in the 1980s, but then the character Wells apparently carries a mobile phone. An elevator has computer-generated random codes to make it operate. In addition, Moss can't buy a gun because he lacks identification documents, but he is able to purchase a used truck. Hmmm.

Books like No Country for Old Men make me wish I could write.

I guess they ran out of money so they could not produce an ending ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"About as fast paced as a retard with a rock in his shoe","review":"The narrative style was addled with redundancies, which made the story tedious to read. And the way the action was described sounded more like reading it from a police report. I did however appreciate the theme and subject matter, especially being that male readers are sincerely neglected by contemporary literature. At least it wasn't anything similar to the rest of the garbage that pollutes the books shelves these days, something like a rehashed court room thriller plot, or some derivative theme about the zany misadventures of bisexual dating in Metro-America."},{"rating":"1","title":"LITERARY NEED NOT EQUAL DISSATISFYING","review":"Literary novels are rarely fun to read and popular novels are rarely well crafted. This one errs on both sides of the fence. I much preferred Sisters of Glass to this one.

If the review had zero stars, it would be more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book which was advertised as new, but which contained underlinings from a previous owner","review":"Amazon should be careful about offering items which are declared to be \\"new.\\" This book obviously had an earlier owner; otherwise, underlinings would not have been evident in the text. Not a happy camper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read - by far","review":"This book is worthless. I have read a wide variety of books over several decades. This is truly the worst book I ever read.It may be an accurate depiction of drug-related violence, but the book has absolutely no purpose. It is just senseless violence.The book was so bad I actually wish I could forget I read it. It made me want to stop reading.If you want to experience the grim reality of life, go find some road kill and stare at it for several hours; you will be better off than if you read No Country for Old Men, I promise.I honestly feel sorry for Cormac McCarthy, but I feel more sorry for anyone who reads this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I *wanted* to like this book.","review":"While McCarthy is a talented writer, I found \\"No Country for Old Men\\" to be a pointless rambling of carnage with a large side-order of belly-aching about the ills of the world and a perplexingly disconnected ending. Other than giving the reader a huge dose of blood, sadism and sermonizing, I really didn't see the point of the book. For those who like some kind of plot and resolution to their stories, you might want to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"is there anything one can learn from a novel?","review":"is there anything one can learn from a novel? The answer is perhaps not always a straight forward \\"no\\" but in the case of 'no country for old men' it definitely is. The ultimate impact of this book on reader is pessimism and the feeling of being cheated by a pulp-fiction disguised as \\"literature\\". I think it is no more than a Quentin Tarantino type disturbance.It contains an extremely violent (almost disgusting) pursuit story combined with very odd, very conservative and ultimately boring family-values philosophy. It seems that for the author the inner thoughts like: I took a war decoration which I don't deserve , or , 'I am so lucky because I am married with my wife' reflects the highest level of sophistication one can possibly reach at the end of her/his life.There is a deeper world than this !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion Reigns","review":"A friend of mine and I have been debating this book for awhile. He called it a modern day classic western (an oxymoran, but hey)while I was just confused. I seemed to have missed some major chunks of plot. Like the ones that connect the story into something cogent. Or, maybe I missed an intricate one-liner hidden amoungst the terse prose that would have explained everything. I know there's a couple of bad guys and there are a couple of good guys, and the bad guys are killing the good guys and the other bad guys over some heroin money found by one of the good guys. Some of good guys die early on in the book and then you're left to root for an aging sheriff who ruminates without much advancement of the plot. Or did I miss the point of that also? I've never been the biggest Cormac McCarthy fan, and now I know why. Read it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"I thought I had discovered a life long author for myself after reading \\"All The Pretty Horses,\\" but then came disappointment with the other titles in his border trilogy. I looked forward to \\"No Country...\\" after reading generally positive reviews, including that this book was more \\"accessible\\" than previous works. Well, accessible it was in terms of the lack of subtleties, but a very off-putting story filled with violence and unsympathetic characters. I'm afraid Mr. McCarthy has had it in this reading room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutton Dressed As Lamb","review":"This was the first of this author's books I've ever read. I bought the hype and got the book. I know nothing about this author but from this book it appears to me he is not from Texas. Not even Texans act so Texan. Which is saying alot.I think John D. McDonald and Jim Thompson and others of their ilk do a vastly superior job of examining what i assume Comac was exploring. I thought the characters simplistic and foolish and i felt no connection or curiosity about any of them. It seemed like the whole first half of the book was dedicated to packing and unpacking bags. The phony terse narration seemed like a Ralph Lauren cowboy add with an occasional Important Message or Meaningful Thought not so subtly sprinkled about.As a light weight crime thriller, the book is unsatisfying, as literature, it ain't. Read Cain,Woolrich,McDonald or Thompson and just ignore this ultimately boring and condescending musing of a giant of american Literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is a tedious read. I haven't seen the movie, but I am sure the Coen Bros have done a great job as always. Nevertheless, McCarthy's writing style is painful to read. He is too cool for quotation marks--what is the point of that? Is it the IMPACT? That's what the whole book seems to be about, so again, it is probably a fantastic action movie. But in print form, I'd say it would be much better as a graphic novel. Unfortunately it comes accross as something that an 8th grader might write if he were held captive on a snow day and forced to spill his adolescent imagination onto paper (I imagine he'd write in red ink)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crap","review":"I really want to read a book which kills off all of the characters, except for the really evil guy who, after killing everyone in sight, returns the big money to some syndicate guy who hasn't even been in the story, like some honorable mercenary. Thanks also for making sure the one guy who does survive (the sheriff who doesn't have any impact on the story besides talking to people) has a deep secret which goes unresolved. Total crap and a waste of money; if the author showed up on my doorstep I would not only my money back, but bill him for my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crashing squel to the Border Trilogy","review":"As others have written, i really wanted to enjoy this book. Having enjoyed the sparse dialogue and trim character depictions of the Trilogy, I was looking for more. Instead I got gratuitous blood and gore, more than I ever want to know about guns, and a plot that was as bad as scatter-brained as Wolfe. I missed the lyrical landscapes from the Border - a strength that I thought McCarthy shared with the likes of Annie Proulx. The one saving grace in this book were the reveries of the sheriff. But did we need all that violence to make the point this is \\"no country for old men\\"? What a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"First book I've *ever* read where I skimmed the last 3 pages because I was completely uninterested and just wanted to get the darn thing over with. The book just kept getting worse and worse.I agree with the previous review saying the book is terrible and doesn't conform to the way stories are told.First annoyance-- dialog that is not in quotation marks. Why would you not conform to that basic standard of writing? What's next? Starting the story on the last page and reading from right-to-left?Story fizzled out.Waste of time. Especially compared to the book I had finished prior to this one: Lonesome Dove-- a true masterpiece from an author who knows how to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Read","review":"I saw the movie, before I read the book. Saw the book sitting on the library shelf and figured I'd read it to get some understanding and clarification of the movie...NOT! I didn't understand the movie and the book really didn't help. Boy, this was a tough read. Besides the fact that there was limited punctuation, I just couldn't find the meaning of it all. The movie did follow the book very closely, except for the ending, I think, and while I was able to remember movie scenes as I read, a lot of it went WAAAAAAAAAYYY over my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking Mans Thriller","review":"I own the imfamous Border trilogy, but to be honest have only read, \\"All the Pretty Horses'. I remember liking it, although I struggled, especially with the lack of punctuation. That exists in this as well, but it didn't bother me in the least. In fact it seemed to aid in the relentless pace that gets set right from the get go. It seems so pretentious to call a book a 'literary thriller' but between bouts of bloodshed are passages about the nature of man, this ailing country, and where it's all headed, that I suspect won't be found in the pages of a James Patterson book. It's violent, tautly written and thought provoking. Quite a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD, WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN","review":"A weak, confusing and largely pointless story from one of our greatest writers. I just feel so sorry. My condolences, Mr. McCarthy. Your immense talent has mostly deserted you here.The worst of it, as a friend of mine says, is that you can see the book it might've been. It probably could not have been as richly rewarding as his great novels, \\"Blood Meridian\\" and \\"Suttree,\\" but it could've been a lot better than this. (A similar book that is much more successful is Kem Nunn's \\"Tijuana Straits.\\")Still, \\"No Country For Old Men\\" has its moments. Even for all its faults, it's much better than the usual bestseller cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie instead","review":"I saw the movie first, and had heard good things about the book, so I picked it up. Here's the quick of it: FORGET THE BOOK and see the movie instead.Don't get me wrong, the book content is respectable, but the formatting is horrible! Cormac (the magician!) doesn't use double quotes around ANY of the dialogue. Now, sure, that is fun and interesting and one may make an argument that it is even artistic, but guess what? It makes it not much fun to read. And I bought a book to be a \\"good read\\" not an exercise in trying to figure out where the writer meant to switch from dialogue to an internal thought process or narration. Seriously!So that is why I say see the movie, especially since the movie is so close to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great three-quarter read then abandons plot","review":"I really liked this book for about three-quarters of it, then it abandoned the plot and suspense and got all preachy and nihilistic, \\"Oh what a horrible place the world is.\\" and \\"We are all awful hopeless people in a hopeless world.\\" Save me the sermon. GIVE ME A RESOLUTION TO YOUR STORY!!! Love the Coen Brothers but won't see this flawed \\"story\\" in film form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas...","review":"The long hiatus between Cities of the Plain and No Country for Old Men wasn't very fruitful. I've been a McCarthy fan for 15 years, and this last effort is very, very disapointing. Yes the prose is McCarthy, but the storyline has lost a lot to cheap expedience and a huge and unnecessary pile of bloody corpses. What saddens me the most is that the feeling of elation is gone. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Country for Old Men","review":"Great read. Hard to imagine anyone making a successful and accurate movie from this story. I haven't seen the movie yet but I intend to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author","review":"McCarthy is a man to be reckoned with--powerful imagery and character development achieved through dialog alone--sparse prose that is able to obtain and sustain a significant amount of action--while at the same time having a fast-paced plot to make it a true page-turner. Pure Genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Tale!","review":"This, as many of McCarthy's books, is an intriguing tale of good and evil and human nature. The bad guy is not likeable but has a code he lives by and considers fair. He is a killer but has to follow certain rules he has set down for himself. An easy read and I wished it had been longer. However, I felt it held my attention and was genuinely pleased I had read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country for Old Men","review":"Well written with some good dialogue, but overall the plot didn't make much sense. Some was just unbelievable, with the bad guy always able to find the good guy, even without a transponder. The conclusion gave the impression that the author didn't really know how to end it, so just cut it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just didn't get it....","review":"Maybe I just didn't get the whole point of the book, but this really should have been about 60 pages shorter than it was. What seems to be the main storyline abruptly ends with a significant portion of the book left to go. Cormac McCarthy's writing style is almost too painful to read. With no regard for traditional grammar and punctuation, what little dialog exists is nearly impossible to negotiate."},{"rating":"1","title":"starts with a bang ends with a whimper","review":"I'm not sure if I have ever read a book that had such an amazing start and that then became so bad. It went from 4 stars to 2. One of the main problems is that about three-fourths of the way through the novel there was a major turning point and from that point on the novel was so boring that I almost quit reading it. Perhaps McCarthy was trying to do something unique with the non-traditional story structure but it didn't work for me. I felt like the story was done 100 pages before it actually ended. I'm surprised to hear myself saying this but skip the book and see the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"I picked this book up at the library after seeing a preview of the upcoming movie starring Tommy Lee Jones. Therefore as I read the face and voice of Tommy Lee Jones became a part of the book -- which might have actually helped me get into this.As others have summarized the story, it is way violent, brutal, depressing, and cold. However, there are some real jewels of wit, compassion, and wisdom scattered throughout. The one thing that made me give this a 4 rather than 5 was the sometimes too lengthy and detailed description of guns and weapons. I don't have a clue about one gun from the next; however, I'm sure someone more familiar with this would appreciate this.This is not my favorite book of all time, but I'm glad I read it. It's a fast paced crime/detective novel that is well written and has some places that are impossible to put down. I'm anxiously awaiting the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple review.","review":"I do not like to retell the whole story of books,as it already has happpened in other reviews.

Too bad the lowest rating is one star ... this book deserves less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the movie...only to be assigned the book","review":"I honestly thought it was just the movie that was bad, maybe it was directing, editing, or the over acting, but when assigned to read the book for an English class I realized the whole thing was a disaster. Like the movie the book is chaotic. MAYBE and that is a BIG MAYBE I would have like the book a bit if I had not watched the movie. Don't get me wrong it's a good story, but reading and watching it, it's very unorganized... just ALL OVER THE PLACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"no plot, no finish","review":"This author writes scenes very well, and creates expectations that he cannot or will not fulfill. He has no plot, and no ending. The intrusive narrator who interrupts the action from time to time never has any contact with the other main characters. It's not explained what happens to the two main characters, and the villain of the piece just floats away. Very disappointing and makes you wonder what the author might do if he learned to plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is much better","review":"I can't believe how much I hate this book. I LOVED the movie. This book is intolerable though. I didn't make it far at all because it bored me out of my mind. The characters repeat themselves and each other so much it's insane. Just watch the movie it's great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Have Seen The Movie, You Have Read The Book","review":"This book is an excellent commentary on the degradation of our society and demonstrates the utter violence and savagery we see every morning on the news. Most of it is a result of the drug culture and the resulting violence it brings. Also contributing is a total disregard of the moral and ethical values that our grandparents grew up with. The book is almost an exact replica of the movie and could have been used for the movie script itself. I enjoyed both the movie and the book immensely. The movie is probably the BEST movie of 2007. The book is highly recommended, along with the movie. Both have a message that we all need to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"Well written book, I enjoyed it more than the movie, which was also well done. Only thing I did not like was the lack of punctuation in the writer's style, but it was easy to overcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Definitely not up to McCarthy standards. This book is confusing. Not realistic at all. I skipped the last 25% because it was so unbelievable and impossibly unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE Cormac McCarthy !","review":"If you like this author, this is more of the same. An updated version of The Crossing. Lots of good cowboy stuff with a healthy dose of wit and appraisal of society today. Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great story-telling","review":"For me, if I read a book before I see a movie, the movie is ruined, Same goes for the other way around. If I see the movie first, the book just doesn't do it for me.This story broke the mold for me though. I saw the film first and then read the book.I thoroughly enjoyed each, and can't say which is better.The story is gripping, engaging and amazingly well written.I highly recommend it and think Cormac is on top of his game with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fan of McCarthy, not my #1 pick","review":"I am a big fan of Cormac McCarthy and believe he's one of the finest living writers of our time. I enjoyed the book, but was not \\"blown away\\" as I normally am by his writing. If you enjoyed the movie or are a huge McCarthy fan, I encourage you to buy the book. Still giving it 4 stars, but not a big 5+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"The first book I read by Cormac McCarthy was \\"The Road\\" and I must admit to being taken aback by it. I must have been expecting a difficult story with a warm, fuzzy ending. Quite the opposite, but riveting nevertheless. So too, is this title. It held my attention and left me feeling just a bit out of sorts. I think McCarthy is my newest favorite author. I am reluctant to see the movie due to it possibly ruining the reading experience for me. I want to remember this novel, not the movie version. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This is a special book on numerous levels. It is a Western that is set in modern times with a great deal of morality infused into it. The plot, itself, is not a complex one, yet it becomes a classic in the hand of the writer. Each chapter begins with musings by the Sheriff about the world, his life and how things have evolved with the passage of time. This gives the reader great insight into the character as well as the motivations for his actions. The characters are all richly developed in this superb work that almost reads like a moralty play. It is a deeply satisfying book by a superb writer. It does not fit into the category of being a page-turner, yet is a very special read that is far superior to the film that was based upon this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"lived up to expectations","review":"Certainly lots of action, but also very thought provoking. After finishing a chapter, I often found myself looking off into space with the book in my lap, thinking about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another story based on Moral Relavance","review":"I read this book as part of my reading list on a vacation to Germany and Italy. After seeing the trailer for upcoming movie, I was intriqued enough to read this book. I was disappointed.The reviewer from Publishers Weekly sees the novel as coming to grips with a new type of criminal. Sorry, but those type of deviants have been with us since the dawn of recorded history. What the novel is about is moral relavancy - every character in this book has a flaw which the author uses to state that there are no heroes. The good guys all have flaws that more or less makes them impotent against evil. The \\"good guy\\" - Sheriff Bell - loses in the end and the evil sociopath succeeds.Sorry, but I just cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book and video","review":"I purchased both the book and the video..The movie was confused, or at least it confused me, so I bought the book to try to unscramble the content of the movie..disappointing..Tommy Lee Jones who plays the Sheriff in the movie was the most interesting character but even with his skills in acting, he was hard pressed to present a believable character.I suppose I am too old to appreciate all the chaotic word pictures and the sad presentation of both movie and book. I don't understand why or how the movie captured the acadamy awards......not satisfying as a book or movie..sorry about that.......... I appreciate a story line that has a beginning, a middle, and an ending..kind of ties things together and leaves the viewer or reader with the feeling of a good read, or view, and happy...the book and the movie did neither for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Very little plot, which is boring.The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michiko Kakutani is right (as always)","review":"Even though he hasn't published a book in seven years, Cormac McCarthy himself said this novel took him six months to write. It shows. The book is way thin. Maybe it started as one of his screenplays. Anyone who's read The Stonemason knows that McCarthy should not write plays or screenplays. Like Don DeLillo, he's not good at it. This book is McCarthy's Vineland. Hopefully his next novel won't be as lame as Mason & Dixon.P.S. Please nominate Judge Holden to the Supreme Court. Thanx."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I think the book is quite overrated. I didn't like any of the characters and the plot just seemed very forced. I read the book when I heard about the movie coming out - but to be honest, I didn't like the movie that much either once I saw it. It just didn't live up to the hype. I actually read and preferred The Road much much more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is literature?","review":"About twenty pages into this book I began to laugh. I'm still laughing, hence the two stars. The bad guy in this is so nasty-nasty-nasty, while most of his victims are inertly passive, that the tale rapidly degenerates to farce, and not very good farce at that.It is as if Freddie had wandered off the Friday 13th set and into a Louis L'Amour shoot-em-up.And for the record: slangy Texas cliches do not interesting dialogue make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good.","review":"I LOVE McCarthy's older work, but this book just feels like crummy popular lit - checkout stand quality. Pretty surprising considering the depth of some of his previous novels - like \\"The Orchard Keeper\\" or \\"Blood Meridian.\\" It feels like McCarthy whipped out this book with no real thought to crafting serious, nuanced prose or characters with any sort of real complexity. I'm surprised to see this kind of quality from one of my favorite writers. I'm sure the money from the movie rights is good - but if you have to write this kind of junk to appeal to Hollywood, it's a shame. This book feels like a sellout. Here's hoping McCarthy gets back to some serious writing soon - he's like no one else when he's really on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"We wait seven years for a book, and by the author's own admission this is the labor of six months. As Christopher Ricks says, \\"Great artists take great risks\\" and Cormac used to do so - no longer. In his twilight years, one might expect some new-fangled creation honoring, say, a Dostoevsky, one of Cormac's shining stars, and instead we get a throw-away \\"thriller\\" to the cannon. Unconvincing characters detached from the drug-world that is supposedly making them real. And the driving force to great Cormac writing - description - is missing. Moral to the novel: tell your children not to make fun of kids named 'Sugar'. Now don't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Country For Old Men","review":"I have read a few books by McCarthy and this was up to the usual high standards. In fact, it is the easiest read of the three I've read by him so for anyone that is new to this author, I'd recommend this as a primer. The book does differ from the movie in certain ways and I must say, without spoiling either, I'm surprised at the differences are as significant as they are ( I'd seen the movie first and clearly the movie makers had different intent). Bottom line, a very good book by a unique and talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish the story never ended","review":"I read this book well before the movie version and the writing although lighter than most McCarthy books was non-stop page turner that I wish was 600 pages. Superb and enthralling. A must read even if you have seen the movie which does the book justice but no equal to the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So frustrating, I couldn't finish it.","review":"I puchased this book on recommendation and hype and I can honestly say I just don't get it. The story lacks direction, the characters are boring and the grammar is horrendous. The lack of proper punctuation and apparent intentional use of massive quantities of run-on sentences is maddening at best. I am sure I must be missing something here, but I just can't bring myself to finish it. Makes a great coaster, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country For Old Men","review":"I am embarrassed to say, after all the great reviews by others, that this one of the WORST books I have ever struggled through. It was almost unreadable. I kept wanting to throw it away, but was curious how it would continue and end. A terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw It in the Trash","review":"Quite a few years ago I read Blood Meridian by the same author and thought it was terrific book. I will have to go back and see why I thought it was such a great book because No Country for Old Men is absolutely horrible.The story just drifts all over the place, the dialogue is laughable and I spent half the time going back and rereading passages trying to figure out who said what. That is not enjoyable. I recall long ago that many people considered Andy Warhol a genius in the art world despite the fact that most people had no idea what he was trying to accomplish. I think that is the care here with this novel...since it is so bizzare it must be great literature many say.The only way I was able to finish this book was because there are only about ten lines on a page and that dimimished the pain of trying to struggle through this mess. This book should be thrown in the trash can along with Andy Warhol's Campbell soup cans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"I don't care how popular this author is; this is the most poorly written book I ever read.The first paragraph is historically wrong. Texas doesn't gas death row inmates and never has. It went downhill from there for me.No one living in the Sanderson area would hike or hunt without plenty of drinking water like the man in this book....oh heck, it's all crap so why go on.This book was recommended to me by someone who obviously enjoys very shallow story lines and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disjointed, disturbing novel","review":"where the sociopath kills everyone.

And if we can make the wall retroactive to the 1980s, we would all be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never understood the hype","review":"Like the title says, I'll never understand this book's popularity. The overly-descriptive writing, the switching back and forth between the sheriff's essays and the story, the real lack of an understanding of the plot; it just didn't flow for me at all. Luckily, it was a fairly quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting","review":"This book has a good theme behind it, but is tedious to enter and does not sustain enough interest to pursue"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast,brutal,and compelling","review":"I read this novel straight through which is very unusual for me.It was my first experience of McCarthy's writing and I think it is first rate,but not for the squeamish-people like Anton Chigurh are around in greater numbers than one can imagine-spawned by wars and prisons or plain old psychopathic personality-the author has created a villain who is unfortunately realistic-not safely depicted as a creature who could exist only in the imagination.The basis of the book concerns drug trafficking,always a good starting point for generating amoral behavior.The counterpoint to Chigurh is Sherrif Bell,an old school cop with just the kind of self doubt and imperfections that make him trustworthy.Don't look for a formulaic story here-McCarthy tells an oft told tale in a new and effective way-if you're looking for a story of justice triumphant you won't find it here,but you will find one hard hitting story nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between violence and reflection.","review":"McCarthy's new novel seems to be doing a balancing act, and one that it successfully completes. In NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, Mcarthy's balancing act is between BLOOD MERIDAN of an earlier time and ALL THE PRETTY HORSES. NO COUNTRY is an extremely violent and brutal story, but the bloody climax comes with nearly 10% of the novel still unread. What makes this novel a gem of a tightrope walking job is that after delivering the thrills, McCarthy seems to see his main task to be on reflection of the nature of the violence. All the blood shed being long over, the author finishes up with a touching farewell. This is really finely crafted reflection on American culture. One that never sounds preachy and packs a wollop taboot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No time for hopelessness","review":"For years, Cormac McCarthy has been one of my favorite writers. His novels always seemed to establish a perfect balance of hope and dignity in the face of total despair. Even Blood Meridian offered some shred of humanity in a landscape nearly devoid of moral value.No Country for Old Men offers characters with plenty of dignity, but this time there is a total absence of hope. McCarthy's Sheriff Bell has it figured that the world is going straight to hell and that his generation was the last one worth a damn. This message gets old pretty quick.As a father of two young children in an extremely confusing world, I have to have hope that the future holds a better place for them. If the \\"sage\\" ruminations provided by Sheriff Bell are what McCarthy has to offer, I think I'm done with McCarthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below his talent","review":"Here is Cormac writing a deposit slip instead of a novel. It is fast moving, well-paced, bogging down here and there when he gets inside the sheriffs head, but nothing like his earlier great books. The absurd cattle-gun which even Jeffrey Dahmer would think was ridiculous, is clearly a set piece for violence for its own sake. Cormac saw the returns for his tepid Pretty Horses and went for the gold. He can't be blamed for his greed as a human being; but as a potential literary immortal, he has embarrassed himself and his craft. He should have written this pot-boiler under another name--it might have helped if the secret was kept. This book also sheds a bad light on his prior books where violence has often been cited as gratuitous. It seems those criticisms were correct and we simply have a great craftsman, not a great author, venting in endless repulsive fashion his inner demons like dirty laundry on a long line."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misfire From a Great Author","review":"With this book, Cormac McCarthy apparently tried his hand at writing an Elmore Leonard novel. Lean, propulsive writing...quirky characters...large sections of dialog-driven narrative...explosive violence...even a tangled, unsatisfying conclusion. Without the leavening of Leonard's comic black humor, however, the result is a portentous mess. I second the comments of other Amazon reviewers who noted that after a masterful beginning, the story veers into a cul-de-sac somewhere after the half-way point and ends with an extended meditation on the least interesting character in the novel.I am a big Cormac McCarthy fan, and will continue to read his new books as they appear, but the wheels flew off the cart this time. If you haven't read any McCarthy and were thinking about starting with NCFOM, check out the Border Trilogy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Better than the movie, which I thought was great. I very excited to read more books by Cormac McCarthy now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, just like the movie","review":"Not much can be said that hasn't already been said in the other 500+ reviews. This book is great, albeit violent. It seems to be the \\"simplest\\" of McCarthy's books I have read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering & Tiresome Story","review":"I was unimpressed by this book. I didn't think it delivered a meaningful plot or significant character development. The story in fact seems truncated. Each time the writer begins to allow for interesting connections to characters they end with the death of the character or a change of scene. The antagonist of the story is more robotic than human. He resembles the terminator (1st one) in his relentless killing and stamina. He lacks personality, history or apparent purpose.Each part of the book begins with a soliloquy by the Sheriff that are not revelatory or profound. The final chapters of the book are told by the Sheriff and include his musings on the old times v. modernity. These lack insight and connection to the plot, as well as anything to intrigue readers.The ending and the way the book deals with the antoganist and other characters is unsatisfying. The book seems like a half-hearted attempt and left me scratching my head at the point of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skilled, mesmerizing writing...","review":"is enough reason to read this fine thriller. A rumination on the evil that exists and those sworn to protect us. A very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-saving","review":"Beyond the Blues was given to me six years ago and I have read it daily ever since. (It's in a daily reading format - one page per day.) The author really knows of what he writes. Depression is devasting and is a non-curable disease. However, it can be kept in remission forever if properly treated. Beyond the Blues, if read faithfully, can be a wonderful part of that treatment. I wouldn't consider starting my day without my daily \\"fix\\" which validates my feelings, encourages me to never give up, and kicks me in the butt when I need it. I have since given at least 15 copies of this book to others. All have expressed how helpful it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I disagree with the other review. This product is amazing! It works from HEAD TO TOE and leaves your skin silky smooth, soft, and smelling fresh all day long. I also use it in my natural black (dredlock) hair as a moisturizing and herbal oil and it works just the same--without any greasy build-up in my hair or scalp. I also use it the same way on my 3 year old son, and we both agree, \\"It smells really good!\\" The scent is \\"almondy\\"--delicate, but not too overpowering. Also, what I like about the bottle is that the special design of the cap allows it to drip out rather than gush out. You can squeeze the bottle harder for increased flow, if you desire. I'm a happy customer with this product and will definitely purchase it again as well as sample other Alba Hawaiian products.

You feel like you could be in for something. Sure, the \\"Germaine\\" thing is a little wierd, but when \\"Fire..\\" plays, you feel like the CD is back on track. Sadly, that's not the case. The CD goes completely downhill after that great song. All of the rest are either boring(All Apologies, Scorn not his Simplicity, Tiny Grief Song, Thank You for hearing me) uninteresting(All Babies, In This Heart, John I Love You, My Darling Child) or just plain wierd (Red Football, Am I a Human, Famine). Ok, I take one thing back. \\"In This Heart\\" is a good song But it can't save \\"Red Football\\" or \\"Famine\\".

Only about 3/4 the songs on this album make it worth buying. But, about half of those are so passionate and powerful and the others have her sweetly crooning - just what we love about Miss Sinead. I always skip \\"A Perfect Indian\\", \\"Scorn Not His Simplicity\\", \\"Tiny Grief Song\\", and \\"Thank You For Hearing Me\\". My favorites are the waltzy \\"John, I Love You\\" (she shows her range in this one), and the empowering \\"Red Football\\" makes me feel like I'm coming out of a huddle. Oh, and \\"Famine\\" is the reason I bought this album. I had to pull of the highway the first time I heard Mother Teresa play this on EOI. I like the political and religious slant of this album.

The unbearable pain, the quiet acceptance, the resilience to rise above, the tender love, the hard earned joy . . .An artist reminds the human race who we are, and they preserve our existence through their art.Sinead is a true artist. And it makes me sad to see that she is underrated in today's flash-over-substance society.Despite some negative reviews, this album to me, is flawless. It is an artistic document that I will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story!","review":"While this book may not be written brilliantly (hence, the 4 stars), the story is spellbinding.

This film really makes you appreciate the freedom we have here in the US and the sacrifices these brave men make.I'm usually a multi-tasker while watching movies but this time I was hooked from the first minute of the film and did not even want to be distracted.Thank you Jake Rademacher and Gary Sinise for making and supporting a documentary that tells the soldiers' stories and honors their difficult journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching documentary","review":"Purchased this dvd just browsing through Amazon and very satisfied.

I saw Gary Sinise being interviewed on Jimmy Fallen's late night show and learned about his support of this film and then caught the Director being interviewed the next day on the news...seemed like a cool movie so I caught it in the theater. Amazing and insightful portrayal of a family's experience with the war. The great thing about this film is that it is unbiased and real from many soldiers and a soldier's families experience...I think anyone that wants to learn more about what our soldiers are sacrificing and what their families are sacrificing to have our soldiers fight for our country should see this film. It's unlike anything I've seen before and is highly entertaining (although it is a documentary). It covers family and soldier struggles and doesn't take any political angles. Overall, a great film. Definitely a top 3 in my book for documentaries...and I've seen a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked! Sucked!","review":"This book so totally sucked!

Instead, I repeatedly started and then skipped ahead from one section to the next, finding the author's wordy style boring. Finally, realizing my hopes were false, I returned STRIP CITY without having finished it. Were Burana not a hot-looking woman with a salivating past, I wonder if an editor (male editor, anyway) would have published this book.Another false hope: at least a few STRIP CITY pictures? Except for the head shot in the dustcover, there are zero photographs. How can a book about a stripper not even have one photo that shows her body? I guess author Lily Burana's in-person charms made the male editors let that, along with her deadly dull prose, slip by.Don't get your hopes up over STRIP CITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strip City deconstructs stripping","review":"For anyone who has ever wondered what it is like to be a stripper, or how one becomes a stripper--look no further! Lily Burana lays it all out on the table. Her writing is witty and honest, as she discusses issues of body image, sexual politics, the history of stripping, how she became a stripper and how she got out of the business. This book is so engaging, one has the feeling of riding shotgun on this journey as Lily tells her story, and the stories of other women she meets along the way. She doesn't make excuses for, glorify, or denigrate the business of stripping--she just tells it like it is. It is easy to see how she moved into a career in journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOORING!","review":"Surely there is some stripper out there who can write a more interesting memoir than this one? I was VERY disapointed by Ms. Burana's weak attempt at taking an \\"oh so daring trip \\"across\\" country\\" (more like a criss cross to a city for a night here, a town for a week there.)Very pretentious, somewhat preachy, and all in all downright boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross-Country Strip-a-thon","review":"Lily Burana's book is excellent- well written and enjoyable. If someone is interested in a cross-country romp filled with ineteresting people/exploits then this is the book for them. If, however, one is looking for something that attempts to tackle the complexities and realitites of the stripping world this is probably not the right book. Elisabeth Eaves wrote a book called \\"Bare\\" that delves more into this territory... but for a fun stripping romp Burana is spot on."},{"rating":"1","title":"She calls herself a writer?","review":"This was an incredibly disappointing book. I have friends who have stripped, and their stories are always so gripping and interesting. Lily Burana, on the other hand, is so self involved that we never quite get a feel for the world of stripping. When she does begin to offer insight, she immediately changes the subject. (Note that she is a fan of white space.)The success of this poorly written book shows how little has been written about a subject many people wonder about. I hope others in the business will take the time to find a good editor, and consider writing a skillful, honest, and true account of the stripping world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped & not worth the time","review":"I guess an ex-stripper who can write must have dazzled the publisher, but it sure doesn't dazzle the honest reader. A bit precious, trite in many ways, with forced humor and no insight whatsover -- I was quite disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely we have more depth than this","review":"I do not and cannot believe that most Americans survive with such shallow thoughts about one another. This book will teach you how to be a leach or a parasite - or at least a member of the heard. Granted, you might be an organized, efficient leach. But, a real leader, a real contributor to our society would not waste time reading this book.Plus, I do not find itemized lists of wardrobes and detailed instructions on how to wear certain items of clothing to be all that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Boring!","review":"This book sounded like an interesting story that might have allowed readers to submerge themselves in the forbidden world of stripping. Instead any housemother in New Jersey could of come up with this story. Just plain boring, unsexy and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Don't ask me how a book on a stripper could be boring, but it was. Maybe I have become jaded after reading Jenna Jameson's and Traci Lord's autobiographies. If you haven't read those yet, they are far more exciting, although you have to hide in your room to read them.This book somehow made stripping boring, and for that I must give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very In Depth","review":"Ms. Burana does seem to skip away from any explanations for her \\"career\\", but obviously she enjoyed it or she wouldn't have done it, and wouldn't have gone to see strippers herself on her Retin A finding mission in Mexico. She treats her subject matter rather superficially, and if you really want to know what exactly what it was she did at Peepland or how she felt while degrading herself, you won't find out from this book. Maybe she just can't face it herself yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impresses","review":"I think this was a writers attempt to find something to get herself published. I was not impressed with her thoughts and thought she is something of an egomaniac. She got pissed when people dissed the profession, but had her own attitudes about what was right and wrong with the profession. I read this book as background research for a paper I was writing. From other readings and interviews with other performers, I think she is way off base and had her personal agenda in writing this book, and it was not to give us insight into the true live of an exotic dancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE IT OFF! (the shelf, and buy it)","review":"Lily Burana writes about a world most of us will never see. She does it with a sharp eye and a sense of humor. It's a fast and fun read, meant more to inform than to titillate. Very skillfully done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringville","review":"This is not so much a stripper's farewell journey across America as it is the scattered culling of a few years during which the author chose to dabble in stripping.

Dry, unfocused, inauthentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow moving","review":"I expected a lot more from this book. I thought it would give me an insight into a lifestyle and the type of individual that partakes of that lifestyle. Instead, it provided dull details of her so-called \\"farewell tour\\". I was troubled when I first read the book and she provided ... and unbelievable reasons for the journey. To me, it was clear that she did the \\"tour\\" (if you can call it that) as an excuse to write a book. Why not just admit it?

Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out. Many details and explanations are left out.

Within days the city is struck by a so called 'copycat killer'.

Of the first three books this was the best, you got to see a side of Agent Pendergast that was not shown in the first two of the series. He became a little more human, more real than the pale man in the black suit. A tiny bit of his history is revealed.My only complaint with the books is the way that the authors portray the police in New York City. In all three of these novels- with the exception of one character, the police are made to appear bumbling, idiotic and arrogant. It gets a bit old.I will continue with the series as I find Pendergast to be intriguing and hope that his character fleshes out some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared the heck out of me, and I loved every moment of it!","review":"This is Preston and Child at what they do best. I was more than glad to have Pendergast return. He is such a fascinating and intriguing character from the Relic and Reliquary. Having a whole book with him made for a very engrossing novel. Nora Kelly and Bill Smithback have good chemistry. It is good to read that Smithback is up to his usual tricks. Nora is more mature and a lot more likeable. The plot unfolds at a furious pace after a bone-chilling beginning. I had finished the book less than thirty-six hours after UPS delivered it.The criminal of the story is dark and shadowy. The detail about the criminal's acts are unspeakably graphic. It made my blood boil. All in all, this is far above their other most recent novel, The Ice Limit. Authors sometimes slump for awhile, but Cabinet of Curiousities has pulled Preston and Child way out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I enjoyed their other books, but this one was somewhat slow, plodding. Pendergast is always an interesting character to follow, possessed of demigodlike knowledge and capabilities, but the rest of the cast is kind of flat. And the final revelation ...

And it's almost six hundred pages long. That's how well it sucks you in.If there weren't a million great reasons already to read this book, such as the chilling plot, the unexpected twists and turns, and the endearing characters, you would simply HAVE to read it for this reason alone: Pendergast. I have yet to meet a person who read the 'Relic' series and did not like this character. Intelligent, charming, and infinitely deep, he's a modern-day Sherlock Holmes with a shrouded past. He's one of the most complex characters ever written. Read it and try to prove me wrong.I've become a big enough fan of Preston and Child's books to know that this one is my all-time favorite. Though the plot is much darker than the others, it is no less terrifying or powerful.

This just begs for a movie version; if done correctly, it could be a VERY scary flick. Heck! The BOOK was scary enough! This was suspenseful.So why did I give it just four stars? Well, the ending, while tense and frightening, was sort of a let-down. I expected a far better climax to a great buildup.

I was one of the few who wasn't happy with their prior effort \\"The Ice Limit\\", but \\"Cabinet\\" has it all. Most interesting was the further development of FBI agent Pendergat, who had first appeared in their earlier novel \\"The Relic\\". Also back from that first novel are archaeogist Nora Kelly and reporter Bill Smithback. The story and action move at a brisk pace, with characters that you like and care about.

My only thought was, surely, this can't be as bad as I think it is. I wasn't disappointed, it was. This has to be the worst book ever written. Not only is it predictable, disjointed, unbelievable (no matter how good you are at suspension of disbelief), and can hardly qualify as professional writing. The authors, editors, and publisher owe the literary community an apology for this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I buy books almost weekly from Amazon.This book looked as if it had just come off the bookshelf of a bookstore.

So contrived. A total fantasy, not at all as \\"page-turning\\" as their other novels. I felt that it should have ended at least three chapters before it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I figured out who did it the moment the character was introduced. It was also too long. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does everyone talk like that?","review":"You know, as I have begun this habit of writing reviews, I soon found myself giving almost everything 4 or 5 stars. Wondering, critically of course, will I actually read something of lesser value? Well, this book fulfilled my nagging dillema. Now, I'm not going to downplay this book. It was a good read for the most part; however, my only complain is that when reading this book I felt as if I were reading a book which contained a land of nothing but absolute geniouses. A great example of this is early in the book when Nora goes to a women's house whom is of the age of about 90. This 90 year old women had a vocabulary greater than that of any scientist explaining molelecular physics. After that, I simply could not help but to think that the authors were attempting some kind of ego-tistical prize by outdoing each other in semantics. Yes the book was good, however, every book needs a character that either equates in knowledge with the reader or is of lesser intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. How can people like books like these?","review":"The characters are as cliche as a bad soap opera.

I don't need books to be 100% realistic, but this isn't even slightly plausible. I'm confused on why this book is so well reviewed. Where's my refund?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Pricing","review":"So it's $23 for the kindle version, and under $10 for the paperback? How about going for the $.01 used copy instead.

Each book has been a wonderful read, with my personal favorites being Reliquary and Thunderhead. After hearing that they had a new book coming out, I began to peruse their excellent website on a daily basis, seeking out new information. The sample chapters were great, but I still couldn't wait for the book. Finally the UPS man delivered my Amazon order and I could sit down to a night of reading. Was all the anxiety worth it? Of course it was. Suffice it to say that after a long night of reading, Cabinet is now my favorite Preston/Child book. The story is remarkable, as is the cast of characters. Having Pendergast return was simply the best. Reading Cabinet was an extremely creepy experience, in a very good way. The tension is unbelievable and the surprise ending will give you quite a jolt. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"I read this after reading Relics and am hooked on Preston/Child. I've read Thunderhead after The Cabinet of Curiosities and was not disappointed either. Great Authors, great books. Can't wait to read more from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Thriller","review":"This is my third Preston/Child novel and I have not yet been dissapointed. The plot is imaginative and the characters unique and interesting. This story is something of a horror/murder mystery/supernatural combination. Although it is not exceptionally scary, it does intrigue the reader. I found the prose in this novel better constructed than in the previous books by these authors. There are several earlier works that I plan to read by the Preston/Child duo. I am sure I won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely fabulous!","review":"A real page-turner!

I could not put this down. I have read all of their books and this ranks as one of the best. It was great to see Pendergast back...the man is always prepared! But the twists and turns in this book keep you hooked. This reminded me of \\"The Relic\\" somewhat. I was also fascinated by the plot, and the mystery surrounding the bodies, the current murders and The Surgeon. The ending will blow your mind. It is a wonderful, wonderful book...I can't praise it enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Drawer Puzzle of a Mystery!","review":"First the bad news!The bad guy here does not really fit, and there are a few characters who seem almost cartoonish. Otherwise, this is a real knockout, with a really eccentric FBI man, whose investigatory tools include using renaissance-era \\"Memory Palace\\" techniques. There is plenty of arcania here as we explore the underground vaults of the NYC Natural History Museum, the mean and oz-like streets of the great city, and the bureaucratic maneuvers of those who run the city, the police, and the museum. Also plenty of bizarre PT Barnum-like late 19th century curiosities, and bone digging. So if you like an accessible, educational, mysterious tour through NY of now and 100-plus years ago, you can't miss with one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their VERY best!","review":"Cabinet of Curiosities is THEE most deliciously scarey tale I can ever remember reading. It's a total page turner. I had to make myself stop reading every night just to get some sleep. If I hadn't had to go to work, I would have read it all the way through w/out stopping. I've read 3 other Preston/Child books and this is by far the most compelling and interesting. Not that the others are bad - they're all great. But COC surpassess the others for suspense, action, character relations, historical, and forensic interest. Don't miss this one!

The main character had Holmes-like abilities, but his were attained by magic, not by deduction and observation. For example, to help solve this murder, he was able to go back in time 100 years (in his head) and watch what happenned. GIVE ME A BREAK! The characters were stereotypical (especially the NYCity Policemen) with childish dialogue, and the ending was pathetic.

You like scary, gothic thrillers that keep you reading all night? Serial killers that would freak out Charles Manson? Then get this one now! It's a killer Halloween or Fall read also; those of you who love certain horror novels around that season for certain reasons, know what I mean. Great characters, great plot, reads like a movie roller coaster going a billion miles and hour and is defintely worth the $$$.

It is mostly sung in German with some French, which I like better than hearing some European speak English rather than his own language. There are no noise or distorted vocals. It does have a retro feel but still seems modern. It has great production and a sound that fills the room. It is the best electronic album from Metropolis in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book needs a faith healer","review":"Seriously, I've had the softcover version of this book for no more than a day and the glue binding the pages together has already fallen apart and the middle section of the book has now separated from the rest of it.

But this book is much, much different... so many times, i was absolutly infuriated at how evil people can be. The amount of physical, emotional, spiritual and financial pain that is caused by faith healers is unforgivable. Randi produces an overwhelming amount of evidence for each faith healer he investigates, showing without a shadow of a doubt that it is a giant scam. Unfortunatly, the truly faithful are never bothered by any such evidence... they believe Randi to be \\"of the devil.\\"This is a truly remarkable book, that will open everyones eyes to the absolute nastyness of faith healers, their unsatiable greed, and the faithful that throw thousands of dollars at them, hoping to recieve God's blessings.Unfortunatly, I doub't that anyone that needs to hear the information that Randi has in this book will ever read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and indispenable.","review":"Randi brilliantly exposes the chalatans and quacks of the faith healing business.

I can use it to set the carriage stop on my lathe and face off a few thou's quite accurately. It makes the difference between getting the final cut right the first time vs constant cut/unchuck/measure/rechuck cycles.I originally bought it for setting a radius tool, but using it with the carriage stop on the lathe has proven to be the real use.

It shows how politically motivated religious racism can destroy a friendship. It's a rare jewel that shows that Arab Jews and Muslims can get along, as they have a lot in common. A passionately told story of comraderie and loyalty which compensates for any technical or pacing weaknesses.

After having Amazon send me two replacement shipments and all 3 items having the same type of damage that you would associate with a used product I gave up. Amazon customer service made a good effort to fix the issue and in the end issued a $30 credit when I reluctantly decided I could live with the damage.

Attaching the rods to the existing 310 \\"pound\\" (let's call it units of resistance, as they aren't really \\"pounds\\") rod structure is easy. You're ready to go in 45 seconds.

I still return to the gym and I am able to lift the same or more then when I left(8 years ago). As for the size issue, well that is more diet related and genetics.

I found the stories entertaining and interesting. And the recipes were as authentic as any my Sicilian mother or aunts had ever prepared. I love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it","review":"I was interested in this cookbook after seeing some of the good reviews it got on amazon and was able to get it from my library via Inter Library Loan. I have to say I was disappointed. I found the stories the author included in the cookbook to be very poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly placed with in the cookbook. Writing is clearly not one of the author's strong points. The recipes were the same recipes you can find it any other american-italian cookbook, and were not written well either. I am so glad I did not actually buy this book as it would have been a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sicilian Cookbook I've Seen","review":"Great book. Great read. Just love the stories and folklore from Sicily. This the food my grandmother made and I never could find the recipes. Well, they are in this book. The sauces, pizzas, fritattas are great. Francesca Romina just won the contest in Newsday for the best Sesame Seed (Regina) biscuits in Mangia Little Itay. They were terrific and easy to make. There are recipes in this book that I have never seen before and great hints and tips along the way. The author seems to go to great lenghts to be specific for her readers. These recipes work and are well tested. I'm buying several copies for my family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book!","review":"Not only does this book have delicious recipes, it is full of charming and funny stories of long ago in Sicily. Along with cooking instructions you get a lesson in the history of foods like lasagna and pastries and how they were introduced 100 yrs. ago. Pictures of the author's family make the stories come alive as well. Even if, like myself, you are not a great cook, you are sure to enjoy Mangia Little Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wanted this movie","review":"but the sellerdid not come through every know and then i get one and when i do i tell the truth hope you will do better in 2013"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a great voice but...","review":"A great voice but no Jim Steinman on production and it shows.

I have read/looked through almost all existing books for 70-100. Two books really help: this one and exam cram. This book covers a lot of theory and extra information but answers many questions like web authentication, security, etc. Exam cram just has similar questions with the real exam (especially those little pieces of text marked as \\"Tips\\" and \\"Alert\\"). And, of course, Transcender is a MUST! Several cases there are almost identical to the cases in a real exam. Just a little simpler than the real ones. Following note is just my opinion: around 70% of exam is about database (tables, relations, primary/foreign keys, attributes, normalization, etc.) Without good experience in it no one book will help to pass the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written book, but does not prepare you for the exam","review":"I wished I had listened to the other reviewers before buying this book.In the books defense, it is very well written, has good examples, and cites plenty of sources if you want to read further.The bad part, I read the first half of this book and the information had only the most remote connnection to the real exam. You should know, in fairness, that I gave up at this point and didn't read the rest of the book. It did look like the remainder of the book was more relevent to the exam, but I was too frustrated by that time.I relied on Transcenders heavily to prepare me for this exam and did OK (I failed the first attempt by a small margin - 1%).My advice: If you are getting your MCSD to go into distributed application development using MSF, it would be a good read.

I think this part of the book is very good. The other parts - well, not my style. Dry text and theory. Frankly I almost fell asleep reading those chapters.However the real problem is the subtitle of the book, - referring to MCSD and 70-100. I have just passed the exam (some hours ago) but I haven't met a single question connecting to this books' material. Simply the exam is entirely something different.So if you are interrested in MSF, read the 'case studies' of this book. A best to understand it. For any other purposes (including exam prep) I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you want to pass 70-100? Then read this!","review":"This book capped my studies for the 70-100 test, and consequently the MCSD certification. I recommend it as a must read for the exam. The material is thoroughly presented form the perspective of authors who have successfully used these concepts. Every chapter or so, there is a piece of a continuing case study that helps to review the major concepts of each chapter. The case study alone is worth the price of the book.

This book has most of the information required in the test, unfortunately I come from the perspective of someone who already has a degree in Computer Science, so it is possible that I had much of the knowledge not covered in the book. It is a very good book on the MSF (Microsoft Solutions Framework), but I must issue one exam caution. The coverage of the User Interface portion of the exam is extremely light. You should consult the MSDN libraries for this information. If you are looking for test preperation software, under NO CIRCUMSTANCES use the self test software that Microsoft reccommends. It is horrible. Use the Transcender software.Good book, but light coverage of user interface chapter may leave you shaking your head after the exam is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"boeing boeing","review":"Being a huge Jerry Lewis fan I did enjoy this movie, it wasn't as good as I expected but still very entertaining, it still has all the things I love in a sixties movie, glam women and cool surroundings."},{"rating":"2","title":"boeing boeing","review":"very intertaining, old time comity,jerry lewis,and tony curtis at there best,great cast,good story,very funny well acted. just a good old movie ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boeing Boeing","review":"I went to see Boeing Boeing as a theatre production and I was knocked off my feet.

Siemens customer support is beyond worthless. They give canned answers and refuse help. Even when they admit they sold faulty product they don't care. The process for warranty assistance is a pain. And when the product is out of warranty you are totally out of luck. They do not provide repairs, help in locating a repair center, or supply any repair parts. To quote their customer service supervisor \\"Our warranty is for one year. We expect our products to last one year.

No so, each cordless unit can only register to one base station at at time. That means that the other base station will not be able to intercom a cordless handset that is not registered to it.

I will never by a Siemens product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM","review":"I was an owner of Siemens Gigaset System. Nice concept but AWFUL, AWFUL hardware.

Two of which I had to return because both units were defective.The first return was the result of the all of the answering machine buttons flashing continuously without any messages. The second return was for a defective handset that refused to register with the base station.The handset has very poor standby time and no mute. Programming the phone was arduous. Although after programming the directory, sending the directory to the handset was a cinch. Do not purchase this phone if you want to share other wireless transmitters in the same environment. This phone creates an incredible amount of interference.I did decide to keep the third set to test long term but I sincerely think that this last set will complete its warranty period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly made, It WILL break","review":"I purchased this phone hoping to be able to add phones to bedrooms without having to install jacks into each wall. This phone worked for about 3 - 4 days. The handsets were always unstable, dropping signals and hanging up on callers every now and then, but the entire thing just stopped working within a week of owning it. When I started to research the phone, I found a lot of compalints. Don't be fooled by the false promise of this product. Go with a better name model like the AT&T. GE or Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this phone","review":"The AC adapter for my phone just died so I call the phone number they plaster on the phone and on every manual. The recording says to email them or goto their website and then it hangs up. Why even give a phone number? I email them as instructed and the email comes back as not working. So I am still trying to figure out how to make a warranty claim.With that said, like many others I hear an annoying clicking on the portable phone as well. Also the controls are not very intuitive. You will have to use the manual repeatedly.On the good side it is an attractive design and the portable phone battery lasts for a long period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Clear","review":"Within two weeks the answering machine portion of this system broke. The technical support person and his supervisor told me the only way to get it fixed was for them to send me a box, have me send the phone in and then they would send me a new phone. They estimated the time I would be without a phone would be about 10 days. I don't know anyone who can go 10 days at home without a phone. For a firm that has 85,000 employees and billions in revenue I can't believe they could have come up with a more insane return policy. Also the reception isn't nearly what they said. In my house I am 20 yards from the base station and the phone will not work in my office. They informed me that there wasn't anything I could do, no additional antennae&#65533;s or anything to resolve the problem.Poor Management and Poor Product!!Buy the Panasonic!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Corded Handset","review":"I purchased the 8825 as a replacement for the previous model, primarily because it has a better cordless handset, with speakerphone (something i wanted). Everything is ok, with the exception of the recorded voice quality and the corded handset. While using the corded handset, I hear a loud buzzing if about 1-2 feet away from, and in line with, the antenna. I have diagnosed the problem to a badly shielded handset. If you hold the handset near the antenna, with either the corded end, or the back, of the handset next to the antenna, i hear the buzzing...strongest at the middle. I called Siemens, and they said it was a bad cord...not so. I also tried a toroid on the cord, to no avail. This is a disappointment, since the previous version has better sound, and no buzz problem. None of these multi handset systems are perfect. I looked at the Panasonic kxtg2000b, but no mute on the base or handset, and more complicated to use. Really disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap Crackle Pop","review":"I haven't found much that doesn't interfere with this phones reception.

The base station phone has a strange connection that may occur at any time during a conversation that sounds like you are in a barrell. This appears to be a common issue with the phone, as we have had numerous conversations with Siemans Customer Service working us through several complicated steps to correct the problem.After these efforts failed, we were instructed to return the phone for a replacement. We were not informed that Siemans does not have any phones to send us, so we are waiting for over 3 months to get a replacement. When speaking to their Customer Service, they offer no compensation, no refund, no nothing. Just tell us to wait. \\"They don't have any ability to help us\\".What a horrible phone, lousy customer service and lousy factory response.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Effort","review":"Purchased the 8825 in July and am satisfied that it is the best telephone system currently available. It does require an investment of time in order to set it up properly. But once setup, it has an excellent set of features with the majority quite useful. I believe the problem most people have is the mind set that this unit can be plugged in out of the box and used. You have to completely read the manual which is fairly good. I did call the help line and following a 10 minute wait talked with a knowledgeable person who solved the problem [do not record your answering machine greeting with the handset (use the speakerphone) or the last 1/10 of a second of your message is cut off]. That one is not in the manual! Quality of construction/design is excellent and sound quality is very good. The ability, with caller ID, to \\"announce\\" the person who is calling is great. The four stars relates to the length of time required to completely setup and the cost of the unit and additional phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destruction of the phone by power outages","review":"I had the previous line of phones and paid hundreds of dollars for it only to find that a power outage destroyed line 1. Siemens wouldn't fix it and essentially told me I was out of luck. I swore never to buy another Siemen's product. I was curious about the new generation phones and I see that they still have the identical problem. It doesn't surprise me. They showed zero interest when I reported the problem so how could they redesign the next generation of phones to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment the Siemans 8825 was!","review":"I purchased this phone system in May, 2003. (Spent about $350.00, incl. a 2nd handset.) During the past year I was without the phone for a month while waiting for the base unit to be repaired (by Siemans). After a power outage in June, 2004 Line 1 no longer worked (a busy signal if you called it). After troubleshooting it with their \\"Tech Support\\", I was told that I have to take it to an electronics repair store. Siemans will not repair it - even at my expense. The base unit is just too prone to problems. I definitely will not purchase another Siemans telephone system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Support","review":"If you'd asked me a year ago I would have said that I loved this system.

I bought the base and 4 extensions. None of them work well at all. When listening, the earpiece \\"warbles\\" so you can't carry on a conversation. This is near the base, far from the base, everywhere. It doesn't do it all the time, but is totally exasperating. Staples was nice enough to exchange some of the handsets, but nothing changes. Also, beware the microwave oven! Anytime you are near an operating microwave oven, you can't hear a thing over the interferance. I really liked the phone when I first got it, but within a week or two, it started developing problems. My sister in law got the same phone system and has the exact same problems. Don't ever buy Siemens products... customer no-service is awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Siemens will not support you","review":"I own the previous model system with four handsets. The base station display failed after the one year warranty period. To my utter suprize, Siemens will not service or support you in any way. For the first year they will send you a refurbished phone as a replacement but after that do not have a problem because there is no repair service, parts, or anything other than a service rep on the phone telling you, \\"I know it is lousy but I can not help.\\" They told me to buy a reburbished phone off of ebay. That was the total service advice of Siemens. I will not be replacing my 2420 with this new model nor will I waste my money on another non-supported Siemens product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away from any Siemens product","review":"I bought a Siemans 2420 for my home office. In two months there was a thunderstorm and it ddn't survive a power surge. The second unit was replaced by my company. From day one it clicked very loudly. People on the other end would ask \\"what is that clicking noise?\\" I would respond \\"it's my very expensive Siemen's phone.\\" Then the battery would drain quickly on the handsets after I had the unit for 8 months.

I made this mistake of forgiving them on the first iteration, only to see the same problems on the second. If you have the same experience as I, you'll begin to see the LCD fade after a year, maybe two. The handsets deteriorate in short order as well.

They then went on to inform me that since the phone is older than 12 months old my only recourse is to replace the base station (@ $250) this seems hardly an acceptable solution.

In concept, it is perfect for home based businesses! So I decided to still get the third one. I had it for two years now and the speaker phone reception is so poor that I no longer use it, the remote handset had to be unplugged because it was beeping without reason.

I would have expected a cordless handset designed to be less \\"sensitive\\" to drops - bad engineering. There is no option to fix the handset if you are out of warranty.

The first thing I noticed was that there was terrible feedback no matter how much adjustment I did with the volume on the receiver and on the unit I was connecting it to.

There was something broken off and rattling around inside one of the mics. The mics only worked intermittently.

Found that the transmission range is not anywhere near what is advertised, even in an outdoor setting with no obstructions. The batteries do not last very long, which wouldn't be a major problem if both mic's worked. Customer support is kinda shaky. Probably would not purchase another item from Pyle as a result of my overall satisfaction. I guess you get what you pay for. I bought and got something cheap.

In my own book \\"The Optimistic Jew: a Positive Vision for the Jewish People in the 21st Century\\" I posit that if they applied their energies to the \\"secular\\" Israeli they would have an opportunity to make their approach to Jewish identity a major social and cultural force in Israel.

The pirates want Edward's book because they're convinced it will show them where they buried their treasure, but Edward can't let them have it: it's a library book. I loved the story in this book, but I am not a huge fan of the illustrations. They are dark and blurry, and I don't think they made the greatest impact with the kids during story time.

The Rizzo family fights, makes up, fights again and all of this is made possible by Garcia and a first-rate supporting cast. The fact that Vince's teenage son has a passion for ultra fat New York women adds to the dysfunctional wonderment of the Rizzo family.\\"City Island\\" was recommended to me by a friend and it turned out even more loveable than I had anticipated.

The daughter is supposedly away attending college on a scholarship - actually she was kicked out for having pot and has taken up stripping to earn money to return to work.

It's a New York kind of tale that has really been told before. But there's such charm and passion here that I really enjoyed it.

I owned an earlier 2420 system and it was the best. I bought a used 8825 system with 4 handsets. The sound clarity is terrible. Range is not as good as earlier 2420 system. Terrible clicking sound on all handsets. Despite all of these issues, however, the most terrible problem is that when the base system (8825) is fried by a storm or surge, there is no way to use the cordless handsets (I have 4). There is no way to repair them and Siemens has no answers or tells one where to get service. Siemens told me when they get one back that is under warranty, they send out new ones. I told the technician that they have to know who fixes the refurbished phones but they claim they do not. So, I had to spend another $250.00 to get another used base system in order to use my 4 cordless phones. No technical repair support has caused me not to ever consider Siemens phones again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these...if there's wireless anywhere near","review":"I have a set of three Siemens 2.4 GHz phones (my mistake to buy all at once).

She has pushed every button on on all four of them, dunked one in a cup of juice, and threw one onto the tile floor. They all still work fine. I wouldn't buy any other brand.I've had expensive Sony and Panasonic phone systems that didn't even come close to the Siemens.I agree with the other satisfied Siemens owners here--if reading directions for electronic equipment isn't your forte a simpler system might be for you.

I found the advise and methods in it extreamly sensible and user friendly. I have only been potting for a couple of years, and found much to learn. There are chapters on clay, glazing, decorating, method for wheel and hand building, and much more.

This book does a wonderful job in describing what the average city and farm person went through in his normal daily grind back in the year 1000. The author paints a rich, detailed picture of what the life was like from the food they ate to the set up of the common mans house. This is just a fun book to read.

There's nothing earthshaking here, but it's nevertheless a good read for those, like me, who have a general interest in history, particulary the history of the British Isles.Many history books focus solely on the goings-on of the King, the Queen, the major nobles and the court--they give us no picture of the lives of everyday people. The authors of this book give us nice picture of what everyday people lived like 1000 years ago. There are even a few surprises that overcame some of my misconceptions.If you're a professional historian (i.e., you like pedantry more than readability), you'll probably hate this book. On the other hand, if you are looking for a short, illuminating look at life at the beginning of the last millenium, I think you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snippets of Information","review":"The Year 1000 by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger has some interesting facts peppered throughout taken from a number of varied sources but most of the book is so light that it can float away, often while reading it. It takes the reader through a year in the life of an Englishman, although it sometimes feels more like the author's interests than the interests of the average medieval Englishman are presented. This book will not interest the person with more knowledge of the medieval period and could give a distorted vision of this time for the non-buff and leave the reader with more questions than answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Year 1000","review":"Purchased for my grand-daughter to read as part of her honors class summer reading.

The mixture of Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, & Danish peoples and customs intermingles to create what became the English language and culture. The year 1000 was the very beginning of that mixture. I found the book to be engaging in the way it is written, not too scholarly - written for the lay person and provides interesting anecdotes of everyday life at the first millenium. The conditions that our ancestors lived seem awful, but proves the amazing adaptability of human beings. Though living conditions have changed, seems that basic human motivations were essentially the same.I also enjoyed how the authors from time to time explain the history of common English words we use today & how they developed from this era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"If you are looking for a dvd of yoga exercises to reduce your blood pressure, don't waste your money on this one.

They don't give you enough time to complete the poses before moving on to the next one in the hour long dvd. You'd have to memorize all the poses and do them on your own to get the full benefit. The most annoying thing of all is the horrible music that plays so loudly you cannot hear the voice over instructions. Plus, the copy I got would not play on my DVD player and would only partially play on my computer. I was extremely disappointed with this product.

I was bothered that the focus is on the life and death of Gary and not nearly as much on the people he killed.

I felt the book was long, but I don't know what parts could have been left out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of the Pulitzer Prize","review":"Hands-down the finest piece of journalism I have ever read. The story of Gary Gilmore has a practically infinite number of issues and sub-issues and Mailer just nails them all with a towering, Pulitzer-worthy effort. Rather than ramrod his own personal opinions, Mailer allows the Legal system, the Penal system, and the Media to define themselves.Perhaps the most gripping theme of the book is its portrayal of ordinary people performing under extraordinary pressure, especially Gilmore himself, who combines a fascinating dichotomy of homicidal violence with deep and intelligent introspection, and under extreme duress shows himself to be a man of unwavering and unimpeachable principle.Tirelessly researched and written in a reserved and simplistic manner, the book is simply astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best story of its kind","review":"I read \\"The Executioner's Song\\" when it first came out in 1979 and it still has the powerful punch today. The story grabs you and doesn't let go, and even though it is very long, it feels a bit shorter. The Kindle edition is easy to read and worth every penny, and certainly better than carrying around an 1100 page book. The only reason I give the book 4 stars (which is really 4 1/2) instead of 5 is that at the end of the book, for the last 200 pages or so, it tends to drag a bit. It is considered by some, including me, to be Mailer's best book. If you haven't read it and enjoy true crime drama, download it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long, Drawn Out Disappointment","review":"My low rating is by no means a commentary on what a prolific writer Norman Mailer is. And I also appreciate the complexities of telling this story and attempting to be as inclusive as possible- a task that Mailer completed more than successfully. However, the book never grabbed me. Some of the colloquial writing style bothered me (see use of the word \\"Now\\" to begins so many narrative sentences) and, with the book as long as it was, too many characters faded from view for large portions of the novel. Excellent telling of the story, but not as gripping as I had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"conjecture can be tiresome","review":"mr mailer's style of writing using conjecture to create moments in time in gary gilmore's life left me uninterested. the purpose, im sure was to lead the reader to the cause of the killer's actions but it did not work for me as I found the style of writing non-absorbing and too much of a drag to get through. I put the book down after 100 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sympathetic treatment of a murderer, but still gripping","review":"Norman Mailer paints a much too sympathetic portrait of a man who blamed his upbringing and the dominant society for his problems and actions. The narrative is engaging, but Gilmore is made to be the hero of the story in the rather one-sided account. Based on historical value, the book is probably necessary reading, but the end result left me uneasy. Times have changed a little here in Utah County, but the climate still does not regularly spawn murderous acts, as the novel appears to insinuate. Aside from these problems, however, the book, to be fair, is gripping and difficult to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS WATCHING GRASS GROW!","review":"This is the most long-winded book I have ever read!

I lost interest almost immediately, but this is \\"classic literature\\" right, so I gave it a chance. This is the most long-winded account I have ever read. Norman Mailer must have been paid per word. I really don't understand the rave reviews, I would never recommend wasting the amount of time it takes to finish this book. The story could be told in ample detail in half the pages. Unless you enjoy reading about people that have nothing to do with the plot of the story, I would avoid this book at all costs...unless you need a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get This Book!","review":"Will someone please tell me why this book is significant? To me it is about a melodramatic loser who had many, many chances at turning himself around but chose not to. Another loser was Nicole, no intelligence, no common sense, and no courage. I wouldn't want to know any of these people and I couldn't care less what happened to them. Why is it more important to focus so much more on the criminal than on his victims and their families. Why even write about this guy, he is not interesting and in his whole life did not do one positive thing. I didn't feel anything but relief at finishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words","review":"A heart wrenching story that got drowned in too many irrelevant details.

Guralnick neither overly praises nor denegrates Presley's actions, but instead offers the reader as true an account as possible. The author does an excellent job of showing who influenced Elvis, both before and after he hit it big. I'm a-gonna' start Volume 2 as soon as I can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding - as if the author and Elvis were Siamese twins","review":"One of the best biographies I have ever read. Detailed, sensitive, written with just the right mix of empathy and detachment a biographer needs. I know two people who are about Elvis' age and grew up with him. Both of them say that the chapters dealing with the King's upbringing in Tupelo and his years at the Lauderdale Courts read like they have been written by someone who grew up with him. If you have only the slightest interest in Elvis, Memphis, Southern history, or American popular culture, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get on board! Elvis Presley is unbelievably great.","review":"I first read this while working as a convenience store clerk, and Guralnick's stories were so powerful that I hardly wanted to stop and sell lottery tickets! \\"Last Train to Memphis\\" shows the vulnerable, insecure Presley who transformed his wide musical background into a tsunami of energy. The book also focuses (justifiably) on Scotty Moore, Bill Black and DJ Fontana, the band members who made the music swing behind their whirling frontman. Just thinking about this book makes me want to swivel my hips too! Swivelling like Elvis, I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunk o Burnin Love","review":"This dude can write. A labor of love. He re-creates what Elvis did, day by day by day by day in his early years.Didn't know this, but right after he got out of high school and was trying to make a name for himself at the VFW Dance Hall - Country Fair - Amarillo Texas Jamboree type gigs, Elvis did A LOT of touring! Playing in small clubs, all over the South, night after night after night after night after night. So some of this gets a little tedious. But not much. This dude - Gurlanick - can write like nobody's downchild. A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Elvis book (s) to date","review":"This is the book that Elvis deserved. Written with respect and reverence while not ignoring the \\"warts\\", this and the sequel CARELESS LOVE form a picture of the artist as much as the celebrity. The basics of the story are well known and oft repeated but Peter Guralnick has done a masterful job of painting a portrait of a life in turmoil. There are passages in this book that will bring tears to your eyes.Most importantly (I Think) is that it brings us the story of the man instead of the legend and I for one found that much more interesting.Diana Mercer is the co-author of Your Divorce Advisor and her company is [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLANT","review":"THIS IS AN EXCELLANT BOOK ON ELVIS' LATER YEARS (AFTER GERMANY AND MILITARY SERVICE).

There is no debating the research or the depth of Guralnick's knowledge about his subject. But knowledge does not a great writer make. This book seems widely praised for its lack of interest in soap opera detail, but that's what I was craving. I wanted a big, salacious, fat smorgasbord. This was a salt-less and dry chicken breast.

This is fine when questions are geography- or culture-related, and for die-hard Race fans, even the trivia questions pertaining to racers from the show are acceptable. However, in the case of Detours, players blindly pick one of two options, and one option allows players to move forward further than the others.The game is entertaining for people who follow the show faithfully, but for players more interested in the board game itself, the blind luck involved in Detours and the inclusion of show-specific trivia questions is a turn-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo mejor en video de la musica Norte?a...","review":"Hola raza, yo tengo el video y lo he visto, es uno de los mejores videos que he visto, en este genero musical, felicidades a los Tucanes de Tijuana; lastima que ya no lo esten produciendo m��s, ya que yo compre otros mas aqui en Amazon.com y espero que lo vuelvan a sacar a la venta que mucha gente se quedo con las ganas de comprarlo, pero tambien para la raza que no sabe todavia, ya esta otro video calientito a la venta, haci que veamos como les va con este y apresurense a verlo ok...

They claim to have a warranty on their products, but there is literally NO WAY to get them to repair or replace a product. If you call their support number, you get an automated system with no option to talk to an operator. Instead, the system gives you an e-mail address.

If you wanted to listen to it quietly at work, however, it was a problem. As soon as the satellite radio was connected, the radio started making a very loud and obnoxious buzzing/humming noise. I'm assuming something wasn't grounded correctly or something, but if you tried to put to music on quietly, the buzzing/humming noise simply overpowered it. If you plan to have your music on at a higher volume (high enough to drown out the buzzing noise), though, this radio works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Dark Music","review":"Darklore Manor features very good dark music.

The author looks at the primary sources critically and attempts to draw out the probable scenarios of the major points of the war. Personally I thought he did a great job regarding that. He has many maps at the end of the book so you can find out where the major action is happening without any problems.

Hannibal was defeated by Scipio because: 1) Scipio was his intellectual superior; 2) Scipio was his miltary superior; 3) Scipio was his moral superior; and 4) Scipio was a citizen of a country that he, Scipio, actually loved and was dedicated to.

What on earth are Hyperion playing at? I notice that the rot set in when Tony Faulkner was replaced by Simon Eadon on piano recordings. The sound is thin and completely unresonant in the bass, and some kind of dreadful digital, piercing, pianola-like plinkety plonk in the treble. Just listen to the closing minute or so of the fourth scherzo! It is such a shame as the sound on Hough's earlier recordings for Hyperion was exemplary (listen to the Liszt sonata and the Franck discs for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELEGANCE","review":"Next to the Nocturnes, the Ballades and the Scherzos are my favorite works by Chopin. I own many fine recordings of both works. Stephen Hough's recording of the Ballades and Scherzos has become, to me, \\"Dessert Island\\" material. He plays the works with sublime elegance and poetry. There is no shortage of bravura; however, he plays the works with much introspection. I \\"felt the music\\" in my soul. Bravo Mr. Hough!The recording is wonderful. The Hyperion lable proves once again why it is considered the \\"Rolls Royce\\" of labels."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, salonish performances","review":"I've enjoyed many of Stephen Hough's performances in the past, particularly his delightful \\"Albums,\\" his Hummel and his Mendelssohn. But in this case, he reduces some of Chopin's greatest music to salon proportions. Virtually every work here is ruined by incessant toying with phrasing and tempo and the disclosing of nonexistent inner voices. At one point in the first scherzo he suddenly begins playing at half tempo! Nor is his technique impressive. The octaves in the third scherzo, for example, are clumsy. To boot, the sound on this cd is cold and remote, far below Hyperion's usual standards. I'm sure Hough will produce much better discs than this careless production in the future. But avoid this disc and stick with Moravec and Perahia in the Ballades and Rubinstein and Richer in the scerzi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic","review":"I agree with Mr. Steiger, and he says it so well I won't belabor the point. My reaction to this recording is that the playing here is erratic and spastic, and that Mr. Hough was merely trying to sound innovative or \\"different\\" so that listeners would imagine he was presenting a well-thought out interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"well they are good socks, but what else can be said, socks are socks are socks, I am satisfied with them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Galveston","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books!

I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice mechanical swiss movement watch","review":"took this to my jeweler to get it sized for my wrist. He said it was an excellent Swiss mechanical movement; worn it for several days and its movement and spring last much longer than 24 hours and keeps excellent time; the cantilever clasp takes some getting used to close the watch, particularly after the slack is taken out of the band; I use my chin to pin the watch to my wrist while I manipulate the clasp to snap it closed. The first time I could not do it, and that's when I had to resort to using my chin to hold the band in place...it can be done. The cantilever closure must be a \\"safety\\" so that the watch will not fall off the wrist if the snap becomes undone.At first it seems daunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entry Swiss Automatic","review":"After 2 month of research I settled on the Le Locle. This is the best price/value watch on the market.I originally wanted leather band but since I am living in the South I decided to go with stainless steel. Apparently leather bands get pretty smelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"it stops frequently","review":"The watch looked good, but there are two problems. First, when I opened the box the moment i received it, i found there were no warranty card and no user's manual except two flyes about the watch. Second and the most important problem is that in the past few days the watch stops frequently without movements after some short time. I wore the watch every time and everywhere, even when i was having a bath or when i was playing basketball, but still i found it stopped at 3 o'clock one morning, and 5 another morning, and 7 another morning. Therefore, I didn't know what the time is when i woke up and I had to adjust the watch everyday i opened my eyes. I wonder what is wrong with it and what i can do with that. Thanks a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame of TIssot","review":"Only after 1 month's normal wear, a gear dropped from the caliber (ETA 2824-2) and sticked inside, I sent it back to Amazon 6 weeks before but it's still under working~! Never buy it and I will never buy a Tissot watch again~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value","review":"For an automatic Swiss Made watch, this is among the least costly you'll find. The good and bad with this is the watch is Swiss Made, but the refinement and overall feel is below more costly Swiss watches. The watch a great old school look to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but powerful","review":"I'm using the Minivee in a great room (18'x 23' + vaulted ceiling) with a Polk Surroundbar 50. The Surroundbar needs major assistance below 100hz. My search for the right sub was not easy, I wanted something that could rumble during movies, but also provided clean, tight musical bass. My budget was under $750, so that ruled out the small Sunfire subs. After trying several other subs, and returning them, I decided to give the Minivee a shot.The Minivee handles movies and music equally well. Action scenes have the rumble we love to hear and feel. Music has a solid, well defined low end that is completely missing with the Surroundbar by itself. But neither music nor movies have that bloated, annoying bass that many less expensive subs produce.Ounce for ounce and dollar for dollar the Minivee is in a class by itself. This little beast has impressed me, my family and quite a few visitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The little woofer that could!","review":"We had to turn/tone it down a little because my wife was on sensory overload from the rumble and base this thing puts out!

Ury's SECRETS OF THE SCREEN TRADE is the most comprehensive, concise, and accessible of them all.This book has been an invaluable resource for the script I am working on now, and I know it will be worn and dog-eared before too long as I refer back to it over and over again on future projects.Oh, and by the way -- it's also a \\"GREAT READ\\" -- as a screenwriter, I can offer no higher praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing a trail yet to be followed","review":"It is unfortunate that Saccharine Trust ,in this classic incarnation, broke up shortly after the release of this album...a pioneering,trailblazing release..way ahead of the curve.. where punk and jazz sensibilities meld as to make such distinctions irrelevant..a crowning achievement which has yet to take its place as the visionary,forward thinking masterpiece that it is...Brewer/Baiza...musical gold"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Available on CD","review":"This is a terrific album by one of the seminal punk/fusion bands of the 1980s. The songs are saturated with desperation, fear and longing.

The best thing about this album? Many of the songs here are two minutes or less. Other than that, \\"Vision Valley\\" doesn't even merit a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically unlistenable","review":"I have all of The Vines work and generally buy it without hearing it because I consider them to be one of the better bands recording today. After Vision Valley, I will have to reconsider. I don't have a problem with the length of the songs or the album, as a whole, but the quality is lacking. If \\"Spaceship\\" had not made the album, there would be nothing redeeming about the album, whatsoever. None of the other tracks would even compete for space on either of the previous two albums. Its like an album of studio filler to keep the record exec.s happy.I wish all of them well, but in the unlikely event of another album I wouldn't buy it until I can preview it and see that they have returned to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Vines","review":"There's nothing new here, and the CD is way too short. However, this is The Vines and I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're kidding, the cd's over already????","review":"the vines previous albums haven't exactly been long or drawn out.. and here they go for quality not quantity when it comes to their 13 tracks. the album totals just of 31 minutes, which every time i think about it, it sounds more outlandish that i spent almost 15 dollars on 30 minutes of music. oh well. the songs are more of the same, which in this case is alright. i wasn't expecting the reinvention of the wheel here. the vines are best when they play with the volume up at 11, or drop it down on an acoustic number with plenty of harmonies. and this album has plenty of harmonies. overall, it's not as good as \\"winning days,\\" yet i find it a step above \\"highly evolved.\\" the music here is by a band that doesn't care too much about pleasing the masses, and they recorded a short and to the point album here. it works on most levels.. i'd recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on people","review":"In the time it took me to read the reviews I just figured out half of this album out on guitar, and I'm not that great a guitar player. I know everyone wants to take the \\"genius\\" angle on this band because Craig Nicholls has a syndrome, but face the facts, this music isn't that great. Now don't get me wrong, I think every Vines album to date has a few very good studio tracks that are nice to listen to and seem to decrease in numbers per album, but the rest of the albums are very flat. Not to mention these guys couldn't recreate the sound on the albums live if they had to. For anyone to compare this band to The Strokes is laughable. Highly Evolved had a few good songs and piqued my interest, but I have been very disappointed since then. This album adds to that. I have no ill will towards this band and hope they do well, but there is better music out there people. Why waste your time? They were more interesting when they toured and he had meltdowns on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many F bombs and fiddling about.","review":"I have made it to 36% in this book. I hate that I spent my money to be reading so many F bombs and fiddling about. Please can we have ratings on the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I brought it because it was a Kentucky writer, and many novels set in Kentucky and authored by Kentuckians are usually well written. However, this novel shifted from African American language to current language, which makes it appear to be grammatically incorrect.The author just did not seem to have a grasp of character development, and the plot lines were not discernible. I believe this to be just a narrative of some family events which could have more developed and the stories more rich. Furthermore, when writing about real life, sometimes it gets buried under the mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull","review":"Wonderfull short stories. But they kept you wanting more. I would like to see some of the stories made into a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source of historical facts; no theory or analysis","review":"What Segrave does, he does well, and this is to conduct thorough archival research. The book is a straightforward re-presentation of this material, without much embellisment by Segrave. His chapters are paired examinations of somewhat arbitrarily defined eras - \\"practices\\" over several decades is met in the next chapter with \\"responses\\" to these practices over the same decades. This provides what little structure the book has, and doesn't contribute much analytically.This book is a solid introduction to media-recorded historical events and attitudes concerning tipping in the U.S., and a good general factual background on that. A must for any serious research on tipping. However, anyone looking for any sort of theory or analysis must look elsewhere, as Segrave is very deliberately focused on one thing - \\"just the facts, please\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not the best of. Who picks these episodes anyway?","review":"If they took all of the really great episodes from the four \\"best of\\" videos, they could fit them all onto one video. But then, they wouldn't make so much money off us Friends fans, would they? The only reason to reach for this tape is for episode 1 (\\"The One Where No One's Ready\\"), episode 3 (\\"The One With Ross's Wedding\\") and #5 (\\"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\\"). Episode #2 (\\"The One With the Embryos\\") has got to be one of the most monotonous ever made. Episode #4 wears thin after the first few minutes. Not worth it in my opinion, but feel free to take your chances."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? They're planning the entire season release???","review":"Well, that sort of irks me, but still, this dvd set is very funny. The best part to me, as an audiophile, is that the series has been remastered in dolby digital (although 5.0, not 5.1). My only complaint is the whole deleted scenes claim. I have NO idea which scenes were in the original and which ones were not. i wish they'd give you some sort of clue, whether it be an extra in the dvd or a pop up icon (like the rabbit in the matrix) to let you know.If you like friends and you don't want to wait for the season releases, pick this up. It's fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's all? Where are the seasons?","review":"I was hugely disappointed when I saw this DVD, as in Europe you can buy the *entire series* on DVD! And what do you do with a best of that does not show this brilliant series in its entirety? Well, you won't have such a good time! If you can, get the DVDs from overseas or somewhere in America, this best of compilation is only for those who thing \\"a little Friends will do\\". The 1 star does not say anything about the content, because each of the episodes are brilliant, but it says something about how terrible it is, that the entire series is not available and that this is what any Friends fan should look out for. If you think \\"a little Friends will do\\" go for it, 5 stars. For everybody else: don't and write to Warner Bros to release the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Watch it on UPN, stupid!!!","review":"UPN keep Re Re Running all the episodes already...just tape it and you dont have to waste 30 . Personally I saw the rebroadcast of all these episodes at least twice already...so dont buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unutterably Revolting","review":"As the title of this review suggests, it is very hard for me to express in words how vile this set of programs is. The series presents a vacuous approach to the comic, creating a tediously secure and trivial set of uninteresting bores who converse dully for half an hour to rid teenagers of their angst for said period of time. The rock interludes are sickening, again attempting to justify the boringly shallow existences of the irritating protagonists. I despise this series for a plethora of reasons: it is boring, not at all comic, trivial and vapid. Utterly dire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good attempt to please Friends' collectors.","review":"It's hard to please everyone when you only pick up 10 episodes out of more than 100. This selection is great (but I wouldn't have included \\"The one with the poker\\"). Are there any great episodes missing? Sure, just to name a few (I don't know the correct names, sorry): season finale 3 (on the beach house), season finale 5 (Las Vegas), the one where Rachel and Ross break up, and so on. It's quite probable that we'll get vols. 3 & 4 pretty soon.It's great to have these Friends DVD's, but they're not that good if you think they have released the whole series (6 seasons) in Europe & Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark King","review":"My wife loves friends, so I bought her the Amazon double dvd version. I have no problem with content, but come on..its a high level VHS transfer..just do a freeze frame anywhere on the discs and enjoy the blur. Colors are vivid, but it is blurry for a dvd release, and poor product for the price. I A/B'ed the dvd with a broadcast rerun (on direct tv) and found the clarity to be inferior, in fact poor. A first run broadcast of a new episode puts this set to shame. Don't buy it. I want my money back. Mark King in Atlanta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Episodes, but already available","review":"This set of Friends, has some of the best episodes like \\"The one with two parts,\\" but the only problem, Is your going to pay [$$$] for six episodes that are aready available in the Season 1 and 2 boxs sets.

Disc 2: The One Where No One's Ready, The One With the Embryos, The One With Ross's Wedding (One Hour), The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks, and The One Where Everybody Finds Out.

In Europe, Japan, and Taiwan, a complete collection of every season, including every episode, is everywhere. That's what we call collection. I don't get why people in The States and Canada don't get to have equal access to those DVDs yet. There are only 6 or 7 episodes in each volume. I don't deny those are of the best ones. Yet to a fan, every episode is remarkable and thus shouldn't have ever been left out. If you get this two-volume DVD set, you're going to be trapped into the following situations: Where's the episode I miss the most? Or Where's the one I happened to miss because I was late that night when it was on TV? You don't want to be in such a scene, do you? So, here's the advice from someone who's been there: DON\\"t GET THEM. BE PATIENT. WAIT FOR THE COMPLETE COLLECTION TO BE RELEASED. However, if you just can't wait, the product may save your life for the time being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD package....","review":"If you are a fan of the tv show Friend's then you should own this.

It is a good size for kids parents who don't like big toys in their house. This toy also comes with a new feature that allows you to snap the body together so the slinky part of the dog will not break. Some disadvantages of this keychain is that the slinky dog is a little top heavy and won't stand, and to warn people who want to buy this toy, to not stretch the slinky too far or it might break,try to avoid giving this toy to little kids, and must be played with, with gentle care.

I've tried, for over 5 years, everything I could find, both prescriptions and herbal remedies, with no success. Some things would work for a week or so and then the rash would return with a vengence while using the product. A friend of mine told me about Dr. Christopher's herbs so I gave this ointment a try. I have been using it for over a month now with great success!! Her skin is no longer red and irritated. I am so pleased!! I stopped using it for a week to see if the rash was healed. It was not. But when I started using the ointment again, the rash calmed down and her skin returned to a healthy state. Although it hasn't \\"healed\\" the cause of the rash, it is certainly keeping it calm and under control. Dr. Christopher's Complete Tissue and Bone Ointment has done the trick so far. I hope it will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed.","review":"I've been applying the \\"complete tissue and bone\\" to my left leg's varicose veins and the spider veins on my left ankle for one month now.

Every night before bed when we say, \\"Do you want to read a book?\\" he immediately goes to the bookshelf and seeks this one out! He loves it so much--he's ripped the wiper blade off twice now so have had to reglue- :) He laughs at the \\"Move on back\\" and \\"Shh Shh Shh\\" :) it's so enjoyable too for adults- well crafted book, this one will DEFINITELY be one we keep in mind for gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"another child.... another copy","review":"Before my first child was born, I was given The Wheels on the Bus as a shower gift.

Since he was 6mths old, he would sit through the whole book happily and wide-eyed. He is now 14mths old and would actively use his 'give-me' baby sign and point specifically for this book. He flips it over and over again; recently, began tugging lovingly at the taps to make the bus driver's head move. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite book!","review":"My two year old can not get enough of this book. We must read it at least 10 times a day.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pop-up book version of the song","review":"We first saw this book in a kindermusik class this previous winter, and my two-year-old son seemed to enjoy when it was read aloud.

Our son loves being able to interact with the lyrics as we sing. The book is very durable and has held up well to a lot of abuse. I couldn't recommend this book more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for children","review":"This is a most beautifully illustrated book. It turns a song that can become boring for adults after singing it 100 times into a beuatiful story about a dog chasing a bus, a lost kitten, crying babies, soothing mothers, and wheels that literally turn round and round. There are hidden stories within the story. A wonderful investment for a child's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!!!","review":"My 22 month old, loves this book.

Of course, I have to supervise him because he is always reaching for them and wanting to handle them.

We look at it every morning for a half hour before breakfast and then for another half hour after naptime. This is about the only time in the day that my son will cuddle with me so I am very grateful for such a wonderful, interactive book. He loves to point to the kitties in the box on the bus and also to the dog that chases the bus.

This album was their last studio recording, made just before guitarist D Boon was killed in an auto accident, and it shows an innovative underground band maturing into a great rock band. Their left-wing politics targeted the foreign policy excesses of the Reagan years, but the politics never got in the way of the music, and, in fact, was one of the sources of its greatness because it fueled their artistry. Boon and bassist Mike Watt trade explosive riffs throughout this set.

It was torn and damaged during shipment. Now for the good part- I visited a carseat saftey check at a local mall(provided by the GA State Patrol), after tring to install the seat in 4 automobiles (including my own) I was told that this carseat is not safe or suitable for any type of car!!!!!!!!

DON'T do the same! Like others have said, it has a tendency to tip. As an employee I can't tell people the bad things about this seat, and I cringe everytime someone buys one. We've had people come in that had the fire department or the police department try to install it for them and couldn't get it in tight enough to be secure. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS SEAT! I want your children to be safe, as I'm sure you do, they may be cute and they may be Eddie Bauer, but they are NOT safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS!","review":"My son tipped over in this carseat!

Also the car seat itself was a lot heavier than other infant car seats which was difficult for me to carry my infant around and finally since I couldn't use the base, I was supposed to use the shoulder belt method to secure it but my seat belt wasn't long enought to reach around the car seat so I couldn't properly use it.

The next day another fell out. I'm going to call that number that was on one of the reviews to see about getting my money back or something. I bought this with the stroller thinking its eddie bauer it has to be good. With both items I spent over 200 dollars. I already tried to take it back to babies r us.

The energy was incredible. I heard the album (yes, remember those big vinyl discs) on college radio one night and was blown away. I feel Grant Hart was too overshadowed by Bob Mould. His songs really shine on New Day Rising and he has more pop sensibilities then Mould with songs like \\"the Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill\\" and \\"Books About UFO's\\". These are some of the most memorable hooks buried deep in the 80's portion of my brain. If you are too young to remember Husker Du you need to buy this CD. Without this band their would be no Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Green Day , etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, I give it 4.5 stars....","review":"This is the one Husker Du album fans of the group either think is their true masterpiece or their worst ever. It's neither. It's simply a kick-ass Husker Du album. Recorded and released barely a year after Zen Arcade, the 15 songs on this album range from some of their best (New Day Rising, Girl Who Lives On Heaven Hill, Celebrated Summer, Books About UFOs, I Don't Know What You're Talking About) to some of their more quirky songs (59 Times the Pain, How to Skin a Cat, Whatcha Drinkin').

The farily good recommendations sold me on it to the point that to save on shipping I purchased 200 bags. It does not taste anything like the Oolong I am used to drinking at Chinese restuarants and other brands that are much tastier and aromatic. The aroma is off for Oolong and the tea tastes like hot water with an off taste.Using two bags to a cup doesn't help. The other folks giving this tea high marks obviously never had Oolong tea before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing prime about this Koch set","review":"This set literally steals the image from earlier (1980s and early 90s) laserdisc and video editions put out by David Shepard and Kino-- so clumsily it leaves on a credit for Shepard's accompanist when in fact there's a new score on it! Stay away from this cheapie and look for the latest Shepard/Blackhawk Films restorations of the same titles, which have much better print quality-- plus you'll be supporting the people who do the real restoration work, not bootleggers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre book creates a foggy picture","review":"What striked me as odd in this book is the background of it's author: Medicine and IT.My skepticism unfortunatelly proves well founded.The book is built around a quite simplified example of a bike shop that fails to clear things up.The writer spends much time explaining technological advances in broad terms and less time with the marketing aspect of CRM.It contains no case studies.Too introductory.It will give you some understanding of CRM but limited.All in all i did not find it a helpfull book on the subject .Only for execs with no touch with current technologies as a starting point, not good from a marketing perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revlon Cream Shadows to use as a base","review":"* I use the Revlon Cream Shadows to use as a base* They provide a sufficient pigmentation for a base* I always use my Revlon, L'Oreal or MAC eyeshadows over it.* A good find for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shadow","review":"I love this product. Its different from many other standard powdered eye shadows because its a creme. It applies easily and evenly. You can apply it with your fingertip, but I prefer to use an eye shadow brush (not those little sponges that come with most shadows, but an actual brush). Using the brush seems to help the color last longer and prevents creasing.The Not Just Nudes set is my favorite so far, you can use any of the four colors and achive a very natural look. I always try to keep my makeup fresh and natural looking... nothing too heavy... and this shadow is perfect for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and creamy without creasing.","review":"This is a combination of soft natural colors that blend easily. The colors can be worn with a sheer translucent look or applied a little heavier for a darker creamier depth. It didn't irritate my eyes and didn't crease. The color lasts all day and still looks rich with color at days end. Washes off easily with facial cleanser. One of my staple favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"I have turned frequently to this little volume this year with Hermeneutics, Homelitics and Exegesis classes and it has been invaluable! I actually have two copies: one at my desk and another where I often sit to read and prepare. They are filled with notes and highlighting to remind of the key points.

I purchased two of these a few months back thinking that they looked pretty heavy duty, had a bunch of useful spray patterns, and were less than $10 each.Right off the bat, the pressure that makes it through this is lacking, compared to the older nozzle I was replacing on the same pattern settings (and on the same hose with the valve opened up full). Not horrible, just not as good.After just two months of these being outside (in Florida) they both started leaking from the nozzle. I guess the seals on the triggers are pretty weak, so now after just two months and approximately $15 down the drain, I will be replacing these things.Needless to say, don't waste your money on these Nelson nozzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite Imagination Builder!","review":"I teach kindergarten and my students have always loved this book.

This is a wonderful book, especially for little boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"More expensive than informative.","review":"Weather and energy derivatives constitute a 'hot' topic in the derivatives market with new articles, reviews and websites sprouting everywhere. So, this book may seem a timely publication on the topic, given the fact that there are very few publications available on this topic.However, unless you know nothing about the subject, I do not recommend to buy this book: timeliness seems to be its only quality.Most articles are descriptive of products and markets and contain little information of interest to risk managers / traders / insurance professionals working in the field. The article on options is a general article on Black Scholes with little or no relevance to energy or weather derivatives.In brief, it looks as if this book were written for purely commercial purposes. Definitely not worth its high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel's video helped me fly fish five times better","review":"This DVD is so helpful.

Now, after having read this lively book, it will be impossible for me to look at a baby's fingers wrapped around mine, a huddle of penguins, or an elephant's ears in quite the same way. By explaining the vital role that temperature plays in the creation and perpetuity of all living things, Blumberg has enriched my understanding of and appreciation for life on Earth. From fevers, fire walkers, fish, and flowers to panting, pelicans, penguins, and polar bears, the information is shared in a clear and entertaining fashion.I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who regulates heat internally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical stories that captivate children & adults.","review":"It's a must read for people interested in latin american folklore, mythology and man's battle with nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for easy 2nd language reading","review":"I speak Spanish fairly fluently as a second language, but trying to read in Spanish can be so tiresome sometimes.

It is misleading. The author obviously has never had a real life confrontation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best!","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book does something that very few self-defense books can, it gets the reader thinking about how they might possibly use their environment to protect themselves. However, the author demonstrates some \\"iffy\\" self-defense techniques with a hodgepodge of improvised items. Having taught realistic improvised weapon use for close to 10 years I can tell you that some of the techniques in this book could actually be more dangerous to the reader than the attacker.I might recommend this title for some ideas on the use of improvised weapons but would not recommend the application of all of the weapons covered or the techniques demonstrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for the laughs!","review":"I've got an edition of this book that advocates taking a plastic drinking straw and jamming it into the heart. Seriously.How about removing the light cover from the indoor dome light of your car? Jam that into your attacker!This is by far one of the worst self defense books every written. For that reason alone, it's worth looking at. It's so bad it's hysterically funny.Now I'm sending one of my martial arts students over to McDonald's to get drinking straws.

I'd suggest getting that cd and then if you really like it, then think about getting this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most interesting","review":"I didn't really like the book and the author seems to reiterate information from her different books into others. I had just borrowed the book from the library as well as the book on Grace Kelly and neither this or the book on Grace had any pictures to speak of and any author who cannot be resourceful enough to get pictures to include in the biography is lazy or did not try hard enough...others have been able to so why can't she?

At times, he seems racist even. The worst thing about this book is how out-of-date the information is, especially in regard to IMGs. There are thousands of successful IMGs in this country yet he is very discouraging. Guess what, Iserson? if it wasn't for USIMGs and IMGs there'd be severe doctor shortages in this country.

I also feel that after reading the book, I have a much better understanding of the fellowships and residencies, as well as how to schedule my rotations for my third and fourth years.Very comprehensive.

In going through my music to see what treasures are so essential that they must be replaced, this was way high on the list. (So was another of the incomparable Snow's work, Something Real.)Snow's VOICE is impossible to easily characterize, so I won't try.

Whatever the emotion of the song, she captures it completely and conveys it so intensely that you experience it as your own.That is artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phoebe Snow revisited","review":"This album blew me away when first released,it became a constant sound track for a chapter in my life.

Here selections are thought provoking, musically challenging, and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest EVER","review":"This album is as fresh today as it was in 1975 -- the essence of a true classic. The minimal and tasteful production enhance what has proven to be one of the Greatest Voices in popular music -- right up there with Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Leontyne Price. The songs -- mostly written by Phoebe -- are keen and beautiful poetic observations, and are in a class by themselves. The players on this record, including Zoot Sims and The Persuasions, and Phoebe herself on guitar, are first-rate. This recording is a must for any fan of great music.

They were doing things no one was doing, or was even capable of doing. However I've long wished that Ginn would re-mix this album. I think every aspect of its sound would benefit, including Ginn's guitar.Mostly what Black Flag did, especially in their later albums, was ingratiate themselves to the disaffected. The vibe of this album, for me at least, was the evolution of that ethos. Early on, the ethos was: 'The world sucks and no one knows you'. With this album, the caveat added at the end of that true-ism, is that you are responsible for what you do, and that you can't be the things you hated that were done to you without also becoming the evil of the world.That meant a lot to me when I was 15 and could not have articulated it.

But if the title of said song is the actual purpose of said song, then I suppose it did it's job. The rest of the album is not as tedious as the first song, however, that does not say a whole lot. The album, as a whole, sounds weak; some of the songs are too long, some of the songs are too slow, some of the songs are too long and too slow (\\"The Process of Weeding Out\\" comes to mind), and some of the songs just don't hit as hard as they should.

I believe the novel is based on the Oakland County Child Killer, who was running amok during this time period.The serial murders are not the focus of the book; rather, it is the impact of the murders on the three children in this book that drive the plot. Many years later, one of those children, now grown up, goes back to the area to find one of the other children, and hopefully bring some closure to things.It's a dark and chilling novel--sometimes too dark and chilling for its own good. It's also confusing at times when the plot jumps from the 1970's to the 1990's, and back again. This is not a book to be read lightly--it demands your full attention--but I still recommend it. I'll be interested to see what Hirshberg comes up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circle of Eight","review":"Mountain Dew Makes Films?

I just wish the episodes were longer than 5-7 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition of Book Ordered","review":"I am not happy with this product. I ordered, and paid for, a NEW book! This book was dingy, and smelled as if it had been in a garage or cellar for a long time. It was damp and the pages smelled of mildew. I am not exaggerating. I'm thinking of putting some Febreeze on it, as I'm just hoping the smell is not harming my health. I'm a law student, and I needed this book fast - so I have to keep it, and use it. But clearly, I'm not satisfied. And unless, the seller, fixes this and sends me another book that is (in fact) new. I will NOT recommend using this seller to anyone of my fellow students, friends, colleagues or co-workers.This is unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Quick and fast shipping! Exactly what I ordered! The book is informative and contain lot of information regarding all aspects of criminal law.

In fact the amount of errors is so massive in each of their books I actually vowed to never buy a Triad Publication book again, but the inclusion of a CJ Henderson story in Return To Lovecraft Country made me pick the book up. Mr. Henderson's work is excellent as always, but the rest of the stories in this anthology are poorly written and make the book unworthy of its cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"After searching for works updating the Lovecraft mythos I thought that I'd be in for a treat when I happened upon this book. I was, in a word, disppointed. The book is poorly edited with numerous spelling and grammatical typos (probably in a rush to publish), its works are horribly derivative and sophmoric at best. I would go so far as to say that it cheapens Lovecraft's works and any true fan would be well advised to avoid this book. One exception I found was 'The Last Feat of the Harlequin' by Ligotti (unfortunatetly not even that salvages this book given the fact that I read it already in one of his anthologies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Of note only for the TED Klein tale, and \\"Last Feast of Harlequin\\" but these two tales have improved in far superior short story collections than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooh what a stinker..","review":"I reluctantly write this review, because I love everything else Tom Rapp has put out. On this record however, beautiful songs from the past get butchered. All the mystique that made e.g.'The Use of Ashes' so special becomes undone in these remakes. It hurts most when 'Snow Queen', once so fragile, is put on a rocking horse. The best thing about 'Familiar Songs' is the cover art, which led one to hope for another purse of pearls. Unfortunately, the music sits like an alien hybrid in the jacket - this album should've been called 'Familiar Jacket'. Tom's liner notes explain a lot, and I'm very appreciative of his decision to give the 'go ahead' on the re-release of this tainted album: it's such a notoriously twisted affair it had to see the light of day again sooner or later. So, with all due respect: for completists only - and I'm one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Classic","review":"Live, agressive, in your face punk rock classic.

A solid piece of late punk material."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got the 1 1/2","review":"Great album. By this point in Black Flag's career Rollins had become Rollins.

I realize 70's disco is getting re-hashed as a club music standard, woven into house music, with all the bells-n-whistles, and pleading vocals. Why? House music is not supposed to be clever/cute...This CD is one that might keep a party going -- after the crowd has been sufficiently \\"lubricated\\" -- but there's just nothing here that grabs me. The mixing is flawless, but song choice is annoying. Especially track 7 \\"Back Together\\" by Hardsoul feat. Ron Carroll. The singer's voice is hard on the ears. At one point he delivers a high-pitched moan over and over again. And this is a \\"club favorite\\"??This CD is out of my rotation instantly. If you're into this house-goes-disco stuff, Soulfuric In the House is far better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downtempo at the very best!!!!","review":"I get for sorprise with this cd, i thought that was good, but it's excellent, the mixes are very strong, no down songs, i like it even better than Miguel Migs, to be honest with you.

Thank you for this gem, and for keep the downtempo and house music at his very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this book","review":"After checking out this book from our library, we read it several times a day and can't wait to buy this one.

Dont waist your money.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used Once, Returned Promptly","review":"I used this phone once and put it back in its annoyingly complex packaging for return. To start, the handsets are poorly designed: on my first call I twice hung up on my callers since the \\"Off\\" button is located exactly where you would rest the phone against your cheek.Besides this, two of the three handsets had communication problems with the base, even when they were in direct sight of the base, such that they could not maintain a constant dial tone and kept cutting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone stinks","review":"Half of the time I cannot hear the other party unless I hang up this phone and talk on one of my old phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION: MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE","review":"Number entry from the handset keypad does not work properly. This evidences itself in 2 ways: 1. Long phone numbers, such as international, do not dial properly. 2. Keypad activated programs, like prescription refills, do not recognize the numbers. Otherwise the phone worked fine except the handset volume was very weak even with the enhancement turned on. But the number entry problem was extremely frustrating and a major issue for me. I returned the phone and bought a Uniden which seems to work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"great phone, lots of features","review":"This phone was exactly what I needed. I wanted a phone without an answering machine to put on a wall outlet. I wanted at least 1 extra handset that didn't need to be plugged into a phone jack. With this phone I got an extra one! Lots of cool features like the little antenna lights up in colors when it rings and several different ring tones. You can even assign different colors and rings to different callers. One thing I don't like too much is that there is not a typical sounding ring tone to choose from. There are no problems with signal strength or range of the phone. I have one handset upstairs and another in the basement and haven't had a problem with either one. The phone is pretty easy to program, but I did have to read the instruction booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt last","review":"It worked great for the first few months but as we are nearing the 4th month, I'm so exasperated! A previous Panasonic cordless phone I had was muffled for the person I was talking to. Apparently with this phone, they can hear my clearly but I can barely hear a word they are saying! Sometimes it is really hard to hear, and other times, it is downright impossible. Either way: TERRIBLE!! It is like having your TV on volume setting 1. You can hear there is some kind of faint noise...but you just cant make out anything being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Sound Volume - as Reported by Other Reviewers","review":"We have always considered Panasonic phones, and their other gear to be first rate, but the volume on these phones, even with all possible boost applied, is much too low. Other reviewers on the Target website have noted the same. We've returned them for a set of well-rated Uniden phones from Amazon and are hoping for better results. It's good that Amazon has a fair return policy that makes this kind of disappointment less annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Headset Phone Review","review":"This phone has no back light on the key pad. You can't see the key pad if you have to make a call in the middle of the night and or darkness. This is a big deal. Panasonic phones used to have back lit key pads.

Very difficult to hear - even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear. Missed call feature does not account for calls received on any of the other handsets. Programming is not as easy as many other brands. Those are just a few of my concerns. I'll pick a Uniden model next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This phone has it all as far as features - as long as you don't want to actually hear the people you're talking to! Worked good for about a week and then couldn't hear anyone. Buzzing and sounded like people were standing next to an electric tower. I tried several ways to fix the problem. Once I went back to my Uniden 2.4 Ghz, I could hear great.

There was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when I tried multiple jacks for the base.2.

I would not purchse this phone again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many failures - Can't recommend","review":"We purchased these phones on the obvious feature of having 3 related but separate phones and chargers. The sound quality was not the best, but acceptable, especially if you use the feature to brighten the voice quality. Within 3 months, the base station unit died. We sent them in for warranty work, and were surprised to get back refurbished units.We did not like it but figured, what the heck, given that the turn-around time for replacement was less than two weeks.We are now about 9 months from that replacement, and the base unit has begun to malfunction.

He found many mistakes in this book. For example, the largest dinosaur is incorrect, many of the pictures show dinosaurs with horns that did not have them, and the descriptions of many of the dinosaurs are inaccurate. This book was not well researched. My son's quote is \\"it should be considered nonfiction.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures but bad science.","review":"At first glance this appears to be a great book for introducing youngsters to the subject of dinosaurs. Although the book does have nice illustrations and a recent publication date (1998), I would caution against buying this book for your kids. The last chapter (page), entitled 'Bye Bye Dinosaurs', is poorly researched. Even though the book claims to have used a 'technical consultant', the author writes that the dinosaurs died mysteriously (maybe it was a change in climate or habitat she suggests). This is a very poor statement. Very few scientists would deny the fact that a large comet (or asteroid) collided with the Earth 65 million years ago. Most believe that the result was the extinction of many species including the dinosaurs. Since I am against teaching uninformed science (especially to kids), I can not recommend this book as a worthwile purchase (unless you cut out the last page!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movado Brings Back A Classic!","review":"Anyone who appreciates a well-made timepiece will want to own this watch.

All the others lived and were released although it is always a tricky surgery cutting the net away from a wiggling and upset snake. This stuff should be banned as a wildlife killer.

I can't stop playing this CD. Their sound reminds me of Creed and Led Zepplin, mixed with a dash of Audioslave and seasoned with sounds reminiscent of the Beatles in their East Indian/Sitar period. Don't think I'm saying they rip off these bands -- if there's one thing Tea Party has, it's originality. Nothing ever gets really hard (coming from the opinion of a metalhead, here) but nevertheless it rocks. There's a nice balance of more typical rock and rather light, folk-sy style pieces on this particular album.

It contains almost nothing about the actual search for sunken treasure. Instead, as noted by another reviewer, this book is primarily a character study of the people involved in this expedition.

Which is really not what you want to hear about when you expect the book to tell you about the exploits of the salvors digging gold out of wrecks tens of thousands of feet below the surface.I'm just glad I didn't buy this in hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for Three Miles Down","review":"This book is a must read for anybody who has ever wanted to go on a modern expedition searching for sunken treasure. The characters are real people, accurately described, who react in unexpected ways when confronted with difficult challenges. I know many of the people in this book, and I have been to sea with them. This book brought back many memories. It's also an excellent choice if you are interested in expeditions to the Titanic, since so few books have ever been written about modern expeditions to the Titanic. Again, it's the same players on a different expedition. You will get to know exactly what it's like to be at sea, with plots and subplots going on around the ship, and where everybody has a different agenda. This is the next best thing to being there.Good hunting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up and write the story","review":"To echo others, this book fails to deliver on its central promise to tell the story of a recovery mission for lost treasure. The author injects himself into the narrative, despite being hired as the team's \\"chronicler,\\" in effect destroying objectivity. Too often he rambles into the weeds to impress readers with his knowledge of other writers or historical occurrences. He also breaks into moralising which, even if I agree with some of it, I don't want to read in a book of this kind. Save your money; don't but this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up Cockney","review":"This book covers Stamp's life up to his late teens, just before he went to drama school. He writes in a very personal style, skillfully capturing what it was like to grow up in the hard times of post-war London. Playing in bombed-out vacant lots; living in tiny flats, his early life comes across as a happy one despite the circumstances. He pays tribute to many of his friends, never failing to mention what he learned from them. He describes unashamedly his sexual awakening thru a daliance with a young nurse. His longings and excitements over his first dates are something anyone can relate to. To be honest I didn't know who Stamp was when I found this book at a garage sale, but I feel I know him well after reading it.

The clues, if again they are authentic are unmistakable and given the circumstances of Mr.Maybrick's twisted life, make perfect sense and grasp the Ripper's inner torment.

She says that this is a fitting epitaph to the end of the Ripper Mystery.But if James Maybrick were to look at the attempts to discover who he was that existed before this diary was found, wouldn't he borrow a quote from his own diary and cackle, \\"They remind me of chickens with their heads cut off ha ha\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"baloney","review":"Blimey!

However, this is the weakest of the lot. Straying away from the British protagonists he wrote about so sympathetically and honestly in the other books of the series, two American CIA operatives are the center of the plot. They are not portrayed unfairly or in a mean way - there is just not the tone of inner truth about them that resounds so much in his other characters. Somehow the plot seem half hearted as well. If you must skip one of this long series of short novels on the themes of the entanglement of past, present, and future and the meaning of loyalty, this would be the one.

Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase.

We will all be hearing more from this incredible young woman from NC. I'm looking forward to hearing more of her on the air, and hopefully on VH1!

The bluesy quality of her vocals are great.By the way, don't buy the \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" score if you are looking for Dana Glover.

Well, we ordered it anyway because we love her voice and I am glad to say that Jaan Uhelszki got it backwards. In the song RAIN, she is showing the birth of faith, and her faith is apparent throughout. In the credits, she even says \\"I thank my God, my true Father.\\" So, if these things are important to you, don't worry, it is a wonderful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT cd!","review":"I bought this cd because I liked one song on it (Thinking over)that I had first heard on a television show.

They have changed with regard to the type of people that are working in the international development community, and the type of people who work for international NGOs. Whatever Viola P. Renya might think, my experience has shown that these are not people who believe they have 'dyed and gone to haven' (SIC), because they 'scored' a job with CARE or Save the Children.

The only thing I haven't tried is the HDMI pass-through since I don't have an HDTV yet.This comes with enough speaker cable to wire a medium sized room but if you are covering a lot of space you may want longer wires.My only beef is the slightly unintuitive nature of the menus; but that is a minor concern.

Having seen both Grace Slick and Canned Heat perform live several times in the 60's, I was hoping for \\"live\\" looking performances from them. Canned Heat's was great, but Grace Slick's version seemed lip-synched and did not have the energy and sound of what she would do \\"live.\\" I was slightly disappointed, but still happy to have a video of her singing such a great 60's song.

It requires a little bit of work to mount it if you want it flush against the ceiling (the other option is to hang it from an already established ceiling hook). The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that it is pretty loud (it requires batteries to spin the hanging crystals), louder than I expected.

Don't fit.","review":"I have had these for a few days and one gym workout. Compared to the stock iPod buds, the sound from the CX300's is tinny and lower. I also noticed that they distort at levels that are easily handled by the stock iPod buds.I have tried all three sizes of the cushions and none of them seem to provide a good noise seal or make the buds stay put. I also find that rounded shape makes them difficult to insert. When I try to push on the rounded end to seat them, they seem to go in the wrong direction.I would return them if I didn't already recycle the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound, cord too short","review":"I really want to like these headphones. I've had them for about six months and I think the sound quality is great for how much they cost.

Unfortunately I'm not. The cord is so short that I can't have my mp3 player at my waist comfortably. That's kind of ridiculous! It does come with an extension cord, but when you have the extension cord on, it's way too long. A bunch of tangled cord in your pocket is not cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than E2C","review":"I already have an SE530 and an older E2C & Etymotic ER6 with frayed wiring. I bought these mostly to use in the gym. I was very disappointed with these, even though they only cost $20. The sound isolation is almost nonexistent, the sound quality is terrible, they're really uncomfortable and hard to put in my ears. I did't expect them to be as good as the expensive SE530, but they don't even compare to what you can get for $60-$80. These are unusable to me. I can't bear to hear my favorite songs destroyed by the horrible sound.I'm going to get a new SE110/115-K."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price paid!","review":"I bought these a month ago on a whim...I have a bunch of headsets, and I keep looking for the most comfortable set that sound good. So far, these seem to be the best. I also own a set of Shure E-2c's, which are much more expensive...and they sound good, but aren't as comfortable and don't deliver the bass that these do. I'm impressed to say the least. Right now these are the earbuds that I'm traveling with to enjoy solid sounds and keep the noise down on the BART in San Francisco. Anyone who has spent any time on there knows how loud it can be. All in all, I'd recommend these as a reasonble upgrade over any of the standard MP3/iPod headphones that come with a base unit. I'm done spending over $100 on headphones if these hold up like I think that they will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor durability","review":"When first purchasing these headphones I wrote a very glowing review. I like these because they sit right at the edge of the ear, it is not difficult to get a good seal, and they stay in. They don't quite have the clarity the higher end ones do, but I enjoy the sound as it is warm with plenty of bass. On top of that, they are cheap.However, I soon found out why they are so cheap. They don't hold up well at all. My first pair lasted a couple of months, until one of the ears stopped producing any sound. I returned it under warranty, and received a new pair. After a month, I had the same problem, and returned that pair. My third pair gave me small shocks in my ear, right after opening it from the box... sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beter than the price indicates.","review":"Certainly not in the class of the super-high fidelity ear phones, but far better than than what you might expect from the price.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality...make sure to insert them correctly.","review":"I ordered these as a replacement for the earbuds which came with my Sansa hoping to get an improvement in sound quality. I was very disappointed at first because they had almost no bass. After playing around with them for a few days (and cussing a lot and writing a scathing review) I discovered that I had not inserted them properly in my ears. They should go into the ear canal until a seal is formed, almost like you're trying to seal out water. Then the bass kicks in. The sound quality was much better when properly inserted. Overall a big improvement over the stock Sansa buds. Should be 4 stars, but I can't edit the rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Bass","review":"The sound is horribly thin and tinny, and the bass is simply non-existent.

Excellent sound quality and blocks out noise around as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, but....","review":"I bought the Sennheiser CX300-B earbuds and had them for about a week. I was very happy with them for about two days. Although I do not pretend to be an audiophile, the sound was great. These earbuds are about 300x better than the ones that come with the ipod. They could produce sound at a high volume and they played the whole range of the audible spectrum. They are not the best headphones, but you're not paying $200 for them either.THE BAD: These earbuds have 3 sets of removable silicone earcups and one started to tear within two days. The earcups weren't very comfortable either. I constantly found myself readjusting them at work. In addition, they block so much sound that I couldn't hear others in my office at work. The worst part was the \\"THUMP\\" every time my feet hit the ground when I walked. The noise was extremely annoying. I sent these back and got the PX100s and loved them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound","review":"The CX 300 earbuds are very tinny.

Amazon's price is a bargain, even for the older models. The company makes quality earphones, and it is definitely doing it's job. Noise-cancellation works, the cord is perfect length, everything is quite durable, and comfortable as well. I am an everyman and I will keep this review short - the earbuds work great and it's recommended to those who want to try sennheisers before getting the newer brands, but I am saying not many will be disappointed for everyday use that is well above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for the price or least until the cord started to fail","review":"Positives1.

I don't like the asymmetrical ear cord length (the right ear cord is much longer) but it would probably be a benefit for someone that wears their player on their left arm. Sound fine, seem durable so far (have been washed once, lol) and fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for air travel Poor noise cancellation capabilities","review":"These ear buds are an inexpensive compromise at getting better quality sound from Ear buttons. The Bass is not very strong. Sound quality is acceptable. However, the lack of a carrying container or pouch, plus the fact that they are poor at eliminating external noise, such as airplane engine noise, makes them a poor choice for air travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable sound and comfort","review":"Two things made this purchase a poor one:1.

Way better than the original Apple earphones that came with my ipod. Sound isolation is good, but not too good to get you killed by crossing the street at the wrong time. Bass response is great once you adjust the earbuds. Durability hasn't been a concern to me. I lost my first pair before they broke or anything. When I bought my second pair, everyone in my family wanted me to get them a pair too, so I guess they also think they are a good value for the money. Definitely the best cost/benefit ratio for any earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than the earbuds that come with most devices, but...","review":"I found it next to impossible to get a good seal in the ear for me - which results in not so great sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"earbuds sound fine, but poorly packaged and very unreliable","review":"I like the sound of these earbuds, but they are very unreliable.

However, I was very disappointed with the lackluster performance. The sound was thin and tinny. Actually, the plain white Apple earbuds sound better! I would say the only thing I liked about these are the comfort.Not sure what all the great reviews are about but perhaps I'm a little more picky than most. For instance, I also generally dislike Bose but a lot of people rave about that garbage.Usually I'm a huge fan of Sennheiser, but I, and a lot of audiophiles, feel they are damaging their reputation with these cheap buds. Too be sure, I understand the engineering challenges of trying to produce headphone quality out of earbuds, but until a product hits the market that achieves that standard, I'm sticking with the plain old Apple freebies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the bad reviews","review":"I bought these on the recommendation of ConsumerReports. The buds sound good, not great. The real problem is that when you move, the wire makes a hum which is quite annoying. I returned these immediately. That is the absolute truth about the issue with these ear buds, and CR was plain wrong. Any good review for these would be from people who do not move with them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced Response","review":"Sennheiser brands this item with the phrase \\"Bass-Driven Sound,\\" which is accurate if your idea of \\"driven\\" is \\"total frequency domination at the expense of all melodic content.\\" The lack of balance across the spectrum makes listening to anything other than bass-fluxed pop pointless; the volume levels necessary to hear upper-mids and treble from an itunes store m4a file is a virtual guarantee of eventual hearing loss. Really a very poor design, even at this price point where disposability rules. If you actually want to hear someone singing, take a pass on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - would have thrown away if unable to return","review":"Based on the good reviews, I was shocked at the horrible sound, constant static and non-existent noise cancellation. First, one of the earbuds has a much longer cord than the other. Does anybody actually like it this way? The sound quality was so bad that I would have thrown these in the trash if unable to return for a refund. It seemed like the slightest movement of the cord would create static. I found it impossible to sit still enough to avoid jostling the cord generating static. I compared the noise cancellation feature to a set of earbuds that does not have noise cancellation and I could not detect any difference. My five dollar cheap earbuds sound better than these.

I paid $85 in 2007, but only $33 this time around. The steep price drop should have been a warning sign that the quality would have diminished some. Still, these new headphones seemed durable enough for basic use and they provided the solid bass and decent sound quality expected from the Sennheiser brand. Unfortunately, the set lasted only 5 months before I began getting sound in one ear only (mono instead of stereo). There appears to be a short circuit in the cord. I used the headphones about 10 hours per week with my mp3 player and occassionally with my desktop pc. The only way to get sound in both ears now is if I wiggle the cord and hold it just so. Pretty cumbersome and quite disappointing. This may just be a bad pair, but I will not take the chance next time around. Will try another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rest in Peace.","review":"R.I.P. March 29th 2012.I loved Sennheiser and their sound quality but I am utterly disappointed after six months.

Either that or they have a lot of employees and friends giving these good ratings.I gave this as a present and bought it very early and it was too late to return these. Find another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted for about 15 months","review":"I am not an audiophile, but these fit my small ears and didn't fall out. They were a great value for the money. I paid about 15 bucks for them on eBay not realizing I could have spent a bit more to secure the two-year warranty by buying on Amazon. The left bud just conked out one day. But overall, these were great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Headphones","review":"To start off, I'm not a big audiophile. I can tell the difference between poorly ripped music compared to lossless quality, but I don't get into the whole mids, highs, lows and how it makes my heart feel and all that other mumbo jumbo you read about in other headphone reviews. With that said, these headphones BEAT! The bass and sound quality on these is pretty impressive.I bought a pair of J-Labs J3's before this, and they were complete garbage. Not worth the money in my opinion. These blow those out of the water. If you were trying to decide between those and these... hands down, Sennheiser dominates the J-Labs, if for anything, for the simple fact that you don't have to dedicate 30 minutes just to put them in your ear correctly to listen to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound, Low Durability","review":"I got these earbuds around five months ago, they started out perfect for me. I don't know sound very well but they were fine for mp3 on an iPod touch with good bass. The problem with these earbuds is that the right earbud stopped working, it appears the cord connection broke on the inside, since it only works when I bend the cord werid. Overall the sound is decent but the durability is horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor quality","review":"I have use these earbuds for merly 5 to 6 times, yesterday I took them to the gym and the right side stop working. I dont know if it is just me or they true are of poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"-These earphones are a very good value for your money.-They work well, sit well in your ears. I especially like the 3 different sizes offered, so you can choose your right size. I always have trouble making earphones stay in my ears for other brands, but not this one.-They lasted for pretty long, until I lost them somewhere!-I do not remember how good their noise-cancellation was, but for the amount you pay, it is good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I didn't like the sound of it. Sounds more muffled than pronounced. If it has bass, it doesn't have the treble to balance what you're hearing. Standard ipod headphones sound better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Work At First Then Short Out","review":"Sennheiser products do not last well. I was given a pair of these for Christmas. By July, I could only hear out of one earbud. I sent them back and the company refused to fix them without a receipt, but offered to send them back to me for $20! It cost me less than $3 postage to mail the headphones to them! It's bad enough when a product doesn't even last a year, but there is no excuse for poor customer service like that. I will never buy any of their products. And if you do, be sure to keep the receipt and warranty information because you'll be needing it about 6 months later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent sound - poor durability","review":"I have owned two pair. First pair: one ear bud died after about 4 months of daily use, I mean, spontaneously died. Like, I was listening, and the sound in one ear just went away and never came back. This made me mad, but I really liked the sound, so I ordered another pair. Again, used every day while I work, lasted about 6 months, one side died. I continued to stay optimistic and said, \\"That's okay, I need one ear free anyway so I can hear any calls from work.\\" Six months or so later, after being content w/one ear bud, that ear bud died. It is quite disgusting. Again, the sound is outstanding, but is not worth much if they are going to die after a year at best. So I am moving on to JLABS which have similar testimonies to this, but at least there is a semblance of customer support as people such as I myself testify to their negative experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound! -- Offset cord length :( -- 4.5 stars","review":"The sound in these is great. Noise cancellation +. Highs Mids and Bass all accurate.Wish the description stated that the right earbud cord and the left earbud cord are different lengths. I hate this design and have never previously purchased a set with this design. It is ridiculously useless, and gets in the way during active use.I still like this set a lot, and the sound makes up for the stupid design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Sound, Poor Quality","review":"These headphones sound amazing, I couldn't ask for better quality in sound. The bass is deep and not rattly, just smooth and deep. I bought a pair and was really impressed so I bought a second pair when the right bud went out. I thought it wasn't a big deal, I probably just had bad luck. I bought two more pairs, a pair for me and a pair for a friend. My friend pair started losing connection about two months after I bought them, and a couple of weeks later mine started to lose connection too. It got worse and worse until my friends stopped working and my left bud died. I checked the warranty, since they came with a year of warranty but they expect you to pay a fee and shipping and handling, that would end up costing more than a new pair. I love the sound, but hate the quality of the physical product."},{"rating":"1","title":"very annoying chord","review":"They should put in the item description that these have a asymmetric cable. Had I know this I would not have bought them. how anyone thinks having the left side a foot shorte than the right side is a good idea is beyond me. This is very annoying. so annoying you can not enjoy listening to music, because one quick move with the head, and out they go. horrid design, and this should be on the main page telling us that this is how they are. The sound seems decent, but I havent had them in longer than one song to get a good feel for the sound. Thats how annoying this chord is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Them","review":"I wanted ear buds that I could wear under my motorcycle helmet that would not put pressure on my ears from the ear bud itself or the little arm. These are compact and I can't even feel them with my helmet on. The sound quality is better than any I have ever had in the same price range. I don't have to turn my Ipod volume up as high as other ear buds I have had which saves on battery.The only thing I don't like is that the length of the wire on one side is shorter than the other ... never understood that design. But it is no big deal, just a matter of preference.Would definitely recommend these ear buds over any other ear buds in a similar price range. (I Can't compare them to higher price range ear buds because I have not owned any to compare them to)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Earbuds - Don't Bother","review":"The sound quality is good, the external noise blocking is good, fit is decent, but durability is non-existent.After using these all of about 15 times or so, I noticed the sound had become muffled and weak in one of the earbuds. I sent them back to Sennheiser and they sent me a brand new pair under warranty no questions asked (thumbs up on their customer service).I took extra care with the replacement and handled them as delicately as possible, taking care to never pull on the wires, or bang them around or subject them to any other abuse. However, after a month of so of use, same problem as the first pair. Sound is dead in one earbud and muffled in the other.Stay away from these headphones. They sound good at first, but fall apart fairly quickly even when treated gingerly. This is a disposable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise canceling with cord noise","review":"As a commuter I needed a set of good noise canceling earbuds (cover subway sounds). The CX300-B are above average at canceling noise, but unfortunately they create noise whenever the cord touches anything. I'm not sure how anyone could rate them high, as the cord noise is ridiculous and irritating. I found the Klipsch Image S4 to be a superb set, with great noise canceling, and high audio quality. Spend the extra money to get a quality product the first time around, so you don't end up wasting money on the CX300-B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Overpriced and second rate. They will work well if you've never owned a decent pair of headphones before, but it's a stretch to say that they measure up against generic ipod/iphone buds - they can't lay a finger on similarly priced over-ears such as the Koss Porta Pro. Highs sound tinny, mid-range is weak, and the bass is over-done. In addition, there is a noticeable hiss any time they are plugged into a device. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder how good the sound is.","review":"I think these earbuds sound pretty good, but it is hard to tell. They fall out of my ears as quickly as I put them in. The cord that goes behind the head aggravates the problem, and the cord is too long. Since I usually listen to my ipod on a vigorous morning walk, these earphones are useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the cord, like others have said","review":"I am by no way an audiophile but I had these earbuds for less than an hour before starting the return process. The earbuds sounded great but the cord is horrendous, the slightest movement of the cord near the plug and the sound would drop way down in volume, create loud static, or one of the earbuds would go completely off. The cord is so thin I can't imagine I simply got a bad pair so I'm going to try my luck with a different brand. Amazon was great with the return as always. Stear clear if you plan on moving at all while wearing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all - I have a $10 generic from Target that sounds as good","review":"The audio is very hot. Treble way to high. hardly no mid. Bass is good for an in-ear. I have a $10 in-ear from Target and it sounds just as good. This is going back. Not worth the $30. The standard Apple ipod headset it better and produces a warmer sound.My experience? I have a Sony MDR-V6 which is awesome for listening to music! I play computer games using a Sennheiser PC 350 which is awesome as well.This head phone is crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sennheiser continues to satisfy","review":"I bought these for my wife to go with the Ipod I got her for Christmas. She loved them, I was not surprised as I have used Sennheiser headphones for years. She really liked the sound and with the three ear piece sizes she doesn't have to worry about them falling out. In fact she shoveled the driveway when it snowed, and I was at work, with them in and they never came out.You can spend more but i doubt your will get better without spending A LOT more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough bass","review":"When I read the product information on these earbuds I wanted to believe that they were very bass oriented. In reality they were dissapointing in that there is no bass to speak of. Recently I purchased a Ipod nano and the earbuds that came with it are much better in bass, even though the dasign of the Sennheiser is much more comfortable in my ears.I would not recommend these for purchase if you are looking for verybase booming sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound/fit, horrible cord","review":"I didn't realize that these earbuds came with a J style cord. Everytime I wear these, the weight of the cord and or any jostling or turning of my neck causes the earbud on the short cord to pull out of my ear since the main cord hangs directly in line with it.Good fit in the ear and good sound but the cord is a loser and I will be replacing these with something else.Update (06/2011): After using these heavily for several months to listen to music on my phone while walking the cord eventually failed right at the head set side of the plug, severing one of the wires. I replaced these with pair of Klipsch ear buds and have had zero problems with them. They are a standard Y cord and the cord is longer as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first but it didn't last.","review":"I bought these less than a year ago. The sound quality was quite good for my standards (I'm by no means an audiophile). Then the weather turned cold and every time I wore them outside I'd get little static shocks in my ears. This didn't happen if I was wearing them indoors. Now there is hardly any volume coming from the left bud. I was quite happy with these at first but now less then a year later I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed in Amazon","review":"Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)Ordered it from reading the good reviews directly from Amazon.

Not recommending to my worst enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!!","review":"Though the quality sound is good, it is useless when some materials are fragile.In less than one year the inner plastic from the plug broke, so eventually the sound from the right earphone went off and is not working anymore.

It produces heavy noise even when the cord is slightly touched (for example when your finger touches it or the cord moves against your clothing), so it's only for use when you don't stand or sit there totally still (for example on board a plane). Use when walking is not acceptable to me, not to mention exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I'm not an audiophile, but these sound pretty good.

On sale at about twenty bucks, the loss didn't really break my budget but this is a piece of genuine crap sold by a highly respected sound manufacturer that does not usually miss the mark like this.

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seller distributes bootleg earbuds","review":"These are definitely fakes. I did some homework and found out that there are a lot of fakes out there of this model. There are sites dedicated to the fake cx300s, so shame on me for being too trusting.

The sound is quite loud, and the sized rubber earbuds and that actually go IN your ear make them seriously noise cancelling. I would definitely NOT recommend these for outdoor running/walking/biking because they allow so little outside noise in. However, for the gym, the office, the library, etc, they are great. The sound quality is not concert quality but extremely good for mid-range headphones. Great buy for the price, just be warned that you will hear nothing from the outside world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Much as I wanted to love these earbuds, they are more or less unwearable when you're walking anywhere. The cord is very nearly too short to tuck it underneath your shirt and then run it into your pocket, if there's any wind at all they create this obnoxious whistling noise when in your ear (like the wind makes when it's blowing really hard, except it doesn't need to blowing hard at all to make the noise in the earbuds), and the cord noise is almost unbearable unless you can keep it completely still and out of contact with any fabric. On the other hand, they're cheap and comfortable, and sitting still out of the wind (say on a bus) they do an ok job. Sound quality in situations like that is not bad, it's just when you get outside that it's absolutely wretched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done, nothing special.","review":"There's nothing overly special about these earbuds. I was used to a previous similar style from Sony and these are basically the same. If you've never worn earbuds before, then of course these will be very different from anything that you are used to. The sound quality gets the job done and I would imagine is better than any cheap pair that comes with various electronic devices.Since these don't have noise canceling technology, you should expect the cheaper price...but since they are earbuds, they still block out extremely light noise and this is simply good enough for me!If you are looking to replace a damaged/lost pair of earbuds, then these would work for you depending upon what you had originally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles's Review","review":"I use this product with my Kindle 2.

Then, about 2 weeks later, the earphones started making constant squeaking, muffled screeching noises in each ear whenever music is playing. Unfortunately this makes listening to music on these headphones absolutely unbearable, and I have not been able to use them since then even though I have only owned them for a month and a half. I'm not sure if this is just a defective pair, or if all headphones of this brand are of terrible quality, the headphones lasted for such a short period of time and there's really not a whole lot I can do with them now except throw them in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horibble durability.

The bass is so high coming from these that you can barely get any clear sound, just a HUGE amount of bass.2. They broke within a week of having them. The left earbud you cant really even hear out of anymore and the right earbud you can still hear but it lost most of its volume so you can barely hear out of it even when the volume is maxed.If you want crappy sound and a HUGE amount of bass because your a bass lover then I guess for the price it sells for its an ok deal. I personally did not like the sound at all and once I got used to the sound after forcing myself to get used to it they ended up breaking within a week or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"These sound great and for the money you can't beat them.Sennheiser is a great company to deal with, too.

I use them occasionally with various players, but I use more in studio and live stage monitoring systems (playing drums & bass) - the sound is great from high to low, the only cons are in physical design - the cord is too short; I prefer an evenly split cord design not the lopsided as these have; The stereo mini plug is a 90 degree plug - a straight plug would be better; And lastly the speaker bud could be just a tad lengthier. Yet they DO deliver in the perform department - They sound as good or better than any at 3X the price.I rate it 4 stars because performance and price is was important to me and these delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wires break easily","review":"Sound quality is good enough for the price.Isolation is okay, but not as good as Shures.Despite its good features, I cannot get over its problem- wires break VERY easily.Since these don't come with bags like the Shures, I couldn't keep them in perfect condition, but I certainly never abused them.Nevertheless, I've had wires break TWICE, and it seems to be a pattern; I also saw complaints online about this issue so I'm not alone.While cheap earphones are nice, I'd rather have one that lasts.Shures, although expensive, are completely worth the price difference for their superior isolation, better build quality, and the protective equipment that comes with it.So in conclusion, I will never buy Sennheiser's cheap earphones again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable unless sedated","review":"I'm shocked at the positive reviews on this product. I use my earbuds a lot on the treadmill or walking around.

Prior to that, they sounded great, and really blocked out external sounds quite well (to the point where I couldn't really hear someone talking to me if I had them in, even if I wasn't playing music at the time). The cord could be a little longer to make them more convenient to use. Overall, though, I have to give them a low rating because they crapped out on me after such a short amount of time (and I took good care of them, didn't yank them around, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult","review":"Hard to keep these in your ears.

They sound good, and when I'm out on the street or on the bus they seem to block out a lot of sound. I'm able to play them at a much lower volume than my last pair of over-the-ear headphones.The only thing I would like to see different is that the wiring seems pretty frail, I'm not sure how long they are going to last. I would like them to be more robust. So far no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ones","review":"I really like them. Haven't encountered any problem with them so far and i've heavily used them for some months now. I read alot of negative reviews before buying them but i dont subscribe to them. The cord is long enough for me, the bass is not so \\"unbearable\\", actually not at all(maybe because i really like hearing the bass). I just think i would have enjoyed some smaller earbuds, but that's probably just me having some small ears:))). Good choice for that money, definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound Quality and Great Low End","review":"I got these headphones because I was never satisfied with the bass on all my other ear buds. These provided a much fuller sound, especially if you get them fitted in you ear properly. The harder you jam them in your head, the better the sound. They block outside noise reasonably well, good enough airplanes.When wearing them at the gym, I have run the cord under my shirt to keep the cord from bouncing around. Because every time the cords thumps against something, the sound travels directly to your ear via the silicone ear tips.Excellent headphones for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right earbud failed after 5 months","review":"Super comfortable. Couldn't tell they were even in my ear. Sound quality was good while they worked. Nice bass and could hear things I've never heard before with over the ear headphones or buds.I gave 2 stars because the right earbud stopped working on me last week while running. I read the reviews of this before I bought, but hoped it would not happen to me. I am not very happy at all.

It is good for flights, however, where I'm not moving around at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plugged Ears","review":"I ordered these because I wanted something better than the cheap generic ear buds that came with my mp3 player. They certainly have better sound and can create a better seal so that I don't have to turn the volume up as loud to drown out the noise around me. It may be just me, but I never realized how much having these kinds of ear buds would feel like being on an airplane when your ears are plugged and haven't popped yet from the altitude change; it took a little getting used to. I would give this a 5-star rating, but the size of my ears (or at least one) seems to fall between the sizing of the attachable tips, so I'm not sure if I'm getting the correct seal (which may affect the plugged feeling)."},{"rating":"2","title":"cx-300","review":"I bought these last year for myself for about twenty dollars. Now these are obviously much better than those crap headphones that come with an ipod. However I wouldn't say they have the greatest bass response. Its too bad they are like 40 bucks right now on amazon, so I can't really recommend them anymore. Good isolation, ok bass, mids and trebles very good. But for the price they are now, I would look elsewhere like Sony's inear headphones.

The buds are difficult inserting into the ear canal, the left earbud cord is about 15 inches shorter than the right which makes it easy for the left bud to exit the ear frequently and the rubber bud covers falls off the actual bud frequently. All of these are horrible design flaws. The earbud jack wire has a 90 degree turn instead of plugging straight into the iPod jack like the Apple earbuds do. This is an odd and inconvenient design. The material used to coat the earbud wires creates a rubber against rubber sound and is transmitted through the earbuds when walking or moving about. The sound quality is excellent through all frequencies. However I would not buy these again due to their design and will probably go back to the Apple earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE","review":"I JUST REVIVED THESE IN THE MALL 15 MINUTES AGO, ALL I CAN SAY IS PURE CRAP.

SO I DECIDED TO SAVE MONEY AND TRY A NEW PAIR THAT WOULD BETTER PRICED. DISAPPOINTED IS ALL I CAN SAY. THE RUBBER ON THE EAR BUDS IS CHEAP AND FLIMSY AND DO NOT ALLOW ANY SOUND ISOLATION. THE HIGH AND MIDS SOUND AS IF YOU WERE IN A 1992 HONDA THAT HAD ORIGINAL SPEAKERS. THE BASS IS UNCLEAR AND WEAK. IM SAD THAT Sennheiser PUT OUT SUCH A BAD PRODUCT WITH HIGH MARKUP.

I bought them as a gift for my husband, but there was a wiring short and he couldn't get a clear sound through them.

The sound quality is just fine; the 90-degree angled headphone plug is a plus, and being able to comfortably lay down on your side with them in is a major plus.A few problems: The rubber ear flange tends to compress and slipdown the shaft when inserted into your ear too forcefully. Another downside is that these plugs tends to collect ear gunk easier than some others, especially when the flange slips, and there's no filters to replace, so you have to manually clean it and/or soak it in hydrogen peroxide to restore sound balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after two years","review":"I used these earbuds for two years and I took great care of them.

I own some full sized Sennheiser headphones that sound wonderful and since most of the reviews on here were positive I figured this would be a good buy, but these sound just awful. It's like all highs, no mid or bass range at all. Extremely tinny sounding with no warmth. I don't normally write reviews, but these were just so incredibly disappointing I felt I should.

They are comfortable, look good, and provide decent sound isolation. The durability, however, is far below average.

When i finally opened the packaging that took 15 minutes to open i was pretty mad, the cord isnt symetric, when the line rubs against your clothes it's very loud and quite annyoing, the bass is't good AT ALL. I mean i had owned the bass frequencys' by V-Moda previously and it has 100 times the bass response these have. The quality overall looks very cheaply made, and the earbuds are very flimsy. Not what i expected from sennheiser. I would not reccomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cheap price","review":"I've been buying Sennheiser products for about 13 years and have never been disappointed. Unfortunately, i can't say this any more after having used the CX300-B.The sound quality is pathetic: tinny verging on scratchy, weak weak bass, and very narrow range. I've compared the sound to a 15.99 sony set and this is far inferior. As an aside, cord length will be an issue if you like a little distance between you and your laptop/player. I realize these are cheaper than buds selling in the 70$ + range, but even at this price, it's extremely disappointing. I'm surprise Senn put their name on this. Bump up your budget and go with a set of v-moda or a higher range (Senn bud if there is one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have to say I've been using Sennheiser products for years with no complaints, but these earbuds are a waste of money.Quite simply, the sound is only a very modest amount better than the free iPod ones and simply not worth the cost of the upgrade. More importantly... any slight touch on the wire from ear to iPod gives such a noise it renders them unusable in any situation other than sitting still.Annoyingly they were sealed in a plastic container that took me 20 minutes of dangerous work with a knife to open. How ridiculous.I would recommend this product is avoided by everyone.The seller was excellent though. The product was shipped quickly and effectively and the good were perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like the way they sounded","review":"I guess it's a matter of taste, but I thought these buds sounded unnatural and generally unpleasant.

In my first pair, the wire split, making it impossible to hear out of one earbud, which I figured could be a fluke. Then, only TWO MONTHS into my second pair, one earbud has gone out again. There is no wire split and they look to be in good condition, but they're now useless.I'm very depressed that I can't find the original package in order to get my money back under warranty.

If they break in the first year they are replaced at no additional cost. If they break after, it's 50% of the cost to get a replacement.

There sound is terrific; very lightweight (other earbuds I have bought have good sound but are heavy and tend to fall out when doing even moderate exercise) and comfortable. However durability is in question... both failed after about 6 months of daily use. I would suggest that the wires used are not strong enough and the connections to the buds themselves requires improvement. The texture of the wire insulation is similar to a silicone and though very flexible, does not glide over clothing very well; sometimes causing a tug on the buds which have to be repositioned. Sennheiser have a good product here...if they make them more durable they will sell many more sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value Earbuds","review":"I've had these since August, 2009 and they're still going strong, even after two accidental cycles through a washer and dryer.

The rubber they use conducts sound very well, so any time you tap the cord you can hear it pretty loudly, which is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you paid for!","review":"Not an avid music fan, I just ordered this to replace my totally damaged original Apple headset. I use the headphone mainly for blocking the subway noise and catch up my reading in BN. The quality of the material is so-so; the sound quality is a bit about so-so. The blockage of the noise is good though. I am not very good at listening to music so I can't compare to those who always listen to a specific kind of music and telling the difference between high pitch to power bass. But I did notice that it's basically has no difference between my old original Apple earphone with this \\"supposed to be better sound quality\\" headphone.

Sound is good but the cord design is bizarre. The difference in lengths between the right and left streams, and the thin gauge of the wire, makes for a very floppy and annoyingly uncomfortable wear.

Two day's later I got them on my hand. I didn't like the feeling of the cable and how thin it was the connector, but hey this just seems cosmetic.After using it for few day's I realized they have almost no Bass at all and the quality of sound it extremely inferior.So now I understand why they where so cheap.

Full bass and they fit fairly comfortably in your ear. Problem is the cord. One side is shorter than the other - making it look ridiculous to wear in front of your body. The directions show to wear them behind your body - but running a cord under my armpit to access my mp3 player just didn't work or feel right to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable and cheap design","review":"I ordered these earbuds a few weeks ago, reluctantly--as I've been unimpressed with my previous experiences with asymetric earbud cords. These buds were no exception--in fact the short length of the cord made them even more uncomfortable than other asymetric cords I've tried in the past. The sound is decent (for this lowest tier cheap pricerange) but please don't allow yourself to be seduced by the price or by the Sennheiser name, these buds are crap. Every time you turn your head, a bud is painfully yanked from your ear by way of the cord uncomfortably gripping the back of your neck. Recently, I tried wearing them in front, which not only looks stupid, but, due to the inflexible cheap material they're made from, causes the cord to rub against my chin or cheek and still yanks the buds from my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"background hum and repeated failures","review":"I've purchased this item twice and had exactly the same problems both times. First, I had a constant background hum/buzz when using with either my Sony Walkman mp3 player or computer. It wasn't significant and generally not a problem, except during soft passages. Second, after a few months of use, I've experienced sudden and significant loss of volume in the left earpiece. Again, this has happened TWICE (I thought the first occurance was just bad luck on my part), in spite of very gentle treatment of the cords. Overall, I'm very disappointed, since my Sennheiser headphones are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed compared to the old MX400","review":"Bought these as a potential replacement for the MX400, which I love but are now discontinued. I don't find the sound quality to be nearly as good as the MX400, which had wonderful detail in the bass and were smooth over most of the spectrum. By comparison, the bass on the CX300 is weak, indistinct and underdamped, and the highs aren't crisp. The sound quality also varies as the CX300 is **VERY** sensitive to exactly how they are positioned in the ear.Note the cord design with a shorter cord for the left side than the right. Equal lengths have the advantage that they divide any pulling stress equally between the ear. But with the CX300 design a small tug pulls them out of my left ear every time.On the plus side, they're quite comfortable in my ear and I can wear them for long stretches without discomfort.They were cheap enough that I don't regret my purchase too much. Guess I'll have to keep looking for good, not-too-expensive earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high expectations for these earbuds, but to be honest, I get better sound with my stock iPod earbuds equipped with Griffin Earjams. The sound on the Sennheiser buds is tinny with almost no bass, unless you jam the bud so far into your ear canal that it's about touching your brain.Also they have asymmetric cord lengths, so the right cord is much longer than the left one. It's weird if you're used to the standard setup with both sides the same length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really so good","review":"I found the sound to be tinny and thin, not nearly as rich as the stock buds that came with my Sandisk m240 MP3 player.

They fall out of my ears constantly and the two different cord lengths for the ear buds are annoying.

The sound quality isn't too bad, but I hate the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as much bass as it claims","review":"These headphones claim to have powerful base but I do not find it that strong; at least not as strong as V-Modas.

A couple months later this happened again, but this time it was worse because the cable got so twisted up the inner wire was exposed but to my amazement they worked perfectly talk about durable!I wanted to buy another pair of headphones and i decided to buy skullcandy titan earphones but within a couple months one of earphones popped out of casing and stopped working... I went back to the cx-300's hopefully they will last for a couple more years. If something happens to them i will definitely buy these again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man I hoped for big! Not...","review":"I saw these Hp's and was really excited about the features and sound quality. However, to my dismay, the bass flattens out and the confounded contraption fizzles out at max volume (how can i listed to Pac w/out bass!) The cords were about 2in. to short for a man that is 6 \\"1, if you are my height please beware, you will constantly pull at the cords and have distortion with your sound. Well besides that the longer right ear cord is kind of nice, but overall i prefer the classic style. The Hp's look great, but really, at this day and age that's all you can do is make them look good...C'mon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible service","review":"I ordered this item from amazon through DLN Enterprises, and the product arrived promptly and they worked fine... for a week. The jack doesn't actually do a good connection so under the slightest movement one of the earbuds stops producing sound. I have tried to contact DLN Enterprises so they can replace my faulty unit since April 1st I haven't heard of them at all, I already filled a complain with amazon. While they worked, they sounded great... but that didn't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Fit","review":"These pads come with two extra pair of pads, but none of them would fit in my ears. Either they were too small or too big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds great but cord got messed up","review":"These were highly rated somewhere, so I bought and they sound great. However, the cord got out of balance where the split between the two buds is, and one is now longer than the other. Not a big deal, still works fine, but looks a little funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"exellent buy","review":"These are a great pair of ear buds, super sound, good fit and a price that can not be beat. The only downside is the offset leads to ear buds from the main cord. This creates an uneven \\"pull\\" on the shorter lead causing one bud to tend to pull out of the ear. If not for that I would have given it all five stars-exept for the poop rateing, what the hell is that anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortable!","review":"good sound quality, and extremely comfortable when you've had them in for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For ipod","review":"These ear buds are very comfortable and have great sound quality.It was bought because of the different sizes available. They are easily changed and work great for small ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buds!","review":"When I first saw these on Amazon, I couldn't believe that they usually sold for $60 in retail stores. I read the reviews and decided to get them anyway. Sure enough a few days later I saw them in Circuit City (prior to bankruptcy) and they were over $60. I didn't realize just how poor my apple earphones were until I did a side by side comparison. The Sennheisers are amazing and the bass is fantastic. I actually hear things such as the Beatles talking to each other before beginning a song that I couldn't hear before. I am not a fan of the wrap around design however."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buds great price","review":"you'll hear people complain about the shortcoming of these buds from an audiophile perspective. But these only cost around $25 now. you won't find shures or etymotics for that price. the fact that people even compare the two is a real compliment to these buds.However, there is always a certain amount of personal preference that plays a role in reviews. for me these are great. so small, I can sleep with them in, the cord is just the right length, and they are very comfortable and fit nice and snug. These used to be $80, now the price hovers somewhere around $20. they are a great deal.I've been using mine for more than two years, and they are still in great condition. The Sony Ex51s I had before broke within a year. My wife was always borrowing them despite having several other pairs of earbuds around the house. so I bought her a pair too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Inexperienced Ears!!!","review":"I bought these after returning a pair of Sony MDR-EX300 headphones. The Sonys were crystal clear. I was truly floored by their clarity. What they lacked was bass capable of handling an M.I.A or Jay-Z track. Took them back thinking, and taking a salesman's advice, that these would do the job. Wrong!The bass is fine but the mids are tinny, the highs are just ok, which makes for a very disappointing experience. Especially after hearing the Sonys.In addition the cord is built for destruction. On both ends you can wiggle the cord at the points where it enters the connectors. That will lead to a short in no time. One last thing, the sound isolation is bad due to the lightweight plastic used on the earpieces.I wasted money on these, warning you so you don't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asymmetrical length of earphone cords annoying","review":"I bought this product because of the ability to change the size of the earbuds. I hadn't realized that the cords to the earbuds were of drastically different sizes. I clip my MP3 player to the waist of my shorts when I run and put the cord inside my shirt. I do not put it on my arm which is apparently what the product's designers assume. The short earbud kept falling out because it had no slack. I had to stop using them because it was so annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds for the money","review":"These are great little earbuds for the money! I've had them now for a few wweeks and they work well and are comfortable. My workplace gets extremely noisy so I needed something to block it out. I put on music and these buds block out all the noise even at very low volume. The cord could be a bit longer, but I am happy with them otherwise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser CX300-B Review","review":"Read about these headphones in a Consumer Reports article. For the price I thought I would give them a try. While I like the sound, the cord is not very long. I also don't like the length of the right and left split from the main cord body either. While these are advertised as an \\"in ear\\" model, there is a hard piece which does come in contact with your ear and after using them for a while, my ear was irritated by it.I hope they'll adjust some of the features and I'll give this a perfect rating then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound good but hate the cord","review":"These buds have a good sound and fit well, but there is way too much cord noise. I got these to use on my mp3 player and Macbook Pro, but quickly found I can't use them with my mp3 player because of the annoying noise from the cable moving around. I also don't care for the different length going to each bud; it pulls too much on the shorter side.They do okay for using with the laptop since I'm sitting still when using, but I'll keep using my old Koss buds on my mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Quality is Good, Everything Else Sucks","review":"Like the title says, the sound quality is clear and crisp. Outside noise is muzzled out due to good sound cancelling.Everything else sucks.The cord length is three times longer on one side which is NEVER a good idea. I don't want to put it behind my head. The shorter side constantly gets pulled out and is SUPER annoying.Then, after 3 months of moderate use (but not rough) they broke. I want a refund ASAP. I'd avoid these and go with a better brand like Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to favorable reviews","review":"From the reviews, these seemed like a solid product for the price. Unfortunately, they turned out to be a disappointment. 1) They feel extremely cheap and fragile. 2) They are not easy to place in the ears due to the short, rounded profile. 3) The sound quality is only average. 4) There is static when I rotate the jack. 5) On one side the cord is about 4 times longer than the other.Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left ear bud arrived defective","review":"The reason why I gave \\"Durability\\" a one-star is because the earphones arrived defective. I can't hear anything out of the left ear bud and am in the process of returning them hopefully for a new pair. It's a shame because they were my friend's going away present and he tried them out and they wouldn't work! The music sounds great in the ear bud that does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great headphone with a very flawed cord","review":"Everything that has been said about the sound is correct in the previous reviews. But I'm surprised that more people don't complain about the excessive length of the one side of the 'V' headphone (where one side is much longer). It is literally so long that you could wrap it around a basketball. This makes it very cumbersome for use at the gym, running, etc, where it is always catching on stuff or getting in the way. It is the one glaring flaw that is causing me to sell these and go back to my other phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good enough","review":"I was first contented with this product, not happy but happy enough. Quality sound was good. Not so good: length of the cord towards the earbuds is not the same, and this asymmetry is a little unconvenient. Then after about a month of regular use, the right side was not working anymore. Too bad. It was my first experience with Sennheiser products, and likely the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cord noise","review":"I was hoping these would be great for carrying around my iPod, but the cords create so much thumping noise that the earbuds are impossible to use unless I'm sitting perfectly still, which is never. Unless you like to hear the cords bumping up against you, go with another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear pads fall off and are expensive to replace","review":"I purchased these ear buds 10 weeks ago and two of the ear pads have already fallen off and gotten lost. I looked into replacements pads -- they cost almost as much as the original ear buds. Not worth the time, aggravation or extra packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"CX300-B Review","review":"I have found the sound quality on these ear buds to be much better than others, which I find to be tinny. I like more bass than most which these buds don't achieve but overall I am satisfied with their sound. I have used them on a daily basis for a month and a half, they seem to be durable although I'm not too rough on them. I've used them several times while running and have not had an issue with them falling out. Very good product for the price paid, which was around $30 including shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money","review":"they're fine. I couldn't see spending the original price of $50+, but for under $30 these do the trick. The sound is a rather muffled, not nearly and clear and I'd prefer and many will complain about getting them to sit right and stay in your, but, for the price you can't complain too loudly.I prefer more clarity and attenuation, so I'm still on the look out for a better IEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"retired grandpop","review":"these phones are exceptional, the best i have ever heard at any price.I cant say enough about amazon,you guys are second to none with your product information,ease in ordering and fast delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones for the price","review":"After messing around with cheaper in-the-ear buds, I finally found the CX300's from Sennheiser. I really don't think you can beat the sound for the price. I've owned these for about 2 months now and use them all the time. The only downside I know of is that they transmit and bumps on the cord onto your ears, but I've never found a pair of in-the-ear headphones that don't. I recently used these on an airplane and wasn't expecting much in the line of noise reduction since they aren't active noise reduction. I was blown away at how much of the jet engine noise they did remove -- and that was without the sound on. Once I turned the music on, I couldn't tell I was on an airplane!These bass is great, the treble is smooth enough -- sometimes the 's' sound is a little tinny, but overall, I'd recommend these for portable use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit For Large Ears","review":"I've been on a quest for affordable noise-canceling ear buds. These aren't them. I have large ears and these work themselves out, even with the large inserts. If you have large ears, these may not work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...","review":"Just like my Samsung Blackjack, one week after the one year warranty is up, tada, they break! One side of the earphones just stopped working. My Sonys, on the other hand, have been going strong for about 3 years. Sound quality leaves a lot to be desired too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be overstock....","review":"Just received these airbuds today based on all the positive reviews. All I am trying to find is a unobstrusive set of earplugs for at the gym....some noise canceling but mostly that stay in your ear most of the time. These sound good enough BUT....it is so weird. The right plug wire is literally 3x (probably like 12 inches) the length of the left plug wire. So, the apex where the to wires come together are not centered thus forcing gravity to pull the left plug out of my ear. I have had the Shure's before but the price was so good on these. They must be a manufacturing reject and I would NOT RECOMMEND THESE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sound, no bass, cheaply made","review":"After reading all the great reviews of these headphones, I thought that I couldn't go wrong. But, I was mistaken. These headphones sound very tinny, and have almost no bass. My apple headphones that came with my iphone are much much better, which was a surprise. The sound isolation is decent, but the sound quality is poor. But, that is what you get for $20. If you are looking for better headphones than apple includes, look elsewhere! These are cheaper, in every regard. The cable is very flimsy and thin. The whole package feels cheap, which it is. I feel like the cheap sony headphones you can buy at Target for $15 are better than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Line Noise Intolerable","review":"If you move, even just turn your head, noise from the line is intolerable. For me it's a deal breaker, and other observations are moot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior sound reproduction","review":"I'm shocked by the sound that comes from these. They are not up to Sennheiser's usual standards. Just bought these along with several other brands of earbuds plus several headphones and these were the worst of the bunch, by far. The Sennheiser PX100 and PX200 headphones were of good quality for their price range. To me these are an aberration in the Sennheiser line. I'm not ready to recommend other earbuds but try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am afraid they are Fake.","review":"I've been using these headphones for more than 5 years and bought many of them from Sennheiser to give as a gift to my friends. However, when I received the package today I checked the sound quality and the materials that are used in detail and compared it to the one that I already have, and see that they are not the same. This one sounds and looks like it's a FAKE version. I might be wrong, but I bought many of these before, and this is not the same as others"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep falling out of ears","review":"I received these headphones two days ago, and they constantly fall out of my ears. I've never had an issue with earbuds staying in my ears, but every time I move these fall out. I would not recommend purchasing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I saw many positive reviews for these headphones, so I was expecting some relatively good headphones, but I was WRONG. First off, the cord for the right headphone is 14 inches longer than the left, which is about 14 inches long. So basically, you end up with a bunch of wire from the right headphone curling up right below your neck. That sucks. It's beyond me why you would ever want a right headphone to be more than 4 times longer than the left. Next, when I received my headphones the right headphone was NOTICEABLY quieter than the left. It was insanely distracting, and I'm printing the papers to return these as I write this. I would NOT recommend buying these headphones to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started malfunctioning after 3 months...","review":"When these are working, they work well. They appeared to be very sturdy. The wires, in fact, seemed a bit thick and tended to retain their shape, standing at strange angles instead of draping down. I used them daily for three months, at which point the contact at the audio plug went bad and the signal to one of the buds began cutting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senheiser CX-300 disappoints","review":"I recently left my earbuds on an airplane. I replaced them with the lower cost Senheiser CX-300. Boy, was I disappointed, and I wish I had saved the price of the SC-300's and applied it to a better pair. However, I have adjusted my equalizer on the iPhone so I can use them, but they are far from Hi-Fi. Previously I had a pair of Etymotic Research ER6i buds, and they were great. Note that they cost considerably more than the Senheisers. The Ety's not only gave great sound (get a good seal in the ear for bass), but they were much more sound isolating. I had to run the sound loud on the Senheisers on a flight, because they give very little sound isolation.Save up your pennies and get the ety's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"I have had many sets of headphones, including some from \\"shure\\", These are fantastic. Love the bass sound ya get from em. I can cut the lawn and not hear the mower. The sound cancelling is incredible. I would recomend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably Loud Click","review":"The sound quality on these is decent, but I can't stand using them due to an unbearably loud click noise they make when inserting them into my ears. I am not sure why, but if you press in on the buds it will make a click sound that is audible when in front of you but too loud when it is in your ear. I can't use them because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Aren't Legit","review":"These are fake knock-offs. Sennheiser doesn't list any of Amazons listed sellers as legit dealers. Couple that with the fact that these have less than stellar quality and it's quite obvious that they're knock-offs. Also Sennheisers MSRP on these on their website is like $80, with a few legit dealers selling for around $50. $20 is too good to be true. Don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as good as the cx 500","review":"I purchased these after the cord on my cx500 started shorting out....I purchased these for 1/2 the price of the cx500, however they do NOT sound anywhere close to the cx500. A couple of co-workers tried them out and loved them, but they don't sound good to me even with the base turned up on my iphone. There is way too much \\"tin\\" sound for my taste, I like treble, but it is a bit extreme. I purchased through Amazon, they are not fakes....BEWARE OF FAKES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the bass?","review":"Does not live up to the Sennheiser name. Bass performance is not a strong point. The wire is way too short and the asymmetrical right and left difference is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"Amazing headphones! Best I've had so far. Great sound qaulity and bass. The different lengts of the earbud wires is a little awkard but that is about the only thing I find wrong with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fit!","review":"I bought this item after purchasing and using about four others ranging from Altec Lansing to Philips, including the one that came with my Sansa Fuze. Finally, I found an ear-bud headphone that fits my ear canal perfectly and feels comfortable for extended usage. In terms of performance the CX300-B has slightly less sensitivity than the Philips SHE5920, rated best among the ones purchased, and considerable less base and acoustic dimension than SHE5920 also considered best in class. Depending on ones personal taste these latter considerations may be strengths or weaknesses. All in all, for me this item has proven to be a good fit acoustically as well as financially. The Altec Lansing proved to be weakest in every performance category, which is probably reflected in its price, being the least expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally worth it","review":"These are so much better than standard ear buds and even the so-called premier buds I bought at Radio Shack.The difference is pretty much the same as the difference between mediocre headphones and premium headphones. The sound is clearer, deeper, and stuff that I never heard before is now clear. Things like light cymbal work, being able to totally distinguish between various instruments. Excellent value for the money if you use your IPod or MP3 player frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"After reading the reviews I expected allot more out of these headphones. They have good sound isolation but that is about it. I was expecting pretty good bass since they are in ear headphones, but it is almost non existent. And when you do play some music that has a good amount of bass like hip hop or electronic music they can't handle it even at modest volume. Mids and highs are clear but nothing impressive, maybe even too high. Overall I was very disappointed. Don't spend your money on these people if you are expecting any bass in your music."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money, not bad at all.","review":"I'm a bit of an audiophile, but I needed cheap earbud speakers for me to abuse. These guys are both cheap, and not bad sounding. If you're sensitive about sound quality, the first thing you'll probably notice is the muffled sound you get out of these buds. They're quite bass-heavy, and it feels like the trebles aren't as well represented.The only other complaint I carry so far is that the cords to the buds are not the same length, as if they expect it to be easier to wrap the wire around the back of your head instead of just have them hanging in front of you. I disagree with their expectation, but oh well. Not a deal-breaker to say the least. The cable is long enough to put my mp3 player in my pocket and listen comfortably without any fear that my eardrums are going to be torn from my delicate body.Honestly, Sennheiser kicks ass. I have a pair of their HD555s and they're the greatest things ever. You're not going to find a better deal than these earbuds. Go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"small and powerful....","review":"It must be the style of the soft plastic on the actual buds that go in the ear that works so well to keep out surrounding noise. These are great for that! The sound is excellent for earbuds.The packaging sucks because it has protect during shipping. I wish someone would invent another safe packaging system. It took forever to get into it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok sound...terrible cable","review":"Not to get too long winded, I bought as an inexpensive set of headphones for my ipod. Pretty decent reviews. Received the headphones and was satisfied with the sound. HOWEVER, every time I touched the jack I got a terribly static like sound. Definitely wasn't going to work. I don't recommend due to the jack issue. Maybe a fluke but nonetheless..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for the money","review":"I have little ear canals and these were comfortable for hours at a time. The sound was great and I loved the offset so they could hang around my neck when I took them out.

It has a noise when no song is playing, and the chord is not good if i movie the input pin a little there are cracks and jerks which are irritating. This happens with iphones. there is always a noise in background which i can hear clearly when song is not playing. Only pro is bass is good, so good for pop hip hop guys. I did not got a chance to test it like.. using it continuously for 2-3 hours to see if it has any itchy or load feeling on my ear.

Wow, what a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheisers?","review":"These earbuds are not what they're cracked up to be. The sound on them is tinny and cheap.

But I was in for a pleasant surprise. To be clear, i am not a professional requiring the best quality that money can buy, but I do like my music and hate imbalance in bass and/or treble. The Sennheiser CX300 goes very well with my iPhone and provides clear music. It worked pretty well in canceling some noise as well. I travel a lot and have put the phones through some rough use and it has held well. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and might consider replacing my Sony headphones (when they are due for change) with a better version of Sennheiser. I recommend a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear phones fit in the ear great","review":"I have trouble with most small ear phones trying to get them to stay in my ear. These are great. They fit directly into the ear and have adjustable sizes to fit your ear. They stay in great when walking on the treadmill. They cost a little more but you get what you pay for. The sound quality is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"They honor their warranty","review":"I bought these about 2 yrs ago when the price was in the mid $50 range. After a yr of use, left channel became distorted. I threw them in a drawer and forgot about them until this past October...with 2 wks left on warranty. I shipped them back with my Amazon.com receipt.

Time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, quality construction","review":"I have owned these headphones for two years now. I frequently use them at the gym or just for listening to music discretely on my laptop. I've put these headphones through a lot of abuse, including washing and drying them. They still work as well as the day I bought them and the sound is great.

This is a design feature that is so incredibly uncomfortable to me that I had to throw these right into the junk drawer. I wish the manufacturer would have stated this. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure to avoid unauthorized Sennheiser sellers - their stuff is fake!","review":"Sennheiser headphones are great. Unfortunately, many of the folks selling on Amazon.com are explicitly unauthorized Sennheiser sellers, meaning they're selling headphones that are counterfeit, defective, or have other problems. I noticed this when I purchased headphones from an unauthorized Sennheiser seller (Closeout Master) which then died within 4 months, even though my previous ones lasted 5 years. When I sent them to Sennheiser for warranty replacement, they called me and told me they were counterfeits and to check their website ([...]) and to not buy from any of the listed companies. The agent explained this wasn't them trying to keep their prices up or the like, but to just avoid places that sold knockoffs. I'm going to contact the seller and ask for a refund, although I doubt I'll get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value - wonky cord","review":"This is my second pair of these headphones. The earbuds work great in my ears isolate the sound pretty well, and block the outside noise a little too well, not recommended if you need to stay alert to your surroundings, like biking or operating large equipment.The sound quality is good, but it will not going to compete with something in the +$100 range.Biggest (and only) real complaint is the cord tends to get really twisted and it exhibits memory of this twisting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked OK while they lasted.","review":"Sound is better than most stock earbuds, and they are very good at shutting out external noise. Takes a bit of work to get them sized up & fitted correctly, and after that it still takes a while to get used to them. If you get them fitted in your ears just right, they have good frequency range for earbuds, but if you don't, the sound quality seriously suffers.Would have been happy enough with them but after about six months, sound from the left earbud failed. Got them pretty cheap so it's hardly worth it to try to RMA them, even if they are still under warranty. I have the HD580 and HD560 Sennheiser headphones and the sound on those is fantastic and they will last forever. A big reason why I bought these is because I thought I'd get the same sort of quality in these earbuds. It's disappointing to see Sennheiser put their name on an unreliable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Ear Buds for Sleeping","review":"These things are great. They sound great, the asymmetrical wires are very convenient, but most important for me is I can lay on my side and sleep with them on. I hardly can tell they are even there.

These headphones did everything that you expect out of a Sennheiser product in terms of sound quality but the within the first couple of months they started splitting down the center cord. A year later the center cord is now two cords and the left ear has stopped working. It was amazing in its time but unfortunately it is time to buy something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for outdoor use","review":"Bought these for running -- regret it now. They significantly amplify the \\"whistle\\" from wind. Cord bouncing also produces a very noticeable clicking noise. They also do not stay in my ear as well as my last ear buds, but that could be just me. Sound quality is good as long as you're relatively still and not outside. I absolutely hate the asymmetrical cord -- real PITA -- doesn't hang down naturally and pulls to one side. Regular ol' Y style cable seems to work best when active."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting...","review":"These earbuds aren't bad at all and really nice for average buds and for the price. I bought em couple years ago and I still use them... because they still work unlike some other ones. Straight 2.0 jacks never works for me cause they always get damages the way I use them but this has L shaped jack and it works perfect for me and the joints and the wire itself is very flexible so they don't break down easily. Only thing I personally didn't like was the the length difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it!","review":"Good earbuds with decent noise isolation. My only complaint is that when walking, there's a transmission of wind sound/thumping of cord against the body through the cord to the earbuds (not sure if I'm bring clear...). My roommate has the cx300 and we both actually prefer that model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted ear bud","review":"I received the ear buds in working conditions. However, within two weeks of receipt, the right ear bud busted.On the other hand, while the ear buds did last, I enjoyed using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"These are probably the best headphones of this type for the money. I would have given them five stars if the cord was just a little bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two of the three pair I own have stopped working!","review":"Like the title says, I bought one pair of these for my wife and she liked them at first, until they stopped working out of one of the ears buds. So since she liked them I bought her a replacement pair thinking it was just a fluke and just ordered an extra pair for myself. My pair has now stopped working out of one of the ear buds and we are down to just one pair again. I ordered a different style and manufacturer this time and we will see how it turns out."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific noise-reducing earphones","review":"I love these earphones-they are comfortable inside my ear, stay in place, and reduce noise enough for me to keep the volume low on my ipod. I can even listen to music on the train without blasting my ear drums! Unfortunately, they keep creeping up in price, undoubtedly because more people are discovering how awesome they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Sound, Bass, + Design for Money, Good Build Quality","review":"I have had these headphones for about a year and a half now, and I am finally inclined to write a review for them now. The sound quality is absolutely unbeatable at $30, and you will be very surprised at how well it isolates outside noises without needing to have the volume too high. The design and look of the headphones are nice, and are easily able to be worn over 2 hours without any discomfort in your ears or the ear itself. Packaging and feel were also very good, and I personally like the right ear bud going around your neck rather than the standard Y configuration. But after 20 months of using them for about 30 minutes everyday with exceptional performance, the right ear bud gave out. I tried these ear buds with other devices and I was disappointed to discover it was indeed the headphones.Despite breaking, I still think these are the best ear buds for this money or possibly more, and would recommend them to anybody. 9.5 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser = great sound for the price","review":"I actually bought 2 of these, each for around $20. The rubber piece around the chord of the left earbud broke due to my negligence on the first one, but it was still working (just uncomfortable to wear). I lost the second one while traveling. I now use the CX300 II, which is much better than this IMO.Pretty durable, extremely comfortable, and great earphones to study with as it plugs your ears. I love how the chord goes around the back of your neck, which adds tremendously to your comfort.Only bad thing is the sound (which is great for $20 headphones). I found the treble to be too high, and the bass to be too low (I am a fan of a flat equalizer BTW), but this is common to all earbuds around this price range. This is still 4x better than the earphones that come with iPods."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Earbuds","review":"The sound quality of these earbuds is ok on my ipod (which i was using these for) but i found i had to readjust the equalizer for different types of songs, which i never had to do with the regular Apple earbuds, and these were a replacement for those. i thought i'd try a different brand, but i ended up going with Apple instead. Plus the little rubber caps that actually fit into your ear simply pop right off very easily - something to look out for when using these, which is why they give you an extra pair when you buy these. But i DID NOT like that feature at all. i don't want any removable parts that were too easy to lose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ear-bud quality sucks","review":"where the cord splits for the ear-buds, one side is 2 and one half times longer than the other side, which is alright if one of your ears is 2 foot higher than the other one, otherwise thier quality sucks!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh.","review":"After the first day of using it, the right ear started buzzing every once in a while, after a couple weeks the buzzing does not go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome sounds","review":"HEY............................I WAS SURPRISED BY THE GREAT SOUND COMING OUT OFTHIS LESS EXPENSIVE ITEM. IT REALLY SOUNDS AWSOME ON MY I-POD. YOU SHOULD GET ONE!!!![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing value from Sennheiser","review":"Sennheiser does not provide any type of protective case for the earbuds or for the 'extra' ear cushions. After cutting and slicing out this product with scissors from the typical nasty sealed plastic packaging, you're stuck with all of these very fragile parts, and with no place to save and protect them when not in use. The earbud wires are incredibly thin and fragile, and I don't believe they will survive everyday use. The only thing impressive about this product is the \`Sennheiser' brand name; otherwise I've seen similar 'cheesy' products at the 'dollar' store for far less money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Annoying Earbuds","review":"These earbuds create a vacumn tight seal within your ears, this results in hearing yourself chew, or hearing the earbud cord as it rubs against your cheek or clothes. VERY ANNOYING. I imagine that the only way to enjoy these earbuds is to sit very still and not move at all. I can't believe that they user tested this and found this not to be a problem. If you rock out to music, or move around you will hear the revirb (very equivalent to the sounds you hear while underwater in a pool) of your own movements. These revirb sounds are as loud or even louder than the music playing. Swapping out ear plugs lessen the problem but does not eliminate it.Apart from this, the sound quality is only mediocre. I was not particulary blown away or amazed with the sound quality. Just a very mediocre set of earbuds that causes more frustration than anything else. Lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I bought these to use at the gym and while walking in NYC. Sure they're not the finest on the market, and the fit does take a little getting used to, but they do seriously cut down the necessary volume, and they do so for a good price.I intend to buy a a second set for my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"So I bought these earbuds b/c I lost my Sony ones, and b/c of the positive reviews on here re: sound quality. I admit to having a critical ear, but these earbuds are sorely lacking in this area. They're heavy on midrange and harsh, tinny highs, and almost no bass - contrary to many of the reviews here. My Sony pair wasn't expensive, but had far more range in sound than these things, including bass. The Sennheiser's sound like you're listening through small soda cans, to simplify it.The only positive I can give em is that they fit in the ear well, and are far better than the ridiculous earbuds that come with the iPods in fitment.Overall, unless you have zero concern re: sound quality and are satisfied w/ the sound of your stock iPod buds, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earbuds when you want to shut-out the world.","review":"These little buds are extremely comfortable, and flexible for all ear sizes with 3 different sets of cushions. I recently used them on a business trip to Italy and they were perfect for the long flights to shut-out the sound of the engines and crying babies.The sound quality is great and you forget you even have them in! It takes a little getting used to the different lengths on each bud, but it's not a game breaker. As for quality, they've lasted on the planes and trains so far without any issue. I don't necessarily take great care of them either. I simply stuff them back in the computer bag when I'm not using them and they are always ready to go immediately. Unless they break prematurely I'll probably stick with Sennheiser after this. My wife likes J-buds for their different colors, but I think the sound and bass quality out of the Senns are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muffled sound quality","review":"Too much bass response and the sound is muffled really bad. The price is good and the noise blocking is good but if you want really good sound quality, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack Bass, sound is tinny","review":"These earbuds sound very tinny and lack bass. The basic earbuds that came with my ipod sound so much fuller and have much more bass. I was looking for an upgrade in sound and these earbuds sound worse. If you like rich, full, bass sound, don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord Length is ridiculous","review":"I never post reviews and I'm not incredibly critical when it comes to products this cheap....that said the cord length is so awful that these are going straight in the garbage. The left earpiece cord length is about 6 inches - that's fine. The right ear cord is about a foot and a quarter - no exaggeration. I saw that these were rated highly on amazon so decided to give it a shot. I really regret not reading the one star reviews - which I usually skip - because I'd have $25 buck still in my pocket. Now I'm going to have to go out and buy another freaking pair of cheap headphones when I could've gotten decent ones for $50. If your thinking about buying these and don't mind a insane amount of cord drooping from your right ear, by all means go ahead, sound quality and comfort are both ok, but for me I couldn't handle right earpiece cord long enough to hang myself with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the pouch?","review":"These are great earbuds, but where is the pouch that is supposed to hold them? I did not receive one in my packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"four months and loving it","review":"There are sellers selling fakes. So if you have a bad pair, check it's authenticity.I've been just using the stock ipod earbuds for years. I finally got frustrated after a few years. The rubber kept tearing off and fairly uncomfortable after a period of time.Sennheiser CX300s are great. The quality isn't great on my netbook, but it's because of the netbook audio specs. For someone who isn't an audiophile, these earbuds sound great with my ipod. Also the sound isolation is very helpful for a college student with 3 roommates and likes to study at home. I just turn on Pandora and they don't exist (if they make loud noises, then yes they are audible but not bothersome). I can't speak for durability. I keep them in a tin case so they aren't squished and whatnot. The wire noise isn't bothersome when you have volume up enough to not hear someone speaking to you -- which isn't too high.Very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low profile stuff. Don't buy it!","review":"This earplug is very disappointing. It has very poor bass response. And it feels uncomfortable when you wear it for a while.I guess this the cheapest Sennheiser stuff. I bought other earphones of Amazon at the similar price. They are much better than this one.So, don't ever buy it. It does not worth it!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with stock earbuds","review":"Read the glowing reviews for these when I lost my Zune stock earbuds, and decided to go for it. A cheap mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. I use my Zune while working out at the gym, and as soon as I started up my playlist with these connected, I noticed cracking noises and severe acoustic inaccuracies. As far as the noise canceling issue goes, I heard a conversation going on about six feet away while using these. Don't make my mistake; get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Have been scouring reviews on different budget headphones and earbuds. Decided to try the CX-300's due to mostly good reviews and price point. Sound is OK, a bit better but nothing extraordinary compared to the standard IPOD earbuds or my old Sony MDR-V200's. For the price ($21)they are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"These earbuds have very good sound quality, stay in place, block quite a bit of ambient noice, and, for me, are very comfortable to wear. Although not as good at blocking noise as my Bose Noise Cancelling headset, they are acceptable for use on airplanes. Speaker effiency is higher than other earbuds I've tried requiring lower settings on my iPod to obtain the same volume level. My only complaint is the lack of any storage case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay in the ear","review":"I purchased the CX300, because it came with different size ear buds. However I found that none of the buds would keep the earphones in my ears even when sitting. I finally had to remove the buds entirely but then found that there was no base although the sound was good. I guess I have large ears would you think? They are inexpensive enough that I didn't send them back. If you have no problem with regular ear buds I feel sure that they would work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly... bad?","review":"These headphones have pretty solid reviews and they're Sennheiser, so they seemed like a sure thing. Unfortunately, they just don't sound good at all! I'm no audiophile but these headphones are about the same as or worse than my iPod buds. The sound is really a muddy, tinny mess most of the time and the bass is probably worse than my iPod set. Maybe I got a broken pair or something? Maybe my ears don't work? I tried these on my computer and iPod with no great results.Edit: if you set the EQ on your iPod to \\"Small Speakers\\" these sound OK"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, the best","review":"This is my second pair, the other one is at my friend's possesion. Both are working well, excellent sound quality for everyday use with notebook, cell phone... Just couple of points.Make sure it is well placed in your ear to get maximum bass.Not very good for workouts, touching the wires makes funny sounds.No carrying case.The wire is the right size to have the player in your pocket near waistline.And, avoid listening at high levels, you will damage your hearing over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Awesome!","review":"I really like these headphones they sound really good with deep bass.Oh the headphones wires are different lengths.The longer one is to wrap around the back of your neck.At first I was trippin'.They work great with my Ipod Nano 4g."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved them for 3 months till the cord quit working","review":"I couldn't be happier with the sound quality from these headphones, but that great sound quit working after 3 months. (I also had durability problems with my iPhone earbuds from Sennheiser.)Fits well: With the three sizes of ear pads, it is easy to fit them comfortably in my ears.Noise isolation: They do very well at blocking outside noise. I was actually at a postgame celebration for the Columbus Crew and was able to block out the outside noise and hear the audio at a comfortable level.FRAGILE: If it weren't for the terrible durability of the cord, I would highly recommend the Sennheiser collection of ear buds.Sorry, Sennheiser, you let a tiny wire ruin what could have been a near perfect product. Fail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine until they stop working","review":"I'm pretty careful with my headphones, and mostly use them when walking around the city. I have had 2 pairs stop working on one side since I bought the first in July 2009 (5 months ago). I won't be buying these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earphones for the price","review":"Looks and feels great. Very good bass reproduction. I just don't like the asymmetric size of the L and R wires, and that's probably 'cos I don't really understand the need for the asymmetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"So called\\" Sennheiser Earbuds","review":"I'm sure if these were an authentic pair of Sennheiser earbuds, they would be great. What I received was a $5 knock off. Be careful who you purchase an item from. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The pair I received are junk. I tried to leave negative feedback for the merchant but removed it for editing and was unable to rewrite my feedback.

Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality","review":"Compared to other in ear head phones I have tried I was very disappointed with these. I had bought some regular earphones from Senheiser and they were comfortable, efficient and had good bass.These in ear buds needed the MP3 player cranked up to maximum and the bass was lacking despite equalization compared to the give away ones you get with a Sansa MP3 player.I would not recommend these in ear buds and especially not at the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfit","review":"I have read other reviews for this item which warned against counterfits. This is one. A few months back I purchased the same item from a different vendor and based on how the first one performed for me I decided to purchase an inentical item for her. This earbud does not even come close to performing like the genuine sennheiser. It was not even packaged the same. One ear piece was longer than the other. The genuine sennheiser had a carry case and a device to wrap the cord around when the item was not in use. I would not ever recommend this item or this vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay headphones but...","review":"Horrible durability! Right earphone broke down and stopped working after just over a month! Showed signs of breaking after half a month, where the sounds sometimes were very discreetly muted in the right earphone. paid over 40 dollars for these earphones, thought I was getting something good.What a ripoff...will send the company an e-mail, I'd be horribly disappointed if I don't get a refund or replacement or at least some kind of reimbursement.And aside from the breaking down, the bass is too strong, the sound quality is average at best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Worthless","review":"\\"Bass-driven sound\\" is far from true. These headphones have a horribly tinny sound; the earbuds that came with my iPod have better sound than these. This came as a big surprise for me because I have owned two pairs of Sennheiser headphones and have always used Sennheiser as a reference point for good sound. In addition, the wires on these earbuds are so thin that I'm sure I won't have to tolerate the sound for more than a few months. The next time I will just buy a pair of Apple earbuds.These earbuds are a huge disappointment. I would not recommend them to anyone for any reason. I've now had them for 6 months and have bought a pair of Apple earbuds to replace them. The earbuds are more comfortable and have much better sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Them.....","review":"The audio quality isn't great. I just bought a pair to replace my V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds that my dog recently destroyed. I would rather have the Freqs. If your looking for decent buds in this price range, skip these and head to the VMODAs .... trust me, you will be more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly engineered--do not buy!","review":"This product is incredibly poorly designed. Like many, I use these earphones to listen to music while working out. The cord design is so poor that you hear incredibly loud and annoying sounds every time the cord brushes against you. I've never had this problem with other earphones, and it's so annoying that I'd be much better off listening to the much cheaper earphones that came with my MP3. I really regret wasting my $ on this product and strongly advise against buying it. I can't believe Sennheiser engineering is this bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"even the best manufacturers have duds","review":"This is an altogether inferior product. The length differential in right and left ear bud feeds is silly and arbitrary. The buds do not fit well into the ear, no matter what size I use, and the sound quality is almost as good as competing products. After two months of light use, the left channel died. A week later the right channel died. Junk. Avoid. Fortunately, seller is taking back the junk for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased in May, broken by December","review":"This morning the right side just stopped working. Very disappointing, as I have only had these since May. I just use them on my commute to and from work, so not really putting them through much.

The sound quality is fantastic and they have held up wonderfully. One pair is a \\"waterproof\\" running set, that I run with 4 times a week and always rinse off after I'm finished, and I haven't had a single issue with them. These on the other hand have developed static after just 5 uses. I'm so disappointed. I haven't heard a single ounce of static from my other headphones, but these have started to crackle badly if the volume is anything above the minimum. It sounds like a blown speaker. I'm worried I received a knock off brand set or something, as Sennheiser product should never act like these have."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are the worst.","review":"Yeah, these broke after two months. Which is one month past the Amazon return window. The sound started going out in one ear, and I had to do that thing where you gently jiggle the cord and hold it just so, in order to find *just* the right position for stereo sound to work. In protest, both sides stopped working. Huzzah! I would certainly not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This product comes with a two-year warranty on the ORIGINAL purchase only. The original headphones broke after about 18 months, and the replacement pair broke after only 8 months.

The right earpiece stopped working properly almost exactly 1 year later. The price on these was just right, so I bought a new set.What a disappointment.In A-B comparison, my left ear only model produced much better bass, and much more natural mid-range.The new model is overly bright in the mid-range, and the bass has virtually disappeared. Looking at the earbuds, the new model is a matte black, and the screen protecting the driver is a much larger \\"grid pattern\\".The old model has a glossy finish, a finer grid pattern, and inserts more fully in the ear.Now I need to try and find a place to repair my old ones. The new CX-300 is an extreme disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright sound, not very durable","review":"These are very bright, meaning there's a lot of high end compared to the midrange or bass. Not a lot of detail in the high end either. I am an audiophile.Bought these for my teen-age son. They lasted only a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality, very poor fit","review":"The sound quality is very good, but it is impossible to walk or even move your head without getting at least one of the headphones out of place. The cable is short too.If they could fit better definitely they will be the best option. I didn't wanted to spend more than $30 without sacrificing sound quality and that is exactly what I got, but you can't go through a whole song without getting them put of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One Bites the Dust......","review":"In my five year search for a pair of ear buds that I can use daily that will last longer than 1 year, the Sennheiser CX300 fell short. About six months have passed and one ear bud does not work unless I twist the cord at the plug point. The ear buds are under warranty, but I have to pay for shipping and they recommend I pay for another pair when I ship my current broken pair to them, ha! Another great thing is it is up to them weather they send me a refurbished pair or not, wow. I love my other Sennheiser headphones, but these ear buds lack durability. While they worked the sound was good I will say."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have normal sized ears ...","review":"...However no matter how many different ways i try to wear these, I cannot get a good result. I have tried all different (3) sizes of ear-pieces, I have tried pushing them as far into my ear as they will go, leaving them barely in (in which case they fall out), I have tried adjusting the sound settings on my MP3 players - and I still cannot get good sound from them AND get them to stay comfortably in my ear when i am running or at the gym.It may be a bi-product of the above, but the volume is also very low compared to other headphones.FAIL for me.. so be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!","review":"Nothing about these headphones works for me.

This one did let me down. for some reason the \\"S\\" sounds like \\"SSSSSSSS\\". i.e like a hissing sound. The bass is pretty good and so is the sound isolation. Even though i sound a bit critical about the hissing sound, these headphones are pretty good and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good for the price","review":"I purchased these headphones through a sale here on Amazon.com. The sound quality is very good and they fit comfortably in my ears. I typically avoid in-ear headphones, but I haven't been able to find a good pair of headphones that rest just out side the ear. The offset length of cord from earbud to earbud may be a plus to some, or an annoyance to others. If you are looking for a good priced in ear headset, I definately recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sound investment","review":"Great sound ioslation. I use them at work and sometimes I miss my phone calls. Yikes. I like the rubberized wires, it keeps it in place when I put them in my pocket.

I mean, they don't give the best big hall sound like some of the expensive headphones but they will do the job just fine. especially if you excrcise with them. they stay in place.8/11/11 Edit:OMG. it is still working great.

Lower bitrates still sound good, but one can distinguish the difference between a good audio source and a compressed format like MP3.The earbuds come with 3 different sizes to make sure it fits in the ear canal correctly.

The left earbud has a cord length of about 12 inches and the right has a length double that.

They fit nicely in the ear, and look ok too. I wish the cord was a bit more rugged and the jack was straight rather than 90, but for $20 I can live with this.What I can't stand, and what's not written about in the product description, is that the cord is asymmetric. The left side is shorter than the right after the Y split. I can't stand this. It feels like I have something constantly pulling on my left ear. And then I have this large loop dangling around my neck. It doesn't work for me, and I would have gladly paid more money for something without it. If I had known in advance I would not have purchased these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"DECENT SOUND BUT POOR QUALITY","review":"I use these earphones primarily while commuting to work by train. The sound isolation was decent as was the sound but the earphones came apart after only about a months use.

I absolutely hate the sound quality of the stock iPod headphones. These have a pretty good sound. They're not in the same category of the Shure headphones, but they're not $400, either. The different sized inserts are awesome. I jog with these and they stay put.

These are balanced sounding with flat response across the frequency spectrum. This is not to say they don't sound good, they are merely accurate without having over-exaggerated bass frequencies. The price I paid $30 was very reasonable. Also, I applied for the $15 rebate through Sennheiser which will end up making these around $20 net, not a bad deal at all. Once again, I want to applaud Amazon's expedient service. Ordered on Tuesday with free shipping, received on Saturday. Thank you for making such a quality product available at such an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgrade","review":"As stated in other reviews, you need to make sure that these are in your ear with a seal. I experimented with the different size pads before figuring out that the largest ones create the best seal for me. Once that is done, you can really hear the bass, but in a balanced way - not overbearing at all. This was an inexpensive upgrade from the ipod buds. Blocks out outside noise very well. I'm not sure how you can give these a bad review unless they are improperly fitted in ear, or you like bass that drowns out the rest of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Sound Detailing of Music...","review":"Sennheiser CX300-B is aural candy. Intricate passages of music can be clearly heard and appreciated by the listener. While comparing other earbuds requires one to overly focus on rhythms easily heard using the Sennheiser. There can be no true appreciation of music if you cannot hear the written note. I sleep in these without discomfort. They have superior noise cancellation quality.

Following the instructions - charge at least 10 hours before 1st use - the battery is simply not strong enough for the motor. The new knife is no different than the old one - the blades move slowly and once in the turkey or roast, totally bog down. (Then you saw with the blades as if using a regular knife). It turned out that the \\"old\\" battery is just fine. My advice would be that if you don't already have this unit, find another brand or manufacturer. Now I have 2 of everything and they're basically useless. If there was any \\"return within so many days for a full refund, I would take it.

The customer rep very politely informed me that THEY STOPPED MAKING THIS 2 OR 3 YEARS AGO. She was really sorry and let me know that the WARRANTY IS NO GOOD. It expired when they stopped making it.

All of my entertainment is here.

WIndows is probably the worst way to use any media and it is what will probably doom this player to failure. A player such as iPod is so much better suited to let you enjoy your photos or music. Apple's iPod is intuitive which is why its such a better player than ones like this that use the horrible Windows media center software. If you have 500 bucks to waste on a player that isnt intuitive and that has the comfort factor of carrying a bread box in your pocket this is the player for you.

I had recently seen the movie of Pelle the Conqueror (which covers the 1st part of the four-part book) starring Max von Sydow as Lasse, and asked our walking tour guide about it. He was excited to speak about it, and said it was the most important work of historical fiction written about Denmark.With that kind of recommendation, I sought the first book (Pelle the Conqueror: Childhood) through Amazon.com and read it. I am happy to say that it belongs with the most important pieces of historical literature in existence, yet at the same time is very readable. The main characters become cherished friends as you read about them.

Lovecraft and the imagination of Nox Arcana rolled into a well packaged and recorded form. Still, I get the feeling that the music is lacking something important. The pieces start capably, rumbling along nicely with \\"voice of doom\\" choirs and brooding keyboards. However, after the stage is set with all of this, no melodic development or \\"B\\" section occurs and no other instruments are tossed into the mix. After 3 or 4 creepy tunes the project starts to run in place. I give these guys high marks for their invention of cool \\"seance soundtracks\\" but the execution feels kinda uninspired...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What music for an HP Lovecraft CD SHOULD sound like.","review":"This cd is packed with powerful, ominous, and forebooding orchestrations.

My favorite is Red River, but The Big Lift has just entered my heart. Monty is such the romantic. With his dark hair, thin frame, and piercing eyes he makes you want to hug and protect him.He is vulnerable in this film to a German woman looking to escape Berlin to be with her lover in St. Louis. She charms Monty into wanting to marry her and take her to the USA. In the end, when he discovers her affections are for another, he is crushed, as was I. You just don't take advantage of Monty that way! I was glad to see everyone turn their backs on her.The military footage, plane sequences, and constant reiteration of the difference between Democray and Communism is to be expected as this is a wartime film. But the real story is about the deception of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"I received the first copy and found a defect.

This movie takes place during the Berlin Airlift, the heroic effort by the western allies to keep Berlin supplied from the air after the Soviets closed down all ground access to the city. In this film an American airman learns to love and forgive in the ruins of Germany. Filmed in postwar Germany and featuring many actual servicemen this movie may not have the glitz or the special effects or the outdoor sets or big budgets but that makes it even more accurate film as far as I can tell. Germany was still in ruins from the bombing of the Western Allies and the ground fighting that took place in Berlin itself. This makes it more real than Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining History","review":"The Big Lift is an important historical document as well as a fascinating look back at a tense moment in modern history. With only two well-known professional actors, Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas in the cast, the film brings to life an event now known only in history books in a brief paragraph. We catch the atmosphere of the early Cold War period, with the wariness of both the Americans and the Russians in their high stakes game for control of Berlin. The stories of the GIs and their romances with the local women, as well as their encounters with other German citizens makes a fascinating story. The images of Berlin in ruins is a graphic reminder of the destruction of war. It's also well worth watching to see a young Monty in one of his very early roles.Unfortunately the quality of the film is less than perfect. It really deserves a good restoration befitting its importance. Along with \\"The Search,\\" it belongs in any history buff's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Context Is the Key","review":"In spite of the title and promotional text, the story of the Berlin Airlift is actually only the context of the story of love and betrayal between an American GI and a German civilian in post-war Berlin. The black-and-white picture and sound quality are low, but the scenery is compelling. In 1948 Berlin, we see the extent of devastation left over from the War, including shots of the Brandenburg Gate and the Bundestag. Some amazing shots are provided of US transports flying below the level of apartment roofs on the approach to the Air Force landing field. Comic relief is provided by a sub-plot regarding the spilling of paint on the GI's uniform, and its loss by the German cleaner. As the main characters hide from American MPs, they flee into the Soviet sector, then escape Soviet guards by fleeing into the British sector."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Lift","review":"The movie shows \\"The Berlin Airlift\\" in detailed footage in a post war Germany,and the lenghts one woman will go thru to leave the country by taking advantage of her now lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!!","review":"The DVD arrived in excellent condition, sealed and brand new, and has so far worked perfectly.

When you read the book, you also have a strong sense of Ms. Williams' love for gardening and her commitment to a healthly environment.

Tempi were thoughtfully chosen and He brings out the melodic line and elaborations beautifuly with a natural rubato and beautiful tone-color. Long-term association with these pieces, allowed Perlemuter to play some details, such as the famous E-flat through the end of the F major Prelude, very effectively. strongly recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheep stroller","review":"Had my stroller for about 2 months and the wheel in the front is bent and i cant fix it.. very cheeply made..

I was charged a whopping 19.95 plus 4.95 shipping for this 26 minute joke! Since several minutes in the beginning and the end are distorted or in fast motion, I figure there is about 15 minutes of film, much of which is shown and reshown. They show Tuf Hedeman's \\"pass\\" in riding Bodacious but don't even show the ride that injured him so badly that he felt he had to \\"pass\\" on the next ride!

The first two times I had no problems sewing bathroom curtains and patching a couple pairs of pants. This time however, while doing a straight stitch for a hem the needle kept jamming in the bobbin area breaking three needles. I noticed that there was a clinking sound when the needle would go down below the machine surface. Upon further inspection I noticed the needle was hitting on the toothlike part in the bobbin area. I have changed needles, tried to readjust the foot and even tested various fabrics to see if there would be a difference, but to no avail.

As far as I know, all the other songs on here are done by the original bands (I could be wrong), but this sticks out. It is totally lifeless compared to the original version. Otherwise, all the rest are great (mostly 1980s) moody, yet upbeat, songs. This is a good \\"listen to in the rain\\" cd!!

In fact, you can find 4-CD sets with the same songs for even cheaper. The comp only serves as a reminder that Suicide Girls aren't just a bunch of hot girls on a website, but a fast-growing marketable brand. But the worst thing on this comp, if not on this entire planet, is Alkaline Trio covering \\"Lucretia My Reflection.\\" NOBODY should ever be allowed to touch that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear PRAT with FELA","review":"PRAT - acronym for \\"Pace, Rythm and Timing\\". Surprised I'm the 2nd reviewer of this phenomenal recording. It is not an audiophile quality recording. Probably a conservative B on sonic excellence. The value is in the brilliant horn arrangements (accompanied by skillfully played rythm guitar, electric base and percussions) and the genius of the artist who is the innovator of Afro-beat. There are hints of jazz influences but Fela stays close to his African heritage. The music has hypnotic qualities but also can give the listener a great sense of self-abandonment and freedom.I agree with all the sentiments and comments of the previous reviewer - if you are new to Fela's music - this is a must. It is a safe buy to be treasured.The only aspect of Fela's music that may be difficult for western listeners is the length of each track which may easily exceed 10 minutes. If you are not familiar with Fela, YouTube has some very interesting live concert footage that may be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Husker Du's second album of 1985 was this underrated gem, perhaps their strongest album from front to back. Produced now by Mould and Hart, the sound is brighter, with more attack, almost like power-pop hopped up on hardcore punk. The songs are great, too, with the FANTASTIC Makes No Sense At All, Keep Hanging On, Divide and Conquer, Flip Your Wig, and Private Plane as some of the strongest. Two of the best songs Husker Du EVER RECORDED, Grant Hart's beuatiful Green Eyes, and Bob Mould's damn-near-perfect Games, are the centerpieces of this album, in my opinion. Simply jaw-dropping, the both of them. The Baby Song is a throwaway, but it'll make you laugh. Fantastic record, and essential. Their last album for SST before moving to Warner Bros."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album changed my life","review":"Husker Du, along with Soul Asylum and the Replacements defined the Minneapolis sound and started the whole power pop thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it at all","review":"I read reviews of this album that make it sound so incredibly awesome that I can't bring myself to sell it. I'm convinced I'm missing something. The songs sound generic and boring to me. Nothing really takes off; it's all a mush of unadventurous and uninteresting guitar rock. Husker Du is often listed alongside bands like Minor Threat and their 90's incarnation Fugazi as being among the noble fathers and seminal bands of hardcore punk. I don't see it. There's no fury here. Even Bad Religion is more vital-sounding than this.There's a couple of good songs here. It's certainly preferable listening to the popular crap invading MTV and the airwaves today, but if you really want to find hardcore gems, stick to Youth of Today and Minor Threat. If you just want some quality punk rock - how could you go wrong with The Clash?"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful book","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

I bought it 3 1/2 years ago, probably use it 3 to 4 times a week. I heard some loud crackings when I used it the other day and discovered that the copper base had warped- it has a large 'bubble' raised on the underside of the pan.

Overall it really isnt a bad album and id recommend it to anyone.. After they get there earlier ones first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction.","review":"Adam Yauch was wrong. The Bad Brains debut isn't the best punk/hardcore album of all time....I against I is! So many classic songs...House of Suffering, Re-ignition, Secret 77.....and of course, the title track, which has H.R. singing in about 5 different voices. The whole band is amazing throughout, especially Dr.Know. Also, this album has slightly better sound quality than their first album. I dunno if I'd go as far as calling it the best punk album of all time (I think that title goes to London Calling) but it just might be the greatest hardcore/metal album of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This is my personal favorite Bad Brains album. If you're expecting something like their first album you'll be shocked. I Against I has little resemblance to the Bad Brains that released the masterpiece self-titled album and Rock For Light a few years before. On this one they slow it down (quite alot on some songs and just a little on others) and make even more of an original sound. The sound they achieve on here is probably best described as just plain beautiful; if you don't get chills running down your spine from the start of the album to the end of \\"Sacred Love\\" you may need to check some things out. This album gets my highest reccomendation and I hope you will fall in love with this album as much as I did; it's as much of a life-changer as the self-titled album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awwwww Cheeezit!!","review":"You want a GREAT rock record???..get this!!!..I would rather hit myself in the crotch with a hammer than live without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jah Rastafari","review":"After the frenetic pace of Rock For Light, the Bad Brains slow things down (slightly) and came up with this, their definitive record in 1986. I Against I is propelled along by the great bass and drums of Darryl Jennifer and Earl Hudson and the snarling quitar licks of Dr. Know. Add to this the rastafarian heavy lyrics of H.R. sung in his unique voice and you have one of the greatest records of the 80s.An incredible burst of energy that merges heavy metal and reggae, Bad Brains forged a unique sound all their own. Secret 77, She's Calling You, Sacred Love(the vocals on this one were indeed phoned in from jail), and Return To Heaven are all mind blowing mini-masterpieces.

I say 'at first' because I came to be more addicted to 'Too High to Die'...if you're used to cleaner sounding lyrics and riffs that are fairly easy-going, go for 'Too High to Die', if you love the 'Pups for their excellent alternative riffs, backed by some brilliantly vivid imagery (lyrically and musically) and want a truly original, alternative record -(not that the others aren't, just that this one is more so than some of the later ones) -go for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Faith-Builder of the modern day \\"Book of Acts.\\"","review":"This book was passed to me by the Director of Education for our missions department.

A great read!","review":"The Tales of the Mustard Twins is a delightful read. I'm not usually one to read books of the young adult genre but it somehow found me, and having read the back cover, I couldn't resist throwing myself into the story.The theme is based around two young female twins from a well-to-do family in London. Their super-active imagination actually transports them across time and space into ancient Egypt. This is where the book's cleverness shines through. It is part history lesson and part fairy tale, but will appeal to all ages. The book certainly doesn't condescend to potential young readers, and for Mr Nimmo's first book this is a stellar effort.I shall certainly be following the subsequent books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mustard Twins","review":"I love fantasy, but this one missed the mark.

I only watched this movie because Natasha Henstridge is in it but even her beauty isn't worth the excruciating banality of this embarrassment to cinema.

I remember loving the story....but for some reason I never read the other books. A month ago, I found Flowers in the Attic at the local Goodwill. I bought it, remembering how good it was. Instantly I was swept into that magical, horrible world of the Dollaganger Family. I could not put the book down, and as soon as it was finished I ran to the store to by the other 4 books! I finished them all in about 3 weeks....not bad considering my busy schedule! When I finished Seeds of Yesterday I cried and my heart ached for the Chris and Cathy I would no longer share life with. Garden of Shadows only deepened the Foxworth mystery, leaving me thirsty for more secrets of jealousy & betrayal....and the unforgiving punishment of the innocent.

It is a movie that throws light on how the 2 generations don't understand each other and how broad each of their thinking is. With a starcast like Deepika Padukone and Saif Ali Khan, who are the face of youth in Bollywood, the movie shows how love in two different generations was the same feeling.... flowery. It's just about how people treat their love differently. Comparing the lifestyles of people in 2 different countries, the movie is based in London, Delhi and Calcutta. It showcases the best of the 2 countries.It's a feel good movie and worth watching again and again with the high quality picturization and amazing dance and romantic songs churned into a beautiful tale of 2 generations that makes you feel that \\"love\\" is truly a bliss and worth giving your life for just like Veer (Saif Ali Khan) does!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon rental video-Very Satisfactory Experience","review":"I bought this rental video from Amazon and I was really satisfied with the clarity and print with no interruption.

He comments on the so called\\"great matches\\" with admiration and wants the reader to be comforted that deaths only occur in a small percentage of the matches. Then he praises the breeders of the past who specifically bred their dogs for their own selfish enjoyment. \\"WHAT A HUMANITARIAN\\"! What person in their right mind would subject their dog to possibly cause death to another or have themselves killed, just because the breed loves to fight and please their owner. The breed will continue to suffer as long as writers like Richard Stratton continue to publish trash and attract those not worthy of owning such a fine breed of dog.

Honestly, no one tells the true story concerning this breed like this author and his literature is a must for anyone interested in the breed.

In short, this is an excellent book for the newcomer to the breed or for the experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all A.P.B.T lovers!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you have an American Pit Bull Terrier, want an American Pit Bull Terrier, or just want to learn about the breed, you have to read this book. This book tells you just about everything you will ever need to know about American Pit Bull Terriers. Also the way that Stratton writes his books makes them easy to read, fun to read, and keeps you interested all the way through. If you are thinking about getting an American Pit Bull Terrier, you must read this book.

Instead I found the author completely in favor of, and promoting fighting. It is book's just like this that give pit bull's a bad rap. TRUE lovers of the breed know their genuine potential as an incredibly affectionate and loving dog. My pit bull is so gentle and cuddly. Working in a vet clinic, I often see the results of accidental fights. NEVER would someone intentionally expose somthing they \\"love\\" to this situation. They never have and never will appreciate this dog. They love the way their ego's feel watching two dogs rip each other apart. It is disgusting. If people succeed in outlawing this breed, it will be with the help of book's like this. Once again, this book is about what people have made the breed. Not the breed itself. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitbull's & Stratton","review":"I won't say too much about the topic.....I have owned this book for over 10yrs along with several other Pitbull titled books.....I got to give it to Stratton, this has been my favorite for years....I never get tired of referring to his book, seeing that I am a dogman myself.....I just recently purchased a lil' pup from the decendant CH' Jeep.....I hope he turn's out to be just like his ancestor.....I have also recently purchased The Truth About the American Pitbull.....I hope it's as good as World of the American Pitbull Terrier....All hat's off to the great dog men of all time......ps I have owned several pitbulls in my life time....I am now going to build a new yard for success.....You'll hear from me again in the near future or even in the Gazette.....PITBULL'S LIVE ON!

This is a glorious mess of an album which is equally indebted to the Undertones as Beggar's Banquet-era Stones. The basic sound is punk rock via the melodic simplicity of the Buzzcocks but crashing cymbals and dissonant guitar lines as well as the absolutely puzzling lines sung by Falling James Moreland with such conviction leave the band far afield of simple punk rock a la labelmates Slovenly, the Meat Puppets and the Minutemen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item pictured is not what SleekHair sends!

The narrative graphic are beautiful and exciting however the game graphics are not really interactive. It seems as though you are just looking at a picture either up close or far away as you play.

When I ran this game for the first time I was very impressed with an introductory movie that was very long, detailed and creepy. I couldn't wait to start playing to see more of that. However, once I started playing I was dissappointed with this game and it's over-simplicity.There are only certain places that you can move to. Want to go check out that dark corner over there? Forget it, you can't. You can turn around 360 degrees but only move in one direction, go figure. You collect different items and solve different puzzles and that's all this game really is. It's a pretty puzzle game. There are no special effects and no movement by the monsters.

But altogether, this was a fairly tame game for an M, so I will recommend it for around the teen-ager and up category, but only for the mature ones.

The work is certainly put out by nonbelievers - skeptics who have trouble believing the Bible and at the same time are trying to explain the most pivotal event in the history of mankind, namely the entry of the Christ of God into time and space. When I saw the little heretic, Dominique Crossan, interviewed over and over again I knew I had a turkey on my hands.

I love Paul Gross, but his ego is too big even for the vast expanse of the Canadian north, and this is essentially his big ego party, with all his favorite people playing on that for him. Molly Parker, from Deadwood, is wasted here, and she usually brings a quality to anything she's in. It's filled with Gross's obsession with scatalogical \\"humor,\\" really bad slapstick \\"comedy,\\" and generally makes Canadians look very bad indeed.

Most girls is less horrible, but the dancing is not smooth and you can tell she isn't in the same skill as Britney or Mya's dancing.

The authors tried to teach Economics in a totally different way, no graphs, no tables, no data, etc. and failed miserably.The fact that there aren't any graphs, pie charts, etc. makes it hard to follow especially if you're more a visual person. It has a hokey \\"down home\\" feel to it that doesn't connect, except in a geeky-dork way. And the book is disorganized in terms of the material covered.In short, the book is written like a novel or a story, NOT as a textbook.

For days now I've been attempting to get music to the MP3 player from the web downloaded MusicMatch Jukebox, but without success. The software that accompanied the player is missing critical components, such as any usable plug-in. When attempts to retrieve the plug-in from ANY web site, it's nowhere to be found. Neither MusicMatch nor Windows Media Player can even find the MP3 player at all! Obviously, this is an old player in terms of the electronics industry. The Users Manual leaves something to be desired as well. With letterhead only an ant can read and the fact that it repeats completed installation steps only leaves one wondering if a step was missed.

It is a mis-mash of 3 books for readers of different ages. It is overcomplicated for young readers (e.g. do adults know what egrets and kookaburras are, can you tell gosling and duckling apart). The pictures are unclear (e.g the turkey and rooster only have close-ups of the head, which makes them look pretty alike). The worst is the Dinosaur book, which is inappropriate for kids under 7-8 years (who I suspect wont need to learn school bus and cat from picture books). Full 10 pages are devotes to dinosaurs.

I guess that's useful for draining greasy foods while cooking but for eggs or pancakes it can be downright awful. The tiny nubs that are supposed to latch the legs into position are either not molded properly or not there at all. The cooking surface tilts at the most inopportune times. I'd recommend this product if the manufacturer could get that part straight. Otherwise steer clear. The surface is good non-stick and the element heats relatively evenly for a surface this large. And if you plan to cook nothing but food that needs to be drained than the tilting problem is okay and this is the one for you. The size is large enough to cook for a full family at one time.

We've used a charcoal grill for years, but this time I added this griddle. It was a big hit. At night it was cold outside, but all I needed was 5 loaves of bread, a tub of soft butter, some garlic powder, a huge package of cheese slices and I was set. This griddle made a ton of perfect grilled cheese sandwiches without causing a mess. (Note: using real butter and garlic powder allows you to use the cheapest bread and cheese and still have them taste great).

I complained to the owner of the store where I buy it that this particular flavor always sells out first. He now keeps 2 extra cases on hand just for me.This granola is unique. Maybe that's why some people don't like it. It's like none I've ever tasted. Once I made a bowl of it and had to stick it in the fridge to go and answer the door. I of course forgot about it till the next day. I saw it and it had turned into a oatmeal of sorts. I decided to taste it and damn if it wasn't good in a different way.This is premium granola.

This documentary takes us through the building of a single piano, Steinway Model D Number L1037. And every step of the way is fascinating. I am in awe of the dedication and craftsmanship of all the people involved. I also loved the snippets of conversation with such pianistic luminaries as H��l��ne Grimaud and Pierre-Laurent Aimard, as well as jazzmen Marcus Roberts and Harry Connick Jr. But mostly I was fascinated by the craftsmen. I makes me appreciate my old Steinway Model B all the more.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Somewhat interesting...I like that concertizing pianists were interviewed and how they shared what they look for in a piano. Otherwise, the behind the scenes look at the workers and whatnot is very boring. I wanted to know the history of the Steinway family and how the pianos were first made with such fine precision. Not enough history for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting...","review":"We enjoyed seeing this video. It was helpful to my son who is studying the piano to see how complicated it is to produce this grand and beautiful instrument. The whole family has enjoyed this video several times over.

If you wear a hat size that is L or XL, when you don your new Clic Readers the magnets will be 1/2 inch to 1 inch apart. The adjustability is in the length, not the width, so the notion that one size can fit everyone depends on how comfortable you want the fit to be, and how ridiculous you want to look in your readers.

I know this movie received horrible reviews when it was released, but of all the 80s movies I've seen, I think this is good as anything else out at the time. The humor can be cheesy along with the dialogue, but if you love Madonna and you love the 80s, then this is a perfect movie to watch.

Plan 9 is a movie that is unintentionally funny. 'Who's That Girl' is unintentionally not funny. It is more than not funny; it is at times completely, utterly and unbelievably not funny.

The problem with this movie is not her acting, which is better than usual, but Madonna herself...she's as irritating as she has ever been with this shrill performance--channeling Judy Holiday on a really bad day--it's no Holiday and nothing to celebrate.

In any case...the second half of the book is absolutly amazing, and anyone who is new to the language the sufis use to explain universal truths will say \\"wow\\" more than once while reading this book...I would read a page or two and it would be interesting, and then I would suddenly read something that shifted me, made me give thanks and put the book down.

The dramatizations were sparse and unneccessary. Mostly, Luther is shown as an old man, riding in a cart, or on his deathbed, with cut-ins of scholars, expounding on his life and influence. Not really a \\"Life and Times of Luther,\\" but more of a \\"Collection of Opinions about the Life and Times of Luther.\\" Very little is said about his faith. More is said about the politics of his times.Some better resources: Martin Luther (1953, starring Niall MacGinnis), Luther (2003, starring Joseph Fiennes). I even thought that Luther (1973, starring Stacy Keach), with all of its shortcomings, was a better presentation of Luther's life than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry that hits you right between the eyes.","review":"I cannot recommend this book of poetry more highly. I have read Babylon in a Jar, over numerous times and still never grow weary of it. Andrew Hudgins has a way of combining what it is to be spirit and flesh in such a way that comes to terms with the essence of what it is to be human. His poems are funny, difficult, and from the heart. He is a man of experience who is willing to be transparent about his faults and shortcomings as he grapples with the circumstances he has created and the ones he finds himself surrounded by. \\"In the Red Seats\\" and \\"Rain\\" are powerful poems showing his range from finding the face of God in a drunkard to a poem speaking profoundly of the lives that are sacrificed so we may live. Hudgins merits more recognition than he receives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hudgins Excels as Always","review":"I would dare to say that those who have problems with Babylon in a Jar perhaps have not read it closely enough. While what he does here is a great departure from his style in After the Lost War the poems still have a great deal of quality and are linked by the paradox between love and death, or Eros and Thanatos as Hudgins put it when I talked to him today. The dust of Babylon in a jar is a metaphor that can relate to almost every poem in the book, the collection is not haphazard as someone has suggested and while After the Lost War remains my favorite Hudgins work Babylon in the jar has some excellent gems of poetry inside and is eminitely readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time/money","review":"Of course, with poetry, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

I'm embarrassed to admit that I bought 3 of these and not one latest more then 2 months. The problem is that the plastic used is of very poor quality and tends to be very brittle and snap very easy. I have called and mailed the company to complain, but they never returned my calls or E- Mails. That tells me that they do not care or stand behind there product. I will no longer support them and buy any of there products again. Beware there are other companies out there that make the same cheap product, they are no better.

I ended up replacing the switch because the indicator light in the switch burned out within a couple days, their customer service is pretty bad as I called to get a replacement switch and they told me to uninstall the entire set up and return it to amazon. The biggest problem however, is the lights themselves. So far in under a year I had one completely shatter and I was forced to replace it and now my other has a vertical crack the entire length of the lens and will need to be replaced too. I always use the stone guards when these lights are not in use, which is far more often than when they are on.

Well the one I received the longer wire was green not yellow and knowing that the green wire is for my right signal on my trailer I had to install the main unit to driver-side and run the longer green wire to passenger side connector. The instructions also failed to mention that the white common/ground wire needs to be connected to the body. Fortunately, there is an accessory ground screw to attach the ground wire close to the driver-side connectors. Other than these minor issues, the unit is easy to install with the bulk of time to get access to the connectors in the side panel.

This movie has everything a film should NOT have: poor acting, lousy script, non-existent directing, boring camerawork and silly editing. I cannot believe what makes people give this type of travesty 5 stars. Avoid this at all cost.What is it about then? Silly, good-for-nothing losers who live for their soccer team and their \\"firm\\". Jesus, this movie sucked SOOO MUCH!

If you want to see a film that is closer to the truth of football-related violence in England, find \`\`The Firm'' with Gary Oldman from the 1980s.Green Street Hooligans suffers from being made and acted by people who have no personal connection to the subject matter. Attempts to portray the reality of such gangs come accross as staged and false. The attempts of some of the actors to do authentic accents makes it laughable to anyone who has been within a 1000 miles of England. That's unfortunate as the film looks OK and seems to be reasonably well shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie Hunnam, I love you","review":"I won't lie, I bought this because I think Charlie Hunnam is the sexiest man God has made thus far :D.

It's an amazing movie and I don't want to give too much away, it's worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The characters were well written and the emotions they invoked in the viewer were very powerful. It was suggested to me by a friend living in London to give me a bit of insight on the passion they have there for their football team(s). It managed that and more. If I hadn't been a fan of Westham before this movie, I would be now. I would suggest this movie to anyone.. though if you have a low tolerance for the reality of violence, perhaps not. Forever blowing bubbles........."},{"rating":"2","title":"My sleeper movie of the year.","review":"I got this dvd thinking it would probably be something weird, but was pleasantly surprised to find a powerful movie here. The film really shows a culture that we've read about, but really didn't know about. Elijah Woods is very solid in the film, but Charlie Hunnam really steals the show. The movie is violent, but the story is about far more than the violence. This was an excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie and His own Factory.","review":"Whatever this movie LACKS in believable characters (Wood) and the violent content is made up with Charlie Hunnam.

The movie starts out with Elijah Woods character (Matt) getting booted out of Harvard due to the actions of his roommate (your typical priviliged jerk) so he heads over to London to visit his sister who is married to Pete's brother Stephen. At first Pete and Matt do not hit it off since Matt is a Yank and rather conservative. A few pints later with the mates and Matt becomes a member of the hooligans. There are quite a few fight scenes, lots of blood, but the movie keeps you on edge throughout and the ending is both tragic yet justice is served."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love it.","review":"I wish I could describe things the way many reviewers do, but in all honesty there is one main connection for my recommending this movie.

Green street does a good job exposing outsiders to the \\"football gang\\" culture and helping outsiders to understand what they stand for. Comrades and family are the best way to describe these hooligans that take part in the violence that sometimes causes death. Good acting performances by the entire cast. The british dialect and accent is a little hard to overcome at first but gets easier to understand once you watch the film for a while. Very enjoyable film, not for those who don't like violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Footie Fans Unite","review":"If you follow football, then this movie is most assuredly the movie for you. Although, the main topic of the movie isn't football, it's the football fans. You know the ones I'm talking about, the crazy fans that get in your face, or most likely get arrested at the matches. This movie shows the side of them that you don't really see. It shows the organization behind the craziness. You've heard of Hooliganism, this movie shows it at it's core. (with substitutions for all around general violence) But you do get somewhat of an insight into the life of a hooligan. This movie has indubitably been bumped up to one of my all time favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

But soon they may be saying \\"Wow there's a new Charlie Hunnam film that I gotta see\\".When I started watching this DVD I wasn't expecting much. I'm not really a fan of English movies because I have a hard time hearing and understanding their dialect. But as soon as Charlie Hunnam appears on the screen he demands your attention. He puts in a riveting performance as do the others in this gem. This is a violent movie, perhaps it's more of a guy's movie then a woman's but it is a powerful movie with many powerful performances.For me it was an introduction to the Hooligan gangs that patronize the soccer games in Europe. It seems we Americans are quite ignorant of the phenomenon.Everyone I have recommended this movie to have said it was one of the best movies they have seen in a long time.

If you want to read a good book search for Joe McMoneagle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess we're not in Kansas, any more...","review":"I'm just starting to study Remove Viewing. This is the first book I've read on the topic and it provided a good sense of his encounter with RV while working in our Government. David's accounts, right from the start, were mysterious, touch and go, intriguing, spiritual, etc. He usually had no idea where he was being drawn and that made it all the more soul wrenching. This is the juice that makes the topic and possibilities so compelling, and it's what I find so exciting. I found myself getting so involved that it was hard to put the book down toward the tear-jerking end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't add up","review":"This book could have been an interesting novel, but that's about it. Way too many inconsistencies...like the carbon monoxide incident. Yes, carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, but the exhaust of a \\"Briggs and Stratton\\" engine is far from odorless. The fact that his daughter suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning and was rushed to the hospital, (her lips were blue), yet the firemen allowed the rest of them to remain in the house while they \\"aired\\" it out. Six hours later (after being delayed from the hospital for an hour and a half) David went to pick up his wife and daughter...YEAH RIGHT!!! As a diesel mechanic I know all too well the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning...it takes a long time to get over it.His whole mission was to reveal remote viewing to \\"save mankind\\", and can now be learned from him at $1,200 a class. What a humanitarian!!!Also his mentor and good friend, Mel Riley, is working with Lyn Buchanan instead of Mr. Morehouse. In this book 5 + 5 = 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most exciting thing about this book is the title","review":"I read this book thinking it would go into detail about morehouse's experiences. My mistake! It's a detailed account of his marital problems... And although I pushed through to the last couple of chapters, I retired early, unable to finish. Not the story I was expecting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Proof?","review":"After a promising start, this book devolved into anecdote after anecdote of the author's supposed remote viewing trips and the ill effects on his mental state and marriage. Could have been a decent article in a magazine, but for a full length book, it didn't work for me. Plus, if I say I entered a state of mind and remote viewed something, does that make it true? Where was the proof that it could really be done?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride into the abyss. Stunning and compelling.","review":"The most moving and profound book of my life. I could not put it down the second I picked it up. I read half of it standing in the bookstore and purchased all they had when the store manager ushered me out at closing time. Where is this guy now? The most facinating, complex and multidimensional book of this decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dynamic and historical journey through one mans Armageddon","review":"A facinating and thought provoking journey into the dark world of the unconcious. A revealing \\"new spy story\\" that drags the reader into an unknown world of espionage and betrayal. Well written and intriguing to say the least. I anxiously await his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or Fiction?","review":"Does it make sense that a decorated hero who has been brought up to think like the establishment suddenly turns around and writes a supposedly crackpot book to not likely get rich on the subject and to risk the price of loosing credibility with friends and relatives as well as facing ridicule and incarceration....definitely not. Can one believe everything the established government and especially the CIA are telling us are true...definitely not. Come on now! Whoever has any logic and sense left in him and who opens his eyes, can certainly see who is telling the truth and who isn't. It feels so comfortable to know that big brother has been protecting us for such a long time, that we abhore facing the facts that this protection may be very limited and not that unselfish"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story by a very humble and lovable person","review":"After having read about Remote Viewing I had the opportunity to meet with Dr Morehouse and take his Remote Viewing class. So now I know. I know the reality is so much more than most people think. I know from my own experience. It strikes me that this is the first time in history a so called paranormal ability is proven and also available for anyone who dares to take his class. Dr Morehouse is a very honest and truthworthy person. This book is wonderful and touching. It makes You understand what the ability to transcend time and space really means and that we all have that ability. Do You believe in paranormal abilities? Become someone who knows! There is a safe and cheap way to really know. Read this book, take his Remote Viewing class and Your whole view of reality will change to a much more accurate and exciting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIA's Stargate Program","review":"This book says it's the 'true story' of the CIA's Stargate program. I didn't believe it for a moment, but I promised a friend I would read it. It was terrific! This story is of a man's career with the CIA, whose time is spent learning how to project his mind into various time/places he can't actually visit (under the ocean, onto other planets, within top secret rooms) and then reporting what he sees. I'm the biggest skeptic in the world, but whether or not this is true, it's one of the best reads I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"This book is well worth reading for anyone interested in psi in general, or remote viewing in particular. For a more comprehensive overview of remote viewing, I also recommend Jim Schnabel's _Remote Viewers : The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies_. You'd also enjoy a book by another remote viewer, Joseph McMoneagle's _Mind Trek : Exploring Consciousness, Time, and Space Through Remote Viewing_.If you have a chance to hear David Morehouse speak, or to attend one of his classes, do so!As an aside, the previous reviewer who disbelieved the book because \\"there were no ovens at Dachau\\" is wrong: there were five ovens at Dachau, each with a capacity of several bodies. Check the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entertaining, if inaccurate account of remote viewing","review":"\\"Psychic Warrior\\" is admittedly an easy-to-read and entertaining account (even if the writing is a bit formulaic and riddled with trivial textual errors). And it accomplished its primary goal: to sell itself to Hollywood. But unfortunately it is also a highly inaccurate portrayal of the remote viewing process and its history within the U.S. government. A much better (and, ironically, less-expensive) book is Jim Schnabel's \\"Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies\\" (also available from Amazon)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote viewing has zero validity.","review":"Mr. Morehouse has simply produced a piece of fiction, so that he can sell books. I feel ashamed that I bought it. Even worse, he villifies the U.S. government in doing so, by including such bogus facts, supposedly uncovered by remote viewing, as-- The U.S. government knew that poison gas was being used in Iraq. The U.S. government did make one mistake. It didn't keep a close enough eye on the CIA and its budget, if it was allowed to fund this bogus wast e of the tax payers money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too brief and not getting the point.","review":"The author is good at circling around, will take you forever to get to the point, lengthy read, and waste of time. No practical facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like awful \\"sci-fi\\"","review":"I have no idea whether Morehouse's story is true, or completely made up, but I will say it reads like the latter. I don't believe in conpiracy theories in general not because I don't believe a government would do something bad, but that they could successfully cover it up. It's against all human nature not to talk, especially about something big, so I don't believe secrets are easy to keep nowadays. That said, Morehouse's book reads like badly-written, paranoid \\"sci-fi\\"...not a well-written book, neither believable nor entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure egotistical, twisted accounts of the truth.","review":"This book is exactly that. I know Mr. Morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book... my father, Mel Riley. All I can say is, you should read Paul Smith's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the Stargate and RV stories. There is also a documentary, if you can find it, made be Discovery BBC called \\"The Real X-files\\" featuring a true and honest view of RV and it's history with the military and all those involved. Giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely exciting, brilliantly written.","review":"This is an extremely exciting book about the use of psychics in the spy war between the superpowers. It is brilliantly written, with an almost poetic language. I speed read it in two days. I just could not stop. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate, tragic, and exciting . . . a tour de force","review":"David's story is both believable and astounding. He does a good job in helping the reader understand the phenomenon of controlled remote viewing while taking pains to illustrate the adverse impact this journey had on him personally and within his family. His courage in standing against the intelligence community is commendable; it will be interesting to see what his next steps are in bringing this skill and set of insights to light.The world is much bigger and more mysterious than most of us realize. David is one of several pioneers that shows us a bit of this mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weary Warrior","review":"This book is so badly written I can't imagine how anyone could rate it above 1 star. It's common knowlege that the Intelligence Community has experimented with everything from psychedelic drugs to the paranormal. Almost everyone but truly brain damaged American TV news viewers have speculated that Korean Air flight 007 was shot down while spying for the US and that US troops were exposed to chemical or biological agents in Iraq. With these type of barely amusing insights it's no wonder no one thought about using remote viewing to find out who killed the Kennedys, ordered the assasination of John Lennon, what was on the 18 minute gap of the Nixon tapes or whether Christ really rose from the dead. Believable or not the writing is miserable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total tripe","review":"The only things sadder than this ho-hum, poorly-told tale is the fact that not only do plenty of people believe it wholesale, but that (as garnered from other reviews) many of its readers actually find it \\"well-written\\" and \\"moving\\". Frankly, I fear for the future of mankind. Just about any episode of \\"X-Files\\" is more entertaining, and my third-grade report on \\"ESP\\" was probably just as accurate as anything herein. Oh well, back to Jean Jacques Rousseau."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fiesque fiction, clearly Anti-Government leaning","review":"I read this book with amusement, It was shallow, hollow and filled with inaccuracies.The implication that our Government is so utterly sinister is not only outrageous, but smacks of hysterical alarmnest fiction. It is indeed a waste of paper, I would not reccomend this book to anyone except to diehard X-files devotees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted so much to like it.","review":"Morehouse's book begins to unravel as one reads. The accounts of remote-viewed things were far too generic and received (ark of the covenant, Mars, complete with ancient living beings, angels in flowing robes no less who guide him) to be believable. Truth has a certain baroque quality, which this story is lacking. Also, the reader is informed that angels informed Morehouse that they live in \\"a dimension parallel to yours.\\" Hunh? We live in a three dimensional world (if you do not count time as a dimension) in which each dimension is perpendicular to the other two. So how is some other dimension parallel to all of these three? And are the angels saying they exist in a single dimension? They inhabit a straight line? We are further informed that God lives in a four-dimensional world. Gee, so do we, if you count time, which most physicists do. So... what distinction is being made? The story smacks of the scientifically impoverished imaginings of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very disappointing. The story of the actual work he did as a remote viewer was fascinating. The rest is dreck and casts doubt on the credibility of everything he writes.He plays the victim card with the Army, acting surprised that his superiors didn't want him to publicize details about his highly classified duties.The reader is left to wonder how much of his experience he distorts or omits. For example, he conveniently forgets to mention his apparently romantic relationship with a subordinate until it comes up in the investigation the Army conducts against him, then tries to justify it.He also is inconsistent. He writes about how unhappy he was in his assignment after Stargate, then about how he curses at the person who calls him out of the blue to offer him a job back at Stargate.He comes across as an undisciplined narcissist who sacrifices his career and family life for his own selfish gain. It is evident why he is an outcast in the military's remote viewing community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair Raising Excitement","review":"This was truly one of the most amazing events I have ever witnessed on TV other than of course the Beatles landing in America for the first tour.They need to offer this amazing show on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay Attention!","review":"As a therapist and a father, I have found this book remarkably insightful.

And while I do not take Ritalin, (There are so many other medications out there to treat my condition it's sad he only mentions one of them) I know all to well what life is like when I miss a day of my medication. NOTHING gets done. My parents (I'm 17) grow frustrated when they find me spaced out and staring at the walls instead of folding the towels, which they had watched me start some three hours ago.Anyway, what I wanted to say is that ADD is not just some made up \\"disease\\" created to alleviate guilt of parents for not being able to \\"control\\" their children. It is all to real."},{"rating":"1","title":"A foolish take on an important topic","review":"Why Nylund would choose to classify Huck Finn as ADD/ADHD is odd.

First of all, I love Diane Keaton - in fact I like all of the lead characters. But this movie is SO bad - I couldn't believe how bad it was. It supposed to be about Diane Keaton being a 'smothering' mother - huh?? You don't even see her do that much. Maybe it's the writing, I don't know. It just didn't make any sense at all. Except for Ken Howard (Diane Keaton's husband) - he was the best of the lot - the second star is for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish","review":"I could not finish this movie. Got too boring in the first half hour. Sad cause I like Diane Keaton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diane Keaton just seems crazy","review":"This movie has a funny concept that usually can't fail - overbearing parents. However,Smotherjust isn't that funny. Rather than being funny, Diane Keaton's character often just appears annoying and crazy. Rather than smothering her son, she seems like she should be put in an insane asylum. I don't think I laughed much at all throughout the movie. At the end, I just ended up feeling depressed about the characters complaining that they had wasted their lives. I was also upset when Dax Shepard yelled at the geese. Not funny.If you want really funny comedy about a smothering mother, check out the sitcomEverybody Loves Raymond - The Complete Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentric to the max, surreal and silly... a damned lot of fun.","review":"If Rachel Griff isn't playing someone with Asperger's here, I'll stand on my head. This film is eccentric to the max, surreal, silly and certainly not a 'tight ship' production at all. But if you don't take it too seriously its a damned lot of fun. The Welsh backdrop is fabulous and the characters are quirky and highly individual, fabulously gritty and Ioan Gruffydd as her gay friend is fabulous and nothing like we are used to seeing him. The film definitely goes into the realm of slapstick and could almost be compared to a home-grown Welsh attempt at Willie Wonker And The Chocolate Factory at times. The Welsh seem to do damned well at poking fun at themselves and this makes this film a stark contrast to more English productions and rather comparable to Australian films like very slapstick Strictly Ballroom. If you enjoy comparing film styles, this Welsh prithsoduction is a lovely one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head Games","review":"I could not put the book down. It was amazing.

I haven't used the slow cooker part or the steamer yet but am planning on soon. I have also cooked dry beans and they turned out good.

I love it. Cooks as good as the old fashion gas ones but it better cause you can take the center out to wash it and it seals so easly. I just cannot say enough about it. I love it and I know when my daughter gets it in a couple of weeks for her birthday she will be thrilled. No more having to wait to visit us to get her roast beef, potatoes and carrots.

No reason, just shut off. I've tried everything I can think of to get it working again, but no luck. I've let it set for a couple of days, I've plugged it into another outlet on another circuit, no dice. Like I said, it wasn't used that much and is in great physical shape.... it just refuses to work, and after reading up on it, I'm not ever going to waste my time trying to get Nesco to do the right thing.Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM NESCO PRODUCTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nesco pressure cooker","review":"do not recommend this item.

Even though I inspected the sealing gasket before each use, it failed. Being thankful that no one was hurt, I figured I'd just buy a new gasket from Nesco. Wrong.Nesco no longer supports my cooker and doesn't sell the gaskets anymore. Apparently their supplier went out of business. No problem. I figured Nesco wouldn't leave a loyal customer with a useless cooker. Wrong again!My expensive pressure cooker was used for only a year and a half and it is now unusable. Nesco offered no alternatives--no parts, no discount on a new machine, nothing. And their customer service department was extremely unhelpful.I would strongly suggest that anyone willing to pay this much money for a pressure cooker look to a different company. I will NEVER BUY FROM NESCO again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it while it worked....","review":"I was absolutely in love with this pressure cooker. I was even going to buy one for several folks on my Christmas list.Then, in October, after five months of use, it died. I called the company and a delightful woman answered the phone and verified that the error message meant that it needed a new circuit board. She asked us to send it back to Nesco, which we did with RMA number and delivery confirmation receipt. Now two months later with no word at all, when we phone the company they have no idea where it is. They admit that they signed the delivery receipt. They have no idea where the cooker is. The nice lady once again answered the phone and promised to call us back right away after her investigation. That was last week and still no word.I would never buy a product from Nesco again.

It was wonderful to work with and a great time saver. However after just a little over a year and at the most using it 14 times, the digital readout freaked out and the whole thing quit. I have read of this happening in other reviews but could'nt believe it wasn't a isolated incident. Its not! Between the cost of shipping back and est. repair of 40-50 dollars (from Nesco customer service) I am going to buy the Cusinart model with a three year limited warranty.

I'll let you know when I get a replacement...EDITED 11 Apr...Amazon was very prompt in sending a replacement. Tried the new one last night - worked like a charm! I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.

I'm very frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among other things: great soup!","review":"I have had this unit for over a year and am always finding new uses for it. I am very happy with it! The pot is heavily constructed and sturdy, as well as having a non-stick surface. Also, I find the button arrangement reasonably easy to understand and operate. Usually, I brown items before pressure cooking. I take care of what I own and have had no problems as I have followed all of the maintenance instructions. Even the rubber seal is still going strong, although I do oil it regularly as recommended. I had an older pressure cooker that you placed over a flame and then from a safe distance watched it go into nuclear-detonation mode. Fortunately, the fear factor is no longer there with this unit, nor do I have to scrape stuff off the walls. Overall, this Nesco pressure cooker has worked well for me. The food is definitely healthier and tastes better.

None of this plastic teenybopper fluff that we get bombarded with ala Ashlee Simpson, American Idol winners, etc etc. This is what happens when bands get together with great, timeless influences and craft a gem of an album with more thought and feeling in one verse than anything you'd be apt to hear on MTV. So what if they borrow some ideas or stylings from Morrissey or the Cure. Is that really so bad? This album is just freakin' beautiful from beginning to end, not one duff track or bit of filler material to be found. Wow, what a concept! If only more bands put as much work into their albums.

Did his theories change the world? Apparently not. Look where the U.S. is now in the Middle East. But for at time, yes, Boyd the flawed man made a difference.

John Boyd was unique within the Air Force for good reason. One has to credit his intellect with his E-M theory and OODA Loop. However, this does not qualify him for hero worship.His basic belief system seems to hinge on himself (either agree or you don't exist). He strives to achieve rank, and then, when not reaching his goal, declares that those above him have sold out. (Flipping off the USAFA Superintendant does not win support.) Discipline still counts in warfighting. Fighter pilots are extremely disciplined warriors.There is a huge difference in \\"simulated\\" and real combat. As an ex-USAF pilot, I let my hands do my talking. This is not \\"Maverick\\" from the movies, but Boyd fits the sterotype and it plays well in print.I'm left with John Boyd as an imperfect intellect.

To try to lump these fine individuals into Robert Coram's classification of \\"Blue Suiters\\" is repugnant to me at the best.The book is long, boring, repetitive and somewhat poorly written. As an Air Force veteran I have great difficulty finding John Boyd the savior of the Air Force and the country. Hero worship should be left to comic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Distortion of Military and Aviation History","review":"John Boyd was undoubtedly a fine fighter pilot, but to claim, as this author does--and on the flimsiest possible information--that he \\"transformed war\\" borders on the absurd. Far from being a good role model, Boyd was an individual who pitted people against one another to achieve his own ends, who was so convinced of his own opinions that he was intolerant of others, and who, ultimately, nearly destroyed his own family as well as his career. This book is a pathetic attempt by the discredited losers of the so-called \\"Defense Reform\\" community to attempt to assert their place in history. There are far more reliable works than this that talk about Air Force transformation, for example Benjamin Lambeth's The Transformation of American Air Power.

I read it in one day and did not want it to end. Boyd was fascinating. The book explains how he approached and solved complex problems. It explained how he made himself and coworkers more creative & productive. An interesting perspective on the concept of \\"thinking outside of the box\\". These strategies are very useful for problem solving eg. to test a theory, he recommends to extrapolate it out to the extremes in both directions as this often clarifies if it truly makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most most ... game ever!","review":"This game ...

But as soon as I started playing, I realized it was a waste. It was totally confusing, what can you pick up and use, what can't you? I was reduced to using the walkthrough via the dreamcatcher website which helped me through absolutely nothing. Playing as the Pagan (for lack of a better term) Bradwen, I got into the villa, and then 'found suvivors' but was stuck in this little room and I had no idea where said survivors were. I got sick of it after that, uninstalled it, and promptly returned it back to the store where I had purchased it.

At last a heroic game without just slaughter, slaughter, slaughter... The problem is that many ideas listed in the previews (Like MORE women, evil choices, honour-codex, etc. etc.) haven't been fulfilled. Thus, if you don't make the right decision, you die. It was promised that there are MANY ways to complete Bradwen's quests, yet there is only one way. SAD, because this was a GREAT idea. I love the game because I'm a history-buff and because I'm sick of the football-games and the even more Action-Murder-games. This game has depth at least.

Should the opportunity to attend one of his seminars present itself...run, don't walk. In this book he offers the reader a clear explanation of the underlying principles of Spirit. It's done so with humor, honesty, wisdom and exhuberance. If you have ever challenged, questioned or encountered self-doubt with regard to the presence of Spirit within yourself or others, you will find this book presents a modern, objective non-idealistic view of God. As a former Catholic priest with an extensive background in theology, his intrepretation of liturgy, symbolism, scriptures and Spirit is appealing and simplistic. This book offers practical appication of Spirit energy to every day situations from diet to business endeavors. Regardless of religious denomimation this book promises to be both an enjoyable and empowering read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly wonderful!","review":"I was listening to the tape one night when I was in the midst of a crisis with my health. As I listened, I brought my full intention to Ron's words, praying for a direct experience of the holy spirit. I suddenly became aware of a very large bright light expanding outward from my heart. It lasted about 4 seconds. I felt this remarkable feeling of warmth, comfort and peace that did not take away my problems but soothed me and made me feel like everything *was* alright. If anyone is looking for a way to bring the holy spirit directly into their experience, I highly recommend this book. Ron Roth is such a strong conduit for the message that the holy spirit is there for us to experience, we just need to get out of the way (I am obviously a work in progress in this regard).

First off, Spencer Krug is an absolute musical genius, and his \\"warble\\" DOES become endearing with time. His lyrical structures and off-kilter arrangements evoke both deep and dark emotions as well as (ultimately) hope for the likes of mankind. There are triumphant, fists in the air, rabble-rousing marches along with lost and pensive wails in the night that leave us emotionally drained and a little bit troubled.

Wonderful biscotti out of corn meal mix, and the recipe can be adapted by using slightly different ingredients each time. How many times have we bought a specialty ingredient for a recipe, using part of it and eventually throwing the rest away? Thanks to this book, we can now use up the remainder.

This is the first book I read on the subject and still one of the very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Cry of Freedom","review":"Battle Cry of Freedom remains one of the most important works on the Civil War in print. It is carefully researched and organized into the single volume that any Civil War student should read. The opening chapter, \\"The United States in 1850\\" is so captivating that the reader comes away with more information that many books dedicated to this same topic. McPherson is a first rate researcher and scholar who has the ability to reach out across educational boundaries and give anyone who reads this work an understandable, informative view of the Civil War era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Civil War Book in One Volume!","review":"Fascinating and smooth reading narrative of the civil war era. Treatment of the war beyond the battlefield sets this book apart from other civil war accounts. McPherson discusses causes, politics (both domestic and international), economics, personalities, geography and business issues as well as delving deep into the military aspects of the conflict. It really gives the reader a thorough understanding of the war's desperate causes. Excellent read -- makes you want to pick it up and read it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"This is the greatest book ever written on the Civil War.

Anniversary of the Civil War. I thought it would be a new book about the Civil War, but it's not. It's last Copyright is 1988, so I'm really disappointed.

It is both more and less than that. McPherson has covered the years leading up to the war, more a political and social history, which takes up a significant portion of the book. The political and social aspects of the 1861-1865 period is covered in more detail than the military progress of the war. This gives a well-rounded approach to the subject.This is not a military history. It is a full account of an era in American history. It is well-written, well-documented, and an engaging work. It is a terrific complement to Shelby Foote's three-volume narrative history and to the more recent single-volume military history of the war (The Longest Night by David Eicher -- itself said to be written as a complement to McPherson's book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest book on the Civil War","review":"As has been said here before: If you only read one book on the history of the Civil War, make it this book! I never expected such a comprehensive and detailed survey of the political, social and economic forces at play to be contained in this one book. There are few books I buy extra copies of to pass around to friends, but this is one that has earned that rank. The only other I can think of at this time is Unintended Consequences by John Ross. Don't pass this one by either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide for a new generation of the curious","review":"Somewhat ashamedly I admit that I sought out a single volume guide to the Civil War after watching the movie Lincoln. I am glad I picked this book. There is no question that McPherson is a leading, authoritative expert in this calamity that still echoes through the ages today. We are not so far removed from the polarization and extremism that split this country apart before, and Battle Cry of Freedom is crucial for understanding that period in our history, and in seeing the peril in our present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive review of the Civil War and attitudes of the times.","review":"The book is an extremely detailed account of the politics and major personalities of this war. It may be a little heady and long winded for some readers, but a well researched piece. If you ever wanted to know the reasons for this war and the feelings of the peoples involved, this is a work to read. However, the Kindle version has battle maps which are microscopic in size with details blurred beyond recognition - they really should work this part out as these illustrations are meant to go in hand with the written stories of troop movements. Also the author fails to give much emphasis on the horrid conditions found within the plantations and slave markets of the old South for the slaves themselves, while giving painstaking details on media exchanges and political movements of other parts of society. Overall a very nice work worth reading for history or political buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War history at its finest","review":"There are tons of Civil War titles out there, and I have read only a handful of them, but I can't imagine them getting much better than this. McPherson does a great job of putting it all into one volume (albeit it a long volume). There are a few chapters on the build-up to the Civil War covering numerous presidencies and conflicts. Once the war kicks off, McPherson will spend one or two chapters on military battles and then a chapter on other aspects of the war (e.g. the South trying to outrun the embargo or the North's recruiting problems, etc.). It took me a while to read it, but I was very satisfied. I feel like I know the basics of the Civil War and that this book is a great starting point for anyone's journey into the war that defined America.Also, if you're not up for a long book, see Ken Burns' \\"Civil War\\" series on video or DVD. It's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me late for work","review":"I am not a civil war freak. This was the first book on the subject I read. Great book though. The book is well over 800 pages and I was reading the book on the bus, as soon as I got home, when I woke up... For weeks I was too into what was happening in the book to keep up with the 'real world'. Not my usual experience for sure. If you have any interest in American history you should like this. If you don't have any interest the Civil War, read this and you will I'd almost bet it. This book is that good and more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Single Volume Read","review":"I've been looking for a great civil war book for a long time.

Amazing read and very informative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one volume history of the Civil War","review":"Simply the best one volume history of the Civil War out there. Well written and very readable, this book traces the origins of the war, the battles, the heros and villans, the arguments, everything! Its only weakness is not really a weakness, but unless one is familiar with military maneuvers, tactics, and the geography of some of the battles, it's hard to follow the descriptions of the battles and troop movements. Other than that this essential reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War Novel","review":"What can I say, I needed this book for a college level class but it is an enjoyable Pulitzer prize winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best single book on the Civil War","review":"If you are going to read only one book on the Civil War, read this. McPherson deals with the battles, as one must, but the real strength of the book is how well it deals with the various interrelated aspects of the War: the politics, the people, the homefront, the technology, the diplomacy. As McPherson explains in his introduction, one cannot really understand the Civil War if one ignores any of these factors. For example, one cannot understand what was happening in Lincoln's consideration of the emancipation, without looking at what was happening at the same time on the battlefield, in the political arena, and in the overseas diplomatic discussions. A final beauty of this book: its bibliography. McPherson not only lists his key sources, he comments on them, so that this book can serve as an excellent introduction for a full reading course on the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"McPherson takes the easy way out and sides with his own bias","review":"James McPherson did an admirable job compiling a wealth of information and presenting it in the early stages of \\"Battle Cry of Freedom,\\" then dismissed with a wave of his pen to embark upon an anti-Southern crusade. He fell back upon the old trick of painting the Confederate Army as a sea of amorphous white faces, devoid of racial or ethnic diversity. He tiptoed around the thousands of African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and the multiple immigrant groups who joined the Confederate Army and fought side-by-side. Where did he document the Emerald Guard, the Mobile German Fusiliers, the 1st Choctaw (or the other 28 tribes who fought in gray), or the Spanish Legion? This book is awash with personal antipathy and politically correct revisionist historical claptrap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally radical, dude, in the membrane. Surfs up!

Wow man, bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Cry If You Don't Like Politics","review":"If you a political fanatic and Civil War buff well then this book is for you. Personally, I am not into politics so that portion of the book was not for me. It took over 300 pages to finally get to the first battle of the civil war, The Battle of Bull Run. Everything up to that point was ladened with hard core political reasons as to why the civil war was fought."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"There is a reason why this book as become one of the best resources for the Civi War. The writing is excellent, the history is in depth, and the pacing of the book is reamarkable. I'm in love with the Oxford History of the United States and this book explains why. A must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent one-volume treatment","review":"The Civil War is such a vast subject (I believe the most written about event in human history) that it's hard to know where to start. I'm not an expert on the war, but I found this read to be very satisfying. I don't know how much more time I'll devote to the Civil War, but it seems to me that this book provides an excellent overview of the event and is everything a nonspecialist lay reader like myself could want to know. I've read great words of praise for Shelby Foote's trilogy, so maybe I'll take on that project some day, but if I don't, I'll feel like McPherson gave me a solid understanding of the causes, major players, and main political struggles surrounding this terrible period in our nation's history. I can't add too much more to the other excellent reviews here, but I thought I'd add another five-star review and hope others take the time to read this well-written survey of our Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive look at America in the turbulent civil war era","review":"Just 100 pages in and I can't put it down, This author has done so far an excellent job of giving the reader a sense of the turbulent period in the years leading up to the civil war. The drama that arose with all the land essentially stolen from Mexico in 1848 and the struggle for north and south to claim this precious new territory as their own. The compromise of 1850 that just postponed the inevitable conflict to come. The violence that arose from the fugitive slave law especially in northern cities. Still another 800 to go but so far this has been one of the most information filled book I've read on the subject. Not surprising it is a Pulitzer Prize winning book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive history of the Civil War","review":"\\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" discusses not only the war but the history prior to the war and the incredible agitation and constant threats of the Southern aristocracy to expand their \\"peculiar institution\\".

It was the best short history of anything since Gibbon, and nothing has really rivalled it since.McPherson places battles, people and politics in a definitive context that strikes the reader as being as close as any human can come to having a \\"true\\" understanding of that War. It is EXTREMELY well written as well, and set the stage for the Ambroses and McCulloughs who followed through and popularized scholarly history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview of a Complex War","review":"Having read many civil war books and by no means an authority on the subject of the civil war \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" is a great read for an overview of the subject.But I must state from having also read Allan Nevins 8 volume set and Shelby Foote's three volume masterpiece of the civil war that if one is truly interested in the fine print and specifics of the war these works must also be read.Each author has their own style and content which is different in each writing. These authors James McPherson, Allan Nevins, Shelby Foote, Douglas Freeman and many others make the subject of the civil war just one outstanding discipline to study.Have enjoyed it over the years and intend to continue this pursuit of knowledge in this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"context for all the content I have learned over the years","review":"I have read scores of books about Lincoln and inevitably about the civil war that dominated his presidency. This marvelous book provides so much background and such fascinating detail about this most amazing period of our history it is a joy to read. It is so full of information I feel as if I am there and understand so much more of what happened and why and how. The writing is fluid and rich and this book by itself could be a college or even high school course in that pivotal time.Realizing how much Lincoln had to put up with from his friends as well as his enemies makes his accomplishments all the more astounding. Few men, if any, could have done what he did. He, almost singlehandedly, saved the United States. And on top of that he was such a great writer he was able to communicate profoundly to his people and to all who came after.I have gone through about 60% of the book and hate to see it ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to start for Civil War rookies","review":"I had never taken a course on the Civil War and most the books I read focused narrowly on a particular battle or general.Battle Cry of Freedom was a highly readable, vastly entertaining introduction to the \\"Big Picture\\" of the Civil War era. McPherson allows the reader to see the forest through the trees, so to speak.I would highly recommend this book to anyone, particularly anyone who is intimidated by the vast amounts of literature available on the topic and is looking for a well balanced and thorough introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mandatory book for all Americans","review":"I gave a copy of this book to my parents when it came out 15 years ago and everytime I go visit them I always at some times take it out and read whatever page I open to.

It took well over a week to come but was in great condition. Usually I get things a little faster when I order through Amazon, but there was no hurry so it was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best single-volume history of the Civil War","review":"James McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM is, simply put, the greatest single volume of Civil War history yet written. The Civil War is a fascinating subject -- on average, a book a day has been published on the subject since the end of the war 135 years ago. The brilliance of McPherson's book is that he manages to provide a vision of the Civil War which both Northerners and Southerners can agree upon. By comparison, Shelby Foote's Civil War narrative is too much a southerner's view of the war to be considered truly objective. While an impressive feat, it is three volumes of narrative, instead of one comprehensive volume of history, like McPherson's book is. Battle Cry of Freedom is well written, well researched, and well deserves the Pulitzer Prize that it won in 1989. No stone is left unturned, and it is perhaps the closest anyone has yet come to a definitive book about such a controversial topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition has problems","review":"This review is purely as to the flaws of the Kindle transfer -- the book itself is a masterpiece I've reread with pleasure on paper over the years. Unfortunately the transfer is a rough scanned-PDF type that is MUCH harder to read than other Kindle books. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 1 Volume History of the War","review":"This is simply the best single volume history of the Civil War Era in existence. The book flows exceptionally well, reading almost like a good fiction story rather than nonfiction. Grossly entertaining yet informative, treatment and coverage of the period is pretty well balanced. Although I disagree with McPherson's analysis that a Northern Political Revolution started the war or his contingency theory that at several key instances, had events unfolded differently, the outcome of the south would have been successful in her attempt at permanent disunion. However, it is still the best, and still my favorite one volume history of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly excellent","review":"Although this is by an academic, this is a excellent book. Very readable and informative. Even though we know how the story ends, this book is still a page-turner. And it is probalby the only 900 page book I wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book, well worth reading","review":"An excellent and highly readable book that gives much insight into a turbulent era in American history. If I had any complaints about it, it's because I would have liked to follow the war in more depth than is presented. However, this is a book about \\"The Civil War Era\\" and thus does exactly as it states. With this book now read, I would like to find (or be recommended) a solid book centered on the various war theaters and less on the politics of the war. Any care to suggest such book(s)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"It has been years since I read this book, so I will not write a lengthy review.

This single line speaks volumes, but as Narcissus drowned from staring at his reflection, so too does this writer. Sadly, the reader is the real victim. If I were imitating Fulbeck I would spend the remainder of this short review wringing this analogy dry. There are some clever ideas, but Fulbeck is too in love with his own wit to let anything stand. Every metaphor is taken too far, and the result is a book that become tedious and frustratingly annoying. The character (Fulbeck?) soon reveals himself to be a person you would not want to know, despite his constant reminders of how talented, good-looking, and accomplished he is. Interestingly, Fulbeck seems to have spent a lifetime being disappointed in the people around him, who never live up to his own standards. He himself, he reveals too often, is nearly flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"psycho man meets neurotic man","review":"Read the reviews and checked out the book. What's wrong with the narrator? Since this is a \\"fictional\\" biography, the narrator can wiggle his way in and out of funky --I mean, funky situations. I sense a neurotic writer who is probably insecure and a bit on the \\"edge\\" (not cutting edge, but psycho-edge), who used this book as therapy. Yeah, the writer intrigues at a real elementary, base level. . . The hapa is represented in such a pathetic way, I was wondering if Fulbeck was resurrecting the tragic, neurotic,psycho mulatto (the main character of this book is reminiscent of Soaphead Church of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. . .

Maybe it was the football story line-I'm no sports fan-but that's too easy an out. The characters-one dimensional, so trite and formulaic(sp?). I finally gave up the ghost after 80 pages. The storyline-about the marriage or no estate-would have made more sense in a historical, but just seems silly in a contemporary. I agree with another reviewer-this one was NOT up to \\"Coulter standards\\" I'm sorry to say..If you do decide to chuck convention and buy this book anyway-buy it from a used Amazon seller for a penny-that way you won't be out too much dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put the book down slowly on the ground and back away","review":"Catherine Coulter is one of my favorite romance authors, but this book has to be the worst she's written in terms of plot and character. Her 'hero' is actually cruel at one point. Throughout the book, in the guise of being a 'real man', he expects the 'heroine' to do all the compromising and sacrificing while he feels noble for actually loving and marrying her. And she accepts it! I had to read this book twice just to be sure I actually remembered how awful it really is. Never again.To top it off, it's like Ms. Coulter dashed this off in a weekend and called it good. No emotional investment in the characters, no clear resolution of conflicts. I seldom meet a book I don't like, but this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad and boring","review":"This story was so boring.

It is perpetuating the word \\"retarded\\" to be used as an offensive phrase. It is as bad as using the \\"N\\" word and I am hoping that Ms. Coulter refrains from perpetuating the common use of \\"retard\\" and \\"retarded\\" as acceptable forms of derogation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most important historical document.","review":"I believe that McNamara is wrong about what the gentlemen is describing. McNamara states that the old soldier is describing the journey to the front before the invasion of Poland. My take on it is that the old soldier is describing the move to the front through Poland and to the assembly positions for the invasion of Russia in 1941.No serious student of WWII can be without this film. Unless you know exactly where Vitebsk is and when the Germans first captured it, you won't know exactly what the old soldiers are talking about.I lived in Germany during the 1990's for several years.

Gee, are all German soldiers supposed to fess up that they were involved in atrocities. Why don't we go further by making the rest of Germany three generations later fess up to atrocities.

This movie did something very rare, it added a new perspective to my understanding of the war. There are no cliches, and there is much you have never seen before. Don't get me wrong when I say this, but I get the feeling that we have turned a deaf ear to anything the Germans have to say about their experience in the war. It is as if this is part of the retribution for the suffering the war caused. We seem to be trying to write their perspective out of the history books out of a sense that their view of things has no legitimacy or out of a fear that it will happen again. Germans are also reluctant to tell their side, I guess out of a sense of guilt. This is all wrong. We owe it to prosperity to get every side so that when people read about this era in the future, they will have a full understanding of what happened. I think this movie goes a long way in that direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"comforting, healing book - for most but not all","review":"For me, this is a very comforting and healing book.

The cover is highly appropriate for the paranoid intensity of this band when in full gear. The disc was split, on vinyl, into orchestral speed-metal lanscapes on side 1 and acid-tinged dub drippings on side 2. The faster titles manage to paint sonic structures that mimic their highly appropriate titles (\\"Shifting Sand\\") and the dizzying sojurn through twisting sewerpipes on \\"Subterranean Flight\\" is an unforgettable highlight. The dub tunes show a charming approach by these midwestern white geeks who definitely know their chops. Drummer Ted Epstein has brought an almost lyrical approach to the instrument, and holds the 'lead' duties more than guitarist Andy Hawkins, who is too busy painting white-hot screaming dreamscapes to bother with single-string noodling.

This debut features a Blue Cheer-strength tribute to Stravinsky, a Meters cover, and three excellent dub instrumentals. The meat of the album however is in the original compositions of this power trio, which are rich in shifting, aggressive rhythms and savage but brilliantly-coloured guitar harmonics.

So I followed the warranty instructions and mailed the batteries in for replacement. One month later I received a letter from Audiovox(the actual manufacturer) stating the item was discontinued and no replacement was available. They offered me a refund but that amount would not be enough to replace the battery not to mention the $8 it costs to send the battery in. I believe Audiovox is lying in stating that a replacement was not available as the Energizer website still shows the item as active.

The \\"Small\\" size Argo carrier is still much too big for him. However, even if it were the right size, the quality doesn't match the price of this carrier. It looks great, but 1) The holes you load the dog through on the sides are VERY small, even for my little dog - I could barely get him into the thing; 2) The inside is lightly padded on the bottom, but is covered only with hard plastic - other carriers have nice furry insides; 3) It doesn't have any pockets to hold your personal items (wallet, cell phone), or the dog's items (clean-up bags, treats, etc.). The peep hole is nice, but there's no way to cover it up (in case the dog gets over-excited in public, you want to make a quick run into the grocery without anyone noticing him, etc.) In summary, the bag looks very cute, but is not very functional. I returned it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carrier!","review":"this bag is comfortable and easy to carry. it provides excellent stability for my active shih-tzu puppy who moves around in it. it's easy to get him into the bag by just picking him up and lowering him into the head opening. i unzip either side of the bag and he crawls out. the tether is great. it gently pulls him back which helps with training. the only disadvantages are that the ventilation isn't super, it's just okay and there is no built-in owner convenience for items such as a wallet or to carry water for you pet. other than that, it's a great carry around bag. i've been in stores and people don't notice it's a pet carrier until they see my dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try to use your common sense first","review":"This book emphasizes the chance of not knowing for sure the real situation in your relantionship, I suggest to read the book but also to have an own oppinion of your situation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book puts all other history books to shame.

Even so, neither of Skom's first two books present her protagonist as much more than a robot. As I said in a comment to a reviewer of the George Eliot book, there is a tremendous temptation to psychoanalyze: has she become an academic because she is unsuited to anything more social? Asberger's syndrome? Definitely obsessive. And not particularly logical in her pursuit of dangerous perpetrators: would you venture into isolated quarters when you know there's a killer around, a killer who is probably after you?

Here we have some very amusing English Dept academics, including a somewhat bitter man-hater, several interesting profs, and the lady professor who really loves Dickens. When a student is karate-chopped in the lady's room, the FBI gets involved with more than book thefts and plagiarism. What struck me was that the FBI did not check the background of the suspects to determine who may have attended karate school in the past, maybe a small quibble but one hopes in real life the FBI would check this out! After the second murder, the situaton gets truly intense, though one feels it should have gotten intense after the first.

I could not get into the characters, and the literary references all over the book were mostly over my head. The mystery was okay, convoluted enough to have an interesting resolution, but the investigation felt amateurish considering one of the protagonists was supposed to be an FBI agent. What's an FBI agent doing investigating the theft of books from a university anyway, even if they are valuable? If he'd been called in after the murders, maybe, but it comes across as really contrived to me. Murder by karate chop to the neck also came across as corny even if it is plausible.

He writes well and the prsentation can not be faulted. But, clearly, he is a great admirer of his subject and seemingly partial to him at times. Cook was more of a surveyor than a discoverer, and some of the heroics might be displaced. His third voyage shows that he was not stable enough mentally. Even his seafaring pales in comparison to his famous predecessors who achieved more with less. Think of the incredible yourney of one of his officers, William Bligh, in an open boat, without supplies, across 3'600 miles of ocean.

Rather than summarize its contents, well done in other reviews on this site, I will simply say that I found it extremely easy to record because it is written in such flowing, evocative prose. In fact, it reads very much like a fascinating adventure novel, and Robert Louis Stevenson could almost have written it. The travels of Captain Cook are superbly recounted, and make engrossing, absorbing reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a readable biography of Capt.
