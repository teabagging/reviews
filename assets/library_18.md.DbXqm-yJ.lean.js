The plot is very thin. The characters are for the most part either uninteresting or unpleasant. There is no action and little dialog.Yet, somehow these elements combine to make a surprisingly good -- even great -- book.Part of the credit goes to the writing and part to the innovative and imaginative concept. I can just picture the author looking at Vermeer's painting and wondering, who was she? We've all done that. Yet, Tracy Chevalier went a step further and created a possible reality that rings true while never pretending to be anything but imaginings. An incredible accomplishment. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at a Vermeer painting without thinking of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for all","review":"I am a 20 something year old man and i loved this book. The movie is great too and it is intersteing to note the differences between them.

I couldn't wait to read about this lovely girl with the pearl earring. What a disappointment, what a bore!Much has been written about the author's portayal of a 17th century Dutch household. True, there's historical information that's interesting, but it was like reading non-fiction, not a novel with well-developed characters and an intriquing story. The prose was tedious, the style undistinguished.Nothing about the book really drew me in, except the cover--I found myself looking back often, gazing upon that beautiful face and wondering what really was behind the pearl earring. Maybe there's a book in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable...","review":"I was not expecting anything as I picked up this book except a good read. I went through it very quickly, and it never lost my interest. I was ready for a novel set in the 1600's with details of life, not art. I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and Stirring","review":"A quiet and stirring book. As elegantly composed as a Vermeer painting itself, Tracy Chevalier seems to draw out of the darkness only the necessary scenes and dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A richly painted novel","review":"The reader will find themselves drawn into this finely spun story, richly lavished on pages you can't help but turn quickly.I appreciated the main character keeping her dignity, and the book not turning into another good-girl-gone-wrong story. Bravo!More!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is writing at its best, both in terms of the concept, and of the prose itself. Author Tracy Chevalier has written a novel in the first person, her narrator being a sixteen-year old girl who is forced, due to her own family's dire finances, to work as a maid for the family of the 17th century painter Johannes Vermeer.In the voice of the heroine, Chevalier reveals how difficult life was in those long-ago days. She never is maudlin, however, nor even obvious. This is a quiet book, which the reader will have to study for its nuances.Oddly, in the peculiar way of coincidences, this book came out very close in time to GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE. Not only are these titles similar, but both of these books engage in fictional explorations of particular aspects of the life of Vermeer. Read together, these two books are as good as a class on the Old Masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, Passionate and Mysterious.....A must read","review":"This is a must read. It has got to be one of the most captivating and chilling stories i have ever read. After reading, I decided to look up information on Johannes Vermeer only to discover that most of the names and information on the artist and his family were correct...right down to where he married into a catholic family after being a christian. I could not put it down, it was so, moving in a way, knowing that half of it was true. It was like you were Griet and you were being painted...Really this is a must read for anyone, no matter what your tastes are like, I am only 15 and i loved it, yet I'm not usually interested in history... it will make you want to keep reading..to learn more...i am now going to study history in school because of this book. Please read it or you may regret doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice little book, this.","review":"Tracy Chevalier, Girl with a Pearl Earring (Dutton, 1999)To date, I've read only one bad review of this slight novel, and a whole lot of excellent ones. I'm casting my vote on the excellent side. Chevalier took one of Vermeer's best-known and most enigmatic paintings and built a story around it (there are a series of these novels; Joyce Carol Oates' I Lock My Door Upon Myself is the only other one I've read, and it is similarly excellent). Griet, a sixteen-year-old from the Protestant side of the tracks, becomes the maidservant of the Vermeers after a kiln accident forces her father out of a job, and the story alternately skips between the variouis tensions within the Vermeer household and Griet's courting by a somewhat ham-handed, if well-meaning, butcher. It's subject matter that could have (and has) been screwed up in too many ways to imagine, but Chevalier pulls it off by keeping the prose spare and letting the silences speak most of the necessary lines. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination from a Painting, and a Great Book","review":"This book was amazing. Chevalier's description was amazing, adding color to the story. She truly put her imagination into it. She expressed the personalities of other characters through Griet's thoughts, but not too much or too obviously. There aren't any words enough to describe how great this book was. You simply have got to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"who are these people anyway","review":"I was greatly looking forward to this book until I started reading it. It was well written, but there was no meat in it. The first half of the book seemed to be about the fine points of being a maid in a household of dysfunctional adults and children. I kept waiting for something to happen other than doing laundry and going to market. The author never developed the characters beyond a purely surface level making it difficult to care about their lives or who they were, which by the way, was never explored. A small interest at the end when the painting was being done, but there was never was any insight into the painter Vermeer's personality. I read \\"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue.\\" A far superior book about the same subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"I heard well-read friends rave about this book, and I finally got around to reading it. Sheesh...It's nothing but a feather-weight, romance novel type tale of archetypal characters! We already know the cast: The illiterate but wise yet plucky housemaid, the silent and enigmatic lord of the household, the shrewish wife, the jealous co-worker. <yawn> Aside from nice language that describes the painting technique, there's no there there. Maybe it works for people who don't read much? I felt let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelled and disappointed...","review":"Though not a complete waste of time, this book was definitely more hype than substance. I felt the novel lacked any real constructive qualities. The narration was lacking, though the story was definitely interesting. I wish the narration had been executed with a more interesting and informative style. The characters, including the main character seem unrealistic. The book is interesting if only for the basic plot. Apart from that, the quality of the text is poor.It is too bad the author didn't spend as much time on her novel as the Vermeer did on his portrait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, and fascinating","review":"I enjoy reading books that have a historical context to them and bring you into the worlds of the past. I enjoyed the way a painting by Vemeer was interpreted to create such an intricate story. One of the best reads of 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly mediocre","review":"Unlike Vermeer who obviously had talent, I am hard pressed to believe that this author has produced a best seller. I truly wanted to like this novel,(as it was a selection by my bookclub), alas I did not. My reasons for disliking it are simple; it is terribly dull. I kept waiting for something to happen (it never does). The characters are one dimentional at best, and our muse Griet would appear to be the most amazing and accomplished teenager to have ever lived. At the tender age of 16 she knows everything about running a large household, raising children, manipulating the mature women of the house, fending off the advances of men, and in case that wasn't enough she's giving art tips to the master himself, um sure... that's plausible. While the premise of this book was fascinating the execution certainly was not. The best thing about this novel?... the cover art!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Love Art History....","review":"...this book will completely mesmerize you! I read it once and I'm ready to read it again. Chevalier has the gift of taking you into Vermeer's studio so that you believe you are there. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely story!","review":"I have long admired Vermeer's paintings and in particular, this one. I picked up this book on a whim as I do not often read fiction. Tracey Chevalier is a talented and graceful writer. Her recreation of Dutch life is extremely detailed, yet presented simply. Some might find this book too subtle, but I thought it perfect. I read it slowly, all in one sitting and found that the emotions so many of us are addicted to these days were all underlying. They are never blatant, yet when Griet hurts, so does the reader. Highly recommended and a easy enough read for younger people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Awesome! the static between the girl and the man was so much you can feel it.

Chevalier depicts the life in 17th century Holland with a radiance unimaginable. She crosses the line on fiction and the historical wonder, Vermeer. With every page turned, one wonders how new maid, Griet, will survive her days working for a catholic family and what painting her master, Johannes Vermeer, with brush up next for the city of Delft.Chevalier captures the true meaning of art and spiritual infulence in this golden novel. She concocts a story of the beginning of one of the world's finest paintings, into the epic of an entire time period. Devour this New York Times best seller and experience the rapture of one girl's path through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly good book","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I found this story particularly enjoyable because of my love of all things Dutch. The author is able to perfectly blend a lovely fictional character coming-of-age with factual history from the life and town of Johannes Vermeer. The author did an amazing job exploring the rift between the catholics and protestants within the community.Also, see the movie after you read the book...Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson portray Vermeer and Griet well, and the scenery of Delft, Netherlands is breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl With a Pearl Earring","review":"I enjoyed this book so much! As I read, I was totally engrossed, and I remember that during the process I paused, and tried to analyze just what it was that engrossed me so. The story itself is so simple, but it's a great story, nonetheless. The author's characterization is so much fun. I discovered many dimensions to most of the main characters. You'll love Catharina! The author's mention of several of Vermeer's masterpieces is an added bonus. When my reading session was completed I felt I had discovered some interesting connections to Vermeer's paintings. I later discovered that my mental images were quite different from the examples of the actual work! It was just a really interesting, fun, artsy, quick read. It doesn't get any better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevalier's tour de force on Vermeer's life and loves","review":"This book has quickly risen to my top 5 favorite books of all time. It takes a lot of brilliance and entertainment to sit alongside George Orwell, and Chevalier delivers. The 17th century Dutch landscape is described with as much depth and attention to detail as its most famous artist. The novel's protagonist and Vermeer's muse is the enigmatic girl from the painting, \\"Girl with a pearl earring\\". Chevalier masterfully blends art history and fiction to make this a delicious read. Chevalier's greatest gift lies in her ability to literally flood the reader's senses. I can still feel the thick smoothness of home-made colors between my fingers, and the warmth of the sun on my face from the windows of a solitary studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My GOD what a waste of time.","review":"I had the cd version (trying to help pass the time on an ugly commute) and I have to admit the beginning intrigued me. I thought the writing was a little silly; the attempts at being profound in it's descriptives were a little ridiculous, but the storyline did indeed pull me in.And then it just kept going and going and going and never went anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen. I waited....and waited.... and waited. Nothing.Then it ended. I was pretty irritated, to be honest. I'm glad I borrowed the thing from the library and didn't spend any money.Such a brilliant concept that was wasted by a very poor writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't judge a book by its cover","review":"I know many people like this book so I just want to address those potential readers who might think this is a literary read. It's not. There is no depth of character, no attempt to describe what life would have been like in the 17th century for a girl like this, virtually nothing about the Holland of Vermeer's time, to the point where it is clear this was never the concern of the author. Just a nice, simple romance novel dressed up in a upmarket dust jacket. Like another reviewer said, it will make a sumptuous Merchant Ivory film, and that will probably improve it. That cover is very deceptive; there's nothing to \\"look at\\" as you read, just the thoughts of a nice girl thinking about love in what could easily be translated to a wealthy bohemian artists' community in suburban America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After all the great reviews of this book, perhaps I had unrealistic expectations...I read this book quickly, hoping that something, anything, exciting would happen. Ultimately, I was disappointed.Throughout the book it seems as though the author is trying to build the readers anticipation for an ultimate shocking scene, a scene which never materializes. I will give the author credit for building great characters; characters that you can truly like and dislike with good reason. The characters were believable, but the plot was just not there. My advice? Borrow it from a friend or the library, but don't spend your money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pearl of a book","review":"I just loved this book and it is one that I will reread from time to time. It is beautifully written and holds your interest from start to finish. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"high school fiction","review":"I was embarrassed on behalf of Vermeer while reading this book. Definitely aimed at high-school level readers, who may be interested in the pseudo romance and \\"artist as a flawed regular man\\" approach. Chevalier's first novel, recently published, suffers from the same sophomoric skill level and just plain goofy storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 3 and half stars","review":"Overall a good weekend read, much like the classics. But Chevalier could've built up the sexual tension a bit more between Griet & Vermeer. It was not as powerful as it could've been, in my oppinion. I was glad, however, that she chose to have them \\"consumate\\" their relationship only by doing the painting and wearing the earrings rather than ever actually consumating in the \\"old fashioned way.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE BOOK...","review":"This was an awesome book. Though I am only fourteen years old, I thought that this book was awesome. It has become my favorite book.

When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. \\"..or in my own words, A fictionalized account of a young girl in Holland who winds up working as a maid in Vermeer's house. She captivates the artist and becomes a muse for him. The best book I have read in years. You don't have to be an art lover to appreciate this book but it helps. Having studied Vermeer's paintings before I found the story very enjoyable and I could not put it down. If you love historical fiction and / or art history check this book out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a story","review":"This book not only gives life, albeit fictional, to the artist Vermeer and to his well known portrait, it also brings the reader into a delightful story of a young woman in Delft whose family has fallen on hard times which seems to redirect her entire life as she is forced to become a maid. The triumph in the story is her ability to take on this new role, but not successfully enough to give up her dignity and self esteem. I found it also to be a marvelous illustration of the passion one can fuel with imagination as a young woman, and the reality one finds with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully terrible book","review":"I just finished the book this morning after reading much of the night.

Davis has written a book that is a flavorful delight. This writer is tough with a pen; her words evoke sharp images, and she is adept at taking you into the past. I marveled at her accurate descriptions of 70's Detroit life. If you grew up during this time, it's like she's describing your childhood, escorting you back into time, and causing you to reflect on how life was, and how it is now.If you love well-written stories with a strong feel for nostalgia, family, and the joys and pains of growing up, you may also find great value in SHIFTING THROUGH NEUTRAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last of the Greatest Hits","review":"This is the last of the Bob Dylan Greatest Hits Series, and it is absolutely fabulous.

I needed to transfer an indented styrofoam ball holder into the bag so that the ball would not roll around. This bag is for my disabled 20 year old daughter who wears a size 4 shoe and the only place to store them is on top of the ball. (not nice) The side pockets and front pockets are too small for her size 4 shoes. We use it still as it does roll well but it isn't the best BOWLING rolling bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for those interested in Pern's history!","review":"This book fills in some of the questions concerning the early times on Pern and why Pern colonists were left alone for so long.

A prologue in front of each chapter would have been nice to setup the chapters (like Lamour has done in his short story collections), otherwise the book is great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book clears alot up","review":"This book was good mostly because it cleared alot of info you might not have known before, but there are some good stories mixed in.\\"The Dolphins' Bell\\" another book by Anne McCaffrey is in this book word for word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't started here","review":"I've heard alot of good things about the Pern series - so I figured I'd start with this book which chronicles some of the history and founding of Pern and of Benden Weyr. Dissapointingly, the stories of Benden Weyr and Ruatha Hold were the only ones I found interesting (the dolphin story I couldn't even manage to make myself read.) I haven't lost my faith in this series yet though - I plan to start at the beginning where I should have in the first place. If you're new to Pern don't start with this book! Only for serious Pern addicts who are interested in the history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any fan of the world of Pern","review":"Truly fantastic! A collection of stories covering such subjects as the discovery of Pern and the departure from the Southern Island. THE CHRONICLES fills in the gaps of Pernesian history more than adequately. Anyone who loves the Dragons and their dragonriders will cherish this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!","review":"I thought it contained wonderful and valuable information about the land of Pern, especially in the beginning, when colonists found Rukbat's third planet and named it Pern. The story of dolphineers was a bit disappointing, because my head swam in confusion in the story so far from the plots. I minus it one star because of that, but otherwise it was an awesome book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True fans should avoid it","review":"\`Okay, let's get one thing straight: I lived and breathed Pern for a great deal of my life. I have to recommend that all fans look long and hard at the slew of latter day Pern books, though, and consider making the hard decision to skip them. This is just such a book -- along with the incredibly disappointing book that showed the \\"first founders\\" of Pern and all the lame origins for things like the grubs, the dragons, the name of the holds, and so on, it only serves to rob the series of the\`\` wonder of the Ancients. I couldn't enjoy this book at all, I'm sorry to say -- the deep exploration of the homosexuality of Blue riders didn't help any. No, for my money, Pern fans should stick with the first three books, the Harper hall series (Pemur and Menolly), and All the Weyrs of Pern. Whatever you do, skip the lame books like Renegades of Pern (shudder) and this one.\`"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get cover on my Kindle","review":"I was very disappointed that I didn't get the cover image for this book on my Kindle. What image I received is not the same as the one presented on the product page.

Anne McCaffrey is one of my favorite authors. I have read almost all of her Pern books. The dragons are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly mediocre","review":"One of the biggest let-downs of all time. Anne's intentions are laudable; the book tries to set the scene for many of the incidents and factors that emerge in the later (Pern chronology-wise) novels. But the book tries to do too much in very short order and ends up as a disjointed series of events, told in a horrifyingly incoherent manner. Only when she concentrates on the beloved dragons in the telling of the founding of Benden Weyr, with Torene and Mihall, does the old gold McCaffrey shine through. I waited for this book with such anticipation and felt like a deflated balloon before I was half way through. Please Anne, you can do much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonriders is great","review":"My first exposure to this writer was a segment in a text book that I was using for homeschooling the girls.

If you know anything about Dylan Thomas' life, you'll be astonished at the detail McTell is able to incorporate here. But if you know anything about McTell's life, you'll recognize the underlying passion and doubt as his own. This is truly a haunting and engaging work.

The rhythm of his writing, with the \\"He said...said he\\" and such is so much fun to read, as are his descriptions of how the characters said things, which are all left out in this production.

We've only got a 1.6 megapixel camera, but setting the image at 300 DPI and printing at the printer's 403 produces incredibly realistic photos. With the 4 x 6 postcard paper, we get very impressive borderless images. And, the speed is acceptable -- IMO, better than some ink jets. While it is still expensive to run this printer, when you want something that has a longer ink life (from fade) than the typical ink or bubble jet, and you want to avoid little dots or bands, this is the way to go. The only problem I've heard is finding paper & cartridges (Sony packages the paper and cartridges together so you use them as a \\"set.\\") With this item, I might just take my film camera out of the rotation once and for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"ink sublimination printer","review":"Easy to use! The picture color is absolutely incredible! I have a Canon S330 and printed straight from Memory Card (you'll need the adapter) and the pictures are vibrant. I would guess that depending upon your camera resolution will determine the clarity of your pics. I have 2.1 pixels and the quality and clarity is incredible. There are several possibilities to print with this thing, so you re not limited. I love it. It's small enough to transport if you wanted to...then you can print out high quality pictures anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun way of tackling Aberrant","review":"Much as they did for Trinity, White Wolf has begun putting out mini-books touching on specific aspects of Aberrant.

It seems like he wants to emphasize his creative writing degree from California much more than he wants to emphasize his interesting experiences on these ships.His writing is overly artsy and the scenes are wildly disjointed.

Watching Cleese and Chapman, you can really see the beginnings of Python.I would have liked to have given this 5 stars, but from what I can tell, there was no restoration work done on the prints. They should have taken the time to present this in as good of condition as possible. Also, the opening menu is hard to read, the shows are not chapter stopped, and the interviews with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Terry Jones, as interesting as they are, are the same ones that are on the \\"Do Not Adjust Your Set\\" collection.Griping aside, the shows are a lot of fun and feature many hilarious sketches including Tim Brooke-Taylor doing the Chartered Accountant Dance; Let's Speak English with Cleese at the top of his form; and the original Four Yorkshiremen. This is a wonderful set, but it easily could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak stuff","review":"Here are five old half hour television shows that are important only to those interested in the subsequent histories of the participants. The material is very weak. And the bits with women, namely one Aimi Macdonald, are so bad they are embarrassing.

The material is \\"3-D\\"/textured, like a carving instead of the flat picture that is usually used on covers, and the etching had a good amount of detail. The heart even has something etched in it, but I was not able to make out all of the words on it. The texture makes the switch plate look artistic, but it also stands off the wall about a centimeter, and with the depth and texture combined, it is difficult to find the light switch in the dark. There is enough of the light switch coming through that I do not have a hard time flipping it on, but since the whole switch plate cover stands off the wall and has various levels and grooves in the carving, it can take a little time to find which bump is the light switch. On looks alone I might have given this five stars, but the poor functionality knocks it down to a four or maybe even three."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best work presenting the African Diaspora","review":"Sandra Jackson-Opoku has created a tour-de-force of epic proportions.

Through the allegory of Anasi the spider, Opoku moves the reader through time and space. I loved this book tremendously and encourage all people to read it.

Do yourself and favor and buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best debut album since College Dropout","review":"This is definitely in my top 5 rap albums ever. The entire cd is solid all way through. Lupe's lyricism, wordplay, and storytelling make me listen to this album over and over, which is something I usually can't do with a cd. Although I gave the album 5 stars, there were a few things I didn't like, which don't affect the rating much: the intro track would've been cooler with a verse, and I didn't care for the American Terrorist song much. I can see why people would like that song, though, it's just not my kind of song. Also, the outro track is tiring; it's cool if you knew Lupe and you are listening to hear him shout your name, but otherwise, this last track is just skippable - or just don't put it on your iPod to save space. Otherwise, the other 13 tracks are perfection to me.Excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROBOTS AND SKATEBOARDS?","review":"Wow!!!!!!!!!!! Not since ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ever have i heard a debut album this good to include: Illmatic, Revolutionary Vol. 1, Resonalbe doubt, Doggystyle etc. Since i heard lupe on late registration i was amazed. His usage of metaphors and similes are outstaning for someone being soo young in the game. True hip hop fans will love this kid. Some ppl say that he is corny and makes songs about skateboarding and a box when these songs are merely explaing the struggle of the inner city community and how you must always prevail and how t.v. is destroying our youth. Every song is a good song and he is not to prechy . By far one of the illest new kats to the game. Once you listen to the album listen to it again to try to understand some of the content 'cause it is serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy was I missing out","review":"I've been listening to hip hop my whole life and I must say Lupe is absolutely one of the best out there. His beats are great and original and his lyrics are jaw dropping. I'm just picking up this album after buying his second album \\"The Cool\\" because I like every song on that album and had never heard this one. I must say that his second album is better but this one is no slouch either.

So honestly my review here is based off of how this album is alone, not compared to similar stuff done in the past. I love how this album isn't so gangsta, so rough and full of materialism. I love how the songs deal with love, skating, school, and fatherhood type stuff. This is an album that the world needs right now in these violent times, we need to all just chill, be around friends and family and let this one rock. The beats are banging, Lupe Fiasco obviously is not only talented, but I can feel his ambition and work shine through his tracks. This may be one of the very first hip hop albums that ever spoke to me personally and I'm guessing that if your ready for something more \\"out of the hood\\" and more \\"down to earth\\" give this disc a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressure","review":"I know I may be late, but better late then never.

You can tell Jay-Z had his hands all over this project. For me, this album is a refreshing, enlightening listen. This kid is for the struggle, and he can definitely spit. Big-up to the Chi. for doing their part in keeping good hip hop alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as good as his mixtapes","review":"This album is solid, no doubt, lyrically, creatively, musically. In order to appreciate this album, though, you've really got to free yourself of distractions and focus on Lupe's words and rhyme schemes (especially on tracks like \\"American Terrorist\\"). The great thing about this album is that there's no b.s.: when Lupe rhymes, it's Lupe your hearing, not a commercial gangster puppet (see \\"Real\\"). Lupe shows an interesting choice in beats on the album-- the tracks are often unique but usually still fresh. If you like this album, make sure you search for Lupe's earlier non-major-label mixtapes, such as FARENHEIT: 1ST AND 15. Back when those came out, Lupe had a hunger, flow, and lyrical dexterity unmatched by anyone in the industry. Buy FOOD & LIQUOR, though, regardless: it is up to us to save Hip-Hop by supporting Lupe's efforts to turn the genre back into something about message, positivity, and activism."},{"rating":"2","title":"hip hop on its way back","review":"great 1st album for lupe fiasco the lyrics are amazing, and the beats are just as good.i recomend getting this album if you are a true hip hop fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Klein is Ling","review":"Robert Klein is the King.

As I've said before, I'm not one of those types who need crystal clear, every pitch perfect, highs and lows. I pump it up sometimes, it's fine. I turn it down when I'm reading, it's fine.

Profound reading with a unique way of hitting the nail on the head when it comes to insight on humanness and our potential.

We literally \\"create our own reality\\" by our thoughts, words and deeds. This book gives the reader many tools to use to create the reality one wishes for, rather than just swimming through life, tossing and turning with no control over direction.Regardless of whether one believes in spirit guides, the information presented in this book can be used in everyday life. Changing the way one thinks can change one's life. Roman gives a variety of exercises which can be used to sense energy in the home and others, to use one's personal energy to improve oneself, to improve relationships with others, and to lead a clearer, more spiritual life.

I came to understand things that I did not quite grasp before and it has made such a difference for me! Being an empath, I would often carry the emotions of other people but did not realize I was doing so, just thought it was me. But after reading this book I was able to separate others' feelings from my own with ease and ever since I have not been brought low through interacting with others. I still have empathy and compassion, I do care - but now I don't carry those emotions with me. Another thing I have learned is how to let go more easily of certain relationships, ones that I just couldn't seem to stay away from because of how much I cared for the other person. Maybe I was just ready for this book, but I will say it has had quite an impact on me and I am so much happier now.

For one, it's a very biased account and second, what difference does it make? Does every book review start with a critique of the author's lifestyle?As far as 777, the section on Qabalistic correspondences is the best. This is worth the price of admission because with it you can construct viable magick rituals for any purpose. Sure, you probably need another introductory book on magick before you can utilize it, but this is more of a reference book than a how-to manual.The other two sections are important too, but Gematria is way too over-used in Qabalah, and is in fact not always a reliable way to test spirits and entities as Crowley claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be Called \\"666\\"","review":"A by the numbers Aleister Crowley book that is sure to please fans.

No matter how you feel about Crowley, this is a valuable resource as a reference book. I have used this book to create elemental rituals for my wicca practice as well as making talismen for spells. This book is similar to having a dictionary as a reference to write, so you need to have knowledge of magick before you use the information inside. Gematria! Wow!

Its value as a magickal reference is unequalled. This book is a chance to follow the thought processes, both mathematically and intuitively, of this century's most adept master of the Arts.For the beginner, this text will be perplexing but worth much time and study.

(OK, so it was plagiarized from various other sources by AC.. yet this volume was one of the first to piece together a number into one work).Positives include a comprehensive set of correspondences covering many areas, and more than enough for anyone to get started on the path of Hermetic Qabalah, Western esoteric traditions etc. Great for memorizing and acting as a foundation for further Hermetic Qabalah work.Negatives include the tables being quite hard to read (ie. small font), some archaic language and philosophy, and some of the tables being incomplete. Also requires some introductory reading on the Qabalah elsewhere, before this book will make much sense to 'the common man'.Deserves a place on the bookshelf of any self-respecting occultist, esoteric philosopher, Freemason, hermeticist, magician etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exelent occult reference.","review":"The table of correspondence is probably Crowley's most genius undertaking. 777's attempt to interconnect the world's diverse traditions and occult topics together under one key scale is nothing short of monumental. While some of his attributions range from questionable to embarrassingly wrong (column XXXIII is particularly disappointing to me) the preponderance of it is not only useful to wizards but to students of comparative religion as well. There is even a section on the I-Ching.As for the rest of the book, I could take it or leave it. It is mostly about Gematria, to wit, the use of ascribing numerical values to Hebrew letters. As it is well known to me that sounds can be numbers, I failed to get much out of it: hence only 4 stars. But Liber 777 is worth any unused pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine work from Aleister Crowley","review":"This is why i buy crowley's other books.

This is an exceedingly superficial, detached treatment of very personal, sometimes revealing stuff. Yet why do I feel MTM managed to pull it off--telling me her secrets while keeping herself at armslength. Then again, she seems to keep at armslength from herself... There is information about The Dick Van Dyke show, the The MTM Show, MTM's alcoholism, diabetes, pregnancies and marriages, the deaths of her son, sister, and brother, her audience with the pope, her visit to Israel...all these things, yet not very much. Possibly one of the most fascinating lives in modern American entertainment, and so many details left out!

MTM's bookdoesn't focus on any one thing long enough to beanymore than a glossy look at her career. Themain problem is that the events in her life thatare meant to be sympathetic come off as selfserving. She points to the loss of her brother,sister and son in tragic deaths as events of majorimportance, but she spends more time describing amiscarriage she had than how these people wereimportant to her. Their main imporatance seemsto be the fact that they died, not that theyever lived.The books main strengths are the behind the scenesshow business talk, although I don't MTM isn't akeen enough observer to bring her shows and moviesto life for us.

It's true, she wrote it when she was in her 80s, and it shows. However, start out chronologically with her books - The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 1920, and go on from there, and you will probably love her. Mysteries, action adventure (rather tame by todays standards but there's nothing wrong in that !) and well written. Her later books must be read by devoted fans who just want to see her old characters again.

Christie was usually at her best with Tommy and Tuppence, but unfortunately all her worst faults are on display here. The book is 10 percent something that resembles a storyline, and 90 percent poorly fleshed-out characters sitting around repeating themselves, vaguely wondering about things, and throwing out references to Christie's previous books until the book sounds more like an advertising flier than an novel. Bill Wallis does a good job with the reading, but he has nothing to work with.Unless you like hours and hours' worth of people talking in circles, stick with the other Tommy and Tuppence books, and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Weak","review":"Tommy and Tuppence's final appearance is sadly weak: although Christie endows the couple with considerable charm, the story itself becomes increasingly vague and confused as the novel progresses, and there is no satisfying conclusion to the piece.

It is Tommy and Tuppence, not Poirot or Marple, which means it is a lot of talk, a lot of piffle, fun bits with T & T, a dog, a mystery, a lot of here and there, and all of a sudden an end.And it is Dame Agatha's farewell to the couple who charmed us with their idealized romance and their happy (albeit a little dangerous at times) investigations.Read it for the fun. Read it also for the investigative method when nothing strange is expected but little things keep cropping up. Only Tuppence and Tomny would have started stringing the bits together then persisted in continuing to look for more bits.Yes, sometimes it seems irritating, but you also cannot walk away from the story without wanting to discover more. In that respect the readers become T & T.

My 1973 hardback was picked up at a book sale. I'm so glad that I read some reviews here to find that this is not representative of her work. The plot has a resemblance to the TV show \\"Cold Case\\" in that it tries to figure out a crime from the past. However, unlike the TV show, there are no flashbacks; so the past remains removed from the reader. For each clue and discovery that either Tuppence or Tommy make, they seem to communicate it very imprecisely to the other, exactly the opposite of what I would think would make good detective work. I kept hoping that the ending of the book would tie it together. Although there was somewhat of an explanation about who the criminals were in the past and in the present, none of it was particularly clear or interesting. Hannibal the dog was fun. I think I will try to find an earlier work of hers, but my recommendation on this book is to pass.

It was the first of Agatha Christie's books I have ever read, and it was not a good way to start out with an author. She contradicts herself in more than one place, and the plot is hard to follow. If you're a Christie addict, go ahead, but otherwise, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"Listen to this advice from an hardcore Christie fan: don't read this book. It's such a painful experience to see one of the greatest mystery writers ever getting into - I can't use another word - complete senility. The story (I can't call it a plot) goes nowhere. Characters are wooden, and some excerpts are merely ludicrous. If you really like Christie, be charitable and forget about that sad final opus. She wrote so many excellent things in her earlier years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cozy, but a poor mystery","review":"If you want a \\"village life\\" book, this isn't badly written, but as a mystery it's a loser.

I have always enjoyed her mysteries but this one was extremely boring and repetitive, wasn't much of a mystery anyway. I love the way Agatha Christie shapes her characters in other books but if one wants to keep admiring her genius, avoid Postern Of Fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and embarrassing","review":"Christie's final attempt at novel writing provides painful evidence of her failing mental powers. Tommy and Tuppence struggle to solve one last mystery while their author struggles to remember the plot line from chapter to chapter. _Passenger to Frankfurt_ may be worse as a story, but _Postern of Fate_ is Christie's nadir as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty terrible -- and yet, distinctly Agatha Christie","review":"The bad has been well-documented: the book moves at a snail's pace, places its intrepid protagonists at the periphery while presumably more interesting stuff is happening \\"off-screen\\", it's full of endless digressions, it never coalesces, and everything sputters toward a muddled and unsatisfactory conclusion. There was probably a good fifth Tommy and Tuppence story to tell, but this isn't it.That being said, while Mrs. Christie's storytelling prowess has failed her, her literary voice remains intact. The writing flows incredibly smoothly, an absolutely blessing when the pacing is so slow, and the ebb and the dialog retains her characteristic patter. If I were out of other Christies to read, it would be worth slogging through this one just to reconnect with a unique literary voice, even one far, far from the height of her powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gem","review":"I've been listening to this album since I was a kid in the old vynil version.Cannot recall how many times i have played it.

It is entirely internally consistent, and doesn't mix different systems to give the appearance that it is intellectual correct. It is comprehensive as well, needing no supplements except a general knowledge of rulerships and so on that every astrologer should know. The test of the book is to test it against one's own database of individuals and see whether the system works. I did so, and the system works with uncanny accuracy. I should note that although a great part of the book derives from traditional understandings of astrology, the book is not traditional. It is a challenge to the conventional application of solar return interpretation, and as such demands that the traditional approach be justified and not just accepted.

Plus she refers to house rulers as \\"Lord of the House\\" LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and disappointing - Terrible","review":"I would like to be fair to Ms. McCullough because I consider myself to be a beginner, altough I've been dabbling with astrology for years. I have just a few more pages until I'm done but I think this book is confusing and not well written. I think the author would have been better off presenting fewer techniques for interpreting solar returns and spent more time organizing the information in an easier to follow fashion. My biggest peeve.... she constantly refers to charts that are chapters ahead and or behind the current topic and doesn't label them except with letters and numbers. arrgh!! I think she should work on improve her editing skills or hand her work over to someone else who possesses greater skill in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and unprofessional","review":"For the beginning astrologer, this might be an amusing read. For anyone who is serious about the profession, though, it is sure to disappoint. At least, that's what it did for me. Ms. McCullough claims to have been an editor in a previous career. She apparently forgot her skills while penning this anecdotal, incomplete and inconsequential series of astrological events. It appears that personal experience alone suffices for Ms. McCullough to deduce astrological rules and guidelines for solar returns. The lack of any kind of statistical and scientific foundation of her findings, together with an amateurish writing style, makes this work very hard to swallow. Not worth the effort of ordering. Note to the publisher: get a copy of QuarkXpress and a decent typesetter."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE SAVER","review":"IT WAS A GREAT INVESTMENT AND A LIFE SAVER WHEN ON AN IMPORTANT CALL JUST PLUG IT IN AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"I received this product, and it is exactly as described.

That is, until I heard the soundtrack from this movie. For the first time, my complete faith in John Williams was shaken. There WERE other people out there that could outdo him!John Barry's haunting \\"John Dunbar's Theme\\" and majestic \\"Buffalo Hunt\\" are the main reasons for purchasing this soundtrack alone. The spirit of the frontier comes magically to life in this wonderful, wonderful piece of work.When this was nominated for an Academy Award, I reluctantly turned away from John Williams' \\"Home Alone\\" and rooted for John Barry...and came away a wiser person. Though Williams is still at the top of my list, I'll always remember the day that \\"John Dunbar\\" made me think twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dances With Wolves","review":"This is one of the most beautiful albums I have listened too.

I do own several other SACD's and these DO play 5.1 channel.

I'm dead serious. John Barry will be remembered forever by this score \\"alone\\". When I first saw this film, I was in my early teens. I saw it on the biggest screen I'd ever seen. Let's just put it this way...Costner should kiss Barry's ass for this one! Without this music, his film wouldn't have been what it was. But it still would have been an excellent picture. This music can make you cry and be comforted. I don't just picture South Dakota landscape when I listen to this music, I picture the entire world. I even get a glimpse of Heaven...and so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD","review":"I have quite a few soundtracks in my collection, but this one is my absolute favorite.

This is a great score to escape from the world. Some other soundtracks I recommend, AFTER you purchase this one, are: Superman(John Williams), Stealing Home, Willow, The Blue Lagoon, Gladiator, Titanic, and Field of Dreams, and The Natural, just to name a few. If you go through your whole life without listening to this CD atleast once, than you'll have really missed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"Dances with WolvesSome of the best music around today is written by film music composers.

Jay Mark's mixing effort managed to bury Gregg Allman's keyboards on most songs. Then there's Soulshine -- why on earth would the band pick a version where drummer Jaimoe is a half-step BEHIND the beat for the entire song?? And why make 4 of the 8 tracks simply re-hashes from the last studio album?? Three songs do make the album salvageable -- the glorious accoustic Liz Reed, a shorter, funky, energetic You Don't Love Me (Warren Haynes' slide solo is AMAZING), and the fabulous cover of Willie Dixon's The Same Thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked gem...","review":"First off, a big thank you to all who reviewed this cd here on Amazon; your recommendations and comments convinced me to buy this cd (and the First Set as well.)As an Allmans fan from 30 years ago, I had completely overlooked this era in their history, and I'm very happy to agree with the other writers that this music is well worth hearing. By the way, isn't it funny to compare the covers of these two cd's? The Orpheum Theatre has apparently been nuked, and one band member vaporized into a cloud of black soot!

I agree with the reviewer who criticized the way the narrative jumps around in seemingly random fashion; there is no depth to the story. However, even beyond that, when I read a novel, I'm looking for good writing. I didn't find that here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad News From Paraguay","review":"I absolutely agree with the reviewers who were baffled by this novel's receipt of the National Book Award. \\"The News from Paraguay\\" is a one-dimensional, extremely violent narrative about a slice of Paraguayan history. The main characters, the dictator who plunges his country into war, and his Irish wife, a sort of Marie Antoinette figure, who longs for adventure so long as it comes with the trappings of Parisian society, are implausible, wooden and superficially realized. This could have been a great novel of historical fiction, like \\"Year of Wonders,\\" but the author is content to give us a bloody Fodor travelogue. In sum, this novel is easy to dismiss, and unfortunately for Ms. Tuck, the news from Paraguay is very bad indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What WAS she thinking?","review":"Lilly Tuck grabbed a couple of wonderful historical figures and has written a truly wretched novel. Francisco Solano Lopez and Eliza Lynch were the Paraguayan power couple who looted shamelessly and drove their poor country to near total destruction in the 1860's. Their story will make a fine book some day, alas that day is not today. Tuck has given us wooden cut-outs where real people should be, a story with loose ends and meaningless sub-plots and don't even get me started on her silly sex scenes. In sum, don't even think of wasting your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Get the National Bore Award","review":"Lily Tuck is in the worst situation possible for a writer - she finds herself surrounded by people who tell her what a wonderful book she has written, but, alas, it is not true at all. The prose is flat (not spare) and the characters are painfully lifeless, reduced to making a series of gestures and comments that never come to life on the page, nor in this reader's mind. Sadly overhyped, this novel is to be ignored and Ms. Tuck needs to hear the truth from an objective public."},{"rating":"1","title":"ignorant and boring","review":"the author is obviously racist yet trying to make her character enjoy her surroundings. it's also obvious that the author has never been to paraguay and that relaxing to her is lazy. why did anyone tell this woman she wrote a good book? all her information came from foreigners to paraguay... not paraguains directly. if you want to read about paraguay accuratly, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Violence!!","review":"I am surprised that in the editorial and customer reviews no one was disturbed by the over-the-top violence: blood, beheadings, dismemberings, starvings, tortures, impalements, rapes, destruction and so on that multiply on every page, with little literary merit. Why would an accomplished author present this to a National Book reading audience? One reads about the horrors of war, but this book goes beyond in gratutitous torture and killing of every person who comes on the scene (except for Ella and 50% of her children). We swoon over her golden elegance and wade into the blood outside. If the point is to show the horrors of greed and war, the telling is too flat and removed to make us care about the individuals, but, instead, we turn away in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"When I saw the logo of the National Book Award, I assumed that I would be purchasing a good read.

Other great songs included are \\"Natural Thing\\" by M People and \\"Martha\\" by Deep Forest. And, the Rolling Stones even make an appearance.

The flag I received has much wider bars and much larger stars than what the picture shows.

It helped me realize that I was actually recovering from my loss, which is a great help when you are in such pain you don't think you'll ever feel normal again.Especially when everyone around you is trying to keep you from crying and encouraging you to forget your loss, this book gave me an outlet for my grief.

It is an awesome resource when your heart has been broken after a death or a break up. It allows you to read a few pages and then when you are feeling weak you can pick it back up and read a few more. It is divided into several sections. The left hand page shows a word/subject followed by suggestions and ideas on that subject. The right hand page has a poem on the same subject. I keep a copy at home just in case a friend may need one. My original stays on the bookshelf and is a favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the lonely and hurting soul","review":"This book haunted me for years before they finally put it back into production! I looked high and low, internet, used-bookstores, overstocked big box bookstores - - and it was nowhere! This is practical advice that you most likely have heard before, but you find overwhelming to recall when in the throes of a painful loss. The best feature is definitley how McWilliams applies these oft heard helpful hints via different mediums - poems, stories, song lyrics, etc. - and in a straight forward, easy to read manner. The conversational tone is like a libation for the lonely and hurting soul. You can also read it over and over again, applying it from anything from a loss of a pet or break-up (loss of a relationship) to the loss of a parent or family member."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, the finest of its kind that I've found.","review":"As a Social Worker who has dealt with hundreds of deaths due to cancer, AIDS, and the rest, I have recommended this \\"Little First Aid Kit\\" to numerous spouses, families and friends. It deals well, and realistically, with all sorts of losses. It was given to me by a therapist as I was grieving a sudden and horrible divorce, and helped me immensely. I now prescribe it to many who are beginning the terrible process of dealing with severe loss. In a word, \\"Wonderful.\\" The poetry is touching, funny, and right on the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book literally saved my life.","review":"The aftermath of an affair can be devastating.

I not only lost my husband, but my family and my self-esteem as well. After seriously contemplating suicide, I sought professional counseling. My therapist recommended this incredible book to me - it has changed my life. I no longer think about ending my life, I am rebuilding it. Thank you for helping me to live again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every person should own a copy.","review":"This book has been around for years, yet still holds true for this generation. It incorporates both self-help advice and beautiful poetry. I could not believe how accurate some of the lessons and poems were in relation to what I was going through.

The logical advise, and somewhat illogical poetry are just what the doctor ordered. I've given over a dozen copies to friends over the years. My own copy is 12 yrs old and a much loved old friend. No matter where I am in my life, it has helpped. A truely wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Healing Book for the Grieving","review":"This book was given to me in '93 when my mother died. I lost my father in 2009 and ordered it again. I had shared my '93 version with so many friends and finally it did not return. It once again helped me heal. Its passages are short and heart-felt. Short is good because when you are grieving, you can't concentrate. I recently met a woman who had just lost her beloved mother, and I took the book to her. It is the best gift you can give someone who has suffered \\"the loss of love' whether it's death, divorce etc. Better than flowers or memorials."},{"rating":"2","title":"smile and shed a tear","review":"This book made me smile and shed a tear.

After that, I could feel myself starting to understand what was happening to me and why I was feeling the way I did.

The reader can identify with the stages of grief in simple terms, which is exactly what a person experiencing grief needs.

This is one of the few books I don't hesitate to recommend to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for those in need of support...","review":"Over the past 13 years - after I recieved this book from a friend when I was going through a loss - I have given out over 30 of these books to others going through divorce, loss of a loved one, or loss of health. Even though I feel that this pertains to loss of a loved one going through divorce, it has brought comfort to others. This may be an \\"older\\" publication, but it still has down-to-earth and to-the-heart support for someone struggling through the loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for breakups, definitely not for deaths","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this book. I think if you're going through the heartbreak of a failed relationship, then it might be very helpful. But for those who are grieving the death of their partners/spouses/mates, take it from me -- this book will not be of much help at all. It does not acknowledge the pain of losing your loved one to death. Some of the suggestions in the book, such as \\"take a bubble bath,\\" are ridiculously facile. The prevailing suggestions for survival focus on forgetting the person we loved, which may work if you're trying to get over someone who's dumped you, but not possible or advisable if you're grieving someone who died. If you are a widow/widower, as I am, then you'll just want to pitch this book across the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sympathy Card","review":"I have had a copy of this book for over 20 years and I have sent it to people instead of a sympathy card. Almost everyone I have sent it to said that they read it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed help","review":"This is a fantastic book. I originally read it some years ago after a painful relationship break up and working through the chapters was a surreal kind of therapy that helped me adjust and cope with intense pain and sorrow. It helped me move on and be a better and stronger person. I bought it again this year for a family member who had tragically lost her adult daughter to suicide, and who was only just coping, and revisited the pages. Two completely different circumstances but the words and suggestions were invaluable for both. It has been very very helpful - loss, pain,fear,whatever the circumstances the suggestions in the book for healing and growth are invaluable. However as it says in the forward, don't just read the book it has to be used and applied to your situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help!","review":"This book has short, easily readable sections that are great for someone who is hurting.

Each page gives a week of thoughts on how to add beauty and style to your every day life. Ideas on buying and arranging seasonal flowers, to adding a big piece of jewelry to your outfit.... it's all here. The book is broken into months with a keyword for each: January - Simplify, December - Celebrate - and the advice follows this theme. The book has beautiful photos and glossy paper, making it a great gift for you or a friend! I enjoy reading about tips not only about my appearance, but ways to bring beauty into all aspects of my life. Even if they don't all work for you, you'll walk away with some great new ideas to incorporate into your life. FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabuleux!","review":"Combining simple and natural ideas with stunning photography, Frederic Fekkai has captured the essence of French Stylings.With ideas for each month and season, and more \\"specific\\" daily ideas, A Year in Style truly offers a year of ideas on how to become chic, stylish and live simply.There are a lot of make-up and hair suggestions without mentioning products, which I find useful. I don't like a book to sound like one big advertisement and this doesn't - despite the fact Frederic Fekkai owns two salons and sells a hair care line.His suggestions are more about living in style than obessing with style. It encourages one to relax about beauty and embrace their own inner style. I love that about this book; it's not about conforming which is why this book could only be written by a Frenchman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible of Style","review":"This book is a must-have for anyone who is serious about style and spends a lot of time grooming their looks. Since reading the book, I have darkened my too-blonde hair and thrown out about half of my makeup supply. It is so much easier to just use basic, simple styles and colors to create a unique and timeless look. This book has saved me literally hundreds of dollars in savings from trendy makeup colors and jewelry that I haven't bought since learning his style secrets, not to mention the monthly salon sessions that are now unnecessary. That alone is worth the ...!Additionally, I would highly recommend this book to brides-to-be. The bridal section gives some of the best suggestions I have read for a simple and classic wedding. And the photography tips are invaluable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple elegance!","review":"This is a lovely book with wonderful pictures and a simple, well stated text. Frederic shares his ideas on how you can derive more pleasure from life month by month. Each month he entreats you to embrace the days by taking advantage of what the season has to offer. He encourages simplicity, paring down your wardrobe. Pitching all your lotions and potions and achieve your best look with an easy, daily routine. Inviting the best and forgetting the rest! And he does it well. The book is charming and fun with new ideas to attain a fresh look and punctuated with thoughts on how to enjoy the process! It's well worth the high price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who are not blessed with a natural sense of style","review":"One of my best friends is blessed with a natural and very personal sense of stytle. I'm not. If you are one of these too, this book will be very helpful. Fekkai gives every women wisdom advice on how to be stylish in a simple way. Most of his recomendations are not expensive and the book has not the BUY BUY BUY message the beauty magazines show you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite beauty books","review":"This is a lifestyle book, referencing topics such as makeup, hair, style, food, spa, etc. Timeless advice with a French perspective. This book is set up according to month, with daily tips/ideas listed in the sidebar. Gorgeous pics & the layout is very visually appealing. Makeup looks, such as the \\"natural face\\" or the \\"confident face\\" include pictures and basic instructions but are not step-by step detailed (which also means no diagrams). Makeup (and all other advice) leans toward the super simple. No specific brand-name product recs. Obviously, as this is Frederic Fekkai's book there are a lot of hair related topics (including hair cuts, color, styling, & care).This is one of my favorite books on beauty. I've owned it for years & reach for it every few months just because of the classic advice & beautiful pictures"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and inspirational","review":"This is a very beautiful book. I would recommend anyone who spend money on fashion magazines to spend those money on books like these instead. They are durable and are not ageing as fast as magazines. The book contains many inspirational pictures, and many good tips about style, how to be chic, grooming etc. However, this is not an \\"how to\\"-book. If you look for more detailed tips on how to plan your wardrobe etc., look elsewhereThe book is divided in chapters after the months of the year. Therefore, it is a book you can come back to all the time. It is best enjoyed browsed through with a cup of tea or similar. I especially liked the little notes in the margins - tips on how to make your life more beautiful and chic. Many of them refer to things to buy, but many refer to things that are simple and inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"do we agree to disagree?","review":"I find it hard to believe that we are reviewing the same book! As I perused the pages, its overwhelming message was buy, buy, buy--this product or some other product, to enhance your life. Buying, to my mind, is not simplifying or beautifying one's life, even if the acquisition fits Mr. Fekkai's personal definition of style. Young people, especially, have perhaps gotten the message and seem to think that living well on the earth is a function of consumerism. Just wanted to add this thought: it's more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Platitudes with Attitude","review":"The photography and models are gorgeous -- the format of the book is inviting. Content is another story - I was very disappointed. The author shines a little in his area of expertise - hair styling, but not much. I suppose this world-reknown hair expert is saving the real tips for his paying salon customers. Ditto for skin and beauty \\"tips\\" in this book. The only tip I got from the book was the use of pure shea butter to condition hair. More of this kind of information would have made this book much much better. As for a the subject of style, Mr. Fekkai's overall mantra is \\"less is more\\" (boring) -- except of course, if you're a celebrity or society person -- then you break this rule and Mr. Fekkai still calls it style. The verdict: be beautiful, young/wrinkle-less, thin; wear and decorate with neutral colors and you will be stylish. Being rich and famous doesn't hurt either."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCH A SPIRITED SISTA!","review":"Kia ora koutou katoaAnika Moa is truly a talented and beautiful young vocal, who also shines with a lyrical pen.Her debut album \\"Thinking Room\\", is a work of pure magic and soothes the ear with captivating words.I recommend \\"Youthful\\", \\"Good In My Head\\", \\"Flowers For You\\" and of course the track from American Sweethearts - \\"Falling In Love Again\\".Arohanui"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Who's Who' in Heresy","review":"I bought this book back in the late 70's when I was a new believer, and wanted to know all about the current cults, and what they believe. I recommend this if you want to read a quick overview on the major religions on the scene, many of which you may not be familiar with.It is presented with a bit of humour, but divided into sections, for example christian-based cults and eastern ones. The author briefly describes the background and teachings of religions of the past decades from the christian point of view, and how they stand in light of bible doctrine.Some may have faded from the scene by now, but this is full of interesting history, as many new movements are based on earlier heresies. It is a good idea for God's people to be up on traps being set by the enemy of our souls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legacy, Influence or Heritage...?","review":"Besides all the favorable and enthusiastic critics I read 'bout this recording, I really decided to buy it, first because it's a re-lecture of a Jazz masterpiece we all love it; and second 'cause all these string quartets' crossovers with Jazz and/or Rock --in general-- produces a very good result.And this was not different in this case of the TIQ's \\"A Love Supreme\\": the interpretations are fabulous and delicate, introspective and happy at the same time.I really recommend this CD, not only due this artistic value, but also for those who knows how to appreciate an outstanding recording by Telarc engineers.Only to add another 'hit' to the list, take care about two standard jazz tracks: Monk's 'Round Midnight, and Davis' So What. They're pure delight and pleasure for the ears and the soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This leaked.","review":"I did read the several reviews that stated this leaked but as the majority of people loved this kettle I went ahead and purchased it. Used it once, left it overnight with the remainder of the water in it and the next morning all of the water had leaked through the bottom all over the counter. Not great at all for one of the most expensive kettles here on Amazon. I have a plastic Braun already which has been going strong for over 4 years. This looks great but clearly has design issues. Pain to have to send it back and start again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks after about a year of use.","review":"I bought this kettle because I liked the look of it and I had cheaper versions of Braun kettles before and was happy with them. Apart from the fact the kettle is extremely heavy and gets really hot - it was ok while it was working. Suddenly the connection to the base started working intermittently, i would have to press down on the kettle or rotate it back and forth until the heat indicator would lit up. And eventually it broke completely. Definitely not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after less than 2 years","review":"I've had this kettle for less than 2 years. After reading good reviews, I decided to purchase this kettle because I wanted something that would last with daily use. I disliked it from the beginning. Why? 1) It's heavy. 2) When you open the lid to fill it with water (you shouldn't fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter), water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle. 3) After less than 2 years of use, it is no longer working properly. It constantly switches off during heating. I've had better use from a cheap plastic kettle, and will be going back to using one of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kettle for stainless steel kitchen","review":"I moved into a new home and decided to retire the old white braun kettle. My previous braun provided great service for about 5 years, but my wife, the tea drinker, has worn it out.

I returned it for a new one because I trust the brand and liked the kettle--also thinking it was a fluke. The new pot leaked the second time I used it--even more so than the first. Like an idiot I tried again and purchased my 3rd Braun WK600--again, this one began to leak the second or third time I used it. Their customer sercvice was of no use.

Useful cord storage. Well thought-out features.","review":"Other reviewers have already talked about how good the kettle looks and how fast it boils, and how easy it works.Like to also highlight that you can wind the power cord underneath the base so that you pull out only the necessary length of cord to the wall socket. This is very useful since the power cord is necessarily quite thick (in order to pull in 1500 Watts for that quick boil) and is way too thick and stiff to wrap into a bundle using your regular twist-n-turn wire strips.On top of that, the kettle when sitting on top of the powering base can rotate 360 degrees, so you can place the base anywhere relative to wall socket to reduce exposed cord. The product manual says this should the chance of little kids pulling on the cord or the kettle getting tripped over, but I'm just glad it reduces kitchen clutter.Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, leaks and more leaks","review":"Do not buy this kettle!!!!I've owned one of these kettles for over a year now. I think because this kettle is partly metal and partly plastic, it leaks. I thought at first it was because it was occasionally being overfilled, but that's not the problem.

Very disappointing.I have contacted Braun customer service - let's see what they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks after few months","review":"I wish I had read all the one star reviews before buying this kettle. It worked fine for a few months but then it started leaking onto the heating platform, making it unusable.I do have to say that this apparently is not the only one of this kind that leaks. I have seen another brand that leaked just like it. So it may be industry wide problem. But for a big name brand like Braun to not come up with a solution for an otherwise fine product is simply stupid business practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Leaks","review":"I used to love this electric kettle. It heated water fast, and it seemed solid. At this high price, I expected it to last for 10 years or more (our clothes washer and dryer have lasted over 25 years).

I did like this tea kettle very much and in all this time it has always heated up quickly. However, when one spends the amount of money this kettle is it should last for a long time. Mine started leaking as others have complained. It is leaking at the base where the electric plate is located and it was entirely wet as others have described. It seems to happen on mine when you want more then 2 cups of water. I am replacing it and thought about spending the money and repurchasing this same pot, however, if others are complaining of the same problem - there must be a flaw somewhere and electric and water don't mix well. Therefore, I will purchase another brand. To bad I would have given this pot a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Leaching","review":"It heats up water pretty really fast. The problem is there are plastic rivets (for the handle and water level window) inside of boiling chamber. All plastic leaches, especially with hot liquid.

The glass one is a lot slower, but no leaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, not worth it","review":"Got it about 1 year ago.

He's a vampire. But not your \\"Twilight\\" kind of bloodsucker. He's infected with the \\"Vyrus,\\" and he mostly just taps his victims for a pint or so which he keeps in the fridge. \\"Already Dead\\" is hard-boiled detective fiction, and it works! Some readers will find this a somewhat gruesome read, and, yes, there are a lot of F-bombs that may turn off others. Still, it's a quick and fun journey through an alternate Manhattan that is not only populated by vampires, but also zombies and the occasional wraith. There are currently two more books in this series, and I plan on reading them both. I would also suggest that this title would make a pretty good movie, but I'm not sure which of today's generation of actors could play the lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already Dead was anything but","review":"I really liked the book. Good Read that kept my attention. It was one of my first Kindle books. I downloaded it because it free just too see what Amazon recommended.

The story moved along well, with a relatively gripping plotline (I think I finished the book in a little over a day) and smart-mouthed characters.On the downside, given that the cause of vampirism and zombies is a virus, not some supernatural force, I thought the introduction of the \\"smoke monster\\" (ala \\"Lost\\") was a little over the top. The story would have been better off without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, different take on the vampire!","review":"After reading Charlie Huston's take on the vampire,you will become hooked. No other writer can give that gritty, rough edged bite (pun intended) to the life of a vampire quite the same taste. Joe Pitt is flawed yet retains some semblance of right and wrong which keeps you entranced."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I rushed to buy Already Dead after reading that it is being turned into a film since books are almost always so much better than their celluloid counterparts and all the reviews I read praised it highly. Unfortunately, it just never grabbed me in the way I was hoping. It was well written, was plenty dark -- just how I like my vampire stories, and the characters were well developed; but for whatever reason the story was somewhat offputting. It all seemed too contrived and convoluted. I just never felt a bond with the characters, and by the end I hardly cared what happened. I was just ready for it to be over so I could move on to the next thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style/text formatting leaves it too difficult to get through","review":"I know a lot of people liked this book, but for me: meh. The writer has decided to forgo the basic writing convention of using things like quotation marks (instead using an emdash at the start of what is considered to be someone speaking), identifying the \\"speakers\\" in a conversation, and then jump-cutting to another \\"scene\\" without any sort of physical delimiter to identify that a new scene at a different point in time is now taking place. I actually got the impression that this was used for no other purpose than to appear \\"cool.\\" Instead, it made it extremely difficult to figure who was speaking; this was made even worse when a scene \\"cut\\" to a new point in time in the next sentence and had conversations that had nothing to do with the people speaking just a few sentences earlier. It was so bad I couldn't get through it... and that's saying a lot from a voracious reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Huston fan now!","review":"I stumbled on Already Dead in a used book store (sorry Amazon - I promise, I'll buy the rest of them here!) and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It's not literature, it's just a nice, quick, entertaining read. I love that Charlie Huston puts the vampires back in the dark (no mainstreaming here) and I found the explanation for how they and the \\"shamblers\\" (zombies) came to be very satisfying. It's quick, it's gritty, it's just plain fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and breezy--I'm a fan.","review":"It took me a while to dig into this series. Vampires in Manhattan, sure, I get it, who cares? I should have given Charlie more credit. He was a bartender in NYC so he knows the nightlife and the lowlife. Life in any city is tough, but this city, with odd gangs and the undead running around? Brutal! In thinking about Charlie's stuff, here's the scoop: there's no one better at upping the stakes and escalating. Always escalating. Things are complicated and it seems like there's no hope. That's Charlie's cue: make things worse. Masterful. His books are a pure pleasure to read, Charlie, keep them coming!Ken Coffman is the author of Hartz String Theory and other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are things worse than being dead...","review":"What can happen to you when you're already dead? I mean once you die and wake up to find that it's not the end of your existence, what's to worry about? Well, in Charlie Huston's Already Dead, Joe Pitt finds there are quite a few things worse than being dead and that there are still some things to be afraid of; very afraid. A delicious combination of hard-boiled detective novel and vampire political wrangling, Already Dead moves along at a fast, furious pace that demands to be read in one go. -- see my complete review in Jan 2006 SFRevu.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was free.","review":"This book starts off interesting, but halfway through I was bored out of my mind. The plot became too complicated with random characters and weak connections to events. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it never did. The motivation for the characters were ridiculous, especially concerning the vampire turfs, zombie virus, and incest.Easy to read, yet awful, wretched story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down","review":"Huston's novels have a rhythm and a flow that makes them nearly impossible to put down, and this was no exception. Surprisingly, there's not too many twists on vampire folklore here -- they still need a fairly regular supply of blood, and sunlight is a problem. In rogue-vampyre-cum-problem-solver Joe Pitt's world, Vampyrism is caused by a virus (the Vyrus). Pitt's struggle in this novel is as much with his Vyrus as it is with the people who are trying to control him -- or maybe even kill him. Pitt's supporting Vampyre cast is varied, from the ex-hippie Terry to the businessman Predo to guru Marshall, each approaching Vampyrism in their own unique way. As always, Huston pulls no punches. His writing is gritty and tough and sometimes gory, and you can't always expect a happy ending. He's created a complex, complicated, and dangerous Manhattan for his main character to navigate, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he has in store next for Joe Pitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Finally a Vampire book I can get behind. It is gritty and realistic with an engaging murder mystery. I particularly liked the realist take in the vampire vyrus, instead of mystic reasons for vampires it is a vyris that can be transmitted that gives them their vampiric traits. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays on the iphone for re-read","review":"I never really warmed up to Raymond Chandler books, but loved the Bogie movie versions -- Joe Pitt (the hero/PI/vampyre) is a great updated version of Sam Spade including the nice chick, the bad dame, the mix ups of friends and foes.I had a good chuckle at the chandler-esque word games and was thoroughly enthralled by the story. I feel like I want to read more about Joe and his world - I would even consider paying for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I picked up the book for free on my Kindle. I had never heard of the author. But, you can't beat free as a price. As a 48 year old man, I'm a long time fan of vampires and vampire movies and not really the demographic for the Twilight series.The main character is a Vampyre. But, he's also a private detective and the story is about his detective work. The book is most definitely for \\"mature\\" audiences as it is liberally sprinkled with graphic sex and violence, and the f-bomb. But, the characters are interesting and there is plenty of action. The author does a great job of explaining how the Vyrus works and the rules of the Vampyre world and the various clans they have formed in New York City.After reading this book, I will definitely pick up the other Joe Pitt (the lead character) books by Charlie Huston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead on!","review":"The author deserves credit for weaving together a character Joe Pitt, who is a combination of Humphrey Bogart, Harrison Ford, and...well, name your favorite vampire.What I enjoyed about the book was the question of what it means to live, and what it means to die, as brought out by a clan of ascetic vampyres who gain super powers by remaining on the verge of death. Then, the plot brings about those same kinds of powers in our hero.I am somewhat averse, though, to novels in which some mastermind seems to know exactly what the protagonist will do and when he'll do it, so that all things fall together just exactly as they were \\"supposed to.\\" This happens with the leader of the Enclave in this book, and it takes away from the balance of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is what a noir vampire novel outta be!","review":"A good twist on the vampire-PI theme. The noir-ish elements are well done. The dialogue is great! The protagonist is perfect: definitely not a good guy but holding on to some imperfect bit of humanity.

The book is well written with a variety of characters. I would recommend this book but the only thing that puzzles me is when I got to the end I felt incomplete. I don't know if I was so wrapped up that it would just keep going on or what but this should become a series. I loved the characters and ideas behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Horrible, but certainly not great","review":"I read a comment that this author made in a New York Times article on the Kindle. That in turn led me to discover this on the Amazon store (at the time, the Kindle edition of Already Dead was free as a teaser). While the author was grousing in the article about the publisher \\"giving his work away for free,\\" I can't help but come away from the reading experience thinking that the book was worth about what I'd paid for it.The plot was formulaic, and the characters difficult to empathize with. For what it's worth, I'd give this one a pass, despite the curious mixing of genres the author managed to achieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. It's an engaging fast paced story with great dialogue. The whole story fits together neatly and everything falls into place at the end.However, I do have one complaint, and that's with the formatting. This book has no chapter breaks, and there's no quotation marks around the spoken parts. I assume that's the author's style since the printed version seems to match the Kindle version. But please, at least put in a line break between the chapters. It's very jarring to have a sudden scene/chapter shift with nothing to indicate the break. There were many times that I had to back up and reread parts to find where the break occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked","review":"This story just didn't grab me. The concept of this story was good but the delivery fell short. I only finished this book because I had nothing better to read.

The one gripe that I have with the book is the use of dash marks in place of quotation marks. Conversations tend to run into descriptions and at times I had to re-read pages. And what is the deal with it not having chapter? Or any type of break between changes in scenery or time of day. One second you are in a basement during the day and then next sentence you are at a payphone at night?Pain in the rear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Already Dead created a Fan","review":"I became a Charlie Huston fan after reading this book. I originally looked for it due to an interview with Stephen King that I'd recently read. The interviewer asked what he was reading and he named this novel. I figured if it was good enough for King (whom I love), then I should give the author a try. Absolutely loved it. The main character is a fantastic mix of street-wise thug and a world-weary vampire. The unconventional way Huston expresses dialog without the use of \\" marks actually makes the books flow better for me. I went on to purchase the rest of the series and enjoyed them all. The connection with the characters is very well done and I struggled to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"This is one of the first books I put on my new Kindle, and I chose it for both its good reviews and the price ($0.00 at the time). It was basically a free reading tryout for my Kindle. I had never read Charlie Huston before. I really didn't think I'd like it, since my vampire days ended way back with Anne Rice. I was pleasantly surprised. It was quirky, fun and very entertaining. The vamps were not as deeply serious as Anne Rice's, and not as romantically silly as the Twilight entourage. Just a few days in the life of your average, big city working-stiff vampire. I had a little trouble at first with the layout of the book - there was none. No paragraphs, no quotation marks for speech, etc. Maybe this was just a glitch in the free version. In any case, I got used to it, and was glad I read it.

After mostly stellar reviews on this book, I decided to give it a try. I have to say I was really really disappointed. The language is dry and simplistic, the plot was getting predictable, and the whole \\"average Joe turned vampire/detective\\" routine was just plain stupid. The character concept for Joe is just both hard to believe and not all that unique. Its like they took your average crime show detective that \\"goes by his own rules\\" that you see on every network and made him a vampire... The vampires are not even all that special, except that Huston explains that he's a vampire because of a virus... hurrayIf you really like detective novels and really like vampires, then maybe you will enjoy this.

Each person gives you two or three pages about reading Zap in the 1960s or hanging out with Crumb. I got bored hearing the same tale over and over. Two chapters stand out: Crumb's ex-wife Dana and Roger Ebert. The Crumb artwork in the middle of the book looks nice, but most of it is excerpted from longer stories.

Thank \\"God\\" I got it from the Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly thoughtful journey of self-discovery","review":"Answered Prayers by acclaimed romance author Danielle Steel is the compelling story of Faith Madison and Brad Patterson, two childhood friends who are each caught up in the midst of unhappy marriages and who correspond by e-mail. Gradually Faith and Brad find the courage to take necessary (albeit painful) steps in their lives that they never dared to take before. Answered Prayers is highly recommended as a truly thoughtful journey of self-discovery and reaching out to embrace life. The large print format is ideal for readers who vision requirements necessitates an easy-to-read font size."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I agree with Kristi of the U.S. It was a good story line but not believeable, pretty bland, but mostly I got aggravated with the repitition. I guess you fill pages that way and make a lot of money but it's not fair to the readers. I was glad when it was over and sorry I paid full price for this hard-back book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly book","review":"This book is in the heap of Danielle's worst. It goes on and on while the characters are never fully developed. There is very little backround as to what makes the characters tick, you just have to guess.I was amused by Faith's \\"praying\\" she always found an open church and she \\"prayed\\" although her personal life showed none of the religion she is supposed to have. She was supposedly so devout, but she never taught Sunday School, sang in the chior, cleaned up, gave to the collection, helped in the nursery, visited a shut in. She just \\"prayed\\" and left. Ms. Steele wrote about a classic \\"pew potato\\" who took her faith off with ther church clothes. This book needed a lot of work before it should have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Boring, repetitive, predictable. Definitely not one of her best novels. Faith's brother Jack was brought up over and over again, so often in fact that while I was listening(book on tape) I thought several times that I had accidentally rewound it or put the same tape back in instead of a new one.Nothing unusual here. Old friendship rekindled,both are in unhappy marriages but they are only friends, both marriages break down and WHAM they find out they are actually in love. How boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a big Danielle Steel fan and have read all of her books, but this one was very disappointing. There was nothing happy or upbeat about it, nor was it very creative. It was somewhat depressing and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"DS goes up and down, this one is down. Faith is such a wuss I lost all interest in her 1/2way throught the book. It is a throwback plot to the fifties--what middle aged man today would have such a strong reaction to an innocent little desire to go back to law school? Get real. Boring, dreary, and the emails do get horribly boring. And for such a pious little wimp that Faith is made out to be, she sure doth cusseth a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!!","review":"This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read. I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book. I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through. This one has gotten on my last nerve. I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable. But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books. It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I found this book predictable and lacking any real surprise.

This droaned on and on repeating the same thing over and over again. This book could have covered the same story in 100 pages or less if things like her horrible childhood and how she deserved to be treated badly by everyone weren't repeated in every chapter.I have only read a few Steel books but this one is almost exactly like the last one I read (The Dating Game)with a middle aged man divorcing the perfect, beautiful wife after 20 plus wonderful years to run off with some young tart.Faith made me ill. Did women ever, even in the 1930's, let their husband treat them like that!Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"This book has way too much repeating of information in it. On each page the author seems to keep telling us the same thing over and over again like the reader is going to forget something from page to page.It also has a very predictable plot.

Due to that, every can was dented so badly, I was unable to place the can on any flat surface without it falling over, or the top of the can was dented outwards that the pull tab broke off while attemping to open it. I wound up using a hammer to flatten out the dent on the bottom and/or using pliers to remove the entire pull tab. They also could not be stored standing up in the refrig.After drinking the first can I immediately did not care very much for its taste. It had a flavor that is difficult to describe...not fruity, but more like a funny bubble gum taste, and it did not provide any energy, at least not to me.I purchased this product a few months ago and I still have about fifteen (15) \\"dented\\" cans remaining.I highly recommend that anyone makes an attempt to purchase and try one (1) can before purchasing an entire case of twenty-four (24)."},{"rating":"2","title":"From One Roller Derby Queen to another","review":"weather you play the sport or not this is a must read for strong, confident women everywhere.

You do have to be careful to keep up with all the pieces as the apples are tiny and easily lost, but overall its a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ending to the series","review":"The Perfect Kiss was a good ending to the series about the Merridew sisters. Grace poses as a travelling companion to help a friend trying to get out of a forced betrothal. She meets Dominic Wolfe, her friend's \\"intended\\" and thus begins the story. I love reading books about heroines that are helpful to others, those that change the lives of those in need - Grace did this to the neighbors of Dominic Wolfe. I also enjoyed Dominic - he was trying his hardest to be cold and hard-hearted, but he found himself caring for others, usually without realizing he was doing it. The story between Grace and Dominic was very sweet and I loved that the author brought Grace's family in at the end of the book and how they looked out for her. Sigh...I've really loved spending time with the Merridew sisters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the Reviewers","review":"Most said that the book stinks, but I ignored them because I didn't want the series to end.

I should have quit w/Perfect Stranger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one...","review":"I loved the other books in the series. This one, however is not good at all. The hero is a lout. Kissing what he thought was a servant girl while she is asking for help for her friends who are stuck in an overturned carriage, during a violent storm? Please, spare me! I couldn't find one redeeming quality in this guy. I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I have never written an online review before, but was so disgusted with \\"The Perfect Kiss\\", that I had to weigh in. I am an avid fan of the Regency period and was astonished at the utter lack of knowledge displayed by Anne Gracie. She completely disregards all the rules and etiquette of the time period. Her heroine Grace Merridew and hero Dominic Wolfe are rotten people who deserve eachother. This book has the distinction of being one of a handful I have been unable to finish.There are many good regency romances, but this is one of the worst!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Kiss","review":"Loved the series.Didn't get much work done last week, no thanks to Ann Grace. Once I started the first book, I read the week away until I finished the last. I loved the characters. Rich and vivid. Heart wrenching story of survival and perseverance.My only small critique is for the lengthy backstory. It was repetitive at times and lost some of it's emotion as the series progressed. I would have preferred less inner reflection for more actual dialogue between characters to deliver some necessary information for the backstory. That suggestion based on my sincere adoration for Ann Grace's wit that she delivers so skillfully through all her characters dialogue.Over all I highly recommend the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received hardcover when description clearly said paperback","review":"I purchased this book from Amazon because it was cheaper to purchase a paperback through here than from my school bookstore. I was very disappointed to receive a hardcover book. The description of the book I was ordering clearly stated that it was paperback.

He plays with certainty and strength and makes even the more sedate parts shine and I think his impassioned interpretations during the Bruch and Wienawski are exciting.

Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world....?","review":"First off, let me just say I've been a huge fan of this man since the first Bauhaus record. I've seen him 4 times and have loved most all of his work-until now. This album lacks melody, rhythm and sincerity. Has Murphy become Sting? Honestly, I have listened to this over and over and I just don't get it. What happened? After Dust, I thought he had gone back to being the innovator again. What a disappointment. Please come back Pete!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The poster child for not smoking","review":"I've been a Murphy fan since his Bauhaus days. The 'adult contemporary' stylings of the new album aren't a surprise; he's been edging that way for some time now.My big gripe is the fact that his voice ... well, it has gotten worse over time. There are points on this album where I was cringing at his singing, a thought unthinkable back in his glory days when he could rival Bowie for most incredible vocals. I'm not a psycho anti-smoking zealot, but it's clear that his taste for fags has ruined his voice. On the plus side, at least he didn't feel the need to Pro-Tools his voice to death as some artists have chosen to do.If it was anybody else, I'd probably give it one star, but I still harbor fond feelings for Murphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst EVER!!!","review":"I have enjoyed Peter since the beginning, what a joke!

That is why this record is such a disappointment. Everything from the lyrics to the instrumentation to the arrangments and production seem to indicate that Murphy has given up trying to be artistic, creative and musical and has decided to just make a buck. Make no mistake, he still has the greatest voice around (which is why I give two stars instead of one), but a great voice singing factory-made pop junk is not much of a prize. If you are new to Murphy, buy the Bauhaus catalog and some of the early PM records, from back when he still gave a damn. Or buy \\"Dust\\", which is as creative as this record is dull. Unshattered is, I'm afraid, just more disposable pop from the hit-making machine of the commercial recording industry. Instead of two stars, I'd like to give this a rating of \\"Yawn\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooof.","review":"A huge disappointment. Though a fan of most of Murphy's music, I'm no slavish devotee and I'm open to changes of direction. My thoughts: This album lacks genuine enthusiasm. is uninspiring and, well, dull.

I've never had a physics class, but after a bit of googling I think I have the gist of it. I really don't find the book hard to follow, but it's a VERY slow read.

I found myself digging up old journals and reliving years of P/P/P in Breckenridge. Todd Richards is in the unique situation of having been involved in every generation of snowboarding so far, and at the forefront of most of these.

There are more than 5,000 Transformers fans out there and those 5,000 Box sets should've been gone on the very first days or so, if not the first few weeks at the most. No just that, IF there were indeed only 5,000 Box sets made, they must've come with a certificate of authenticity or at least something that said \\"copy 1,500 of 5,000\\" for example. None of that came with it. Another thing about the \\"signature\\", according to Michael Bay himself on this video: [...] he says he \\"signed\\" all 5,000 of them. If you look at his video you can very well see his actual signature. All of them match. The one that comes with the Box set doesn't even come close to his actual signature. I love the Transformers franchise, I really do. I just don't like being ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell did you send me!!!","review":"I bought the box set and was unable to watch any of them.

I would strongly advise Amazon to contact the discs manufacturers to stop attaching cellophane tape on the blu ray discs, they ain't gonna fall off as its in the BOX!?

The movie is about a filmmaker who wants to make a documentary about crime in Mexico City and discovers that some of the crime is being done by corrupt policemen.

The movie suffers from the way the story unfolds, teetering between a weak drama and a silly comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement...","review":"We bought this for storage of items while on the go as well as a seat protector from our toddler kicking the back of the seat. I could tell when I took the product out of the package it wasn't the best quality but we figured it would do the trick. When my husband went to install it he said the strap at the top that secures it around the headrest should have had more velcro so it would be easier to attach. He ended up wrapping it around several times until it lined up. With in the first week of having it the big pocket in the middle ripped, the stitching was very poor quality and with my toddler rubbing her feet on it a couple times it didn't last long at all. So now it has a ripped pocket that we can't use. Next time I will spend a little extra money to get a better quality item. One more thing...I have found that most of the mesh pockets are so small that I can't get much to fit in them. Small toys, sippy cups etc do not fit.

Adventure scifi is my favorite and Dickson excels in creating mini worlds, plots and characters that are believable and great fun. Each story offers hope for humanity in the millenia to come. I highly recommend this book.I only wish Baen Publishing would stop the annoying habit of placing horrific cover art on their books.

I hated it, and that is very rare for me. So much of the book seems to be just filler. Roland makes connections without foundation between events. He thinks about what has happened, and decides that certain events are related. He is right, of course, but it does not flow. Alchemy is a foolish excuse for a book.

If you are a Scientology staff member for very long, eventually you will see this book, either in this form, or a photo copy. This is the book that they use to train all staff on how to hard-sell Scientology services and materials to the masses. This is one of the few books that LRH mentioned and liked so its now permanently part of their teachings. It is a very short and crappy sales book. It is very basic and does not have many examples or techniques. Thousands of Scientologists all over the world have been drilled on the techniques in this book. Don't waste your money, just get a more modern sales book that is more well known and has more and better examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"You eventually get used to it...","review":"I picked this book up because I heard that her previous book was well written. Once you get used to the fact that the book is written from 8 different people's perspectives, it's a pretty good read. However, it takes 20 pages or so to get used to it. I thought that the character's narratives brought the individuals to life (even if I did want to strangle some of them for their behavior).The main story is about Lavinia and Maude's relationship for the 10 years between the deaths of Queen Victoria and her son King Edward. The story starts when they are 5 and ends when they are 14 or 15. Throughout this time, many things change in their worlds that they have to adjust to.I would highly recommend this book. It is a very fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dark","review":"This book started out very slow and was alittle too dark. Although it did pick up halfway through when Kitty got involved with the woman's right to vote movement, I can't say that I would recommend anyone to buy it. I think if the focused less on the cemetary and funeral rituals and focused more on the people in the book and the relationship between Kitty and Richard it would have been a better book. The Girl with the Pearl Earring was definately beter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet masterpiece","review":"This is the sort of novel that stays with you for years, coming back to haunt as ideas and perceptions change in your own life. Set in the years between the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 and that of her son, King Edward VII in 1910, it reflects the early but rapid transformation of culture as seen in marriage, crime, the upbringing of girls and the dawning of feminine awareness. Tracy Chevalier's remarkable talent and craft are clearly evident in this early work, and it includes (as I remember) a chapter which is only one sentence long, but cuts through you like a knife. I highly recommend it not only for fans of historical fiction, but to any reader who appreciates the discovery of a unique, fresh voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the Boat, Missed a Century.","review":"Actually it was rather like going down with James Cameron's Titanic. I found this book very disappointing and contrived. The stories unbelievable and exposed every metaphor used in soap operas and movies. I was sorry to see so much time wasted on writng such a misguided book. Tracy completely missed the idealisms and feminism in turn of the century England. It played out more like Sex and the City.A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bunch of cliches","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that the constant switching of narrators led to confusion and that the characters are not well developed or interesting. The characters are all cliches. There's the oblivious father, the neglecting mother, the prudish, disaproving neighbor ... And as another reviewer pointed out, the lesson seems to be that women who dare to have interests outside the house will necessarily neglect their families and will pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Victorian-era Fiction","review":"I love the way this book is written. Each chapter is from alternating characters' points of view (very much like Poisonwood Bible but not as tedious). The language is succinct but beautiful and quite descriptive of Victorian England, which I adore! I really could not put it down... Brava to Chevalier! The ending is VERY sad though. Be prepared. I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars, but 4 will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid sense of period","review":"Whether she is writing about 17th century painters or the late Victorian obssesion with mourning, Tracy Chevalier subtly and accurately portrays the lives and times of the characters she creates.

Totally uneventful until the end--and then bad things happen to the only characters you can actually like! The constant change of voice was too choppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so disappointed with this novel. I loved \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" and felt this didn't even come close. While some of the historical detail was interesting, this story wasn't at all captivating. I even started to feel I should have paid less for this book since half the pages are blank and others are only a paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Angels: a 1900s Soap Opera","review":"The problem with writing a great first novel is that the second is bound to disappoint. And Falling Angels certainly does. My fondness of Girl With a Pearl Earring compelled me to fight the impulse of putting Falling Angels down when I felt I couldn't take another minute. While the author did an amazing job of relating the story through numerous narrators, the story itself was not compelling. Picture Days of Our Lives in the 1900s and you've got a pretty good sense of what Falling Angels is about. Don't buy the book. If you want my copy, you can have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading Girl with the Pearl ear ring I expected a good read. This was choppy, jumping from one character to another, difficult to follow at times, and the ending seemed forced. One character did elicit sympathy, but you don't inside any of the men to understand them. Our entire book group felt let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on Symbolism, Light on Intrigue","review":"I had high expectations at the beginning of this novel, but I found it very disappointing. The characters never quite take flight and become real. While each chapter is supposedly voiced by a different character, if you didn't read the headings, you'd hardly notice the differences in style. Lavinia and Simon are flat and cartoonish. Kitty and Maude are almost interesting, but the most compelling characters (Jenny and Richard) are given cameo appearances. The pace of the book is very uneven, and I grew weary of all the heavy-handed symbolism and unbelievable coincidences. After the tedious parade scene, the crime almost seemed thrown in to generate some drama. I really wanted to like this book but it simply didn't capture my interest or the excitement of the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls flat","review":"I agree with a few others here, it imparts a limited sense of the struggle for the vote, but the story itself is flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"The story lags, the characters are not as interesting. If you liked The Girl with the Pearl Earring and The Virgin Blue, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I truly enjoyed Falling Angles, but then again I've enjoyed just about everything I've read by Tracy Chevalier. It's a sweet book about 2 very different girls growing up in 2 very different environments. The book takes a grim turn, but it works. The most unique aspect of the book is that it is written in each characters voice. You get a look into everyone's head. A nice change from what I am used to reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Follow Up","review":"I was excited to read Tracy Chevalier's second book after loving \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" so much. In \\"Girl,\\" so much was left unsaid, and the writing was to tight-- but lyrical at the same time -- that Chevalier painted her characters with subtlety and grace. Not to mention that the story itself was fascinating.In \\"Falling Angels,\\" she takes a sledgehammer to everything she presented in \\"Girl.\\" Instead of subtlety, she hits you over the head with everything again and again, in case you didn't get something the first time. The characters are unsympathetic and irritating, the dialogue is totally unbelievable, and, frankly, the story is Boring with a capital B. Graves? Little girls becoming friends over a grave? Huh? It may be historically accurate, but I yawned my way through this and vowed to never again buy another of her books. She should have paid less attention to her research and more attention to the actual story and its characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish Tracy Chevalier Wrote More!","review":"I loved Girl With a Pearl Earring and this book is as good or better. It started out slowly and I wasn't sure if I liked the writing device used of switching character viewpoint, but it turned out to be hugely involving. Smart, heartfelt, wonderful writing -- if only she were more prolific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I was extremely impressed by this novel. I went into it thinking it was going to be another adultry novel that affects the family but it wasn't. There was lies and deceit and broken vows but that's only half of the excitement in this book. It's got twists and turns that you will only \\"think\\" you see coming when in fact, what you thought was going to happen is replaced by something far more innovative. This book will remind you what true love is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point of this book!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Girl but this book left me asking \\"why?\\". It was depressing and a waste of time. It gave me bad dreams the night that I finished the book. Disfunction, neglect, infidelity, need I go on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing second effort","review":"I very much liked Girl with a Pearl Earring. The writing was restrained and displayed an authentic voice. But Falling Angels was a disappointment--I realised after about 60 pages that I had no real interest in the story or characters, all of whom came across like twentieth-century retreads of Edwardian stereotypes. So I skipped to the end to see what narrative point all of the build-up had been heading to--pretty predictable stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting historical tidbits, but....","review":"...boring and depressing.Love the history, but I couldn't get into it. It was slower than sludge. Nothing happening of interest. And five-year-old kids just don't talk that way. Much too adult in conversational content. Can't buy it--literaly or figuratively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good period novel","review":"When I first opened this book and realized that it was written in so many different voices, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to follow the story or not. However, once I got past the first two pages, I realized how well Ms. Chevalier was able to bring each of the characters to life just by letting us see their thoughts and dialogues one at a time. The book certainly opens with a bang and doesn't disappoint all the way through. While I don't think this is as superb as The Girl With The Pearl Earring, it is still well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling Angels","review":"Falling Angels is about life at the beginning of the twentieth century. The lives of 2 middle class families are brought together by their two daughters and a gravediggers son who met in the cemetery and made friends with a 'naughty boy',the gravediggers son and all are frequently drawn to the cemetery for a variety of reasons. The novel is intriguingly written as each character writes what they Are thinking. The novel touches on ? wife swapping, paedophilia, adultery and more without mentioning these words but leaving it to the imagination. Tie all this up with the suffragette movement and it makes a compelling read. I wish each of these things had been pursued further but maybe the novel was all the better for that not being so. When I finished the book I realised a beautiful love story of forbidden love had been told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is a story that takes place in a graveyard and that's exactly where this book belongs. After reading a flurry of good books, my good run came to an end with this disaster. The characters were stale, the narrative kept switching from person to person which could have been interesting but instead perpetuated the slow movement of the already snail paced plot. My biggest gripe was...WHO CARES? The novel was devoid of soul and leaves the reader without interest for the characters. Someone died and I barely blinked. Her historical perspective was poor as well, the setting was too weak to transport the reader to that era. I don't know why I finished this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failing Angels","review":"I loved \\"Pearl Earring\\", and was looking forward to this book also. I am sorely disappointed; the writing is sophomoric, the characters are surfacely drawn, and basically, it's a silly story, that evokes the question, Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I very much enjoyed Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Lady and the Unicorn, Remarkable Creatures, and to a lesser extent, Burning Bright. However, Falling Angels is my least favorite Tracy Chevalier novel so far. The ending gave me a nightmare! Here I am, up at 3:00 AM writing this review, if that's a clue. The last third of the novel takes off in a direction that seems to come out of nowhere. The tragedies towards the end are very upsetting. Dark or grim novels are OK by me if they are done right (Sarah Waters does \\"dark\\" well). This one seemed to be grim for the sake of shock value, or because the author needed something to stir up the final chapters. On the plus side, I learned a lot about Victorian cemeteries and mourning practices, as well as the suffrage movement in London during the early 20th century. However, I wish I'd not read the whole novel. Now I'm off to have a warm milk or something to get to sleep..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"If you would like to learn about the life of women at the beginning of the millenium - read this book. I think a good \\"go-with\\" is The Awakening by Kate Chopin. She writes of the same era but - her book was written at that time.

How do I get the book. Exchange?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational yet disappointing","review":"My husband brought this book home to me one afternoon upon the recommendation of our local bookstore. At first blush I was very surprised they would recommend this particular book. The plot revolves around a cemetary after all. Kind of morbid (I wondered what he was trying to tell me). I will tell you that there are good points and bad points to this piece of literature. The last few years I have seen an increase in the style of writing I will call character jumping ... a couple of pages from the point of view of, or about, a certain character. Then jumping onto another. Truthfully, it drives me crazy! This book is particularly guilty of that. Writing in this way doesn't allow for strong character development. On the positive side, I learned a great deal about this particular time in history and enjoyed that. I haven't read her first book, but if it is written in the same style, I'm not sure I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen Angels","review":"I picked up this book after reading \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" (one of my favorite books--truly wonderful!). I also enjoyed Fallen Angels, but it seemed almost not finished...i wish there was a sequel! I kept on wondering if anything would happend between Simon and Maude later (i realize there are strong class barriers, but, nonetheless, since Maude is so forward thinking, who knows what could have happened?)...and four years down the road from the end of the novel WW1 would begin...it just makes me wonder how this would affect the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look at a distant time","review":"This book is highly intriguing and deftly written--not as much so as \\"Girl With the Pearl Earring\\", but I look upon that as something a writer is likely to produce once in a lifetime.

This DVD does contain a few confusing moments (Stevie Wonder etc) which I would attribute to limited rehearsal time, understandable, given the logistics of getting all these 'giants' in one place, but this is sheer genius and Stanley shines like the star he is. I had tears of joy watching this and believe no bassplayer or musician should not have a copy. Do yourself a favour and witness what positivity humanity is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappontment!","review":"the dvd is too short with music content. The songs are edited and even the Lenny White song is excluded from the dvd even though it is listed on the cover. I have been a Stanley Clarke fan since the RTF days and was waiting patiently for this release but I guess I would need to wait some more to see if there will ever be something release from Stanley that is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing C# Reference","review":"I have found this book to be a very disappointing C# reference. The scope of the book is very large, but it doesn't seem to give adequate coverage of much of anything. Time and again I have gone to this book looking for a specific piece of information only to be disappointed. Other sections of the book are very poorly written. For example, in the section on exception handling, they state correctly that exceptions shouldn't be used to break out of for or while loops, and then proceed with an example that does just that. I think the author's could have invested a little more time and effort in coming up with a better example of using exceptions. Instead of buying this book, you're much better off saving your money and just using the MSDN documentation pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I have only reached the 250 pages on this book, I would say this is by far the best C# book that I own.

I would at least like a little more discussion of the implications and applications of key theorems but this book has nothing except a brief statement and proof of some key theorems and then a bunch of exercises.Any help, understanding or discussion of the topics or theorems I get is from web resources. There may not be a lot of geometry texts at the college level, but this is basically useless.

I'm thrilled to be able to order it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad and touching tale","review":"The Last Algonquin is a sad but heartwarming story about a man and his attempts to come to grips with his place in the world. The fact that this man, Joe Two Trees, is the last of his tribe of the Algonquin's makes his journey that much harder and more interesting. If you are looking for an official history of the American Indians, this isn't the book for you. However, if you are looking for a deep and touching story of one American Indian, and what we as a nation have lost by ignoring the heritage of American Indians, then you will enjoy this book. Mr. Kazimiroff has done an excellent job of preserving the story given to him by his father and keeping the memory of Joe Two Trees and the Algonquin Indians alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"This was a gift for a Gaither Band and Mark Lowry fan.

Gavin loves the music and singing and I love the great Barney themes. He teaches the importance of manners, playing nice with others, and more! There are 19 Barney songs throughout the DVD, with my favorite \\"Clean Up.\\" Honestly, Barney is not one of my favorites to watch, but he does teach good values and the music is catchy. It is also cute because the DVD begins with Baby Bop forgetting her manners, and Barney teaches the importance of being polite. I think this DVD would be great for kids as young as 1 years old and it is basically a great collection of Barney favorites. It is 65 minutes long which I think is just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and soulful beats to great intelligent lyrics.","review":"I saw Zebda at Esparrago festival in Jerez,Spain.

During the first half, a small tear developed where the backpack straps meet the body of the bag. It didn't look bad enough that it would cause a problem on the rest of the trip. However, when I loaded the seat for the return trip to the airport, the zipper broke making it impossible to close the bag, and thus rendering the bag incapable of holding the seat. Which made life with all of our luggage, plus a seat that I now had to somehow carry, very difficult indeed.Note that this bag was only used transporting the seat to/from the airport, it wasn't like it was mistreated in checked luggage or something. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough","review":"I wish the carrying bag was made as strong as the car seat, but unfortunately, it's not. I've now gone through 2 of these, each one has only made for part of a trip and died. The first bag had the shoulder strap holder tear loose from the bag while in the security, the second bag had the seams bust apart in two locations and the zipper pulled off the track.For those interested I managed to salvage some portability of the unit by purchasing a luggage strap from target and using it to strap the folding seat closed. Then I used one of the shoulder straps from the case and fastened it to the the nylon eyelets one side of the chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I only traveled a 2 1/2 hour flight. When I went to pick up the car seat from the belt, the handle broke. The bag kept in place but without the handle what's the use. I can't imagine if I was going across Europe or wanted to use this more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly great car seat - TERRIBLE CARRYING CASE","review":"I wish Sunshine Kids had put as much thought into their carrying case as they did the Radian Car Seat. It seems someone miscalculated the measurements of the car seat when creating the cover. The cover is made to fit so very snuggly that it takes my husband standing on the folded car seat while we wiggle it into the case...and forget putting the rear-facing base in the case - they simply didn't expect you take that along. The car seat has traveled with us on about 8 trips (16 flights) and the bag is already pulling apart at the seams. If you bought the folding car seat, just go buy a duffle bag with wheels to travel with the car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, but did not hold up to travel!","review":"Purchased 2 of these bags to go with the carseats for a recent trip...after one flight and on the way to the gate of our connecting flight one of the straps ripped out of the bag, rendering the backpack useless, but we were able to hook it to a different side and use as a shoulder bag for the rest of the trip. On the return trip the zipper pull pulled all the way off of the other bag, and I had to rip the zipper apart to get the carseat out.When these worked the backpack option was great, made carrying two carseats through security and the airport almost a breeze. BUT they did not seem to be made luggage quality to hold up to the rigors of travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but poort quality","review":"I like the idea of carrying your carseat on your back in a backpack, but this product is not well-designed. Even after my husband and I folded our Radian 65 down completely we had a very difficult time fitting it in this bag--it was as if the bag were designed for a different seat. The zipper broke as we were trying to get the carseat into the airport. We ended up having the airline put our seat in a plastic bag and checking it with our luggage. We threw this bag away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bag is the worst","review":"Yes I have a radian 65. First trip with this bag, seam broke at the airport. Strap broke within a few hours. Company did send us a new one but I don't anticipate it will be any different. And we followed all instructions. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a duffle instead","review":"We've been through three of these for the two Radian seats we own. Not one of them has has lasted more than two uses before a seam rips or a zipper breaks. The fit is impossibly tight and if you don't get the seat in perfectly, the zipper will not close without breaking. I finally bought a couple of $12 duffels at Target which did the job and look much sturdier. To quote another reviewer, \\"Nice idea... terrible quality\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form-fitting nightmare","review":"While I looked for this product exhaustively and was so excited to find it, I'm sorry that I spent the extra $60 now (I had to buy 3). This product is form-fitting and has no markings or instructions to tell you which way it fits over the car seat. If, like me, you just think you can tug the zipper up over the carseat, you'll find that you are not only wrong, but you'll blow the zipper and the seam, leaving you with nothing. Skip it and just check the carseat in with your luggage if your taking it on travel...."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LOW QUALITY--DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"The first time we used this on a short 2-hour flight one of the backpack straps broke off, making it a lot harder to carry. The second time we used it, the other one broke off along with one of the zippers.

Bought the seat, bought the bag.... bag riped on our second use. Called the customer service, asked for a replacement bag within a week before our next trip. Said it would be mailed. No bag arrived 3 days prior to our departure and called again, and got the run around that they couldn't ship it as their office was moving. I asked why it wasn't shipped before their 'so called move' when we initially called and got no answer. (BTW, how hard is it to throw something in the mail?). We left lugging the thing through the airport by hand. Worthless customer serivce! Buyer beware. I wish there was an option for -5stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still undecided on this one","review":"We ordered this seat carrying case for our cross counry trip. The very first time we put our son's seat in it, the seam ripped and the whole side was exposed. When we checked it to board our flight we removed the straps like you would any other piece of luggage and upon return to us, the place where the clip to the strap fits in was ripped off. We have requested a replacement case but have not used it yet. If it is anything like our first experience, I would not recommend this product. It is a good idea and I can see how this could be a nice way to transport this rather heavy seat, but I think they should re-design how they reinforce the stitching around the strap clips and the edging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic (cont'd)","review":"I was specifically referring to the Tchaikovsky in my comments below, though the Sibelius is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This has to be one of my favorite CDs. Peter Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto has to be one of my favorite pieces by the violin, and Jean Siblius does a great job on his too. Isaac Stern does a great job, making only one mistake in the third movement of the Tchaikovsky piece. As always, Eugene Ormandy does a great job conducting his Philadelphia Orchestra. I find this an almost perfect replica of what Peter Tchaikovsky and Jean Sibelius pictured when they composed their pieces. This is a very good price considering that I have seen it in bookstores for [a lot more]...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Illustrations","review":"This is a fairly traditional telling of the classic story, though I don't remember two pigs being eaten and the wolf landing in a pot of boiling water. The (uncredited) writing is fluid and well paced, but Aurelius Battaglia's illustrations make this a great book. The detailed pictures, laid out in panel style (a la comic strips) are vivid and humorous. The sequences showing the wolf getting ready to blow down the houses are particularly imaginative and funny. 29 pages, with lots of pictures, and a subtle message about the rewards of hard work and brick. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too high brow for me","review":"I kept waiting a story to unfold or stories to unfold with some interconnecting theme. I was still waiting after half a dozen snippets out of different people's lives each unremarkable lasting 2-5 minutes each. Then I became plain irritated by two bimbos filmed through the front window of their car as they sung along to some brainless pop music because this scene went on and on. Then I cheated and read the reviews to see if it would get better because the plot bloomed. Alas the other reviews also claim this is a film dealing in abstractions. Call me too straight to get this film but there should be a way to make the free-radicals/ abstractions into mini vignettes rather than panning the camera at people engaging in busy mundane ways; it is inane."},{"rating":"1","title":"very familiar......very disappointing","review":"There used to be a sense of \\"must have\\" with these Hottest 100 compilations...but this has been destroyed in the last couple of years.

It seems that it is the main point of these books to confuse you on basic concepts, then not tell you anything that you really need to know to certify.

The material is extremely dry and presented in a non-user friendly way. There are few graphics, no color, and no stories about how to apply concepts to real life.

That way you can really test thing like replication, RIS, sites and so forth.Also it is a good move to get the Windows 2000 Resource kit (also available on Amazon), it will help you allot with preparing for the exam and help you in *the real world*.If you still got cash spare it might be an idea to invest in VMware so you can run multiple OS's on your machine at the same time, allowing you to test NAT, subnetting and the like.Good Luck on becoming an MCSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Lot OK for 210 and 215 but NO GOOD for 216 and 217","review":"This book has all the imformation that you require with some hands on experience for the 70-210 exam.

As an ex Network engineer and MCSE NT4 1998 (Passed all exams first time all from self study) I feel that I was awnsering more questions in the exam from my experience than from the content of this book and that the book was a waste of time and money.

It is stiff, since it has a metal core, but the outer edges is sort of flexible like a rubber spatula. So, it is neither stiff nor flexible, very irritating.I like the idea of one tool having 2 ends, one small and the other a larger, standard spatula. However, once you use one end and try to turn it over to use the other side, you hold a slimy, greasy end; you can hold it from the middle, but then you have what is effectively a 4 inch spatula.Not convenient, not easy, not worth your money or time, unless you hate someone, in which case this thing would be an appropriate gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not that special","review":"This small book has 4 short stories, 3 of which have been publish before (of which I think I had previously read 2) and the fourth is new.

They were my favorite characters throughout this whole book. Even though I'm not a fan of short stories, I enjoyed this book greatly. I hope you have fun reading it, and maybe Ms. McCaffrey or Todd will publish a book, or atleast a short story, about Neru and Nian.And I know the cover is supposed to be an artistic interpretation of the title and the message the book is portraying, but until I read Dragonsdawn a while later, I actually thought that the dragons climbed out of a box on some weird penninsula in the sky and flew down to Pern.

Such a pleasure to read again about Keevan, the smallest dragonboy, and Aramina, the girl who heard dragons, and then to meet new charmers like Tenna, the runner and Nian and Neru, the dragon-riding twins.

Boy was she wrong! This has a large surface area, yet the only part that heats up is the very top, a very inefficient design! At its hottest setting, and on \\"high\\", a warm wave of air drifts upward out the top, doing very little to heat the room, or even me, standing two feet in front of it!I used to use their parabolic, radiant heaters, which at only 1100 watts put out more heat than any of their other 1500 watt models. However, for some mind-boggling, unknown reason, they discontinued making those. So, I would strongly recommend no one waste their money on this model, it's awful......"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this product!","review":"I own two of these heaters and I am getting ready to discard them.

Fortunately, I got this for a buck at the used book store. This book was so obviously written by 2 women for women. There's some pretty puritanical viewpoints here too.

You can't find a soul mate if you're own soul is lost and with the 'self-work' they do, you will find your soul or spirit. If I had to pick the BEST concept in this book, it would be the one which talks about discovering your \\"Non-Negotiables\\" What an amazing break through. You date some one who does or behaves in such a way you disagree, but you accept it thinking \\"he'll change\\" years later, a few kids, he still does those things. Is it his fault \\"NO\\"!

Because these were intended for my nursery, I decided that I should return both sets, rather than risk the other set breaking above my baby's crib.When I called Baby SuperMall to explain the problem, they quickly offered to pay for the return shipping. All I needed to do was drop off the package at a local UPS store.Well, that sounded great, for about 5 minutes. Baby SuperMall called me back to tell me they didn't want the damaged product and, even though I can no longer use the other set because one was broken beyond repair, I have to pay to ship it back.

Also, the book jacket I read made it sound like this was the return of the main characters (Kidd and LuEllen) but it is not. This is the book where they first work together. With all that said, this book is good but not as good as some other Sandford novels I have enjoyed. I am a computer nerd of sorts myself, so I found the books plot (computer hacking/industrial warfare) interesting. The scenes centered around LuEllen's skills at B & E are good too. The story includes some clever elements and plot twists that always make for a fun read. Overall, I liked the book and would recommend it as a precursor to reading the better novel, \\"Empress File.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Integrates Several Plots in an Enjoyable Manner","review":"I do not share the disappointment expressed by some of the earlier reviewers, perhaps because I do not read many novels and this was my first exposure to John Sandford. In any event, I found this \\"airplane book\\" so interesting that I made time to finish it once I got home.The integration of several sub-plots, the detailed portrait painted of the primary character, the ins and outs of planning the destruction of a corporation, and the final surprise ending, very much an \\"out of the box\\" solution for an impossible situation, gave me great satisfaction, to the point that this author joins Robin Cook, Dick Francis, and Michael Creichton as a trusted provider of light entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Sandford","review":"This story's main problem is that it is significantly outdated IT wise which detracts from the thrust of the whole thing. Whilst it is an easy 'plane' read and has some of Mr. Sandford's trademark elements, in the end, it is not a satisfying experience as old hat technology merely underpins a flimsy story which suffers from both predictability, and at some points, extreme stetches of incredulity!Stick with the Prey Series which are in a different league from this unremarable rendition of a very old theme saddled with even older IT elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable and sub-par for Sandford","review":"I have been reading John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series for years and find them generally to be excellent, but I had avoided the Kidd series as I had heard that they were lighter in nature and content.I should have listened to the advice.The book concerns company sabotage where a company owner hires Kidd and his team to infiltrate and sabotage the computer workings of a rival company.Now, I am not a computer person so I don't know how much of this hacking business was factual or fanciful so I concentrated on the actual story. I found it pretty dull stuff and maintaining my solidarity behind John Sandford, I skimmed the last 100 pages just to say that I had finished the book, no matter how disinterested I was. I couldn't summon up any interest in the characters or the storylines at all.One distasteful moment is when the lead characters kill a watchdog. Didn't want to read about the killing at all and left a bad taste in the mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark this one \\"Out of print\\"","review":"This book was origionally published in 1989. The information in it is hopelessly out of date now (2007). For example, he talks about a 2400 baud modem as if it were cutting technology!At one time it probably made a good read when the technology was accurate and up to date. However, it's not current. I suggest that you skip this book for something with technology newer than 20 years old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandford surprisingly disappoints!","review":"I don't know if I could have been more surprised. I have literally loved almost every John Sandford novel I have ever read. I was really looking forward to this first chapter in the Kidd saga. What I got however, seemed like it was written by a completely different author. Maybe it can be chalked up to it being an early novel of his or the \\"cutting edge\\" technology of the time is so outdated now, I don't know. The Prey series has always impressed me but this might put me off the rest of the Kidd series. The characters were so hodge podged and lame. It was weird compared to Lucas Davenport, Virgil Flowers, etc. If you want good Sandford you might want to skip this and look for the Prey novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functions Exactly as described","review":"I don't know what else there is to say, but it works.

While several of the books written toward the end of her life (Elephants Can Remember, Endless Night, etc.) are slow, poorly imagined and dull, this has all of those defects PLUS a preposterous plot. I have always observed that her 80-year-old mysteries have a timeless quality to them -- except for telegrams and typewriters, they could take place almost in any decade. So it is interesting to note that this awful 1970 novel is also so dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your classic Agatha Christie","review":"I've always been a huge Agatha Christie fan, but this book is a complete departure from her usual work and I hate to say it, but it falls short. I always finish reading a book if I start it, but there were times when I was really tempted to just put this one down. If you're looking for classic Christie, this is probably not the book for you. I found the beginning quite good, but ended up plodding through the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Thriller","review":"I agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not Agathat's best work, far from it. Her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller, which doesn't work at all. I cannot say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting. Her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also couldn't be compared to her regular setting of a family murder. So much of the plot just doesn't make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy, which is never the case in any of her other books. I have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"...Except for Stafford Nye, Great-Aunt Matilda, and Theodora/Renata/Mary Ann, who are often absent for several chapters on end, the characters are so poorly developed that when they reappear, I can't disinguish one from another and I have to go back a few chapters and try to figure out who is who. And in the end, the good guys (with all three main protagonists absent) catch a couple of the bad guys, but it's not clear how or if the global plot has been thwarted.However, the book does have one memorable scene that keeps the effort of reading it from being a total waste. That is where one of the characters (can't remember which one) recounts listening to Hitler and coming away inspired and motivated, but unable to recall anything specific that he said. Maybe that was the effect Ms. Christie was trying for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book [isn't good]! I love Agatha's books, but this one I only read until the end to see how it would end. It is NOT worth reading it, unless you like subjects like the cold war and international politics approached in an childish manner. This was actually one of the worst books ever!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes folks, this one is BAD","review":"As with the other reviewers that gave this work a low rating, I am also a fan.Perhaps, as some have said, it is the departure from the much loved Poirot, Marple and even Tommy and Tuppence that makes this a less than enjoyable read.In any event, the book started out fine but soon found its' way into a plot that was so convoluted and unbelievable that I finally gave up.I did skip to the end and found that even there, the wrap-up was nothing that gave me reason to regret the time I saved by not reading the remainder of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Book","review":"This mystery is too slowly paced to be of much joy for a reader. However, it is vintage Christie so it is worth reading as a mystery if one cares to make the slog."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad performance by a master","review":"I am a big fan of Christie in general, but this is one of her later novels that falls into the \\"nothing is the same since The War\\" category. If you have read a number of her books, you can definitely see a tendency for her post-war novels to have these themes: the Kids Have All Become Violent, No One is Who They Say They Are, and Civilization is Just Going To Hell Generally. This novel is one of the latest and worst examples of this post-war group. A barely believable spy story is interwoven with endless chapters of men in a room discussing the direness of the situation. Christie wrote some stellar novels, even some that changed mystery literature forever, but stay away from this one, it's pretty worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock-bottom Agatha Christie","review":"One of Christie's few complete disasters. The plot is a muddled spy story presented with near-desperate sincerity but little coherence or believability. As a story, this is Christie's absolute worst, though _Postern of Fate_ is sadder in terms of writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst Agatha Christie's I've ever read","review":"What made the experience of reading this book even worse was the fact that I just read Christie's So Many Steps to Death which was also an extraordinarily unlikely spy thriller. Even more troubling was the almost identical plot twist involving the \\"Youth Movement\\" and most eggresious was that Christie plagarized herself by, in both books, use the same antecdote of someone going to hear Hitler speak and being caught up in the frenzy of the moment and afterward not being able to recall a specific thing Hitler had said.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"She could do much better","review":"I rarely able to choose the worst books of an author.

Every few months I'll pick it up and start reading, reaching a bit farther than the last time, hoping it'll get better with age ...no such luck. I'm hoping desperately that this will be the first and last time I'm so disappointed with one of her books.

I'm only have way through, and I thought let me see if others on Amazon have reacted as poorly as I have to this work. They have!So far this dreary novel sidesteps logic, is extremely talky, there is no suspense, and politically it comes off as a right wing attack on youth culture and the anti-war movement. Agatha, you have never disappointed me before, although I did notice a few hints of anti-Semitism ( I can't remember now in which mysteries), but then I thought I must be imagining it.Now I'm at page 151 and am forcing myself to continue because you brought me so much joy in the past.

Next came the high chair song which shows a chimp in a high chair flinging food all over the kitchen. Not exactly something I want to encourage in a young child with little impulse control and an ornery streak a mile long. The \\"Crazy Monster\\" song and \\"Watch a Wicthie Whiz\\" were actually a little frightening to my son.

I was particularly struck by the brass lines I had never heard before in a recording. Having said this, I am still hesitant to give it an unreserved recommendation. On just a few occasions I found the characterization a bit lifeless and a bit too much like a rehearsal. Certainly the performance doesn't stand up to other classic recordings of these works, namely Toscanini's NBC recordings, Dutoit/Montreal on Decca, Rizzi/London Phil on Teldec, Muti/Philadelphia on EMI, or even Maazel's own recording with Cleveland on Decca.

I got a killer deal since this was on clearance, but a week later, it went back to the store.Why? Because I get horrible, random white spots appearing in photos. There was no rhyme or reason for them, though I think they were caused by reflections.I also had many problems with auto focus and constantly had to adjust the scene mode and flash to get a decent picture. Sometimes pictures would look great and other times they would be blurry, as if the camera couldn't figure out what to focus on.The LCD also fails to \\"gain up\\" in low light, making it difficult to frame shots in less than adequate lighting.On the plus side, the size and speed are fantastic.

However, this is not a malfunction.\\" READ: your low-light pictures will have spots all over them! Sony does not think this is a problem.

The battery life also is impressive.The slideshow playback of pictures is also a neat addition. The fact that you can add your own audio as background is icing on the cake. I would have liked to have a little bit more control over the transitions during the slideshow though.My only complaint is the lack of a view finder.

Well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. The resolution in prints is excellent, the screen is large and quite nice and with the shake resistant circuitry I don't miss the viewfinder, as I thought I might. The smaller size with built in lense cover/on-off slider switch is nice, and this camera does shoot a little quicker than my 4.0, but not as quick as the larger Cybershots and cameras from other makers.

They even created their own Shushybye train dance, which gets them up and active. It is now part of our daily routine to sing Shushybye songs.

I highly recommend this DVD for all preschool age children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best children's music video I have ever seen!","review":"From the opening chords of Conductor McCloud to the Nighttime Prayer, this DVD evidences a great creative musical spirit filled with heart felt soul. The songs are original and contemporary and stand up to repeated listening. It's shot like a real kids rock concert and moms and dads will walk away humming the tunes after one screening. Just watch the reaction of the pre-school set in the audience. They love it. Buy it, you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy K And Todd K Love It!","review":"We are a married couple with no children.

The mattress arrived shrink wrapped in plastic but without a box. The plastic had a small rip at one corner and the mattress was a little dirty on bottom at that corner but not enough to worry about. It was a little difficult to move up and into my old waterbed frame by myself (I'm 5'2\\" and 62 years old) but well worth the effort. I removed the plastic and unrolled after it was in the frame and there was no unpleasant smell at all.

The mattress was delivered in the time frame that was given us and was a pleasant surprise in that it was everything that the company stated! It expanded to the right size, the smell was not bad and disappeared after airing it out for a couple of hours. The only complaint is it is a bit firmer than we thought it would be, but it is so comfortable and our back pain is gone!

In truth no book would be a better way to learn C than having this one. Mr. Corriveau has numerous programming language errors within the first 80 pages that make it impossible to run most (if not all) of his 'samples' as they are. His lecture note style organization would be difficult to follow even if the book had had a proof reading before it was released to publications. His near 800 page book is 900 lbs worth of frustration. It took an experienced C programmer to clean-up and rewrite Mr. Corriveau's sloppily written 'sample code'. In his book he states that C programming isn't for everyone . . . well certainly not the way he approaches teaching it.

It's a great machine in that it does what it is supposed to do and is intuitive. My problems:1. Total waste of tape (which is $$$) because it prints an extra 1\\" on each side of every label you print. Keep scissors nearby.2. If you clear out the text by pressing Shift + Clear, it clears all settings including the font size. It defaults to ENORMOUS SIZED FONT that I don't think I would ever use. Their smallest size is still kinda big for a file.I am simply not willing to buy the a/c adapter (sold separately). I purchased this for the office and if it were for personal use, I would return it.

The \\"M\\" refill tape for the 80 is about half the cost and has all the same printing features as far as I have seen (I used the 80 regularly at work and bought this 1280 for home use).

The functionality is worse, it's difficult to navigate, and worst of all, it is apparently DESIGNED to waste tape--and when the tape cartridges cost almost as much as the labeller, that's important! By default it leaves 1\\" of blank tape on each end of the label, meaning for most applications you have to hand trim it with scissors. I finally found a \\"margins\\" option and set it to a half inch, only to find that it puts the default 1\\" margin, then ADDS the half inch with a little mark to show you how much extra tape it wasted. I'll be looking back to the M series, or other brands, for my next buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!","review":"If I could give this labeler negative stars, I would. It is a money waster. Every time you print a label, it wastes 2 inches of label tape on either side and you have to end up cutting the excess off.

If I had known that this machines was designed to waste 1-2 inches of tape each time you print a label, I would not have bought it. The real cost to the label-maker is in the cost of the tape and if you are literally wasting 1-2 inches for each use, then a roll of tape will not last very long. I called their \\"customer service\\" line in the hopes that I had not set the margins properly but was told that although they receive complaints EVERY day about this problem, it's not a design problem, it's my problem. Not very helpful and extremely frustrating since I asked if there was a way I could provide customer feedback for the next version of this model. I would not recommend this label-maker and I definitely would not recommend calling them for help either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconvenient scissoring of EVERY label","review":"I like the *idea* of this labeler. I like the querty keypad and the form factor. The labels are nice as well. But I have to use scissors to trim each label because of the ridiculous inch-long strip of blank tape on each label.To whoever said this was an easy fix using the 'chain print' function: You're wrong. I don't print several identical labels in a row. I need a label now and a label later. One at a time. If I was willing to do a bunch at once I would use my computer printer to make labels.What was Brother thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Away","review":"As most everyone has noted previously, this label machine does waste a LOT of tape. Oddly enough, I really do like this labeler. I like the many options it has and the regular keyboard-style layout. One reviewer (\\"It doesn't waste tape if you set it up correctly\\" - Lynn B) noted, you can change the margins to reduce the excess tape. However that's not quite the full story. Reducing the margin only saves tape on one end (instead of 2\\" of excess tape, you now end up with 1-1/8\\" of excess tape). If you print multiple labels in one sitting, then the reduced margin is beneficial. If you're like me and print one label at a time - as you need it - then you still end up wasting tape. I recommend you set up for the reduced (narrow) margin, but you'll still end up cutting off an inch of tape. If it wasn't for the wasted tape issue, I'd give this machine 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"PT-1280 is a cheap machine to buy, expensive to keep in labels!","review":"Agree with ALL of the reviews about the PT-1280 wasting label ribbon. I bought this machine about 4 months ago at a Staples while I was in store to fill an immediate need. Sadly, I didn't do my normal research & check how much it was on Amazon or, more importantly, read any reviews. The cost of the machine itself is cheap, but the label ribbons are so pricey you think twice about labelling. In addition to the narrow margin & chain print functions (which you have to set EVERY time), another way I've managed to get more out of the label ribbon is by using the carriage return/ENTER key. I stack titles on top of one another to make the ribbon last longer. But again, you have to use scissors to trim the 2 separate lines in 1/2 - which defeats the purpose of having a label maker... I wouldn't buy this again ever. But since I have it I buy labels from ptouchdirect to make the best of a bad situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a MANUFACTURING DEFECT, do not buy! Wastes tape!","review":"This unit worked great for 6 months... then suddenly, without changing a setting, it started to output labels with excessively wide margins. Apparently, according to the FAQ on Brother's web site, this manufacturing issue is normal: \\"The 1 inch (25mm) piece of tape that is produced prior to every label cannot be eliminated due to the construction of the tape mechanism.\\" (from www.p-touch.com) So, for every label I print, there's as much white space outputted around the label and I need scissors to cut it. This will not only waste your money in label tape, it will waste your time as well. Very disappointing to have to throw out as much tape as you print.Other units by other manufacturer's do not have this issue, nor do other models from Brother. Simply this unit, it's terrible. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Life Poor","review":"Like the labels but detest the waste of the expensive label tape. I have ordered an AD30 adapter as after my first set of batteries the 1280 tells me my new batteries are bad! They test fine. Did not see this problem with any other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a waste!","review":"It would be easy to give this labeler 5 stars if it didn't waste tape at the end of each label. I thought I would be able to just print lables and stick them on, but you will need a scissors unless you want an inch of blank tape before and after each label.Otherwise, it works well and is quite intuative without having to read the directions. Nice selection of different tapes, as well. Works great for labeling wires in a network, on your computer or stereo system. And if you have a zillion AC adaptors (which this product does not come with) you can finally label them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"PT-80 wastes less tape","review":"If you want to waste a lot of tape, this is the labelmaker for you.

It is the far better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"TAPE WASTER - Big Time","review":"This labeler will waste a lot of that expensive tape. If one prints a 1\\" long label, 2\\" are wasted.

Every time I turn it on I have to start over and re-size and change fonts for my labels. Every other model I have had saved your changes from use to use. Not exactly a time saving feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"This products is trash in comparison with the PT-80 (the model we always trusted) in regards to the amount of tape waste.This product was released in 2005, now we are in 2008 and the manufacture (Brother) didn't even bother to correct the problem of the amount of wasted tape, despite the endless complains from all reviewers. 3 years and this product is still as is.. In fact I don't think its a problem on their end, this product had been designed this way, to waste more tape, thus forcing us consumers to buy more and use more.This unit is going back to Amazon and I'll get a Dymo instead. Too sad I got deceived by the brand that I always trusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted tape = swindle","review":"Bought, tried, returned. (Should've read online reviews first and skipped all three steps!) Simply put, the replacement tape is expensive, and this machine is designed to waste as much of it as possible. Using the \\"narrow margin\\" setting only slightly reduces the waste on one side; on the other side it spits out all the same waste and then tells you to cut it off by hand.I went and got a cheap Dymo labeler instead. Its features and interface are much worse than the Brother's, but it's not designed to perpetrate a transparent swindle like this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I thought I found a great deal on this label maker. Unfortunately, the thing is a piece of junk! The settings are difficult to adjust, unintuitive, and not well defined. The result is the waste of a lot of label tape (which is more expensive than what I actually paid for the thing) trying to get the label you want. Even when the text is set to large, and the margin is set to narrow, the text comes out tiny, then when you want a label to fit a tab or book or something, it comes out too long - it's really just a crap shoot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I purchased this item as a gift for my fiance who is a teacher and she loves it!

Martha Avery has done an excellent job of giving the reader true insight into the lives of Mongolian women and their families -- women of all ages, from all parts of the country, and from all walks of life. Although the photographs and interviews were compiled several years ago, the struggles of a country moving from Soviet communism to a democratic market economy are evident in the hopes, disappointments, joys, and persistence of the women depicted here. Through the pictures, the words of the interviewees, and the author's own editorial asides, we get to see what life in a ger is like, including the challenges of heating and cooking with a dung-fueled fire and finding ways to preserve yak milk products to feed a large family through brutal winters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"If you're interested in Mongolia and its culture, this book is wonderful. The author interviewed women of all ages and walks of life in Mongolia and photographed them, along with their camels, gers (tents), and homes. The book includes fascinating detail on ordinary and extraordinary lives, as well as an insight into life in Mongolia today. Wonderful! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prom Kings Rock","review":"The Prom KingsThis is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased.

I have been married 11 years and somehow never ended up with this book and I was sorely tempted to keep it for myself. The array of recipes is amazing and so diverse. There are pictures on each page that show what the perfect finished product looks like, what it looks like underdone and overdone per each recipe's situation. Example, underwhipped cream, perfect whip cream and overwhipped cream, which is great for someone starting out cooking. The visual aids are such a bonus. I will definantly be ordering this one for myself! Another bonus was that on her registry this book was $30 and I bought it on Amazon for $20 with free shipping!!!! Can't do better than that.

This book has EVERYTHING you need from making lemonade to cooking the perfect ham. The recipes are very thorough and easy to make. It's great how I don't have to go searching all over town for a certain ingredient. Everything can be bought at the local supermarket.

I actually ordered 2 of them from Amazon Marketplace from the Bookguys out of New York. I intended to give one away as a gift. Unfortunately the books were packaged in a box much too small for their acutal size that in fact the box appeared with round edges, and a significant amount of tape, on my doorstep. I opened the box and much to my dismay these hardcovered masterpieces have all 4 corners of each book bent due to poor packaging. I am discusted. I would have surely thought a book company would package their books appropriately. I would never order another book from this company again. I guess that is why the price was right.

It is one movie you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICHARD TUGGLE, OPUS 1","review":"***** 1984. Written and directed by Richard Tuggle. That's one of the Eastwood movies I prefer.

Sons of the Desert is the lodge that Laurel and Hardy belong to (does this look like Shriners and a Shriners Convention?). The local lodge wants its members to go to the annual convention. Stan has no problem getting an OK from his wife, but Ollie thinks he has to sneak away. As usual, Ollie gets them into trouble.Needless to say, their wives discover they are at the convention and not where they are supposed to be, according to what the wives were told by Stan and Ollie. There are some funny scenes when the men return home and try to sneak in.There are also some classic scenes in the motion picture, including Stan eating the wax fruit. Stan Laurel could turn almost anything into comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honolulu Baby !!!","review":"The song interpreted by the 2 coming back from their \\"vacations\\" is for me the best part of the film if I had do choose between all.

On this CD \\"GAROU\\" tries too hard to impress the listener. He over sings (a la MICHAEL BOLTON) almost every note of every song sort of like a werewold whaling at the moon. Plus, it is much too early for him and his label SONY to place a LIVE RECORDING on the market when the artist has only ventured out with one studio CD of original material.If you're searching to obtain a great FRENCH POP recording, I strongly suggest anything from \\"SYLVAIN COSETTE\\" or \\"BRUNO PELLETIER\\". Bruno is a currently one of the strongest male francophone vocalist on the planet. He has a tremendous vocal range that blends right into the solid pop/rock material supplied by his label."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets clogged","review":"every time I use this vacum I have to drag out my shop vac, detach the hose, and blow it out because the hose inevitably gets clogged with the stuff I'm vacuming up. HOOVER has been around for 100 years, and they still don't know how to make a vacuum cleaner that works. how sad. Wait! don't tell me, let me guess, it's made in China in a factory not owned by the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor suction","review":"I needed a vaccuum to use mostly for my unfinished basement floor. I didn't want to spend alot, so I got this. However, I am extremely dissappointed with the product for its very poor suction. No other feature can really make up for that. If it doesn't pick up the dirt, what good is it at all?? I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be worse","review":"We bought this Hoover Junkios a few years back to replace my 25-year-old Hoover Spirit. What a disappointment. The Telios has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It mars floors (tile and vinyl); the floor attachment connector cracked causing a loose fit to the wand; when the hose isn't kinking, it's breaking; forget using it on stairs; the suction has been engineered right out of the thing (one of the suction-reducer controls is located in the handle where it constantly gets bumped into a position further reducing it's poor suction); vacuum bags are expensive and not easily obtainable.I grew up with a Hoover in the house. When I moved out on my own, I bought a Hoover - it lasted me 25 years! But, I'll never, ever buy another Hoover after buying this Junkios."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Vacuum!","review":"I purchased this vacuum over a year-and-half ago and have hated it from the start. The first problem is that it has very limited suction strength - it might pick up a penny (as others claim), but often it won't pick up a stray piece of lint (no matter how many times I try)...and it leaves so much HAIR behind that I have to follow up with an adhesive lint brush!!! (And since I have long hair, there are always stray hairs around the house, no matter what I do). Also, this vacuum has such a small cleaning path!!! And the hose detaches from the wand on a regular basis - and to top it all off, I have found using a canister vacuum to be very inconvenient. I'm now shopping for a bagged upright vaccum, hopefully with more cleaning power and a much wider cleaning path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"For the price, this is an excellent vacuum. The retractable cord, onboard attachment storage and extendable wand are all very nice features."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had the reviews before I bought...My fault","review":"I replaced a Hoover I had for years and loved. The model I had is no longer made or I would have just gotten it again. The fact we are down to carpet in just the den made me think I didn't need an expensive canister so I bought this one. The wand keeps falling off and it might pick up a penny, but it won't pick up a toothpick or a band-aid wrapper is very true. The suction is very low. However, I do use it on my baseboards. I'm in the market for another canister but I don't this is will be this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Bother","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. The wand constantly separates from the hose while vacuuming. Short of glueing it on I see no other way to keep it in place. Very annoying! Plus, glueing,as other reviewers state defeats the whole purpose of having a canister vacuum. Don't waste your money. It's true that you get what you pay for but if what you have to pay with is all you have you've lost all the way around. I've had two fantastic canister vacuums in my lifetime one was the Electrolux (the old steel model) and a Singer (no longer manufactured) they were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I didn't have the problem with the wand, but my Telios has no power whatsoever. It's the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. I will go back to Miele from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"My mother bought this for me to replace a terrific Hoover canister vac that I had. This one pales in comparison. While it picks up dirt off of hardwood floors okay, it basically just moves dirt around the surface of a carpet. It's a frustration machine. Also, the design of the attachments is horrible. Instead of having any sort of way to lock things in place, the wand depends on pressure to keep everything attached. It fails frequently to do so. Also, there is some little black slider thing on the wand to regulate air flow that falls off constantly but must be attached to use. It's pointless, really, since the vacuum offers so little suction anyway that there's really nothing to regulate; might as well replace it with some tape and keep the hole closed. Terrible vacuum for any price. If you have a better one that's broken, spend the money to FIX IT rather than buy this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard!","review":"I bought this at clearance price, $49.99.

As a parent, I like the message of the story, that is being different isn't bad. Elizabite begins as a \\"different\\" plant, treated with caution and potential scorn, but soon shows how her difference is her strength and saves the day. The illustrations are wonderful - I noticed something new each time I read the book, from grateful smiles on the faces of insects as Elizabite is captured to tie-ins to previous pages. The language is rich, and the only change I made was to substitute \\"hot dogs\\" for \\"frankfurters\\" when reading to my kids so they would understand what it meant. Great book for anyone's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood favorite","review":"I still have my 40 year old copy of this wonderful book, which I have enjoyed re reading to my 3 year old. The rhymes are better than average (for this age group), and the premise, while familiar to us now as \\"The little shop of Horrors\\", still seems fresh when told and illustrated by HA Ray. If you like Curious George you'll love Elizabite."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a strain to look for the points","review":"The underlying theses of seeking to integrate the gospel message with social justice, and to see Christ in those suffering, are so important and intriguing in themselves that it is unfortunate that Kenneth Leech presents points without developing them. The entire book is rather flat and puzzling. For example, he mentions the classic Greek saints who were \\"fools for Christ\\", without adding the essential parts of their stories that show their holiness - one wonders if insanity guaranteed the heavenly crown in itself. As both a devout Christian and a political liberal, I had expected to be enriched by this work. That goal was not fulfilled. Trying to figure out what Leech meant was tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"This book is the total opposite of the floral-cookbook style material u so often find on relationship astrology.

In this video Carey seems cool and at home with the audience; her vocals are great and the music is just as enjoyable - she is truly in her element. Soulful performances of greats such as \\"Vision of Love\\" and \\"Emotions,\\" which in my opinion is better than the record version, along with her charming, innocent stage presence, make this a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"prinncess Mariah Carey","review":"Mariah carey is a very powerfull singer she sings from her heart.

I think he is one of the greatest US train photographers. Unfortuanatly some photo's in his last book are made bigger then in previous books and (in my opinion) that did not made the book better. The disadvantage is that the grain is more visable (normally with such big photo's you take more distance, but in the book the distance to your eyes remains the same as for the smaller pictures) and the picture is cut by the gutter of the book. However this book is worth the money, because the pictures are very good.

The author Erik, is brutally raw and honest, yet strong as hell in body, mind and soul. This is truly an amazing human being. An inspirational being to the nth. Funnily enough, he rattles off his brave accomplishments very matter-of-factly.

This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good read","review":"Not the best writer in the world, but I still found it hard to put the book down during the last half of the book.

It is much more a coming of age book than a climbing book and as such will appeal to a much wider audience. Congratultions to Erik for taking the risks and showing us the possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspitation","review":"What Erik has accomplished is an inspiration and a very important lesson for us all. He takes us from his childhood to his status as a world reknowned climber, telling us all the steps and stops in between. This isn't a book written by some blind guy bragging (or feeling sorry for himself) and wanting recognition. It is written by a man who is as in awe as we are as we read of what he has done. It is about a boy who grows up to to what he sets out to do. He has many problems along the way, but we learn from him that the only way to do it is to do it AND HE JUST HAPPENS TO BE BLIND. Don't just read the book; visit the website and learn more about this young man and the contributions he is making to help others reach their potential. He doesn't just climb mountains. I wish nothing but the best for Erik, Ellie, and Emma in everything they set out to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"The bulbs are packaged well and the price would be fair if they actually lasted more than 4 to 10 hrs each.

I don't think this kettle is any worse quality wise than other more expensive kettles. The handle doesn't get too hot to pick up either, although I have an electric stove I don't know about a gas range. Mine doesn't sputter when boiling.

Very thin and light metal, don't expect a copper bottom or anything close. The whistle didn't work at all. The first time I used it, no sound came out.

My stars wound up in alignment recently when I found this exact model at a local flea market in brand-new condition.I like that the handle folds down, so there's one star. It's well made, so that's another star. It's inexpensive (very much so in my instance), so there are three stars. And you can bring a full pot to the boil and pour off several cups without burning your fingers - therefore, four stars.I'm taking off one star as the whistle is weak; however, it sounds off loud enough to get one's attention that 'tea time' has arrived. Overall I'm pleased with this product - one of the better bargains in today's confused cornucopia of cheap import kitchen accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty!","review":"I got this teakettle for about 2 months.

It could not read any discs and made a high scream whine all the while scratching any disc placed in it.So I returned it, luckily the second one does work. But for how long I am not sure.

And lord help you if you loose the child controller, because then you are left to rummage through all of the garbage on the larger controller. This item is now sitting broken in the closet of my daughters bedroom because when she went to open the slot to put her DVD in, it broke off and the DVD slider came out and stopped halfway and that was it, it is now completely shot in less than a year.

Add to this the DVD played would not stay open long enough to actually remove or add a DVD - you would literally have to hold on to it to stop the door shutting!

Sometimes it would not respond to the eject command. I would have to push eject several times and when the tray would jut out ever so slightly, I had to be ready to grab it. Sometimes I would have to get something thin enough to slide into the tray and pry it open. Just recently, the tray stopped coming out all together. I ended up breaking the tray trying to get a prized movie out. Now it won't close, open or read disks.

But he has not yet shown himself capable of handling forms larger than a few paragraphs in length - leastways, he doesn't with Teeth. I ground mine in frustration on nearly every page.

Darkwing had the catchiest theme song and the craziest villains including: Megavolt, Bushroot, Steelbeak, The Liquidater, and Darkwing's evil twin Negaduck.

That happiness was short lived when I got it unpacked and loaded into a player. The video and sound quality is very poor and varies from episode to episode. I have some old VHS copies of episodes from this volume that have better sound and picture quality to them. Another thing is that there are absolutely no chapters. Each episode is one large segment, hitting the chapter skip button merely ends the episode and brings you back to the episode selection menu. It resembles a home dvd burning software where you can load home movies into a pre-made menu and \\"click\\" on them when loaded into a dvd player. This product was viewed on a 720p LCD flatscreen, HDMI cable, and blue ray player. The show is not that old, why was it not remastered first before being put out as a set?

The raincoat has a terrible, offensive odor in it. Airing it out, or washing it will not remove the odor. It is in the fabric and smells similar to strong camphor-mothballs.

After the receipt of this coat, we noticed an aggressively foul smell in the house. We traced it to the jacket. At the time of my last posting (3 days) hanging it outside to airout had not worked.

I don't know if you had it setting in a location that smelled of some type of fuel or what happened to it but it smells sickening. I could not possibly put this on my dog to wear. I am disgusted that I paid for this item. It is totally unusable and not worth even shipping back. It smells so bad it needs to be thrown out. Only you know where you had this item sitting and why it smells like kerocene or whatever fuel smell is saturated on it to make it smell like this.

It had to be trimmed and sewed instead of sending it back. I purchased a small and it was too small for him so the medium should have fit but he does have short legs and luckily I was able to alter it to fit him. Our dogs hate to go out in the rain so this makes a big difference. The packaging smell was horrible and I tried washing it with baking soda but it still has a strong odor, will try washing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rain coat","review":"I like this raincoat and it fits my Westie very well. However, as others have said, the smell is really bad. My dog would not let me get near him because of the smell. I have had this several months now and the smell is getting better so I am hopeful that eventually it will get better. I would like to see this in Yellow. This would be a great design for a regular wool coat with the hood and would be really cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a few bad things.","review":"I love this rain coat. I bought it for a bishop frise. The measurements were all correct except the chest part. He is only about 18 inches and it is made for 26-30 inches. I made it work by tying it up a wierd way though. It did have the strong rubber smell to it like everyone had said. i took it off my dog and his fur smelling like it to. We left it beside the door and when we walked in the house smelled like it. I'm gonna try airing it out to see if it works. Still haven't got to use it in the rain though. Hopefully it will rain soon!

My dog was completely wet after we went out in the rain, and so was the inside lining of the coat. It did not keep the water off him at all and it soaked through to his back.As far as the fit, the belt was too long like others said, so I had to cut it down and cut down the front flap so he wouldn't trip over it. Had I not done that I could have returned it, now it's too late. I felt so bad for my poor fella. I wouldn't have made him stay outside for so long if I knew he was getting so wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"I was initially more pleased than not with this raincoat. Although the hood was not very well designed (the connecting piece is not long enough for the hood to remain secure on my dog's head) he hates hoods anyway and would have shaken it off even if it did fit securely. The leg elastics were useful when they worked. They kept the coat in place in high winds.HOWEVER... My dog has worn this coat for barely two months and it is already showing signs of wear and tear. The leg elastics are completely worn. While that would be an easy fix, the wear on the vinyl is not. The vinyl is so worn in several places that the white underlay is visible. I am particularly disappointed because my dog's previous raincoat which is at least two years old is still wearable. The older coat is in much better condition than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky, stinky, stinky","review":"I ordered this raincoat for my Pomeranian. He's a peanut.

This is one of only a handful of non-Christian rap CD's that I listen too.I could not rate the CD a perfect score because of the 'adult' langauge. I feel he [Javahn] is calling out to God.

It is very loud- sometimes I think it may wake my kids! While my handle has not broken off (and it does not get hot), it is the complete opposite of anything ergonomic. In order to lift it while using your finger to trigger the opening mechanism, it is VERY hard to tilt far enough to get all the water out. Forget using one hand to pour it. Because of it's shape you cannot get this under the fridge tap to use the filtered water (we have very hard water here in south TX!) I have the red one so I can not speak for the stainless getting discolored, but my red one isn't. That is probably because most of the time I'd rather use my Pyrex in the micro to boil water! It does boil water, so I guess it works which is why I gave it the extra star.

I've been using the same kettle in pink for a while and it became clear that this kettle was such a waste of money.About a month after, the color started fade and a hook to open the whistling lid snapped in half. Although it still boil water and whistle, the handle gets extremely hot to grab and you'd hope to use a pan instead. Oh and the other day, the handle for lid snapped in half as it couldn't take heat any more.There's nothing heat-resistant about this kettle.

I put the first one in and added lots of large rocks about half way filled. Then I planted my flowers in the second one and put that one on top of the first one. This worked great.

You say how many more takes on Mozart can be made, well in this case it is three. The infrequently recorded Symphony No. 23 is first (all nine minutes of it) and even in its brevity it is as enjoyable as any of the middle Symphonies. Next is \\"Sinfonia Concertante,\\" K. 364 which is a concerto for both viola and violin, and it is delightful. Finally, comes the CD's meat and potatoes piece, the 36th Symphony also known as the \\"Linzer.\\" Abbado manages to draw his interpretation out to nearly twice the length of his Berlin predecessor Karl Bohm's recording of thirty years earlier on DG Originals, and Abbado's performance offers an interesting contrast to Bohm's version. In all, this is fine CD but with all the numerous classic Mozart performances available by Ormandy, Szell and Bohm (among others) available at mid-line or budget price, it seems there are better places to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is excellent","review":"Royal hunt,a very interesting band that delivers a very interesting album,it's a conceptual cd because it mantains a unified continuity between each track,musically and liricaly. the Royal Hunt keyboard player Andre Andersen is the similar to Yngwie Malmsteem on keyboards. you're going to find a powerfull cd with a lot of neo-classical influence on the music,one of the major characteristics of royal hunt is the way that the keyboards demonstrate such a high profile by the use of solos,orchestral effects,and so much more.

My only complaint is that this game seems to reset all of the data on the cartridge at its own discretion. You could have played for hours, days, weeks, created characters, unlocked characters and arenas, etc, only to have it all erased. If you are the type of person who can just play a game without wanting to tweek it or earn all of this stuff available on it, then this game is for you.

I received a vacuum filter that does fit my Eureka Boss Smart Vac, HOWEVER, has NO identifiable packaging that states it is a Eureka product. The filter does not have the baking soda packet attached to it nor does it have the yellow rim (it's black) that I have purchased from Eureka in the past. While I know products can change slightly from year to year, I feel it's a little fishy to receive a product from a seller that has nothing on it that states it is a Eureka brand product."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better price via Amazon than retail","review":"I can't find these filters for less than $20 at any store so the $11.50 price through Amazon was great.

I just replaced my OEM Arm & Hammer Hepa filter with this one. My OEM filter has a pad on the back of it that has the Arm & Hammer baking soda in it. This one does not have the pad. Additionally, the image displayed and the description *imply* that this is OEM though the description does not SAY so.

They were so self-centered and obnoxious.

However, they are far too small to efficiently use the space under the changing tables. I'm thinking of getting a wall mount shelf to put these on instead, because I'm unwilling to waste so much space under the changing table. The gingham colored bows are a nice little feature; they actually include pink, blue, green and white bows with every basket so you can match to the nursery. I would've liked purple or lavender, actually, but I guess you can't have everything. Construction is just as you might expect for a wicker basket, not unusually cheap or anything like that. I gave it 2 stars only because of the inconvenient size.

Having never seen LWT's original version on the UK's ITV in the 1970s, this was something new to me.The three episodes are fantastic. The period detail seemed excellent. I particularly enjoyed the Fascist storyline in the show and the appearance of Mrs Simpson and the discussion of the possibility of an Abdication which certainly held my attention, attaching the fictional storylines in the show to actual events occuring at the time.A wonderful cast where every member performs equally well, I was particulary impressed with Neil Jackson as chauffeur Henry Spargo.Looking forward to the next series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Production","review":"Hi I had great hopes for this production after watching the beautiful production of Downton Abbey on PBS earlier this seson, and watching again and remembering the first great Upstairs Downstairs. Iwas intrigued to see if this production could measure up to the other productionWhat a dissapiointment It was awful !!! Even the great Jan Marsh couldn't save this turkey It stinks The best charaters were the Halham's Mom and her distinguished Indian secetary, the cook, and the maid IvyThe plot was terrible The bit with Agnes's younger sister Persie's involvment with the chauffer and the Politiccal Cause was a blatent rip-off of a similiar story-line in Downton AbbyThe characters of Agnes Persie Hallam ,the Butler and eve Jean Marshe's Rose were weak I would save mu money and go to your local library and rent the video Rose"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't go home again","review":"this is what happens when an attempt is made to tamper with perfection..agendas do not make for good entertainment...One star for effort *"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie -- Go ahead and buy it!","review":"The clever idea of upstairs/downstairs always amazes me.

Those who remember the original series will certainly be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busy Life","review":"Its like everyday life in our world today. You have a life of romance, scandal, and some amusing events. There is secrecy and of course lies. The elegant furnishings, clothes, hair styles, are very primm and proper for that era. Also its like the haves and have nots. Of course there is always factional scheming for power. Lots of excitment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at social divide under one roof","review":"While this was no competition for the recent hit Downton Abbey(watch it!!!), it was certainly well acted and stunningly filmed. I loved the costumes, and seeing familiar faces like Keeley Hawes(Spooks) and Eileen Atkins. I hope they will be making a second series, because three episodes was not enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ghastly","review":"Only worth watching if there isn't any thing on TV. Its best actors are the butler, the cook, Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins. One can hardly tell the difference between the characters. No blonds, redheads, and all with very similar hairdos and faces. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I rented all of the original Upstairs Downstairs and was so sad when I had seen them all.I wanted this one to be just as good and do justice to the original and it does!

It's choppy and doesn't flow organically.

While the initial episode tries to cull forth the emotions and remembrances of times past, with the hiring of the former maid, your dissatisfaction with the series will be as culpable as hers was with the new household. The focus isn't on staff/employer relations as much as it is about the plight of the Jews and the rise of fascism. Did we really need Upstairs, Downstairs to feature such a well-worn subject? What a wasted opportunity. Also, the series is mortally tainted with political correctness, like everything on PBS nowadays. Historical accuracy is sacrificed once again to serve a social agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"fairly poor interpretation of the libreto, disappointing decor,seen much better british series , i will not recommend this production to anybody"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could live that way... minus the Nazis!","review":"Beautiful scenery, people and great writing and acting.

Sequel!!","review":"The original Upstairs Downstairs was filled with characters you could care about, and it had all kinds of true-to-life stories that involved the characters. The character development and acting was superb.However, the new version is a huge disappointment. The characters are shallow and don't make me care about them at all. Even Rose, the excellent parlor-maid in the original series, is a disappointment. Her acting is stiff and her character is just plain uninteresting. The same with the other actors..stiff and boring.After the second episode, I have no desire to see the rest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"liked the show but then the next season was not included in Amazon Prime!","review":"I enjoyed the new upstairs/downstairs but was disappointed when I went to watch the next season and you had to pay on Amazon Prime.

I'm very happy that I had the chance to immediately compare the two.I'm sorry I spent the money and wasted my time on this set. The original Up/Down was terrific. This one is a DUD. The characters aren't well developed nor are they nearly as endearing as the original cast. The Downstairs servants (with the exception of Rose) for the most part are immoral and vulgar and very easy to dislike (exception are Rachel and the man from India).My recommendation is not to purchase this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Fans...","review":"This is a great series, although very short indeed! However there are at least 7 episodes, i believe, slated for 2012! If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, you will hopefully find this entertaining. Downton is unmatched, but this fills a loss when Downton is on hiatus! The casting is quite stellar, especially Eileen Atkins and Anne Reid, two of my favorites. The series harbors on the political aspects of England in the 1930's, a few bits on the fascist movement, however there was enough drama that did NOT include politics to make it worth while. It's a young husband and wife starting their life anew and adapting to society around them. The house is absolutely beautiful too! I thought the casting was great and there was no one character that you \\"love to hate\\", which i thought was kind of nice for a change. Although flawed both great and small, everyone had some sort of redeeming quality! I'm looking forward to the 2012 season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"redone version of original series.....","review":"sometimes, it's better NOT to try and \\"improve\\" or \\"re-create\\" what is classic.

Yes - I have two.I'm not a techie, so I was pleased to discover the station easy to install and the interface between TV and iPod pretty slick. The remotes are a pain - particularly at any great distance - they just aren't very responsive.I like being able to shuffle through pictures and display them on the big screen, and even with my lack of technical finesse I found it simple to use and enjoy. I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't get frustrated with the occasional lack of remote control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry that Takes Risks","review":"Gillan's poetry in \\"Things\\" is not safe poetry, which is what Gillan's critic from NY is apparently looking for in a book of poems. Yes, many of Gillan's poems are prose poems and do challenge traditional notions about what makes a poem. That's her point in \\"Things.\\" In poems such as \\"Zia Concetta and Her Whalebone Corset\\" and \\"My Father's First Car,\\" the form looks like prose. But no matter what form her poems take, they qualify as poems by where they take us as a reader: first into the emotions that Gillan expresses and then into the very real places from which these poems are derived in experience. In \\"Family Vacations\\" and many others in the volume like it, Gillan demonstrates that she can write in more traditional forms. Her poems are meaningful expressions of what it means to grow up as an Italian American woman in contemporary society. \\"Things\\" has a place on anyone's reading list who is interested in gender and ethnic identity in American society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Drab for Poetry. Unimaginative Prose.","review":"I expected to find some wisdom presented in a poetic way, but the poems were drab and sounded like prose. There is nothing new here and the poet seems uninspired and provencial. I was looking for good Italian American poetry, but this isn't it. I've read DiPrima, Barolini's book, Gioseffi, Stefanile, Ciardi and From the Margin, Writings by Italian Americans from Purdue U. Press and enjoyed them better for their craft and imagination. There are many good Italian American poets who reach more out of themselves into the world. Gillan's not dreadful, just not very original as these other Italian American writers. Perhaps, she should stick to editing. I recommend the other authors named above as more fully realized poets and they are all available at Amazon.com, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not poetry","review":"This is not poetry. This is maudlin, banal sentiment formatted to look like poetry. Poetry is compressed, surprising, insightful, fresh, musical. This isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Sleepy Poetry without Much Wit or Wisdom","review":"Gillan doesn't quite reach the heights of poetry. She's not terrible, just passably digestible. Her real talent is in promotional work. She has been good, it seems, at spreading poetry around New Jersey, and along with her administrative work, her own name. Gillan's work isn't really much worthy of recognition, because it lacks verbal grace, originality and substance. She's okay, just not stirring or enlightening. I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, But Not Good","review":"This poet-whom few seem ever to have heard of--seemed worthy of trying. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. My mind and heart were open, but Gillan's poetry isn't bad enough to be interesting and not good enough to spend money and time on. Gillan is okay, but nothing in the book is exciting or really moving. It sort of puts one to sleep with the ordinary, the television sit. com. ideas it explores, the sentimental family life it does not really bring to life. It is simply dull and uninteresting and more worthy of the adjective \\"prosaic\\" than \\"poetic.\\" she has good managerial or administrative skills, it seems from her biographical note. She seems to be known more as an administrator than a writer. What are \\"the powers that be\\" thinking? This book is okay, but not original or good--and ceertainly not a good example to student poets. One should read books by Milton Kessler or CK Williams or Sharon Olds or Linda Hogan or Tony Hoagland as an antidote to Gillan."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kids love this little book about a little car","review":"Mi Carrito is a hilarious story about a little girl receiving a kid-size \\"lowrider\\" pedal car from her grandpa. My kids cheered when she was in the competition, and clucked their tongues when she didn't take care of the car. There's real tension when she is chased by the dog and when she knows grandpa will see the dilapidated state of her carrito. As you can tell, young readers will really identify with this young protaganist and her adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lowe's best film performance...","review":"Saw this movie when it was originally released- shortly after the sex tape weirdness of the '88 Democratic convention; it was serenely ironic that at the precipice of career suicide by Lowe, he would in this film provide his best performance. Although recent work in West Wing & Brothers & Sisters has helped him reclaim a bit of appreciation, this character still resonates as a well-played, against type evildoer. A tight script, another high quality performance by Spader and an ecellent soundtrack all add to the guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led astray","review":"Hadn't seen the film for some ten years before it arrived on DVD. A decade makes me even more appreciate Spader's work as Michael Boll. His character is a most convincing utter corporate dork who struggles to free himself of his devils then aftwards free himself of his 'savior.' Lowe too is great in his villain's role also though his character is perhaps overly cute/pretty at times - yet convincingly threatening when required. Good to see Christian Clemenson in *any* capacity. Oh, Lisa Zane: suits please note she needs more time before a camera! (Notice how the couples who stumble into the plot - the pier bar, the garage - are screaming about their relationships?)

This is a truly ravishing and inspiring collection of songs from deep within a creative spirit that manages both to be beguilingly open and teasingly private. \\"Sudama\\" is an invitation to meditation and exploration that has antcedents not only in New Age but in the restless inventiveness of Coltrane's jazz and the Dead's peaceable, funky kingdom.

Around the middle and especially at the end it is not. The segment in between songs is very loud in a couple of places so a relaxed sleepy kid is startled. Then the last two songs (I think they are the last two) have terrible visuals. One has a puppet flying around and it is the ugliest thing. Another has a little men on the crib. One song is about a kid who keeps waking up in the night and going in to his parents bed - he ends up getting to stay and the mom sleeps in his bed. Not an idea I want to promote.

Like all Earth records, this is by no means a pop album. There's nothing candy-coated or crisp about this music. It's raw and fuzzy, and, well, earthy. The first song (\\"Ripped on Facist Ideas\\") is classic Earth; a half hour long sludgy, dirgy piece that will rattle your car's chassis if played at the proper volume (i.e., all the way up). \\"Geometry of Murder\\" is my fave on this album. The way the melody gets played around with is really cool. \\"German Dental Work\\" is somewhat more monolithic and harder to appreciate at first, but well worth the effort. \\"Divine and Bright\\" is an alright song, with Kurt Cobain singing the vocals along with Kelly Canary. \\"Dissolution 1\\" kind of brings us back to the same vibe we had in \\"Geometry of Murder\\". All in all a surprisingly listenable album that makes good car travel fare and easy listening before bedtime.

JTB takes disparate elements of post-punk, emo, classic rock, and even New Wave to create a modern masterpiece. \\"Sea Anemone\\" is without a doubt my favorite track, but with the exception of the weak \\"Lemon Yellow Black\\", every song on Orange Rhyming Dictionary stands alone as a great piece of work.

I loved Jawbreaker, and Blake has really brought the same virtues over to JTB: interesting musical shifts while sticking to his pop sensibilities, great lyrics which actually seem to have improved over the Jawbreaker albums. But the album's missing something. It's missing a sparkle, that stand on your chair and sing along feeling. The music seems like it almost wants to break out, but doesn't, creating a drone, bland taste. It's like a horrible singer trying to sing a U2 song Bono style; there's something there, but there's something restricting it. And I also notice Blake's not doing any screaming like the Jawbreaker albums, so maybe he's not getting the vocal melodies like it should/could be. But hell, I also hate 24 hour Revenge Therapy (BIVOUAC's Jawbreaker's best IMO), so maybe there are some sides to Blake's music I don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was eager to hear this album as it came highly reccomended. I was acutely disappointed. The album is nauseatingly narcissistic It seems almost that the band was following some campish paradigm of the outcast rockstar who exploits his own troubles to get girls and money while at the same time abhorring it. The only thing that keeps it from descending into the mirky abyss of MTV rock is some eccentric melodies. The lyrics are extremely affected and surpass depressing. A rounded, intelligent voice doesnt mix well with corny references to methadone. I felt I was privy to some angst ridden, high school misanthrope's journal. The music behind the words is unremarkable. It is mundane and boring. I have never written a review. but found myself so nauseated by this wimper of an album.

One day it clicked, i had it on and got goosebumps from the fantastic lyrics, it didn't leave my cd player for weeks while my friend begged for me to return it. Eventually I bought my own copy before returning hers. This album is brilliant, 'sea anemone' and 'i typed for miles' being the best tracks, the entire remaining album follows closely (with the expetion of maybe 1 or 2 tracks) this is a must for allto own (i have done my part in turning people on to it)... give it multiple chances and it will pay of f... brilliant!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punchy, but not really Pop.","review":"This college radio-y album could be justifiably considered indie, but not very poppy. The sound is more dragging (more suited to emo) but doesn't have the same kind of crystalline sound a lot of indie pop has. It's good, blithe music that reminds me of Built to Spill with a punk-ravaged vocalist, but is nothing to really soak into your soul. It's got urban-hole-in-the-wall-club vibes as well as some alt-country landscapes, and I can definitely imagine this band being supersweet live. I'd reccommend getting this cd used, but nothing I'd ask for someone to buy for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than i thought it would be.","review":"I'm glad I bought the Orange Rhyming Dictionary.

Meaning no disrespect, but if he was seriously trying to carry off this Liberace-esque charade, he should have left out the precious early photo of himself looking like Norma Shearer with his two adopted sons, and most CERTAINLY a later photo with his hunky adopted \\"grandson\\" at his side (said grandson being a full grown man when adopted.

One definite plus is Yvette Vickers, who looks good in leopard-skin underwear. The tawdry little plot is a combination of Erskine Caldwell style southern lust and adultery portrayed against the background of a 1950s/early 1960s low-budget sci-fi flick. Some of the supporting characters resemble the \\"gloom, despair, and misery\\" guys from TV's Hee Haw. There are atomic-size leeches in the local swamp. The authorities are baffled when local-yocals mysteriously disappear. As in many of these old sci-fi flicks, the script wastes time having the various characters dispute that anything unnatural is going on, and then arguing over how to deal with the problem.Ultimately, this movie can either be totally disregarded, or taken as unintentional humor.

The print of A Bucket of Blood used for this DVD starts off very badly; it's choppy and distracting from the wonderful opening monologue (\\"I will talk to you of art, for there is nothing else to talk about...\\"). Worse, the sound quality is muffled, and it sounds like noise reduction was applied to a master tape that wasn't recorded with Dolby - instead of removing hiss, all the high and low tones are reduced to a flat middle-range.

Sorry: not good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"This book is definately different. It mixes real life situations with inspiration. It gives hope when in the worst predicaments. It is a very to-the-point book where the author shares her most intimate of life stories with her audience. She uses comparisons of everyday life to relay a spiritual message. I've never experienced this form of teaching before and it is the most welcome change. Something I can actually relate to and understand, along with being interesting. I am excited for the next book to come out!Thanks Vanda!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy Scouts Merit Badge book","review":"This book is all information and merit badge requirements.

I am an electronic junkie. Pioneer DVD 640 H was my first DVD hard drive recorder and so far it is flawless in recording my favorite soap operas and burning DVDS. My first DVD recorder was a Magnavox using a DVD disc to record my shows and I found that recording directly to a disc was quite unstable and sometimes it freezes in the recorder which really upsets me. Then, I found the Pioneer 160 Gb HARD DRIVE DVD recorder in Amazon and I loved this recorder. The hard drive is stable and it doesnt freeze at all. I love the erase section editing feature of this recorder because it makes it easier for me to edit out commercials. I am a satisfied customer. So if you are just looking for a simple and dependable brand for a DVD hard drive recorder, the pioneer DVR- 640 H won't disappoint you.Pro: dependable DVD recorder with a reasonable price and user friendlyCON: simple recorder and not for complex editings.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Burner","review":"I bought this product for use by our AV department at church. After a month of using the product, we view it as a great asset to our transition from VHS to DVD. The learning curve was about 2 weeks, but in the product's defence (and the men in the AV department), that represents only a few hours of hands-on experience. We are very impressed with the speed of the burner. Also, picture quality is still very good, even with 4 hours on a disc. I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product!","review":"The Pioneer DVR-640H is EXTREMELY easy to use!!!!! I hardly had to refer to the instruction manual to record, set timer recording and watch the programs (until I try some more exotic copying or recording). The picture from the recorded program on the Hard Drive is actually better than the original on the TV. Recording to a DVD was easy too. I'm loving not having to constantly put in a new tape or DVD to record new programs. We deliberately did not want a subscriber recorder because we didn't want anyone on the tile roof breaking tiles to install another satellite line. Setting the channel manually is easy. Great product and is working fine so far (2 months.) Hopefully the reliablity will continue for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVR 640","review":"A very versitile unit, many inputs, decent hd all this for a low price.

There's no way I would call this a \\"horror\\" novel; I've read a lot of horror and this doesn't qualify. It's sort of a mystery with a supernatural flavor. The drawbacks: 1) characters are very one-dimensional (so the reader doesn't even care if they are killed), 2) the \\"bad guy\\" is known from the very start, 3) the dialogue is stilted. I could go on, but suffice it to say that I would recommend this book only if you have nothing else to read and are pretty desperate."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREEPY JOURNEY","review":"Nicholson captures small town life in an unsettling fashion in this tale of evil centered on a red church and the mysterious \\"pastor\\" who comes to start a new religion. The plot has been described in various details, so I'll spare you any additional narratives.Suffice to say, there are several frightening scenes, some unusual plot twists, and an always impending sense of doom. The book sometimes falters in key spots where the tension is slackened by a little too much padding. But, overall, the dialogue and scenarios are well written and chilling.RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the TRUTH about this book","review":"It reads like a \\"spooky story\\" made up by the counselor at camp, but in this case it's Bible Camp, with an overdose of sermonizing. Kindle users, beware of downloading the sample and thinking you might like this. It's what I did, and they don't get to the absurd supernatural premise till later. A boy and a sheriff solve a murder? That sounds like an intriguing mystery story. A town gets targeted by a murderous entity in human form that's been rising from the bowels of the earth since the dawn of time? Not so much. Sorry for the spoiler but you don't need to bother reading this anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"While, well written, this book was just a bit too much for me. Not for those with a weak stomach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great horror read","review":"This was the first Scott Nicholson book I've read. I found him to be a wonderful storyteller and have already read a few of his other books. The star of the book is Archer McFall and he's not the good guy. The negative reviews seem to focus on wanting a \\"happy ending\\". This is a horror book with true horror. An old town with a dark history and characters with a horrid past. There are some scary scenes and that's what drew me in. I was impressed with the story and his style of writing. Some reviews are comparing Scott Nicholson to Stephen King and Dean Koontz and that is not fair. There is no need to compare them, just enjoy them all for what each one brings to the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK BLOWS","review":"This book sucks so hard.

Throughout the book, I felt that the author was very talented, but a lot of what was happening was stereotypical of a Christian horror novel. But even with that being said, I still enjoyed the story. The ending was what did it for me.Absolutely loved the twist at the end! I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the way the author set the tone of the story and then came out of left field with the ending left me thinking for days afterwards. Great ending to a good story! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a tale of horror with a surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not usually a fan of the horror genre","review":"I am not really a fan of the horror genre, but I will read about anything that is free. The Red Church is more than just horror, it is more creepy suspense. The characters are well developed, the book well edited (a big pet peeve of mine).I had read a couple of other Nicholson books and was less impressed. Now that I have read this one - which I have since learned is actually his first novel- I think I might give him another try or two.I think some prior reviewers had some issues with his treatment of the Baptist religion, but it is fiction which allows for literary license.At any rate, if you need a good read to chill your blood this fall you might consider adding this one to your Halloween library.I just bought an abandoned church and I can tell you what color I will NOT be painting it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite author","review":"This is the second book I have read by Scott Nicholson. I loved them both. The Red Church reminds me of Stephen King type novels. It grabs you at the beginning and doesn't let go. It is hard to say too much without spoilers, but I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading authors like Stephen King, or Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Church Turned Out to be a Red Herring","review":"I was excited by the book's description and it was free. That's enough for me to download it. Pretty much a waste of time. Predictable and trite. Plot was only skin-deep and not worth the effort to even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good..Great since it's free","review":"I actually enjoyed reading this book. It is kind of dark and a little gruesome (but what do you want out of a horror book?). Very nice storyline and I really liked the ending. One of the best free Kindle books that I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good elements but ultimately disappointing","review":"This is the first Nicholson book I've read and I'll be in no rush to read another. Along with the commonality of the dark subject matter, his writing style is very similar to Stephen King. Almost too similar. But while Stephen King was always a master storyteller, roping me in and keeping me enthralled into the wee hours with his best works, The Red Church seemed to drag on and by the time I got 2/3 through I had to force myself to finish it. The book has its good moments and captivating elements, but the story and overall experience never lived up to its potential in my opinion. Some other reviews have commented on religious implications - I am non-religious so I found nothing offensive nor redeemable in the author's musings in this regard, however I enjoy spiritual exploration and the lack of any meaningful impact considering the substantial verbiage spent here is a good example of how this book falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I was skeptical since this book was so cheap at only $0.99 but I was pleasantly surprised! Really good, I couldn't put it down. Now I am stuck on Nicholson and will certainly be purchasing more of his books. I love the way he writes....amazing author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read is good to find","review":"This was the first time I have read anything by Scott Nicholson and I surely did enjoy it.

I look forward to reading more by this author and will be telling family and friends about my new discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first novel","review":"I've heard a lot of good things about this books, so I throught I'd give it a chance. I was very pleased on how good this book was.In the mid 1860's a chruch was built for the Reverend Wendall McFall. His sermons were about God's other Son. He was going to undo all of the work that Jesus did. But for this to happen, a sacrifice was needed. A sacrifice had to be a child. When he did this, the towns people hanged him. They thought that it was going to be the end....it was just the beginning. Then in present day someone comes and claims that he's God's other son, then the murders start. Are they the work of this \\"other son\\" or are they the work of a creature that haunts the church. And who is this creature. Read the book and find the answersNicholas has a powerful style of writing. He has the abablity to keep the read glued to the page. The characters are life like, you help to want to get to know them.If you love horror, then you have to start this book. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I just could not get into it. I managed to finish it, but it was a struggle. I did not find it to be the least bit scary or suspenseful. The ending seemed completely arbitrary, and I did not think it flowed logically from the story. It was supposed to be based on a dark interpretation of christian theology, but the belief system portrayed as Christianity would not be believed by anyone over the age of 10. \\"the exorcist\\" pulled this off pretty well, but not this one. I was in the mood for a spooky page-turner, but was disappointed. At least it was only 99 cents, but it turned out to be overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Fun","review":"Scott Nicholson is a newly discovered author for me. This is the second book of his that I have read. I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz, and a milder fan of Stephen King. So far, I have found that Nicholson's style falls somewhere in the middle of these two authors- but with his own, unique flavor. This book is both scary and well-written. I especially like how Nicholson provides insight into his characters, making me feel as if I really know them. I will definitely buy more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Very good read! It was hard to put it down once I got started.

This is my first Nicholson book and I'm quite impressed not only by his mastery of language but by his character development, plot development, and clean copy editing.

I like a very certain feel to the love affair I call my reading experience and usually if I stray too far, I am just not happy. But Since getting our Kindle I have been a little more willing, with the lower cost of books, to experiment a little more, to try new loves. I am not screaming from the mountaintops that this is the next best horror author, but it was a good read. I will keep the book and it will get read again at some point. This is an author I will purchase more books from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good horror tale,","review":"This was very worth the purchase. I am surprised by how well written it was, including the varied perspectives of children, police, adults, cultists...and so on. This reminds me a bit of a modern HP Lovecraft tale. It also has a very rural horror taste.I will definately read more from this author. I thought it might be a cheap evening read but I was thrilled when I learned it was a well written full length novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, disappointing development","review":"At first I was intrigued by the apparent premise of the book, a cult's belief in the idea of a \\"second son\\" of God who was a rival of Jesus and has come to earth to correct Jesus' mistakes. But this interesting idea quickly becomes lost in a befuddling tangle of ghost story, curses, creatures, and caricatures. I read it all the way through, both because I hate to not know how any book ends once I've started it and because I kept hoping that the author would pull the story out of the fire. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really bad...","review":"I bought this book because of the good reviews, but I couldn't finish it because it was so bad! A haunted church? a ghost hanging in the tree? a preacher who turns into a mountain lion? Jesus told nothing but lies? Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good supernatural horror!","review":"I bought this book because the author, Scott Nicholson, was to speak at a conference I would be attending. What an unexpected pleasure! Because I am in 2 book clubs that read more mainstream literary books, I had not read many horror/thriller books in the last 15 years. This grabbed me and pulled me firmly back in the genre - Nicholson's style is reminicient of Dean Koontz with a touch of Clive Barker. It is a well written book that fully captures how our fears can get the better of our senses. His portrayal of NC mountain life and beliefs was right on target (being a NC resident myself). I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes books by Dean Koontz, Clive Barker, or Stephen King. I will definitely read more by Scott Nicholson - my only complaint is that some of his books are not in print at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While overall the writing style was enjoyable, the story simply intensified in it's non-sensical nature as the book progressed, leaving the reader confused, unsatisfied, and feeling like potential was lost for a satisfying ending. It began as fairly believable but rapidly became far-fetched at a pace that tried to say \\"There is more to this story than their seems\\" but merely contrasted uncomfortably with the attempts to give logical reasons for some of the happenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Finished the book only to find out if the good guys won, almost didn't but didn't have anything else to read at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Church","review":"Couldn't put this book down till I finished.

(It also kept me up past 3am for other reasons.)So creepy. So good.I might just become a Nicholson fan after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good verses evil","review":"This is my first Scott Nicholson book, so had no idea what to expect. It started out vaguely reminiscent of James Patterson, but then moved into supernatural...GORY supernatural. Ronnie Day, and his Brother, Tim, side-track into the cemetery at the dreaded Red Church, where they discover items belonging to Boonie Houck. Strange. But not nearly as strange as being grabbed by a bloody, torn up Boonie. If Ronnie was afraid of the Red Church, he's REALLY afraid now!This is about evil, in it's worst form, and the effects it has on a small, backwoods community. It's about salvation, or the lack of such, good & evil. If you aren't into reading about salvation, be warned that this talks about Jesus and evil. It's about \\"the Second Son\\" of God, as seen in the eyes of Archer McFall. It's creepy, gory, and edge-of-your-seat reading.I have to add, here, that this is NOT, in any way, true, except at the very end, where Ronnie finally REALLY accepts the Lord as his Savior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was cheap!","review":"Here's the deal... if you read Stephen King or John Saul (his later books --- not the good ones).... you will probably like this novel. If you're not into characters turning into illogical, supernatural \\"things,\\" then don't waste your money. For some reason, I thought the supernatural connotations would be logically explained in the end... but nope, it was just unbelievable junk. The book wasn't spooky, scary or anything else... just another Stephen King wannabe..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like It","review":"The plot is strange. The writing is mediocre at best. Comparing this author to King or Koontz is a joke. He is not even in the same league. The ending is sudden with a very \\"Huh?\\" like quality. The monster is NOT scary. The dialogue does not flow smoothly. I can't believe so many people liked this book! The only good things I have to say about it is that is was short and it only cost a dollar to download it to my Nook. If you want to read something scary read (or re-read)Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\", one of the finest and scariest horror novels ever written (in my humble opinion). It will be time much better spent, even if you have already read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good content...ending a little anticlimactic","review":"The Red Church has great potential, sustaining suspense throughout most of the story. The language does a great job of painting a dark and sinister tone, along with the mysterious nature of the Red Church and the happenings there. The story is told from the perspective of multiple major characters, allowing for a great breadth of perspective than if a single voice recounted the tale. Unfortunately, for me at least the ending was somewhat anticlimactic and I wished the characters had found more resolution of their personal problems, each of which was fairly well developed in the three or four major characters. Overall a good book and well worth the current price for an intriguing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Scary!","review":"I'm a new Scott Nicholson fan and working my way through each of his books. The Red Church was no disappointment. Rich character development and more of his Appalachian lore makes for a very compelling story. The bonus material at the end was interesting as well, where he shares with the readers some of his thoughts regarding the characters and the story line. Another great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Hellfire","review":"I read, and generally enjoy, Stephen King (except for that cosmic turtle crap in \\"It\\"). I also read Robert McCammon.

The description of the novel did not indicate that it has a Christian based theme, it therefore comes across as a bit preachy and over emphasized to the point of redundancy. Never able to connect with the characters didn't help matters. As opposed to other complaints with the ending, that was one part that I found worthy of the drudgery of slogging through the story. As a Christian, I understand that the darkness is just as eternal as the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read, but keep the lights on!!","review":"A great scary story.

Most of the characters are well drawn (Ronnie's dad was a little too dimensional for me). The plot keeps moving.I liked how so much of the book was from a pre-teen's point of view, and Ronnie was a great character whom I very much sympathized with. From his crisis of faith to how he took care of his brother, he was good all the way.Although the underlying mythology was completely different, the book reminded me a bit of Lovecraft, so if you like his books, you'll probably like this one.It's tagged as Christian fiction, but don't worry. Faith IS an important part of the book, but non-Christians (like myself) can read and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Thriller by an Amazing Author","review":"Let me start by telling you that I have a very short attention span and generally struggle to make it through a book. With that said, this book had me in suspense as to what was going to happen from when I first started it on my Kindle to the final page. When I say final page I mean I read the Essays and the descriptions of his other books. The layout of the characters were detailed enough to get me engaged in them personally but the story moved along fast enough to hold my attention. Very few Authors have the ability to get me so interested in the outcome of a story. I am about to start on another one of his books after having great experiences and journeys with the 2 I have read so far. (Flowers and The Red Church)I have very high hopes for the rest of Scott's books.

One sure sign that I've read a good book is when I think about it for months afterward and this is one of those. Let me say first that I am a huge fan of Stephen King, I've read them all. The Red Church reminded me of the earlier, scary books of King's. But not to compare, because Nicholson is in a field of his own and has his own creepy way of developing characters and unfolding the story. I was never bored reading this book. I like to learn as much as I can about the characters in the book I'm reading so I can figure out why they do what they do but I hate a lot of boring 'filler'. There is no 'filler' in The Red Church, it is non-stop story-telling. I read it in two evenings and wanted more when I was finished.To Scott Nicholson: Archer scared me 100 times more than the Bell Monster.

I found it distasteful and inane. I stopped reading \\"horror\\" books long ago, after reading King's \\"Cujo\\" and being so disturbed by the child's death in the book. I should have stayed away from the genre. This book had no moral lessons that I could determine and the usual graphic violence. Not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad characters, Weak plot","review":"The Red Church was recommended to me. As I like the dark horror genre I gave it a go.It had potential to be a decent book, but the execution was terrible! I had no problem whether the characters lived or died, they were hard to identify with and not very likable; the plot was predictable and weak, so not much suspense or surprises; all in all it was a waste of time reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Horror Story","review":"WOW. Simply, WOW. Scott Nicholson channels his best Stephen King to give us a delightfully scary read that was near impossible to put down. As someone who lives in the mountains described in The Red Church I though his characters were spot on. I know these people. I live in their neighborhood which makes the novel all the more creepier. This author needs to be read by a much larger audience. Furthermore, The Red Church is begging to be made into a film. In the right hands, it would be quite a thrill ride. I look forward to reading other books by this gifted author. Don't miss out on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Normally I only read books based on true events but I read the description of this book and it sounded great. Well once I started reading it I could not put it down. Will be looking into reading more of this author's books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange but good.","review":"Weird book and I've never quite read anything like it. It was a fast and creepily fun read that had me hooked until I turned the last page.I will definitely be reading more from Nicholson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the rave reviews for this book, I hate to be the spoiler, but I really didn't care for this book. The premise sounded interesting, the reviews were great, and the price was right, so I tried it. As I read, I kept waiting for the ideas to come together in some sort of coherent whole, or at least resolve some of the ambiguities, but it never did.This \\"horror\\" book that may have worked thirty years ago when readers were less sophisticated and less demanding, but it didn't work for me now. The writing was almost lyrical at times when describing the countryside and the mood, but the plot was rambling and very unconvincing. After reading some of the descriptions, I thought, \\"O.K., now it's going to get good,\\" but it didn't. And it didn't scare me either. It bored me.I think this author has talent and may come up with some great writing in the future. But not now. At least, not in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Church","review":"Too much nonsense and repetition of the same phrases. It just became silly.

Kind of reminds me of The Twilight Zone old TV show. If you know that show you know what I mean. This book pulls you in & you feel the main characters, you bite on the plot bait, following it along, knowing some, suspecting more, and then when it's done you get a little something to think about for awhile. I'd recommend it to just about everyone who likes supernatural stories with a religious touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and bizzare book","review":"Very freaky.

The book was so bad that i never even finished it which it totally out of character. The plot was hard to follow, the characters never developed and the editing left much to be desired !! Finally came to conclusion about halfway through that i didn't even care what was going to happen. Don't bother with this one - not sure about the others written by him as there seem to be many........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read Red Really","review":"Sorry, but this is a rather sad novel, even though it is someone's debut novel. I have to confess to not being able to finish it because it is indeed so bad. The plot is predictable, not very suspenseful. The characters aren't very likeable. The dialogue is terrible. The things the characters do are stupid. The central idea itself isn't bad, but would have been handled much better by a stronger, first-rate novelist. It's hard to believe this book even got published. I cannot in good faith recomment it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horror or bible class?","review":"I was looking for a good horror story and read the reviews on this book. It was recommended judging from what I had been searching for on this site. I had been reading Dean Koontz with hits and misses. Most reviewers compared this to Stephen King. The reviews of this book seemed to be the exact thing I was looking for but it came across as preachy to me. I understand that it revolves around a church and religion would be part of it, which is what drew me to it, because it could be \\"believable\\", but it just came across as preachy. It seems like the author used some horror (lightly used) and gave me a long drawn out sermon on the concept \\"Jesus Saves\\" which was mentioned over and over and over again. The ending did nothing for me. Once I finished, that was it. I didn't think about the book any longer, which is what I love about books. The drawing me in and making me think long after I've finished. All this did was disappoint me."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD illustration is correct, album tracks/music samples are not.","review":"I own the album illustrated from rewind records.When I bought it, it was not an import.The music samples & track titles that amazon provided appear to be from some jazz fusion album,(not from the actual Airborne CD I own A27569 (REWIND 55019-2).The correct album tracks are as follows:1.

Within a couple days, he couldn't wag his tail--it just hung limp. While I don't know for sure, I suspected the Hartz Flea & Tick drops which I applied along his spine and base of his tail, where he gets more fleas. Being out in the middle of nowhere, I couldn't take him to a vet, but his tail function returned to normal gradually within 2 days and he's fine now.When I returned home, I related what happened to a vet friend of mine and she warned me against using Hartz products because they have an atrocious safety record.Bottom line: I was looking to save a couple bucks by using the cheaper Hartz flea drops and figured that if it has regulatory approval and is on the market, it must be safe. Wrong. Please do some research on the safety of this product before putting it on your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intimate And Moving Portrait Of The Artist And Her Ancestral Land!","review":"A beautiful and compelling presentation by Soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian of Armenia; its ancient culture, its soul searching music, its spiritually haunting sacred sights and monuments, its majestic geography, and its checkered history throughout the ages. Her interpretation of the various sacred and folk songs presented here, is profoundly disarming in its simplicity and purity of expression. Her soprano voice is glorious and grand. With a warm velvety timbre and a marvelous tessitura; it soars with ease and seemless fluidity thru all passaggios from the silver toned top, to the rich and full low notes. A beautiful and important Artist. And a first class presentation of an Ancient Land and her colorful and rich heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"A Long Journey Home is Isabel Bayrakdarian's journey back to her homeland, she takes us on a journey to discover the history, the sights and culture of Armenia. I found this program fascinating and informative but I enjoyed her singing the most. Isabel Bayrakdarian has the voice of an angel and her melodies can lift your spirits, most audiences may know her from her contribution to the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Soundtrack, she provides the vocals for \\"Evenstar\\".Aside from her wonderful singing, you learn a lot about Armenian history and see her personal connection to her hertiage and country,a simply delightful treat, I recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates history, different cultures and of course, very wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR SERIOUS MUSICOLOGISTS.","review":"For anyone who lived through the early beginnings of Rock N Roll, the 50's and 60's this book is a goldmine. It lists by artists most all of their charted records and some others that might not have made the charts but that were essential to the development of Rock N Roll.It contains many photos, facts about the artists, months & years that the songs were released and the record labels.I grew up during the 50's and was there when it all happened, so for anyone interested in collecting music from that period, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCK ON - THE SOLID GOLD YEARS - UPDATED VERSION","review":"MY HUSBAND & I ARE AVID DOO-WOP FANS & WE HAVE HAD THIS BOOK SINCE THE EARLY 80'S.

The stories are pretty weak(unimaginative and repetitive) compared to his other works like COBRA and KABUTO--and the \\"Neo-Tokyo\\" setting gets tiring after a while, along with too much pointless sex (waaay more then his other series. Dunno if he's trying to compete with HeavyMetal Magazine or something, lol). If you're a diehard fan of Terasawa then get this.

The story seemed like such a unique concept that i was sure it would be something exciting. I was pretty disappointing thou, being that it was direct to video and probably had a small budget, the special effects were pretty lame. The background story was actually pretty good. However, it was buried under cheesy special effects and performed by Sabrina and Boy Meets World outcasts, that are all grown up, so it was hard to tell. After thinking about it a little, I could see where they were going. Overall, it was ok, pretty much just a direct to video version of a failed movie with a similar story line, Stay Alive.

Unfortunately I have to conclude that either these reviews were planted by the publisher or the reviewers were not very well educated about the American civil war.

The whole idea of a belly dance workout sounds really fun, but this is just boring. There is waaaaay too much repetition of the moves in this video. It feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again. I get so bored with this video I can't even make it all the way through.As for the workout quality, I don't feel like this video gets my heart rate up enough.

I recommend a coin hip scarf it helps you with the hip moves (and makes you feel more like a dancer). The only negative comment has nothing to do with the content but more of the menu, I like a workout dvd that will allow you to by pass all the intro talk and dance part and allow you to get to the actual instructional part without having to fast forward.

I liked them so much that I decided to purchase the dvd. I was looking forward to continuing the program.The problem is not the program but the product itself. The dvd is not synchronized properly.

I finally gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good in terms of both exercise AND dance","review":"I bought this DVD after reading the reviews and was extremely dissapointed. First of all, the instruction is horrible. The disembodied voice instructing you does very little to actually tell you what you are doing. In order to get the full effect of some of these movements you need to know exactly what you are supposed to be doing. In this case, they are basically doing standard exercises, while saying these are traditional bellydancing movements. And frequently these exercises are done in a manner that is incorrect and places too much strain on your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Belly Dancing at its finest for those who want to try it but don't have any expertise -- just fun, and a lot of good workout, sweat, burning, and laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hips, buns and thighs","review":"That's the worst DVD I've ever got, it's nothing but a waste of money.

This is not a very good fitness DVD unless you have never worked out before or have been bed ridden for years. I had a stroke a few years ago & after doing for only a couple weeks, I found was not challenging at all.You have to fast forward through the twins talking and dancing between segments, which if they had taken those out & added more exercising in, might have made the DVD better.The other less annoying facts are that the choreography is disjointed & the narrative isn't inline with the moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE video for beginning bellydancers","review":"This, combined with the Basic Dance and Fat Burning DVDs in the same series are the first videos anyone interested in learning to bellydance should buy.

They are a bit hard to take seriously with their plastered smiles and over done moves. DO NOT get these videos to learn how to dance.

There is not much actual dancing, just isolation of movement in parts of the body. I wouldn't mind the small amount of dancing if the workout was good, but it's not. There is little to no instruction and some of the exercises seem as if they could lead to some serious back injuries.

I just started to read as a hobby in this past summer.. I am only reading Star Wars books and to me, personally, thought this was crap. I think it just was Luceno. The way he tries to describe everything just seemed to make my mind drift into other places and not on what he was trying to say.The story was okay, different from the Clone Wars animated series which I enjoy. He did through in a few new things to the Star Wars universe.Overall, I did not care for this book. It took me a long time to finish it because I had to keep going back and rereading what I missed (because my mind would drift). I might pick up another book of Luceno to just see if he is the same for those, or was it just this.Hope this helps..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have Been a Movie in its Own Right","review":"This novel was a great lead-up to Episode III. In fact, it would have been great had George Lucas made this and Episode III as a two-part movie. The story was sound, the excitement and anticipation were there, and the transition between scenes (as well as to Episode III) was seamless.I particularly liked the hunt for the elusive Darth Sidious, which gave the story a touch of mystery. Another thing I liked was the airtime given to General Grievous, which was greater than the airtime given to him in Episode III and developed his character. Grievous was a star in this novel.4.5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Labyrinth of Evil is a good book. Luceno did a good job of writing the book and adding a lightsaber duel with Mace Windu and General Greivous. Luceno also did a good job writing the attack on Coruscant and the kidnapping of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Anakin showed his true power by bringing the roof and walls down on Dooku, Obi-Wan, and himself. It was smart to finally let the jedi know about Darth Sidous and Dooku's affiliation with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining use of Star Wars lingo and sound effects","review":"If you want to know what happed between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith this is the book for you.

It served the purpose. The story has some interesting points and some back fill of information on some of the characters. There seemed to be some ground work laid for a story on the origins of Darth Sidious. Look for that series soon. One thing I really disliked was the insertion of innuendos--very, very thinly veiled innuendos--comparing Palpatine to Bush. Does Luceno think that some of his readers will be suaded to form their opinions of Bush and his policies based on this comparison? It was a completely egregious, needless distraction from the story. I hate being spoon fed propaganda of any kind in the guise of entertainment. But perhaps it was insisted upon by Lucas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff - expands story","review":"An easy, fun book that gives some background to Episode III. It's not War and Peace, but it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prequel for the the third prequel","review":"I thought it was a great book...until I read episode III. If you are a diehard star wars fan, read labyrinth of evil and it will help you understand why episode III starts off the way it strangely does. 3 1/2 stars. (no where near a great star wars read)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"Very nicely sets up the events of Revenge of the Sith, from Anakin and Obi Wan chasing Viceroy Gunnray while General Grevious begins his attack on Courscant in order to kidnap the Chancellor Palpatine. The Jedi Council growing more suspicious of Palpatine while they seem to be winning the Clone War. We also get to see Senators Organa and Mon Mothma which is nice since they along with Padme will start off the Rebellion. Palpatine's chat with Padme were eery and hinted that he knew of either her marriage or her pregnancy or possibly both. Even now after reading it a dozen times I can't be sure which he's hinting towards with Palpatine you can never be certain exactly what he knows. That of course its what makes him Palpatine. Well that and the fact he's so brillantly evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"LoE vs Clone Wars Vol II","review":"This is a quick-paced, fun read that effectively sets up Ep III...Luceno also does a great job of tying together all the Clone Wars Novels, Dark Horse Comics and Clone Wars Vol I Cartoon series...however, it must be a great disappointment to him, and of some potential confusion to the reader, that these scenes and events often contradict the plot of the new Clone Wars Vol II micro-series...having recently finished reading this book, and currently catching the nightly airings of Clone Wars Vol II, it's kind of like listening two different versions of the same story...nevertheless, I recommend this novel for SW fans, especially if you don't take the contradictions too seriously"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing really special","review":"This book is alright if you're just looking to read more about the Star Wars universe but its nothing special.While it does give you some background on the characters such as General Greivous, its not really enough to justify the book. You can simply go to the Star Wars website and read about the \\"expanded universe\\" to learn more details.Some of the dialogue is questionable. Such as Anakin questioning Obi-wan about things that happened in Attack of the Clones...which is three years ago to them.Also, the political views of the author are imprinted in this book alot more blatently than need be. Star Wars never was and never will be a commentary about the US political system. He could have done a better job if he had left out US politics and focused more on a plotline.If you're looking to learn more about the Star Wars universe, buy a Star Wars encyclopedia or just search the internet; you'll get the information much faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and exciting read.","review":"I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one wasnt bad... pretty brainless adventure story but one of the better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"You must read this book to understand the episode III.

I thought Clone Wars Vol. 2 tied into Revenge Of The Sith. How does this tie in as well? If anybody can answer that, without giving away anything, I'd love to know before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased with this book","review":"I just got done reading Labyrinth of evil a few days ago. I thought it was empty of substance. No real questions were answered about the forth coming movie. I also found typos all over. If James Luceno is that much of an accomplished writer I shouldn't have found that many mistakes. It is also suppossed to be the book before Star Wars III well at the end of the book we are left hanging in the air. By the time he comes out with a book to end this one the movie will be on DVD.

It will unlock the secret history of the Freemasons and how they have continued to plague the Catholic Church throughout the years. The author goes to great lengths to show how Christianity throughout this country has been condemned through the actions of so many of the judges who have very close ties to the Freemasons.You may ask, \\"if this society is so secret, then how did the author get hold of such detailed information about the High Degrees in side the order?\\" Through a very exhaustive method of research and people who have seen what goes on, it provided the details necessary to show what really goes on behind those closed doors. Any Catholic who knows someone who belongs to the Masons should order this book and send them a copy of it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just got it today","review":"Like the title says, I just recieved my copy today. The book is bigger than I thought,which is great because it will take me longer to read and will be time well spent at work.haha. I bought a used copy and its in ok condition but no problem,I knew what to expect. Whats so great about this used copy is whoever had it before me was really into it and I can tell they were doing research along with it because they highlighted key points and took notes on the edges of the pages. Even more interesting is they left a newspaper article in the book of a 2002 story when a judge appointed by JFK passed away. They dated the paper and even wrote NON-MASON on the side, which tells me they were doing research, which is awesome. Can't wait to start reading the book tomorrow and will most likely do a follow-up when finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"damned by their own words","review":"Mr. Fisher has used their own documents to expose Freemasonry for what it is -- superficially a charitable fraternity, but fundamentally a secret society committed to destroying all religion except worship of \\"The Great Architect [of _this_ world],\\" namely Satan.

Instead of framing the book in a sensible outline fashion beginning with the foundation nd history of the Mason's and then taking us through to modern times, sins an all, this book just jumps right into the all of the \\"bad\\" things Mason's have done, or might have done. I don't argue with the facts but they are so poorly presented I don't think I'll make it past page 100 before I throw this book away.

I finally found the trick using no tool...Dont just pinch the tabs on the hose fitting and pull. You need to pinch the tabs, then push the fitting forward towards the fireware (this removes the tension on the tabs against the pipe), then pull forward. It comes right off. The trick is getting the tension off the tabs first by pushing forward with the tabs depressed. Once to do it, you'll go \\"wow that was easy\\".

There is nothing really to savour here except for the most ardent Mehta enthusiast. Hamlet, for instance, is by many considered one of the best Liszt symphonic poems, but if you encountered it for the first time in this performance, you'll have a hard time figuring out why. Both that one and the other works sound utterly uninspired. Not only are the works consistently played too slowly, there is no sense of musical argument or structure - they all seem to move from one dull episode to another. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring.......","review":"Mehta and the BPO - how could one go wrong?This is how: Surround one of the flashiest, most superficial of second-rate conductors (still around today) with the luxury and comfort of the plush upholstery possessed by the sumptuous Berlin Philharmonic and what happens? HE FALLS ASLEEP!A few minutes of the deadly dull tempi adopted by Mehta here should have been enough to propel the producer out of the studio to get a new battery for Mehta's pacemaker (if he has one).Could it be that the public's opinion of this dreadful musical mismatch is reflected by the absurdly low price asked for the used copies? (I sold my copy after only two hearings).If you want only the tone poems, I suppose Haitink, Noseda,or Masur are the safest recommendations.And if only the Hungarian Rhapsodies are wanted , Fischer and Dorati are the clearly the conductors to go for (and both with enthusiasm).As for Mehta, somebody do him a favor and wake him up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is spiced","review":"Info provided doesn't disclose that this is spiced apple syrup.

The only reason I have taken 1 star away from my rating of this book is because this book just wasn't for me.In specific I didn't like the constant reference to \\"The Hand of Destiny\\", it got sickening. The red kingfisher that \\"led\\" Anne to the island and helped her companions find her when she was lost was just too unrealistic for me. And finally, I didn't like the setting either. I guess jungles and strange native peoples just aren't my thing for a romance novel.But I cannot say this was a bad book simply because of these things.

I own most of the Hollies catalogue up to the mid-70s but this does not belong with it. I keep revisiting this hoping that I will 'warm' to it but I can't. This pales beside anything they did.

The arrangements are heavy on synthesizer, light on Hollies. This group showcased its brilliance with arrangements on three previous albums full of outside material (\\"Hollies Sing Dylan,\\" \\"Romany\\" and \\"Buddy Holly\\") but there's none of that here. In fact the members did not even attend the same studios to make these tracks.A Hollies fan will have to buy this album for the rare chance at the original vocal trio, but aside from \\"If the Lights Go Out,\\" there will be nothing here to enjoy aside from those voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book with Peters' exuberant, jazzy style!!","review":"This book presents a strategy for meeting the uncertainty of the current competitive markets through creating customer responsiveness, pursuing fast-paced innovation, achieving flexibility by empowering people, learning to work in an environment of change, abandoning conventional wisdom, and the reconceiving of organizational systems.

There's lots of satanist films, and scores of starlets that get tied to altars, but hardly ever does anything really happen to them due to the pitiful security measures of the robed devil worshippers.

The guitar playing alone makes these cd's worth owning, and I personally guarantee that Freed would call Hendrix (isn't Cry of Love a Jimi man song?) and Paul Kosoff of Free his favorite guitar players. The songs have that explosive, sometimes funky, all the time soulful, southern feel to them, and as said before these albums are a must have. Thank you Cry of Love, your music has made my world a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is.","review":"This album is a good example of pure heartfelt unadulterated quality rock.

Guitar follows with organic sounds morphing with dreamy psychedelic vocals.The piano appears again in \\"Lilacglass\\" and quickly melts away, providing a certain clarity between the vocal haze and then the music turns breathlessly beautiful in Violet which I found to be interesting on the emotional level and this album delves into emotional complexity, revealing beauty in love and loss.Jes Lenee's voice wanders through dreamy worlds of piano, violin and folk-inspired guitar. Through a merging of modalities, she creates a completely unique sound that sounds hauntingly familiar to the heart. The album ends as it begins and the way this album is arranged shows an advanced sense of artistic excellence.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is [not good]","review":"The author obviously loves the blues and knows all there is to know, unfortunetly the CD that comes with the book jumps all over the place and doesn't help at all.

Wrong, wrong, wrong!The book contains \\"patterns\\" for 26 bags consisting of two squares or rectangles sewn together. Mostly the patterns call for stripes, although some use bobbles, cables, sequins, beads, intarsia hearts, knitted flowers, or embroidered flowers as variations. The yarn color selections for the pouches are generally poor, and even the addition of metallic Rowan lurex yarn fails to add pizzazz.Accompanying \\"how-to\\" material is pretty much unrelated to specific problems of knitted bags. For example, there appears to be nothing about linings.If you want to knit bags, a much better selection would be PURSENALITIES by Eva Weichmann. Weichmann's book has patterns for handbags of varying shapes and sizes, including some that are felted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry! Not something anybody needs.","review":"This one is going back to Amazon. If you can knit a patch, bind it, fold it in half, sew the sides together, and attach a handle, you don't need this book. That is the gist of almost every pattern. There is some beadwork in it also, but I can tell you how to do that right now for free. String the beads onto the yarn first, then knit. Push them forward, out of your way, as you go. When it's time to put one in, pull it into place. I think this book didn't need to be made. Certainly, it's not reflective of what this designer can do. I'm still in the market for a bags book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers and say that this book was a big disappointment. While there are a couple of bags that are very cute most aren't all that original. While it is called 25 Bags to Knit and there are probably 25 bags in the book a few of them looked identical to me but in different colors.

It has been a terrific program making me feel wonderful when I am done and full of energy to face the day. The 10 minute segments allow me to do a whole routine or just part of the routine while still getting benefit. If you have never tried a streching program, this is a great way to get started for a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I generally have all the flexibility of a 2x4, but I can do this!","review":"I like these workouts. I did all three ten minute stretch workouts and the 30 minute flexibility workout today and was able to complete all of the segments and each of the moves the first time through. I can't go as deep into some of the stretches as Tamilee does, but I definitely can get into the positions (a great start for me) and with time (hopefully), my muscles will loosen up. This is a big boost to my morale - to feel like I can stretch. I have tried some beginner yoga workouts with poses that maybe a contortionist could do, but which were entirely impossible for me, and which left me feeling awkward and uptight, not relaxed. The background setting for these workouts is very pretty and the music is nice as well. This is a keeper for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone can do this","review":"I can only reach my knees when trying to touch my toes and I can manage to do everything on this DVD. It feels good and she makes it easy and it's relaxing. I hate the ones when the instructor winds herself up like a circus act and then says \\"if you can't do this yet just go as far as you can...\\" Tamilee is not intimidating at all. I can't reach as far as her, but at least she looks realistic and gives me a goal I might reach someday. There are a few options to choose from too including stretching in a chair, on the floor or standing. I got 3 DVDs at the same time and I liked this one best. When I get a little closer to my toes I'm going to get the next DVD with Tamilee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This stretch DVD by Tamilee Webb is very beautiful---the production is outstanding and the scenery (Jamaican beach) is gorgeous. This was a pleasant start for me as the stretches began. The stretches are athletic and some are different than the usual stretches seen on most other DVDs. Tamilee is soft spoken and has such a calm, soothing voice (complements the stretches nicely). I love how there are 2 different stretch workouts on 1 DVD: the first of the two is a 30-minute continuous stretch session. The second of the two has 3 10-minute stretches that include standing, sitting (using a chair) and floor stretches. I find these sections to be so great for days when time is more limited for stretching. These stretches relax me and the only thing I wish, is for the stretches to be held a little longer a than they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Stretching","review":"I love this DVD. I believe it has really helped with my range of motion in my lower back and my hips. I also like how Tamilee isn't an annoying instructor like I've found with some stretching or yoga DVDs.

I gave this production 4 stars because I found the routine short (barely 30 min.) and not too challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"I enjoy the exercises that this DVD offers and have enjoyed other fitness videos and instruction by Tamilee Webb. However this particular DVD is defective. I returned the first copy I received because the DVD completely cuts out the floor exercises. I received the new DVD and it does the same thing--it goes from the end of the seated stretches and skips to the cool down of the floor exercises. The actual floor exercises are missing. I was disappointed as the floor exercises were the main ones I wanted. I won't return the second copy since It still has the 30 minute flexibility workout on the DVD. But just be warned if you decide to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and relaxing :-)","review":"I love this dvd. It has two stretch routines on it, and it's so nice to do either at the end of the day, or just after a workout. You feel so relaxed after it. It is set in Jamaica on a beach and that in itself is relaxing.Throughout, there is standing, sitting and lying down stretches. There is hardly (if any) muscle in your body that won't get stretched. It has nice soothing music to workout to and I think anyone would love this. It really will help loosen and lengthen your muscles and you don't have to have a high level of fitness to enjoy it or benefit from it. This is a great workout for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner Stretch","review":"Very good DVD for beginners and perfectly separated for people short on time. I tend to do only one of the options for 10 min stretch at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Got What I Needed","review":"This is a solid, two-part stretch video, and the first part can be done as a full half-hour or broken down into standing, sitting, and floor work. It is not as comprehensive a body stretch as I might have hoped, but that may be more a function of time than the stretches she chooses. It was a good purchase and I will probably use it quite a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee","review":"I was looking for a DVD that was just stretching for my Mom who has Fibromyalgia and this DVD is perfect. Tamilee isn't annoying at all, the scenery is beautiful, the music is peaceful and the stretches are effective. She explains everything well so you stretch correctly and reminds you of all the normal things like not holding your breath, shoulders not being up to your ears and so on. Theres three 10 minute total body stretches standing, sitting and floor which I love for when your short on time or before and after a different workout that doesn't include stretching and one 30 minute stretch for flexibility which is my favorite. This DVD is definitely worth owning in ones library of exercise DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Stretch DVD","review":"This is an excellent stretch dvd, very well narrated.

The title of the DVD is Total Stretch for \\"Beginners\\". I was expecting something very simple, not too complicated, and I was sorely disappointed...pun intended. She stretched me in ways that a human is not meant to be stretched...unless of course you are a size 0 and can bend yourself into a human pretzel. I am by no stretch of the imagination a size 0, so I found the stretches to be difficult and extremely awkward. I also bought this DVD because in the description it said that it had a relaxation technique session. Well the session lasted for about 5 minutes, and it was not differentiated on the DVD menu from the stretching exercises. I had to jump around on the DVD for about 15 minutes before I finally found it. I would not recommend this product for someone who is looking for a \\"beginners\\" stretching video.

It is very boring and not in a relaxing type of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamilee Total Stretch","review":"I purchased this DVD in May and have been using it faithfully for the past seven months. Let me just say that Tamilee is awesome! She is very encouraging, and does not have that typically annoying voice that most instructors have. She reminds you to do simple things that you may tend to forget such as proper breathing and posture. The DVD is composed of three 10 minute stretch routines: Standing, sitting, and a floor routine. And there is a 20-30 minute routine that focuses on all three areas along with a cool-down. I have acute cerebral palsy, so I was extremely inflexible with poor balance and range of motion as well as poor posture. Because of this video I am now much more flexible, my posture has improved as well as my balance. I can now do things I never thought I could before such as Tai Chi and kung fu. If this video can improve cerebral palsy, it can work for the most inflexible persons."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DVD FOR 50 + YRS.

To be a true antenna expert, one needs to know both. But for those of us who are not equipped to handle the mathematical approach, the practical approach will do just fine, in which case I would recommend Carr's Practical Antenna Book and ARRL's Antenna Book. Here are some differences between the two:1. Carr is more readable.2. ARRL is more comprehensive, with 2.5 times the number of words as Carr.3. ARRL has more photographs and better looking sketches.3. ARRL has a multi-author approach (with technical checks and balances) as opposed to Carr's one-man approach. Carr contains few bibliographical references, whereas ARRL has tons of references for further reading.My opinion: Carr is better for the beginner, but ARRL is better for details and as a reference book. Better yet, get both books, since they serve complementary purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Practical Overview of TX/RX Antennas","review":"The title gives a very readable overview of antennas, installation and usage.

The humor is great in poking fun at fast-food restaurants, which generally I'm not too fond of. Claire is a good example of the apathetic employee that is dragged in off the street to work, not just in restaurants, but in many businesses across America. Add to that the emphasis on meat, raunch fries, and other high-fat foods, along with a lack of fruits and vegetables, it's easy to see how fast-food places are fun targets for humor. Although to be fair, Lucky Cow does exaggerate for humor's sake. One of the strengths of this strip is that it is a lot more consistent than many comic strips in maintaining good quality day after day. A lot of other comic strips often have klunkers, and days that make me think \\"What the heck does that mean?\\" but with Lucky Cow I seldom am disappointed.

As we well know, this was Hitch's return to England after nearly 40 years or so. Most of it was shot on location (lovely to see England in the 1970's), and it has some of the greatest dialogue ever in a Hitchcock film (courtesy of Anthony Shaffer, one of the great British screenwriters/playwrights). It is also quinessentially British, which is probably why I love the film so much. There is an incredible amount of dark humour here, but it's done so well and with such skill and grace. I love the appalling meals that the police inspector has to \\"get rid of\\" from his wife, and the scene in which 2 doctors are discussing the murderer is very hilarious indeed. The film's outcome is pretty much never in doubt, but getting there is fantastic. Every performance is superb, and Hitch's direction never falters.

Scripted by Anthony Shaffer, \\"Frenzy\\" (1972) gets better with each viewing. From its opening shot of the Thames to its sarcophagus-lid conclusion, the film never falters as Hitchcock mixes brutal violence with gourmand black humor and a plethora of striking camera angles.

Acting is great and very genuine - this is no Hollywood fairytale with love stories forced in by movie star achetypes - this is Hitch at his darkest."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Minor\\" masterpiece by the great Hitchcock","review":"Gritty and very un-Hollywood, this movie explores many of Hitchcock's favorite themes, but with a new look and a new edge to them. The most effective shot is when Rusk guides the girlfriend up to his room, \\"Have I told you you're my type of woman,\\" he says as he closes the door. The camera very slowly pulls back, down the stairs, across the street, where the sights and sounds of life go on as normal, and where the camera lingers, filling the viewer with the hope and expectation that she'll escape and emerge from the building. Of course, it doesn't happen -- we know what is really happening, after his disturbing murder/rape of Blaney's ex-wife. Technically brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock in full gear here","review":"Hitchcock entered the seventies with his last great film, a delicious thriller with a down on his luck ex-RAF pilot with a hot temper who is suspected of a rash of rape/strangulations in London. In typical Hitchcock fashion, a load of circumstancial evidence is heaped on an innocent man, and matters aren't helped any when his ex-wife and girlfriend turn up as the latest victims. With all the plot twists, black humor, and creative camerawork, Hitchcock must have enjoyed this immensely. Highly recommended, but avoid the butchered TV version."},{"rating":"2","title":"next generation","review":"My daughter got this copy because I would not give her mine!

I was under the impression this book covered a multitude of animals, and discussed more than in depth descriptions of their importance specifically pertaining to the Native Americans and some rituals to attune yourself to different animals.

My spiritual relationship was built with my animal totem before I really understood the God and Goddess. I use Animal Speak to look up animals when I see them in the wild, or when they appear in dreams. Animal spirit guides are great helpers to Wiccans, they are easier relate to than deities.I think the research here is well done, and I like Ted Andrew's writing style, which is informative and interesting without being *gasp, shudder* \\"fluffy\\".

Great movie for Jerry Springer fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole Lot about Jerry You Probably Didn't Know","review":"When I bought this book, it was purely because of the price and for an entertainment factor. When I got the book, I almost immediately started reading it. I found his childhood very fascinating.One of the parts that seemed to bore me a bit was his conversation with God. But after that, the book really seems to pick up.I knew some of the things about Springer, like the check at the 'massage parlor', but I didn't know many of the details behind it. Perhaps this was a way for Jerry to set the record straight, and to purge his soul.In interviews, he rarely mentions his ex-wife, Mickey, or daughter, Katie. This book has only a chapter about his family, with 2 or 3 pictures. It was a side of Jerry that only the people of Cincinnati saw.I think that this would be a good book for anyone who judges Jerry and the Jerry Springer Show to read because it really expresses the theme that you are all human."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know what you're getting into here","review":"Okay folks, you KNOW you're not getting Shakespheare from this! All you Lawrence Olivier and Masterpiece Theater fans have gotta go elsewhere. This is down, dirty, lowgrade stuff that's just as bad as the real Jerry Springer show. I don't know why the League of the South or the NAACP haven't gotten after Jerry for the incredibly crude depictions of Blacks and poor Whites in this film and on his show (check out the airplane and elevator scenes in particular). Jerry's soliloquy in mock defense of the poor and ignorant contestants of his show must be heard to beleived. Sounds like an (unusually bad) Bill Clinton speech. But anyway, you know who's involved, so ya know what to expect.

His painful missteps echo human misfortune. A good, if not great, read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quite Different Story Line","review":"Everyone knows that Ruth Rendell is one of the the best writers out there (in any genre). This book did not disappoint me. She handles this story about the disappearance of a young black girl with her usual style. It's a realistic story about the lives of what are sometimes called the disenfranchised people, or the people in a community that no one really notices. Wexford is faced with one of the most difficult cases in his career when he sets out to find this girl. To him it's almost like trying to find a ghost. And on his way he uncovers a horrific story about what happens to some people from other races who manage to slip into England under the radar. He can't believe it happens in his lovely little home of Kingsmarkham. But he does manage to solve the mystery, and get the right people in jail in the end. Only Rendell can handle a story that is this complex without letting any of her readers get lost in the process of trying to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you think","review":"I started this book and then put it aside to read some other books as I wasn't too impressed with it. Upon picking it up again I read it non-stop.Was interested in the subjects of class and color and how they are such a part of the English culture. I have spent some time there and know.As always, Inspector Wexford come thru as a wise gentleman. Like the parts about his family. Also like his partner Burden. A class act."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is nothing new in this DVD","review":"There is nothing new in this DVD, unless you are a teenager or have very little experience in sex. Besides, the actors in it look like they are in 1980, very old-fashioned. Maybe it is fine with people who still live in eighties, for me it was a turn-off. Looks cheap and cheesy as well. I consider this purchase a waste of money and would never buy any other DVD of that collection.If you are really interested in learning something new to spice up your love life and would like to see something attractive I suggest you get Kama Sutra The Sensual Art of Lovemaking in 2 DVDs instead. It is a real pleasure to watch, although not all of it is practical, unless you are an acrobat, most of it is useful and very beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goosebumps.","review":"I have a professed liking for song stylings of great lyrics.

This recording is not an attempt to sound like Hank Williams or even Tony Bennett or even Hasil Adkins. You will probably not ever hear another more idiosyncratic set of Hank covers.

It is flimsily based on one of the greatest short stories I have ever read, but it is terribly melodramatic and dramatically different from the original story. It has a very made-for-television quality. In other words, it's low-budget. The acting is crummy. The dialogue is nothing like what Vonnegut would have written. I am shocked that he authorized it and allowed his name to be put in the title. His name is obviously used as a selling point, because the film can't stand up on its own. Mother Night and Slaughterhouse Five, both excellent films in every respect, are adaptations of Vonnegut novels that are available on video and much more worthy of your attention. Those two films are true to Vonnegut's vision. Slaughterhouse Five is particularly impressive in the way it deals with the difficulty of working with a story that is set in both World-War-II-devastated Germany and the imaginary planet, Tralfamadore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserved a zero rating for the poor quality costume, not as pictured","review":"Customer service was very condesending and argued with me to the point of exhaustion.

Why is it so important for Robert Knight to find the next young white blues hot shot? When has this music made any kind of cultural or financial impact on the music scene? It's truly remarkable how much time and resources they put into jump starting this Taylor Bryant kid's career. The likelihood of this kid becoming a true visionary of the guitar like Jeff Beck or Steve Vai is highly unlikely. It's depressing to see how much time and money is wasted shoehorning this kid into success, when there are so many other creative and innovative rock bands that would take off if they could just be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess this is.","review":"Do yourself a favor and rent this. When the photographer is not whining about his parents he is trying to be a talent scout to a kid who won a guitar center contest. The photographer works for Guitar center, BTW.Or he is trying to promote a band. Probably the most annoying thing about this picture is this very unattractive old mans ego. There is a close up shot of his face every 10 seconds. Imagine your grandfather dressed head to toe in Ed Hardy making an ass out of himself trying so desperately to be hip and you will get the idea. If you are a musician you will find this whole thing even more hilarious, especially the NAMM sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true delight for Hemingway fans","review":"H. Lea Lawrence.

Tal deepens and becomes a more complex character. The overall driving forces of the story begin to flesh out (I came to Talon a new Feist reader lacking the background of previous books.) Tal has a clearer enemy, more focused objective. The magic and behind the scenes good/evil struggle are more developed make more sense in King than they did in Talon, though still could have been left out without much change to the plot and action. This book departs from the good-guy-always-prevails predictability of Talon; a good thing.Very readable prose and a well paced plot make for an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting Galore","review":"King of the Foxes is a most compelling sequel to Talon of the Silver Hawk.I would even go so far as to say that King of the Foxes is one of Feist's best work yet. Though I still like The Serpentwar Saga best. Talwin is a character at least as complex and well developed as Jimmy the Hand or Arutha were in the Riftwar saga.It seems to me that the Conclave of Shadows is indeed an example of classic Feist, the Feist we all know and love. With his classic talents for keeping his readers unaware of the next twist or turn his novel will take, and his uncanny ability to create and develope characters we all connect with on many levels, Feist once again reclaims his title as the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid sequel!","review":"This sequel picked up right where _Talon of the Silver Hawk_ ended. And as Talon of the Silver Hawk, or Tal Hawkins, developed, he became a stronger and more likable character. Some of the hardships he faced could have made this a much darker book, but lucky interventions in the same vein as the last book, kept Tal optimistic and surprisingly upbeat.I wonder what will happen in the next book, especially considering the fate of the villain....My favorite scene, though, was the shark/beach scene - such fun, and totally unexpected for a fantasy novel. I do hope that Nakor and other series regulars play a larger role in the next book!

Feist has been one of the top fantasy writers that has stayed consistent in giving us readers solid fantasy epics.And in the 2nd volume of the Conclave of Shadows trilogy he once again proves he can still propel readers into high adventure in a fantasy realm fraught with danger and intrigue and excellent and impressive characters of both Good and Evil...and something in between.A must read for fantasy readers, as well as historical readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Hurried","review":"It's a sad thing to find an author you've enjoyed for so long produce work you really don't like much.Feist's novels in the Riftwar and Empire (with Janny Wurts) series remain some of my favourite fantasy works, and I've enjoyed most of his other titles also.Talon of the Silver Hawk was okay, though somewhat contrived and artificial in the way it brought about its resolution. King of Foxes has the same problems, only more so. It seems hurriedly, even carelessly put together; I never really felt a great sense of reality from any of the characters, and the plot did not move forward so much as it was pulled uncomfortably by authorial intrusion.At the height of his powers, Feist can provide excitement, entartainment, and engaging characters as can few others. Foxes is nowhere near that height."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for something new","review":"Feist now has a bijillion books set on the same world that are all sequels of each other. It started to become obvious after the second trilogy that he is writing this world because he needs the money, not because he likes the characters, world, or anything else. The first Conclave of Shadows book was good - almost a renewal of purpose similar that reminds me of the obvious enjoyment in writing the first Magician books. The second book - King of Foxes - appears to be more a labor of deadlines and bills to pay then any type of interest in writing.After this, I may get the third book just to see who he bumps off but not unless I am really bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book?","review":"I don't understand.

This is the best, without question, movie, of all genres, I have seen in at least five years.First of all, with Monica Bellucci in it, I need not say much more. But seldom does a film capture the entire spectrum of emotions as this one does. At times I laughed until it hurt, at other times the sadness was maddening.

Sadly, you will not be able to see this film in the U.S. as Mirimax/Disney Home Video has heavily censored it for DVD release in the U.S. Monica Bellucci is a beauty, but to fully appreciate her in Malena, you'll need an Italian import of this DVD and a region-free player."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING 'UNCUT' VERSION - IT'S CENSORED!","review":"With deleted scenes put back in, this is a 5-star movie. However, this 'Import, Uncut' version is CENSORED in a way that ruins the overall movie.

The tech details says it's 92 minutes, meaning 17 minutes are still missing (15% of the movie!) as was the case with the last release in which the movie did not flow right due to the heavy cuts.I have both the Itailan and Korean DVDs and they are UNCUT, but the Italian has no subtitles and the Korean has a below average image quality.Would Miramax please treat us as adults who can decide by themselves if a movie is appropriate or not and release an UNCUT version of this?Note that in NTSC(R1) the Uncut film is 109 minutes while in PAL (4% speed up) the uncut length is 103 minutes, so if you find a 103 version in pal(R2) buy it, it's the full version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film....but this dvd release is total crap","review":"This has to be one of my favorite films. It is a shocking, powerful, and very tragic tale that leaves you breathless. I also think this is Monica Belluci's best role. However, with that said, this DVD release is total crap. I saw the international version earlier and really liked it, so I recommended to my friends that we rent it. To my dismay the american version was highly edited and terrible. They took out much of the \\"questionable\\" content, which resulted in a film with no flow and ultimately lacking in sense. It's ridiculous how our country has gone to such such extreme censorship procedures. I feel it is this kind of repression that really contributes to the moral decay of our country as a whole (sorry for being on my soap box...). I suggest anybody who criticized this film to see the real version as Tornatore intended it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"The movie was not what I had expected.

Only beauty is their value.If a married woman start a rumor that the beautiful neighbor is a wanton who will make love with everyone, it will good for her marriage? I don't understand. I don't know why the movie talk scandal about married woman. Only single girls need to compete with Malena for men by the fact itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, empty, witless, and repellent","review":"Yet another middlebrow cookie-cutter pseudo-art film from Miramax taking on the usual easy targets like Italian fascism. Lush production values are wasted on a practically non-existent plot, a repulsive male main character, and a female lead who remains a cipher throughout the entire film. The male lead's masturbatory obession with Malena is simply embarassing rather than amusing. Male viewers who rent this merely to satisfy their own obsession with Monica Belluci will be equally disappointed in the small number of \\"good parts\\" worth fast forwarding to (what few there are is the only reason this film gets two stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY BEAUTIFUL...and a great story from War times.","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie. Monica Bellucci is not only beautiful as Malena but to watch her silent beauty, and the young man who admires her from afar and who becomes her shadow is refreshing. The story of life in a small town for this woman whose only sin was to be beautiful, shows how tragic gosip and innuendo can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i love foreign films, and felt very lucky when this and girl on the bridge (french) came out at about the same time. this movie, malena, is excellent, but a bit cliched. it is great eye candy and the dialogue is great up till the very ending scene... which is when the movie somewhat falls apart. i am glad i own it and watch it often, but i always stop it two minutes before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie 5 stars -- This Edtion 2 stars","review":"The review from Naked Truth \\"KC\\" is true.

This version comes from Korea, and compared to the (original) version from Italy (which I later bought from VECOSELL) video quality is slightly worse. So considering the price + the censored scenes + worse video quality, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful little movie...","review":"...and a beautiful Monica Bellucci! This woman(!) really looks like an angel, and has got to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. And so talented as an actress. Her performance in \\"Malena\\" is as impressive as it is rememberable, and the young boy does an amazing job as well. You forget after a few minutes that the language spoken (Italian) is a total foreign language (because of the subtitles of course), it didn't take me long to live myself into their little town in \\"Malena\\".The story is sad, and while watching it you'd like to step into Malenas' world to help her, and the movie works this way to be so realistic.The boys' father himself stands for the humour. And though it's not always just funny what goes on in this boys' life, his \\"a little mad\\" father does put a smile on the audiences' faces.Great acting, Morricone does a great musical-contribution as always, superb direction, locations and camera-work also!See this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Hey, first of all, Let me see the REAL MOVIE deserves five stars. But for this, It deserves two, and a lecture to the american distributors.I watched the movie and it turned to be the American Version (that means, the clean version). The Original version includes the extended passionate scenes of Malena and Amoroso, deleted by the inquisitorian hand of Miramax Films. Disney did it again.How come we expect the real deal if they cut boobs and butts when they are part of the story? Actually, you cannot mess with Monica Belluci's body, probably the most beautiful in Italy. So we movie lovers expect an apology.Miramax and Medusa films have to release an unrated version, I'm getting tired of scissors in movies, as Giuseppe Tornatore protested in \\"Cinema Paradiso\\". I'm pretty sure he's very angry with what they did with this beautiful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Film","review":"This lovely and heart-wrenching movie was made even more special by the fact that the two main characters barely speak (well, one of them IS the narrator). I had never heard of the beautiful actress Monica Belluci (Malena) but now look forward to seeing her perform again. She was exquisite and spoke volumes with just her facial expressions.Giuseppe Sulfaro played Renato, a young boy feeling the first stirring of his sexual awakening who falls in love/lust with the beautiful Malena. His acting was very touching, especially when he goes to the church and lights a candle every day to try to ensure that Malena will come to no harm.This coming of age film about love, jealousy, ostracism, and hate during four tumultuous years of World War II was filmed on the coast of Sicily - and what beautiful cinematography it was. The score was also magnificent, befitting the gorgeous setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they do this?","review":"This DVD has so many scenes cut out it's not even the same story described in IMDB. It should be renamed \\"A Boy and his Bicycle\\". If you want to see a movie where half of it is a boy pedaling his bike, this is it. But it is so exasperating to watch a movie and know there are things missing. Why do they cut scenes out when I buy a movie to watch at home?? This version must be a record for the fewest lines spoken by the title character. She is only shown walking thru the town square. Don't buy this unless you want a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harder Lessons","review":"A lot of Denzel's early movies fall a little short, but because I am a lifelong fan and am in the process of collecting all of his movies (good or bad), I will have to recommend this movie.

I have used the hitachi 2 1/2 inch angled finish nails from lowes for this nailer (after trying the bostitch finish nails which wouldn't fit right), and they have worked great.

The first time I brought it out at my new job people didn't know what to think. Every one of them has tried it and loved it. Some were just passing the tool around and amazed that the thing would fire nails into thick molding. I guess they thought you needed air pressure to be able to do some of that.

I was looking to learn a thing or two and I learned absolutely nothing from these videos. The couples looked like they were faking it and the commentaries were pointless.

I'm sure the average imagination naturally comes up with better stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must see this!","review":"If you have seen the Macross Plus series, you are sure to love the movie. In actuality, the movie, is all four of the tapes piled into one film. however, different scenes were added and removed, which gives the viewer a better understanding of the basic storyline.Some things were a little confusing in the series, such as Isamu, Guld, and Myung's childhood affairs, but the movie explains a little more to you. Also, for fans of Sharon Apple, the 4th tape concert scene is almost totaly diferent from the series, but it adds a new dimention to the awesome computer graphics used in the Macross videos. Trust me, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"Top notch art, smooth animation, and a stunning soundtrack combined with a great story make this a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hears My Thoughts","review":"I first saw the original four part movie of Macross Plus on the Action Channel and was truly amazed by the splendid graphics and not to mention the music. The music blends in as a huge part of the movie's setting to bring it's listeners closely involved. But it's the story line and plot that truly amazed me. When I read a summary of what the movie was about I didn't expect much but as soon as I watched it I was, agian I say it, amazed by how the the writer wrote a story about a plot seemingly basic and turned it into a story of great expectations. The movie is a true vision of splendid movie making. It captures you in a world not much different than our own but yet manages to capture those who watch it in a world of fantasy. The movie is a must have no question. If you haven't seen the 4 part version of this film you should see the four part not the actual movie version: Macross Plus: The Movie. Its in anime but its much more than just another cartoon film."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it could have been: it just couldn't be better","review":"This was the climactic end to the climactic Macross Plus series. It was surprising, astounding and and very emotional. The ending was as good as it could have been. It just couldn't have been any better than that. What really awes me is the music in this movie. It's really incredible. Macross movies and shows have always had a heavy music influence, this is no exception. It's great. Watch it. You can't not watch it if you've seen the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars because of the end","review":"The major differences between the movie and the series is that the movie has some old scenes deleted and new scenes added. Certain sequences of events have been altered in the movie too.I was disappointed how they deleted the fight scene at the beginning. That truly sucked. However, they made Gauld's dogfight with the ghost more spectacular and his death more heroic, and more scenes were added to give Sharon more depth which gave you more of an understanding about her.If you own the series, i wouldnt bother with the movie edition. However, the movie is good in its own right, especially with the added scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my summary review of this video","review":"(To warn you, there is violence, explicit language, and some adult stuff but don't let that stop you from buying this great video) To start this off I think this a good story of the macross/robotech saga;and if you like anime, mech's(and in this case mostly valkyries), a little of drama and air/spacecraft combat then you should definitely get this.The only rip off is you have to get all 4 parts of the Macross plus VIDEOS because of the \\"to be continued...\\"note and each is approximately 40 minutes long so it could have been at least 1-2 videos to purchase because the length all together is around \\"Titanic's\\" movie time length and that movie was formated on only ONE video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD transfer ever!","review":"What were Manga thinking releasing this? Hands down this is the grainiest, spottiest, mind-shatteringly terrible transfer I have ever seen.

Going by some of the reviews here I expected this to be a classic anime the likes of Ghost In The Shell et al. Talk about Robotech/Macross fans seeing things through rose colored glasses. This film is all over the place, granted it was culled from a four part OVA, but even so, it truly is bad. I love mecha anime as much as the next guy, but there is little to recommend here.

This movie has none of the horror of Psycho, very little of the suspense of North by Northwest, none of the twistedness of Spellbound--and so if you go into it expecting any of that, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you go into it expecting a bit of looniness and a chance to chuckle now and then without having to think very hard, though, it actually turns out to be a decent movie.Not one of the master's best, certainly, but then again, even an off day for Hitchcock was better than many directors' bests. Worth considering, at least as a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hint of Romanticism","review":"1976's FAMILY PLOT was Hitchcock's final film. In an interview with Franois Truffaut, Hitchcock stated that in today's films you no longer had to close the picture with a kiss. The audience no longer needed it or expected it. The romanticism of the motion picture was dead. If not for the performances of Barbara Harris as a phony psychic and Bruce Dern as her taxi driving-detective-boyfriend this film would have indeed lacked any hint of romanticism. In a complex plot that involves the location of a missing heir the lives of Harris and Dern become intertwined with the villains of the piece (William Devane and Karen Black). Ultimately the film seems more akin to ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS than to Hitchcock's previous films. However, there's nothing wrong with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor Hitch, But Solid","review":"Minor Hitchcock that feel a bit like an episode of Columbo, but it would be a great episode of Columbo and Bruce Dern is a more amusing detective.

Worth revisiting from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out with a bang.......","review":"Poor ol' Hitch. He didn't go out with a bang. I was looking forward to this film so much, considering it was his last film. I thought it would be interesting to see how his style would hold up in 1976 compared to his prime of the 40's, 50's, and early 60's. Even Frenzy from 72 was a far superior film, actually one of my favorites. But I must say I was highly disappointed in this pitiful film. The only good part was the down the hill in the car scene. And Barbara Harris is pretty entertaining lady. Other than that, it was quite hideous. \\"Frenzy\\" should have been his last flick for sure. The question is, \\"Is it a comedy or suspense?\\" Well, unfortunately, neither, because it's not funny, suspenseful, or even interesting at all. No disrepect though because he is still one of the greatest directors ever....."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Rental first","review":"Hitchcock was one of those rare directors I could buy any DVD at the store, without even seeing the film first, and KNOW it was going to be a worthwhile purchase. Sadly, Family Plot has broken that.Aside from the opening title sequence, it does not feel at all like a Hitchcock film, but rather a run of the mill talking head detective mystery of the 70s, with rather bland/dry acting. There is little of the Hitch suspense throughout, aside from a decent ending, it's fairly conventional and doesn't really scream Hitch at all - and in fact at times, feels more like a TV movie.Frankly I'd say this is a rental only and I'd save the cash for any of the other 60 films Hitch made.

I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, but this was a sad and disappointing way to end an otherwise stellar career. I didn't mind the fact that the movie is a comedy (with dramatic overtones)...after all, so was \\"Frenzy\\" in a much darker sense, and \\"The Trouble With Harry\\"...in fact, that characteristic Hitchcock wit permeated most of the master's work, and usually, it only added to his movies...(\\"Rear Window\\" is a prime example)but \\"Family Plot\\" was just stupid, and waaaay beneath the master of suspense. With the possible exceptions of \\"Marnie\\" and the dreadful \\"Topaz\\", \\"Family Plot\\" was Hitchcock's worst film...but mind you, this is just one person's opinion.

Perhaps the book's greatest deficiency is the skimpy treatment of Ukraine (and Belarus, for that matter), which should now appear in their own full guides.

Ms. White's rich, evocative prose draws the reader into a setting and plot of chilling intrigue and forbidden temptation. In the tradition of Victoria Holt, she captures the spirit of a heroine who is in grave danger, perhaps from the man with whom she is reluctantly falling in love. Whispers of Goodbye is a beautifully written book with mysterious, multi-layered characters who will fascinate from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can never go wrong with Karen White","review":"This book was a well written story of the romantic, historic, old south.

It's more a lengthy poem or a novella -- I see it more as a musical tone poem. Declarative sentences of beautiful, sensitive construction build and awaken our eyes to an awakening day in London. The first few pages are stunningly strong and while all the book doesn't maintain this pitch, indeed no living person could, we don't particularily worry because at ever turn of a page is a new discovery.Reading it in one shot is to be overwhelmed in the way watching the entire ring cycle or mahabarrata (sp?) would overwhelm.

Be warned, for those of you with pathological fears of any type of violence, there will be planes getting shot down and things blowing up. They are good about having the animal/people manage to parachute out of their aircraft, but there is a fair amount of combat going on from time to time.

But I was surprisingly entertained and charmed by the entire movie and found the child actors in this one nearly stole the show from Banderas.

When I saw I had no idea why I was watching it. After that I kind of felt depressed. I've seen more interesting things from movies not even shown in the theater. Any film could have amused children the same way this film had. For example I find disney's classics like the Jungle Book more bearable. Do not buy this film at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Okay, i am usually not the type to give anything one to zero stars, but, this is awful. This movie makes fun of technology, I mean robots that are so smart and strong that everyone thinks they are the real people, but they can't talk unless they have a miniature brian that the arch enemy of the bad guy happened to build. plus the children act like babies. Fighting and teasing and being dumb. I was 10 when I saw this and am 13 now and never liked it it at all. The kids arent goood actors, the action is bland at best, and the ending is cheesey. the only good parts are when george clooney makes the guest appearance, and the \\"Mushrooms\\" joke.

I have seen many movies good and bad, but this is one of the 2 absolute horrible movies. the other being A.I.All in all, if you have a kid of 8 or less, they'll probably like it, or if you have to see it, rent it, you'll thank me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrificly bad","review":"This is the most blatantly commercial and poorly written movie I have ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes on.

Too often films for audiences of color are niche-marketed, thus making it so that only straight-white-middleclass-male movies are seen as universal. Here, children are taught to be proud of their Spanish last name. The son imagines friends with Spanish first names. The daughter takes voyages to Belize. They say Spanish phrases to each other. In addition, the DVD has Spanish and French dubbing. Something more fascinating: one never knows if the family is all-Latino or mixed, white-Spanish or minority-Latino. I love the way this film can speak to audiences beyond race, nationality, first-language, gender, or age.

The DVD box makes absolutely no mention of that. As near as I can tell, it's the original version. Don't get me wrong, the original was fantastic, but I expected so much more.

The melodies are complicated and beautiful, but subdued and contribute to the story every bit as much as the powerful lyrics. Bazan's voice is similarly dedicated to the purpose of telling the story, singing so slowly and melancholic that i found myself holding my breath for every word.The reason the album is stunning, however, is the story itself. In America, where success is the measure of success, not many people are prepared to hear where self-interest really leads. Nor are they willing to admit that it is only the broken spirit that can find comfort in God and the Promise. For someone as messed up as me, this album is pure hope.If you're the sort who listens to whole albums at a time, sitting down with the lights out, than this is the sort of thing you wait around for.

The tracks appear in random order with no rhyme or reason. Logic suggests it would have been appropriate to play them in sequence. However, each song included is lovely. The main title, Orchard House, is frostily beautiful and lyrical. It calls to mind the simplicity and serenity of a New England winter. Valley of the Shadow, while breathtakingly solemn, plays for just over two minutes, which is far too short. Several other tracks: Scarlet Fever, Two Couples, Burdens, Harvest Time, Amy Abroad, and The Laurence Boy, give the listener much too little. Each lasts only 90 seconds or less. For the hefty pricetag (I purchased it years earlier at a national chain bookstore, yes, I know, stupid) I think the editor should have given more bang for my listening buck.

Every piece in it is captivating and beautiful, but the main theme, Orchard House, is by far the most moving. The rise and fall and the violins and the sudden building of the orchestra, haunting and beautiful. Sometimes, I'll admit it, this music can make me cry. It makes you want to be somewhere else, somewhere with rolling hills and beauty all around you and just be in a joyful place.

The seeds of the modern Middle East were partially sown under Khomeini's leadership. This brief volume contains translations of some of Khomeini's sayings while in exile on subjects ranging from Holy War, to government, to sexual relations, to taxes, to wiping one's butt (yes, you heard me correctly). I personally feel this book needs to be more highly read by Americans if it even halfway describes the Ayatollah's true opinions. The overall result is a disturbing look into the mind of a man who seemed to think of himself as a Shi'a Islamic messiah. Overall, I recommend it to anyone interested in Middle Eastern history or who just wants a taste of what a fanatic thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2 and neither worked","review":"I purchased 2 of these units.

You have to appreciate the talent it took to make this bad of a movie, so credit must be given for that.

Of course you never see them in the same film. The character of \\"Jake\\" is killed in one version - he lives in another.As a JAWS fan, I found this movie to be partially entertaining but mostly disappointed with the acting, especially Lorraine Gray and Michael Caine.

With the exception of the opening sequence where Sean Brody gets killed, I just wish that I hadn't bothered. I remember the time when Roy Scheider refused to make this movie, and he made a good choice. I do admit that there are a couple of times in the movie where the acting was OK. I have only been able to sit through this entire movie once, and it was a waste of time (and I generally like bad movies).

It will BLATANTLY be a HUGE hit.This film, granted, does have a rather incredible plot. Especially regarding the shark travelling from NYC to Bahamas in 3 days. BUT you r all taking this too seriously! This is FICTION. Get into the SPIRIT of it. JAWS THE REVENGE is good entertainment, and is thrilling, tense, funny, scary and dramatic.

This is among the worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Must Be One Smart Shark!","review":"The shark is able to follow Mrs. Brody all the way from the New England coastline to the Bahamas after she flees the area (by plane)following the shark's killing of her youngest son. The shark must be very proficient at geography. It must also be somewhat different from other sharks in other respects as it is my understanding (and I could be wrong) that sharks are cold-blooded and unable to survive in a warm ocean environment such as the Caribbean. The shark also must have a somewhat different digestion system as it was able to eat ALL of Michael Caine's airplane. YES, all of it in one large swallow.Folks, if you can accept such absurd plot elements, be my guest and buy this film. If you are more discriminating, however, and prefer to have the plot and story elements immersed in logic, then stay FAR, FAR, away. Buy the original \\"Jaws\\" instead. That was the only one worth seeing to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be halfway decent if they'd just remove the footage of the shark","review":"If you go to the gift shop at any Sea World park you can probably find a plastic or rubber toy shark, and it will look five times better and more realistic and lifelike than the one in this movie.The only interesting and redeeming feature of this film is the gimmick of putting a camera on the shark's POV (or rather, his dorsal fin's POV). In an odd way, it works.An early scene in the film shows one of Brody's sons being attacked and eaten by the shark during the Christmas season. It reminded me of a \\"Jaws\\" novelty song that was released just before Christmas in 1975. It was a parody of \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" -- I remember a line that went, \\"And what to my wondering eyes should appear/but Santa Jaws, who ate tiny reindeer\\". Poetry.Michael Caine missed accepting his Academy Award for \\"Hannah and her Sisters\\" in person because he was on location filming this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Whimsically Stupid...Just Stupid","review":"I saw Jaws the Revenge when it was in the theaters. I was 5 years old and liked it. Then I watched it many years later. I realized how terrible it really was. Newsflash, Sharks lack vocal cords, therefore, they can't make sounds like a dinosaur. Anyone interested in buying this dvd, should wait for it to air on television, and then shut it off after the opening credits. I've been told that if any thing with the shark were to be lifted out, it would be ok. I agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than Jaws 3","review":"Believe it or not, this movie is even worse than Jaws 3. The plot is just stupid. Ellen Brody's youngest son gets killed by the shark. Later on she goes to the Bahamas. Somehow the shark follows her there. Yes, you read it right. Then later on it tries to kill her oldest son's daughter. She goes out on a boat and somehow finds it. And get this. The shark roars. Like a lion or something. Yes, you read that right too. Anyway, a few minutes after the shark jumps 15 to 20 feet out of the water and grabs the annoying Jamaican guy. Few minutes later it jumps up again and they actually stab it with the boat. then you find out the Jamaican is still alive, they swim back to shore, and they're all ha-ha happy and the movie ends. That's pretty much a full summary of this piece of crap. If you were planning on buying this, sorry I pretty much ruined the whole thing for you. But odds are you wouldn't have liked this movie anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"For continuity, skip Jaws 3D, watch this one","review":"Jaws, a classic. Jaws2, a decent, if not somewhat repetitive sequel. Jaws 3 (whether it's in 3D or not) is just plain old sad. Jaws 4 eeks past the third stinker if only for the fact that the opening of the film gives us a handful of the original characters from the first two films, played by the original actors. If only the writer had left the action in Amity and focused the story on Mrs. Brody's inner nightmares, we might have had a decent follow-up. Instead, we get an inane trip to the Bahamas. This one put the nail in the franchise's coffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This time, it's bad!","review":"I saw this movie on TV since there was nothing else on and I must say that I couldn't stop laughing. The movie is so bad, that it is a comedy! In the begining of this movie, they start off by saying that the events in Jaws 3 never happened (reason why it's called \\"Jaws: The Revenge\\" instead of Jaws 4) and that the sharks from the first two movies were the new sharks parents. So the shark follows the Brodys to kill them all! What a dumb plot you must think, but it gets even worse by the bad acting and action. In one scene the shark jumps out of the water and locks it's jaws on a plane! Come on, I bet the guy who wrote \\"Basic Instinct 2\\" could do a better job.-Ben Russell"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing Bahamian about this movie.","review":"Before you direct a film that is supposed to take place in a foreign country I think that it is a good idea to study the culture. I think that the thing that would have helped this film considerably would have been if the director had learned about the Bahamian people. He obviously didn't do that. If he did he would have hired Bahamian actors to play the part of the Bahamian characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Super Movie!","review":"Every once in a while a great movie will come along.

One of the stupidest films I've ever seen with some really ridiculous moments. This is actually a good thing because this film is so bad that the only possible reason to watch this is it's extreme stupidity! One of my favorite moments is when the shark jumps on the side of a boat and roars!...the sound used for the shark's roar was used on 'The Munsters' TV show for Spot's roar! lol! It's just hilarious and I can't believe that this film ever saw the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitten off more than it can chew?","review":"When the only good thing I can say about this film is that it's better than the abominable Jaws 3-D, things don't look rosy. True, this film has an excellent opening sequence, and the scene in which the younger of the Brody brothers gets chomped is equally effective. But after that things go downhill and you're left with something that feels like a Saturday afternoon made-for-TV flick or a film which has had the frightening bits removed by the censors. The plot is just ridiculous. How could a shark travel halfway across the world in a matter of hours? Why did Mrs Brody have flashbacks to events she never even witnessed? Why does the shark explode? The worst element of the film, however, are the 'character is killed but then miraculously turns out to be alive even though his death was obviously irreversable' scenes which really belong only in groan-worthy cartoons. The proposed Jaws 5 has never been made. Perhaps this is a blessing undisguised."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid jaws movie","review":"I have never seen this film but by what I have heard I would jump into the water and drown before seeing this what looks to be god damn awful crap. In fact I have not seen any of the Jaws sequels in fear of ruining my perception of the orginal. Jaws 1975 is a classic and is a overruling boss compared to this crap ass movie. I don't get why the original even needed any sequels but if you ask me the one reason is money. Because those god awful universal bastards can't get enough of it. I have already bought the jaws blu ray!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera elements wrong for a Jaws film","review":"This movie, unlike the first two pictures, actually has soap opera type storyline. Ellen tells her daughter-in-law, Carla, about the former's feelings for Hoagie. We never saw such sappy elements in the previous films in this series. Everyone rightfully picks on the extra-foolish storyline but let's not forget the soap elements sink this turkey more than it's already sunk anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crud, one good eaten scene","review":"Crummy movie, yes. Only good eaten-scene in this one is the woman who gets eaten on the banana boat. She's obviously a MILF, and the shark rises up (a little too high probably) and pulls her off. They show her grind her teeth in agony and blood squirts around. As the boat zooms away, we get a shot of the shark diminishing into the distance, and the woman is in its mouth, clamped about up to her lower waist, her arm back in the air (it always reminded me of a gory rodeo). Then we see the shark close up, sinking into the red water, the dead MILF going with him.Oh, and PS: I swear as heaven is my witness, in the VHS rental version that I originally saw this movie on, Jake resurfaced at the end of the movie, chewed up but alive and in good humor as I remember (I think he said something like \\"Come on mon, come help me out!\\" And back on shore Ellen Brody asked Mike how Jake was, and they loaded him onto a plane or chopper to get medevaced out. I swear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very theraputic way of farting and crying at the same time","review":"It's that funny. If Jaws the Revenge was released say, 70 years ago, it could have been scary to certain standards, but no sequel, certainly not this one, could ever live up to the original classic or better yet, the Peter Benchley book itself. C'mon. Sharks plotting revenge? For no apparent reason against a particular family? It's also very amusing in the way it tries to insert useless cameos and irrelevant flashbacks from the first film in order to spruce up and blind the viewers to what can only be considered a monumental travesty, especially with such a great actor like Michael Caine playing a guy named...Hoagie. Personally, I don't know what was more hideous, the fake shark or Lorraine Gary. Either way, you'll either be severely depressed or immensely amused by what transpires, from the Lifetime-esque opening credits to the painfully bad showdown in the end. DON'T buy it, but hey, it's your dollar. And your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"HILERIOUS!!!!","review":"This is one of the top 10 movies of all time....BECAUSE IT'S SO FREAKEN FUNNY!! (which it isn't supposed to be, which just makes it that much more funny). Jaws was excellent, Jaws 2 was ok, Jaws 3 was a joke, and Jaws: The Revenge was basically a comedy. Loraine Gray plays Ellen Brody again, and takes a vacation to the bahamas, where yet another, a 3rd shark appears and follows her from Amity to the bahamas. That's realistic. And watching old people fall in love is gross. When Ellen Brody has the dream of her being eaten, i laughed my ass off. If you're looking for some good laughs, rent Jaws: The Revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"What next? A shark in the Brody Pool ? (0 out of 5)","review":"What kind of crap is this? A fourth shark getting revenge on the Brody family. This must be a mafia movie, not a sea creature horror. And sharks do not roar. Have you ever heard a dogfish bark or a catfish meow? The amazing thing is that an oscar winning actor goes straight to a garbage film. Shame on Micheal Caine (what a waste of a talent). Same goes for Louis Gossett Jr. in #3. NOTE: Micheal Caine even missed the ceromony where he won for \\"Hannah And Her Sisters\\" in 1986 (or 87) so he could film this junk. And now Mrs. Brody becomes a heroine? Her?! Oh, man. This is so bad, I almost cried and laughed. How about for laughs, make #5.... GUMS!

Bad plan. For me, anyway. This video didn't present anything at all new.

The author was unlikeable. It is an autobiography, but I could care less about Pham's personal stories. Although it did get somewhat better towards the end, overall, it was very slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"...I think it's very poorly written. I'm trying to read it as quickly as I can now so that I can move onto something better but I'm really struggling to finish it. To mention Pham in the same breath as Kerouac or Theroux is really misleading. He uses adjectives like \\"nature-happy\\" to describe one character and \\"frost-rosy\\" to describe a person's eyes. It's all very romantic but it doesn't actually mean anything.Incidentally, I bought the book while I was traveling through Vietnam. I spent a month there and bought the book in my last week before moving onto Cambodia and Thailand. I don't think it represents the country at all well and some portions were downright incorrect, false, and exaggerated.It's just a bad book. Kerouac and Theroux wrote enough good books so that you shouldn't have to read this bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what I expected","review":"Read this for a memoir-writing class, and it was the book I was least looking forward to from the syllabus; sounded like a philosophical travel story. It turned out to be my favorite book of the class, with a deeply personal account of the war and being a refugee, but mostly the scars it left on the family. The author's return to Vietnam was surprisingly poignant; I knew he'd find that \\"home\\" was gone and he'd feel like a stranger, but watching him see it for himself was still painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving","review":"This story of a family's escape from Vietnam is a captivating memoir.

I ended up finishing the book in one sitting, feasting on every word. This book is hardly a mere travelogue or a book limited to exploring Vietnam. Andrew Pham uncorks stuff that should go down as a classic piece of literature.The book's jacket does it a grave injustice painting it as a book about the writer's travels on a bicycle through Vietnam. That's like saying Romeo and Juliet is about forbidden love and leaving it at that. Hope the author gets the recognition he deserves some day.On a end-note, the book's contents were so spell-binding that at times I felt the stories were just that- made up figments of the author's imagination, not real life experiences. Yeah, it's that good. And it exposed the sham of my own mundane existence. Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"I found this book very interesting.

The center plot is a return to Vietnam by a young Vietnamese American which his family fled years ago to live in the United States. However, it is far beyond cross-cultural travelogue; it inhabits the American as well as the Asian psyche with such scary acuity, and takes us into an inner landscape where few can go....without this author as guide. The prose is elegant and luminous; the situations tragic, comic, ludicrous; terrifying. The tone I felt was one of battle fatigue but transcended by unrelenting steel: this one was meant to survive and to tell it all....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real reflection of Vietnamese American and East-West","review":"I found myself related closely to the book, not because of the dramatic of the story, but because of the experience that Vietnamese Americans have had... I found the truth revealed in many scence that Andrew described... This book actually recalled many memories for me... I also suprised that, with limited experience (was pretty young when Anh An left Vietnam), that he can bring out a lively pictures of reality in Vietnam. Identity...

Irish-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Chinese-Americans...ect) were challenged with similar hardships and scramble for identity when they first arrived in America. This book is not only an allaying pill for every lost Vietnamese-American, but it will suit everyone of all ethnicity who's interested in walking the shoes of their father and finding their own roots. From humanly topics of a devastating war to internal family conflicts to a delapidated society washed of morals and basic human rights, I said \\"amen\\" to the almighty for giving me such an easy life after reading this breath-taking book. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating read!","review":"Most families hold tightly to secrets but in Catfish and Mandala, Pham courageously shares his family secrets, and in essence, we can learn from these lessons of life.

It has a very condescending tone and attitude towards Viet Nam and its people. Granted that it is the author's experience in VN, but he writes it with an American audience in mind, so in the end, he is willing to trash his birth country to let his audience know that his true home is still America. He compares VN to a prostitute on a few occasions, and similar to how a hooker is abandoned after she is used, he, too, abandons (metaphorically as well as literally) VN after it provides him with the necessary backdrop for and backbone of his book. The book, if read in bits and pieces, can be interesting, but beyond that it lacks a persuasive sincerity ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catfish and Mandala","review":"This book is highly reccomended. For those who know so little about such a trerrible country, vietnam"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a big disappointment","review":"I fully expected to enjoy this book, but it just turned out to be deeply disappointing. Sure, the premise is promising...a grown man goes back to a homeland he hasn't seen since early childhood. But besides that, the book is simply horrible. Pham's style of writing is so technical that a narrative that should've been wrought with emotion is about as evocotive as a grocery list. Pham is just not charismatic enough to be read about, though he tries to make himself look good by bad-mouthing everyone around him, including his own people and his family. If this book serves any purpose, it is to show the tragedy of Americanization on the Vietnamese people in the U.S., who unjustly feel that they are somehow superior to the Vietnamese in the homeland. This book offers nothing new to the Vietnamese-American experience because Pham's selfish impulse to make only himself look good clouds the poignancy that the book could have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot lend this book even though it is listed as \\"lending enabled\\"","review":"I just don't get it.

It did leak occasionally, but the day after it's one year anniversary it just started leaking. Seems to be a back pressure problem.It never could make a cappuccino without leaking.

I would have expected leaking from a cheaper (under $50) model. For $80, it shouldn't leak.I just made a cappuccino and got about 3oz in my mug and 4oz of water on the counter.If Consumer Reports rated this as a good value it's probably because they either received the unit for free, or Mr.Coffee is an advertiser of theirs.Spend another $20-$40 and get a real pod maker.I might try Senseo next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The machine worked wonderfully for 10 days and then died.

There are days I make 5 or 6 cups of coffee! I just started looking for a replacement and there doesn't seem to be anything as well thought out as this unit; large water reserve that can be rotated to the either side of the maker, accommodates short or tall cups and one button pushing for what ever size you want.

Don't get me wrong, I've seen some beautiful work done with Bryce, but if you want a better, more intuitive landscaping software buy a version of Vue 6 instead.

That said, I consider \\"Jailbird\\" to be one of Vonnegut's true masterpieces. Overshadowed by \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" and others, this book doesn't get nearly as much respect or attention as it deserves. It's amusing and engaging throughout, and deeply moving at many points, especially the end. While I was a Vonnegut fan before reading it, \\"Jailbird\\" helped me understand that the true genius of Kurt Vonnegut lies not with his incisive wit--which is considerable--but with his compassionate humanity.

Starbucks, the lead character, is the least known of all the Watergate conspirators). Where he succeeds is in showing that things are not always as they seem and that everyone is redeemable. Where he fails is in his heavy-handed dealing with bums and the mis-characterization of one Kilgore Trout (his most popular character, drastically miscast as a conman in prison). A fine book full of funny and poignant moments, \\"Jailbird\\" unfortunately remains one of Vonnegut's lesser novels, and a contributer to the great glut that he fell into at the end of the '70's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Insane Voyage","review":"I've read everything Vonnegut has written.

This book made many realistic allusions to events like the Cuyahoga Massacre and the Boston Clock Company that forced me to cite a historical source in order to determine whether the event had really happened. In many cases the events described were based on real occurences. Also the subplots of President Nixon's White House and other real-world scenarios make this book quite different than many of the Vonnegut novels I've read.

However, what goes around, comes around, and she indeed has her eyes opened by a beautiful young caregiver. I've had 2 copies of this for many years; people either loved it (as do I) or hated it.

Perhaps it because the film echoes a great dream of the Irish - to return prosperous to the Old country of Ireland where one can live a simple life, fall in love with the most beautiful girl in the county and live out one's years in an idyllic farm. Wayne is the American boxer who returns to encounter a spunky Irish girl (Maureen O'Hara) and her cantankerous brother (Victor MacGlaglen). The film won numerous Oscars for performance, direction, cinematography and more. This was a very personal project for John ford who was from Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quiet Man","review":"This movie has always been a favorite of my husband and myself.

Showing on a DVD/Blue-Ray high end player on a 55\\" Phillips 1080 flat screen. VIDEO QUALITY IS AWFUL. Low resolution causes the images to be pixilated and blurry. Amazingly dissapointing.

If ever a movie needed and deserved a make-over, its THE QUIET MAN. Someone please get to work restoring this. We fans would love to see something along the lines of a BEN HUR restoration. I've read online that a 2K copy exists (somewhere). Films like this are national treasures, and should be treated as such. Maybe, the persons owning the video rights are being jerkish. No idea why we haven't seen this 5 star film with a decent treatment. As others have stated, the DVD for THE QUIET MAN, looks like a straight copy from a VHS tape. The only time I can even stand to watch this is when its Turner Classic Movies. (Ted, send me a copy)...Seriously, don't bother with either of the DVDs floating around out there. Just wait for the BLU RAY or keep your eye on TCM."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR PICTURE QUALITY","review":"I rarely review my purchases but this one deserves a special warning.

As someone else said, the VHS tape has better quality. What was even more disturbing to me is something I just discovered. It shows the \\"CC\\" symbol for closed captioning and also spells it out in the special features block on the back of the case. When a hearing impaired friend recently wanted to watch it and needed the captions they were not there. We tried for over an hour to find a way to get them to display and if they are on the DVD the link to them is broken. Under the Audio category off of the main menu they are not listed. How an outfit like Artisian ever got hold of a classic movie like this one I don't know. What they have done is false advertising where the closed captioning is concerned but what they have done with a wonderful classic movie is even more criminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet man","review":"Item received on time and was well packaged - no damage in shipping - quality of DVD good - some slight hesitation at beginning of DVD play but did not effect the rest of movie - could well be my DVD player and not the actual disc.

First, my grandfather then my father and then myself would watch it on TV every March 17th.

It's noticeable throughout, particularly when characters speak quickly. I gave a 2 rating instead of 1 (but would prefer 1.5) because, although the transfer is not good, many of the shots retain their beauty - particularly the landscapes. Where the problem arises is in the red and facial tones. Terrible. Still, the movie is so good, I laughed out loud many times. \\"Impetuous! Homeric!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminal Quality","review":"I have the \\"Collector's Edition DVD\\" and am horrified at the abysmal picture quality especially on a movie of such high quality. This is one of the best movies John Ford and John Wayne did but the poor reproduction is criminal. Any 13 year old with a computer could have done a better job. I agree with the the other posters that the poor quality makes it almost unwatchable. If you are considering buying it hold off until someone does a better job of reproduction. Ford insisted that Republic allow him to use Technicolor for the colour as opposed to their own colour process so that the film could be of the highest quality. He would roll over in his grave if he ever saw this abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV Version of a Sweeping Comedy","review":"I cannot believe that they went to all the trouble to restore this classic and then chopped the sides off to make it fit a television screen.

Therefore I cannot understand all the positive reviews for this DVD. (I can only assume most are simply reviewing the movie itself.) How many of us looked for a \\"Quiet Man\\" DVD, hopping to find something that captured John Ford's original vision? Wouldn't a digitally remastered, wide-screen, surround sound version of this be an incredible addition to any movie buff's library? (To all the nay-sayers, a high quality DVD version of an old movie can indeed be produced - see Citizen Kane). This DVD has all the technological quality of a 15 year old video tape. The sound, full screen picture etc. are all second tier. The \\"making of\\" feature is interesting. However, if you love this movie, nothing will make up for the overall lack of quality.

Right now, Lions Gate owns these rights. Until such time as a Blu-Ray version comes out using the UCLA restoration, I would avoid buying this movie on DVD and simply watch the superior version shown by TCM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but terrible transfer to DVD by Republic","review":"Rent before you buy. Apparently Republic allowed their master copy of this great film to deteriorate, and now they've transferred it to DVD without any attempt to restore the original quality.

Certainly I will be more careful in the future if I pick up anything with the Republic logo!

Needs restoration!","review":"Please someone consider digitizing this movie to a clear picture that isn't fuzzy, close captioning it as promised, and perhaps putting this on Blu Ray. We know that this movie was done prior to any of these wonderful new technologies, but as an important classic that this movie is, is worthwhile cleaning it up, making it worthy of the audience who adore this film. After all, there is a full tourism trade in the area that the movie was filmed based on people's love of this film, and to honor the fantastic actors/actresses who made this film special.Even more deceptive is that fact the shells claims in two places (on the rear panel) that there is close captioning. This is very important for many people who are hard of hearing, not to mention to allow accessibility, that has been made available to the public since 1986. Let's do this right, folks, really. There is such a love of this film, just honor what you say you'd do. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Picture","review":"Great story, and super cast and director.

The video quality is mediocre at best (and this is one of the half-dozen most beautiful movies ever shot, which just makes it worse), the audio is lousy, edgy and shrill...Well, you get the idea.

And so on. Well, having seen all this before at a theatre and on VHS I couldn't resist ignoring the warnings about the DVD. It couldn't be as bad as reviews here were saying. Wrong! This is absolutely the worst DVD by far that I have ever seen. For reasons already aptly described by others in this list of reviews.

Buy the VHS if you can still find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A taste of the blarney","review":"I owned but eventually gave away a DVD copy of this film because of its poor video quality. I wonder why Criterion hasn't jumped on this classic?Having said that, I wouldn't give this film a five star rating for either story line or acting -- it's more an Irish feel-good movie. But because of the strong Irish flavor of, I presume, a bygone era, it is enjoyable. I partcularly get a kick out of Barry Fitzgerald's criticism of John Wayne's self-styled introduction to Maureen O'Hara: \\"Just who gave you permission to play patty cakes in the holy water?\\" That slays me every time!I hope Criterion or someone will do right by this movie eventually and then I'll buy it again. The current quality level makes me wonder if the distributors think: Let them have chopped liver now and, when we eventually do it right, we'll sell it to them again. If that assumption is correct, it's time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - do not get this copy","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable movies ever made but the DVD is almost unwatchable on anything but the worst TVs.

First of all, I bought my copy the week it was release for the first time, in 1998 I think. The look of the front art is a little different from the one they are selling now, there is no black contour and the background color behind the image of John Wayne and Maureen embrassing is a soft grey. I'm writing this because my copy is not that bad, it's blurry in some places but like I said in my review, some exterior scenes are clear and gorgeous. The audio is not great but everything is in sink with the action. I don't know if it's because I bought it when it was released or because I bought it in Canada (I don't believe so cause I think our stock comes from the states) but anyway if you can try to find an early edition DVD copy, maybe you won't find it that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistake to order","review":"I did not realize it was in German, I thought it was in English, but apparently there was a code..

I was thrilled to find out it was to be on DVD. I was on my third copy trying to get a decent product until I stopped, realizing they must all be defective. They all had the same problem: the images blacked out periodically and what visual there was kept freezing every few seconds. The color wasn't too great either.

Don't waste your money unless you just can't stand to not have this in your library.....its a very CHEAP price and a disgrace!Lets all hope....HOPE .....that they bring this out with an improved image....Heck, colorized films from decades before look better than this sickening sea of GREEN!

Why can't a current studio film restore this film classic and make a worthwhile production? I'm sure most John Ford fans will latch on to this pretty quick.

I deliberately bought the \\"Collectors Edition\\" as one of the reviewers said the quality in the \\"John Wayne Collection\\" was poor. It hasn't been digitally enhanced and must be played in the 4:3 format which is outdated these days.

The only real flaw of this book was that this story was published by itself, when it would have been better as part of a collection. I understand that it WAS part of a series, but for whatever reason, this new publication isolates this story. But like I said, that's it only real flaw, because I wanted to know what happened after the ending and had to read it somewhere else.Edit-I didn't find out until later that this story was actually part of a collection, happening within the same 'universe' as many of his other works, and that the fate of the Ship is revealed in another novel.

After defeating Mantrid and destroying the light universe Stan, Kai and Xev freeze themselves and drift into the dark zone. When they awake we find them in episode one of season 3 \\"Fire and Water,\\" in which they they are unfrozen by Prince the soon to be nemesis of the Lexx crew and leader of the Fire planet. In the first episode the crew is introduced to two planets called Fire and Water which is a alter-ego of the ideal of Heaven and Hell with a re-incarnation twist. If your a fan of the T.V. series on the Sci-Fi channel in the U.S. you will find more female nudity. Another added extra on this DVD is the behind the scenes feature, which has interviews with Brian Downey(Stan), Micheal Mcmanus (Kai), and the director of the 4 episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly unreliable","review":"These SD cards turn out to be highly unreliable.

It introduces conversational Chinese language to children at a steady pace. Children will not be bored by the video either, as the language lessons are presented in a fun, interactive way. There is also a companion booklet that summarizes what was taught on the tape and it helps adults to follow along and sing the songs. The names of animals and fruits and colors are covered and the children in the video are definitely having fun learning! An added bonus for adults is that there are \\"subtitles\\", showing the Chinese characters and pinyin (phonetic) spelling for the lessons.

Controversial and creating two instant female American icons. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are nothing short than perfect as Thelma & Louise, both creating equally likable and complex characters. Considered to be a female buddy road-trip movie, but this film is much, much more, mainly because of the excellent multi-layered screenplay. Ridley Scott directed an instant American classic. Some scenes are now considered classics, such as the ending. The 'male' part of the cast are all excellent, Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen are great. Brad Pitt is also a stand-out in the role that shot him into stardom. Extremely entertaining and even poignant near the end. This one is in a category all of it's own.

Sure the guy was a dirt bag and he should be in jail but you can\`t use lethal force like that if someone offends you .

Three different endings.","review":"This is perhaps the only Alfred Hitchcock color film I have not seen, until now. It is a rarity for television. And it would be edited for television broadcast anyway. Now on DVD, you can see TOPAZ in its entirty. If you have seen TOPAZ before, well here is the surprise. There are three very different endings of the film you may have not seen yet. This DVD version will show them all to you. If the ending chosen leaves you flat, in the Bonus Material section, you can see all three alternate endings and decide the one you like best. John Forsythe (Bachelor Father [1957-62],Charlie's Angels - The Complete First Season[1976-1981] as voice of \\"Charlie\\",Dynasty - Seasons 1 & 2[1981-89]) sure does make the beginning act of the film much more interesting to watch.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninvolving, but not entirely uninteresting spy film","review":"The wooden Frederick Stafford is not the kind of compelling , complex hero (like Cary Grant or James Stewart) of Hitchcock's earlier films, and the film (which lasts 127 minutes) seems a conventional spy story except, perhaps, in calling attention to the pile of corpses of those who helped the hero.Michel Piccoli is a conventional foil. Philippe Noiret is more interesting as a French NATO official, and John Vernon as a Cuban official. The Cubans are not demonized, though Karin Dor does explain her cooperation to him being because Castro has turned the island she loves into a prison.The film jumps from Copenhagen to Washington to New York to Cuba to Paris. Many of the key scenes are filmed from a distance at which the viewer cannot hear what is said. If the visuals were more interesting, this might work, but as it is, it only makes the characters and their fates seem remote in interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topaz - does not shine like a usual Hitchcock film","review":"Read no further, if you are concerned about \\"spoilers\\"....The IMDb explains that this film concerns \\"Cold War politics,\\" including parts \\"leading up to the 1962 Cuban Missle Crisis.\\" Being a Hitchcock fan, I'd been eager to see this film, after learning of at least one scene filmed in NYC. Unfortunately, this film does NOT measure up to Hitchcock quality. A review on the web site of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops describes it well:* \\"The dialogue is mostly banal and the action largely unconvincing, but there are occasional glimmers of the Hitchcock touch in subtle plot twists here and blind alleys there....Some physical and psychological violence and a lot of confusing intrigue.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Hitchcock's few mistakes","review":"If you have not seen this movie I highly suggest you either rent it or wait for it to be shown on AMC again. This is one of Hitchcock's worst movies. The character's and story are wooden and uninteresting. There is no signature Hitchcock humor and no exciting camera work. I am a huge Hitchcock fan and it is very hard for me to think of anything really positive about this film. It is simply not up to the Hitchcock standard. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because a bad Hitchcock movie is still better than most other films made around the same time.If you want to see some good Hitchcock movies that you may have missed, I highly recommend the Criterion Collection DVDs of The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I'm a fan of Hitchcock and have seen most of his films. I missed Topaz when it came out, so I borrowed the VHS tape. What a waste of time! This is the worst Hitchcock film I've ever seen and one of the worst films ever.This is nominally a spy thriller, but at every point where suspense is possible, Hitch defuses the thrills. There's way too much talk, and the few action scenes are predictable and flat. The tradecraft is unbelievable: what intelligence officer waits across the street while his operative waves to him and then walks into a hotel filled with Cubans?The actors are wooden and glum, with the exception of Phillipe Noiret, who manages to inject his character with some shades of feeling.It feels like a bad propaganda film, one made by the State Department to warn the Russians that we're serious about the Monroe Doctrine."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not even deserve the one star!","review":"That's a really unrealistic movie, a complete political fantasy. This guy didnt have any idea about Cuba and his political situation. He doesnt understand neither the cultural background.

Shot directly after 1966's TORN CURTAIN, Hitchcock's TOPAZ is a more matter-of-fact tale than a genuine thriller where real lives were at stake. Essentially an American intelligence head (John Forsythe) uses his friend in the French Intelligence (Frederick Stafford) to spy for the United States in Cuba and at the same time they try to ferret out a high French official passing on secrets to the Soviets. This all takes place during the height of the Cuban missile crisis. Roscoe Lee Browne as Philippe Dubois has the best scenes in the film as he has to get close to the Cuban United Nations delegation visiting Harlem and staying at the Theresa Hotel to photograph some secret papers from a high official (John Vernon as Rico Parra). These scenes were what Hitchcock called pure cinema. TOPAZ contains an interesting score by Parisian Maurice Jarre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine story of Cold War espionage","review":"I liked this movie a lot. \\"Topaz\\" is based upon the Leon Uris novel of the same title, and I consider that novel to be perhaps Uris' finest work. While the movie does not quite measure up to the excellence of the novel, it makes a brave attempt to do so. This is an engrossing and realistic film about the Cuban Missile Crisis and retains its relevance today. Without giving away too much, the story revolves around a French espionage agent who supplies vital intelligence information about the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba. This film is multidimensional, with engrossing characters, a solid storyline, and historical relevance. Not to be missed.Highly recommended.

However, the film fails to generate any real suspense, unlike his earlier films, which are masterpieces and the mostly abysmal Torn Curtain (which had at least one good sequence that had plenty of suspense in comparison to the rest of the movie). I liked John Forsythe (who would later play the unseen Charlie in Charlie's Angels), and Frederick Stafford was very good as Devereaux. The film was also much too long than it should have been, in my opinion. Could have had a better plot and a much better screenplay, though. In my opinion, Torn Curtain was the beginning of the end for The Master Of Suspense as far as suspenseful motion pictures were concerned...In my opinion, Marnie was Hitchcock's last great movie.Rated PG (mild language & violence and a brief love scene)."},{"rating":"1","title":"JCParis","review":"This remastering in 1.85 (a bit too larger for a 35 mm base film in \\"flat widescreen\\" format - 1.66 is most appropriate) is not to recommend for the ugly colors: flashy red, some colors faded, finaly bad color balance.

The cassette tape was stuck together with an adhesive, and not screwed together.2.

However, I called Sony customer support and they were not able to resolve the issue. (I was hoping placing a piece of tape over part of the cassette might be a solution.)

The problem is that the cassette player in your car has seen better days, played many tapes and is magnetized. The solution is easy: buy and run one of the cassette head cleaner / demagnitizers on the market. A good one is Maxell A450 Cassette Tape Head Cleaner, $2.95 on Amazon (through Office Depot). It's done wonders in my car.A final word about expectation management: any non-direct hookup, either through FM or via cassette adapter, offers limited performance BY DESIGN. Frequency response and dyanmic range for FM radios and magnetic tapes are by far inferior to what you can get with CDs and MP3 players, and the additional signal conversions (analog to magnetic and back, or analog to RF and back) don't help much either. So expect a good solution from a cassette adapter, but don't expect CD quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great . . .

I tested a regular cassette in the deck to see whether my cassette deck had a problem (my warranty runs out in another 7000 miles so if THAT was the problem I'd get it fixed promptly!) and my regular cassette played with no problems. I checked the reviews on the Apple site and I saw that there are a number of people who have this problem but the adaptor would not work in their decks from the beginning. My adaptor did work for six months. I'm not sure why this is happening. The only thing that has changed is that it has recently gotten colder here over the last couple of days so temperature is probably a factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its worth the money...","review":"recently, i bought the \\"sony car adaptor\\" for my vehicle, and i had mixed feelings. First of all, people complaining about the bass must have a Mp3 set up problem, because even with the bass turned off on my \\"diskman\\", it still sets in strong. The sound is decent, but you gotta turn your volume control all the way up to get it to blast loud enough. It also dosent seem like its very durable.

At first, it worked fine, but after three days, the sound would only come out of the left speaker. After a week, it stopped working completely, and would only make clicking sounds when playing.

This is the first one to have problems. First, there is barely any sound coming out of the speakers on the right side of my car, so I need to change the balance setting every time I use it. Second, whenever I use it for more than about 10 minutes it begins making loud mechanical noises, like something is rubbing inside of the deck.

With the volume raised completely on the iPod and the stereo, I could still barely get a decent sound. If that wasn't the problem, the cassette itself would make an unbearable noise. The bass and treble aren't very good either. It's a risk to buy this. It's cheap enough if you want to try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"works like a charm in my murano with a bose sound system. there was a hint of white noise in there when I had the iPhone volume really low and had to boost the signal at the dashboard, but that was easily rectified by putting the iPhone's volume to about half. yay old school tape decks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worked for my cassette player","review":"My old cassette adapter finally stopped working after more than 10 years of excellent service.

The CD player works great, but the adapter is useless. After about an hour of play, it began flipping always to side 2 of the cassette, which has almost inaudible sound quality. No matter what I do now, it always flips instantly to side 2. Playing Side 1 is absolutely impossible. I thought that I had gotten a faulty adapter so I returned it for another.

Don't waste your money on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I read bad reviews for this product but decided to try it out anyway.I got this in mail few days ago. I was pretty excited and tried it out immediately by connecting my iPhone to the car stereo. It was disappointing to see that the thing really does not work.

This worked great, but now the cable connection at the jack for the line-out port of the Discman is getting loose.I purchased this w/ the intention of replacing that adapter. Everything about the product seems identical, but for some reason, it doesn't work as well or doesn't work at all in either of my car cassette decks (Subaru and Oldsmobile Bose system). It either sticks, and can't eject, or doesn't play, etc. Can't figure out the problem.

Once in a great while I could get it to stay in. Sometimes when it stayed in I got a very faint sound. Other times it stayed in and worked for a few minutes before ejecting again. One week of use isn't enough! I'm very disappointed in this unit. I bought it due to high praise in reviews but my experience has been anything but satisfactory. Too bad I threw away the packaging or I'd return it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifespan","review":"I've gone through a number of cassette adapters in the last ten years, but this particular model had by far the shortest lifespan. The cord gave out within two months, leaving me with sound only through the right channel.

Last month, my wife commented that her unit would no longer stay in her player. It was constantly being ejected. She stopped using hers. This month, mine unit started doing the same thing and then started causing the tape player in my vehicle to auto reverse. This unit only passes audio to the player when on the \\"A\\" side so when the player reverses to the \\"B\\" side all audio stops. We are very disappointed.

Once he goes back home, he gets a job working at a dinner. While he was working, he sees a note from \\"mother\\". At first we think that Norman is just having flashbacks. However, as he also starts to get phone calls from \\"mother\\" you start to think he is going back to insane.During all of this, Marion Crane's sister Lila Loomis believes strongly that Norman Bates is still insane.\\"Psycho II\\" is a very good sequel to the classic original.

It gives Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 film a very bad name. For one thing, at the end of the first film, the psychiatrist said that the mother side of Norman's brain was now dominant. In the sequel you wouldn't even think he ever had a problem. Also, there should not have been any nudity and very little blood.

Seeing him on screen again certainly strikes a chord, especially when he is filmed together with his famous residence. But the pleasures of \\"Psycho II\\" end there.

Anthony Perkins gives a stellar performance as Norman Bates trying to peice his life together after 22 years in jail. Meg Tilly is good as the young woman who befriends him. This high gloss production was a cash in on the success of movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th but regardless the end product was fully engrossing and suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie was excellent,just as good as if not better than the 1st Psycho!the quality was great and the movie was full of suspense and thrills.(if you can call it thrills)very pleased all round with this one kept me interested all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"POOR NORMAM","review":"Poor Norman. Norman (Anthony Perkins) tried to get his act together after he was released from the psychiatric institute. But his new friend, Mary (Meg Tilly) and her mother (Vera Miles)suceeded in making him go wacko again. Maybe if they would of left Norman alone, he could of actually been ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the original","review":"It is rare that a sequel can live up to the original.. especially when the original was a classic... but Psycho 2 brings back Norman Bates with a witty and extremely entertaining way.Perkins really develops Bates into the \\"psycho killer you root for\\" in this film.Amazing that a film wil a low $5 mill budget like this can be so much more captivating that the disposal $200 Mill budget films Hollywood is spitting out today !"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Oh god, mother, blood! blood!\\"","review":"The best sequel of all time. It's 23 years later and Norman is coming home. After 23 years in a mental institution Norman Bates is deemed rehabilitated. He goes home and begins working and leading a normal life. But his past continues to haunt him. Once he's in the house, familiar voices begin to be heard again. The sister of the 1st movie's shower victim wants to put Norman back into custody. So Lila, with the help of her daughter, begin to torment Norman. Murders begin to happen once more but are the murders the work of Norman? This movie contains all the shocks and turns that made the first so great. Alfred Hitchcock's gothic horror masterpiece was not shamed by this sequel at all. It made us realize what a good movie it really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy","review":"Though nothing can top the original, this is a really good sequel. You don't have the surprise of Norman in his mother's dress, you do have plenty of other twists and turns that make this a fun ride. It is pretty gorey, especially compared to the original movie. As far as thriller/horror movies go, Norman Bates is one of the great characters, and Perkins is ideally cast then and now. Across in England they have a nice box set of all 4 psycho movies which I wish they would release stateside. You can't even buy part 4 over here."},{"rating":"2","title":"He\`s back...","review":"I remember sitting in a moviehouse November 1983 and we where ALL terrified! No, it isn\`t Halloween... But it\`s still great and in my opinon, superior to the 1960-film...2day\`s writers should learn by watching this film... Here the characters are introduced and the slowpaced narrative just builds a tension within us.... It\`s a must-see.... Perkins is brilliant as Norman... he knows his character.... Vera Miles and Meg Tilly shines too...."},{"rating":"2","title":"NORMAN'S BACK!","review":"23 YEARS LATER, NORMAN IS DECLARED SANE ENOUGH TO BE RELEASED FROM THE ASYLUM.

If you want to see this film, by all means do so, but I really would'nt see the point of owning it, unless you must own all the Psychos. It's always a bad sign, when instead of the whole movie entertaining you, only a few scenes do, but when these scenes are as enjoyable as they are in Psycho 2, it is a recommended viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is the best psycho movie made","review":"To me, Psycho 2 was the best pyscho movie made at of all the pyscho movies made.

This movie does nothing but detract from the original masterpiece. The characters and flat and uninteresting, the deaths are quick and unsuspenseful, leaving most of the movie to support itself on its boring story and poor dialogue, and the ending is terrible!I'm not saying that a sequel to \\"Psycho\\" shouldn't have been made. However, if a sequel were to be made, this obviously wasn't it. There's nothing remotely decent about this sequel other than Anthony Perkins. Made only to cash in on one of the most popular films of all time, \\"Psycho II\\" is a terrible slasher that has contributed to the bad reputation the genre has gotten.

The reason is that it started to develop a ring of rust on the inside where the bottom meets the side. The \\"stainless steel\\" label is simply false advertising.

Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Whistle","review":"Had a Copco teakettle for years and worked great. Unfortunately, we somehow lost the cover to it. Thus, ordered the Copco Escort. Two problems - difficult to remove the cover as there is no place to insert one's finger into the cover's plastic handle to remove it. Even worse, it does not whistle, making it very dangerous. I note that two other Amazon reviewers also report a weak or \\"no whistle\\" problem with the Copco Mirage. Thus, something appears to be wrong with this line of Copco teakettles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but doesn't whistle","review":"The Copco tea kettle looks as good as I had hoped.

I am going to have to throw it away and get a new one, from a different brand of course. I feel robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Size... So So Quality","review":"I love the size of this kettle. For a single person, the size is perfect. However, it begins to turn a copper color within a few months of use. I don't have some of the problems that people mention in the reviews, such as melting plastic or rusting but I agree that no amount of scrubbing will get this tea kettle to come clean of this copper color. The whistle always worked for me. If you don't mind an ugly tea kettle, then I think it is alright. But my tea kettle sits out everyday on my stove.Another issue that I don't like is the handle gets hot enough where I need to use a pot holder or kitchen towel.

While some of the technical information contained within is now outdated, much of it is still relevant... not to mention the social engineering tactics covered.The structure of \\"Corporate Espionage\\" is ideal, with Winkler discussing espionage concepts, followed by case studies and countermeasures. It almost reads like a manual, and an effective one at that.

With each album coming packed with at least 1 new song from the original you get some really rare tracks. I had only 2 complaints about about:1. All the lyrics are in one booklet and not in 4(also is has 2 versions of the lyrics for Sleepwalker for some reason, and no lyrics for Over the Hills and Far Away).2. The CDs don't include alot the extra tracks or japanese bonuses, like you see on some other versions here on Amazon.But, trust me on this, just because of these 2 minor complaints, it does not stop you from buying this GODLY Box.

It is not of professional grade. Even when being extremely careful it dispenses too much paint which causes runs or uneven line. It is designed to be used one time which makes it to expensive for a one time use. This should be priced at $5.00 to make it any kind of value. I found that that the rollers did not roll freely which caused the tool to slide and deposit an uneven layer of paint. Because of this I had to repaint much of what I painted with this tool. I do not reccomend this tool at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I've bought many edging tools over the years and NONE do a good job, including this one.

If I had red reviews before hand, I wouldn't have bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first","review":"To begin with I was so in love with this product for edges. Did exactly what it said. Loved the tray and the swivel head. Then it begin leaving black marks on the wall. I have contacted the manufacturers website and left feedback. Because of this problem it is next to useless unless I put pressure only on the side without the metal. I am going to try and put tape over the metal to see if I can still get some use from the product. Five stars without this problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I had high hopes for this product, since I hate taping off trim, but I highly recommend you don't waste your time with it. I got so frustrated with this product that I gave up halfway through my project and went to the store to get tape and a real trim roller. The main problem is that it is impossible to get just the right amount of paint loaded. It seemed like I was either getting too little and doing the same area over and over, or too much and then it drips everywhere. Also, the coverage is very uneven, so if there is a small space which just requires a little roller, you cannot use this one because it overpaints the edges and underpaints the center. This is absolutely the worst painting tool I have ever purchased, so bad that I contacted the company and am leaving this review for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have never written a review before, but I feel I need to alert people so they don't waste money or ruin their ceilings and woodwork. I bought this because it was marked down. It looked pretty nifty. I would be even more disappointed if I had paid full price. I ended up having to go out and buy tape anyway because this is a horrible product. A metal edge scrapes paint off your woodwork and the ceiling line is horrible. Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake I did. Buy the Shur-Line Premium Paint Edger for a great and cheap ceiling edger and tape your woodwork. This product is also messy and has way too many parts that need to be replaced with subsequent paint projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother","review":"In the time it took to figure out how this thing worked I could paint the trim free hand.

I realize you can't put a whole life into the time frame of a movie. But this is full of major inconsistencies. I would recommend this movie, WITH RESERVATIONS, to somebody who already knows the truth about Vlad's life from an imartial source and who also enjoys beautiful settings and passable to good acting. Most of it was pleasant to watch.And WHY did they depict this man without a moustache? It's his most distinguishing feature. They should have had the moustache even if it meant giving up the high cheekbones.I think the Immortal Life ending was a mistake, and the cover is misleading in the extreme. And it's not even a spoiler for me to say this, because the cover would otherwise lead one to believe it was a vampire flick. There is no hint of vampirism in the final scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but no cigar!","review":"I saw this film when it was on USA Network and I thought it was a very poor attempt to show the story of Vlad the Impaler/Dracula.The character did not evolve to the man we have seen in the standard portrait of Vlad, the hat with the rows of pearls and the ruby star with the feather in it and no mustashe was ever developed. Her looked scruffy and unshaven through most of the film. and the ending was worst of all as they linked vlad with what would later become the vampire Dracula. If you want a good film on Vlad the Impaler, then I suggest you go to VIDEO SEARCH OF MIAMI and get the Romainan film VLAD THE IMPALER which has english subtitles, but is a far better film on Vlad. The copy quality is not great but the story is more to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"not 5 stars but 10 stars!!!!","review":"I had figured this would be just another cheesey vampire movie, but it wasn't.

The movie was touching, intense, and kept my eyes glued to the tv so as not to miss a single thing.

He could have taken better advantage of having this opportunity with Bettie.If he used this technique to get more information from Bettie, he should have gone about it differently.

Corduroy, my favorite, is addictive and a magnificent song. Better man is good as well. However, outside of these, I couldn't get into the album. Especially Bugs, I hated it.

This is the only way that this pathetic, throw-away of an album could possibly get more than 1 star. This album lacks melody, structure, feeling, mood and originality. This album was clearly released to satisfy label requirements -Pearl Jam put no effort into this release. The reason that I am reviewing this album 6 years after its release is that I've noticed that there are very few negative reviews posted on this site. This led me to believe that Amazon either only posts favorable reviews or writes their own. So, in order to test this, I picked one of the worst albums I have ever heard and checked the reviews.

The only songs that are loud, are 'last exit', 'Spin the black circle', 'Tremor Christ', and 'The Whipping'.There is a little more creativity, on this cd.

Its is not like Ten or Vs. ,which are very good, but it represents their best work to date.If you scatch off the last track and some other gimmicks this album is completely flawless. It has beautiful ballads, like Nothingman and Immortality, and some hard rock masterpieces like Spin the Black Circle and Satan's Bed. It can display every emotion you go through in life and everyone should one it. The highlight is Corduroy. This is the greatest PJ song ever! It just really instills something inside of me when I hear it.I cannot even sayy more words to tell you why you should buy it. So just do it.Dont get to freaked out by the book. I dont really understand it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of solid twists and turns","review":"I've always like this cd. When it came out, people said it was weird and quirky, but I say wonderfully so. Last Exit's clamouring guitars and catchy chorus are simply lovely. Even though Not For You is a bit whiny, it has a flowing burn. Tremor Christ, to me, is a great one to sing along with, showing how E.V. has probably the greatest voice ever. Right down to Satan's Bed the band embraces all the weird vibes that this cd was supposed to deliver. I don't care if this album helped to get rid of the high-fivin' bone heads that didn't get the full message. To them I say, see you at a Matchbox 12 concert (although I won't be there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 songs great, 10 songs terrible","review":"I love \\"Corduroy,\\" and \\"Not For You,\\" \\"Better Man,\\" and \\"Immortality\\" belong on a hypothetical Best-of collection, but the rest is a confused, disjointed mess.

The result was one of the greatest albums of all time. Pearl Jam had a great recipe for success and great songs; I still wonder to this day why in the world would they threw all of that away? Vitalogy is the album where Eddie took over all aspects of the band and wrote over-simplistic songs with cheesy riffs that sounded like they came from a 3rd rate garage band.

If you do not own this album go buy it trust me you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best?","review":"First off, I only give 5 stars for a select few albums, so don't be fooled by my 4 star rating. This album took Pearl Jam into a completely different direction, and thank goodness. Although Ten, and to a greater extent VS. are great albums, they would have been wearing thin creatively had they tried to hold to the grunge style that dominates those two albums. \\"Nothingman\\" is a beautiful, balladesque piece that works better than anything similar they'd attempted before. Straight ahead rockers like \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" and \\"Whipping\\" are more fresh and lively than anything in their previous work. \\"Corduroy\\" and \\"Better Man\\" are songs of epic proportions that add nice dynamics to the mix. All the other tracks add in some way or another, and add to create possibly the darkest, rockiest, and musically solid album they've yet to create (although No Code is more diverse and experimental and also quite excellent). A far better album than most people give them credit for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam's watershed (between the lines)","review":"With \\"Ten and \\"Vs.\\", Pearl Jam reinvented modern rock with it's Zeppelin-ish raw power. The band was merely carried by Vedder. They were an arena rock radio staple band. \\"Vitalogy\\" was a crossroad that established the line between Pearl Jam and the rest. 'Nothingman', 'Whipping', and 'Corduroy' were the three standout tracks that showed Pearl Jam's depth in one album. From \\"Vitalogy\\"'s album package to it's strangely hypnotic musical trials, the album became a modern classic from it's first days. The feel will never be reproduced. If you enjoyed \\"Vitalogy\\" listen to Pearl Jam's \\"Yield\\", Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", or R.E.M.'s \\"Up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly dark & intense & thought provoking","review":"absolutely mind blowing, the best 90s album, its so great , & takes a long time to grow on youbut its worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"the heart of pearl jam","review":"Pearl Jam achieved perfection on 3 albums; Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy. Ten was the commercial sucess, Vs. was a glimpse into the bands anger and rage, and lastly Vitalogy was the album that went into the heart of what Pearl Jam was truly about. The album delves beyond hard core rock songs and grunge ballads into the enigma which is Pearl Jam. Vitalogy is at times baffling, confusing and hard to grasp but at the same time the music is so rewarding and deep. \\"Immortality, \\"Satans Bed\\", and \\"Corduroy\\", to name a few represent not the fading grunge era measured by time or teenage angst but by the emotions a truly great album can evoke. Vitalogy shouldn't be bought by true grunge fans but by true Pearl Jam fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is good music","review":"if i could give this six stars i would. easily the darkest, most heart felt and original record of the band. vedder's voice captures the mood of the music incredibly. cliff says- greatest album of all time? definately a contender. pearl jam have never re-capsulated the emotion in any other of their albums. amazing. tremor christ is the best song of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Whenever bands evolve, whenever artists take risks, there's always someone writing them off with 1 star because the newest album isn't enough like the classic one. I respect artists like PJ and Smashing Pumpkins who don't put out six versions of \\"Ten\\" or \\"Siamese Dream\\", respectively. Vitology rocks, and while it's uneven and contains a few annoying jokes, it's a lot better than \\"Jeremy II\\" would have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best grunge album ever","review":"Vitalogy is truly an extraordinary cd, definitely Pearl Jam's best. Compared to Ten and Vs, Vitalogy fearlessly moves to some completely different grounds, and it works!!!!All songs are precisely polished, Eddie's voice is more magnificent than ever before or since...Dark, moody, contemplative songs like Tremor Christ, Nothingman, or Immortality, excell both lyrically and melodicaly. The experimentation on the sound level in Bugs may be a little overdone, but the song's shocking words leave a definite message that will make you reconsider some crucial existencial stuff in your life...It also needs to be said that because of its distinctive sound marked with some decent experimentation, this might not be the right Pearl Jam cd to start with, but it is certainly the best of what Vedder & Co. have produced so far. If you already own some PJ stuff, this cd should definitely not be missing in your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is some powerful music here.","review":"Wow! After hearing Ten and Vs which are both fairly straight-forward rock albums, I was shocked at first by this album. While I love their first two albums this album is very powerful. By the time I get to the track \\"Nothingman\\" I'm almost brought to tears. While there are some tracks that are strange, such as Bugs, Pry To, and Aye Davinita, these tracks just seem to build the momentum to the refreshing sound of Better Man. The only song that I tend not to listen to is Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me because I'd rather not listen to a little kid talking to a \\"foxy\\" mop handle. Hmmmm. This album also has it's share of fresh fast tempo songs. Spin the Black Circle leads the pack. But the true beauty of this album is listening to it as a whole, feeling the feelings that this album makes you feel, and by the time you're done, you should be inspired, in whichever way you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"vitalogy","review":"i got this product very quick.it is about the 5th or 6th cd i have ordered from amazon.as much as i want to believe these cd's are original and new\\"i no some are not due to i buy them used\\".but even the ones that say they are new i dont think they are.but they play fine,look fine but i have had this vitalogy cd before and the cd cover and packaging was different then.but maybe it is made different now than it was back in 94 and 95.but over all i am satisfied.amazon is the place to buy cd's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing edition!!!","review":"Very nice 180 grms edition.

Vitalogy started Pearl Jam's slide into loud unimaginative \\"by the books guitar rock\\". Ten and Vs. had tremendous melodic guitars. Vitalogy and beyond turned Pearl Jam into a loud disjointed mess. If you're thinking about buying this CD don't. Just get Pearl Jam's first two (Ten & Vs.) and then forget about the rest of thier vastly overrated CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...","review":"Vitalogy alienated Pearl jam from the mainstream and most of thier original fans, including myself. They have been adrift ever since, trying desperately to avoid thier grunge roots. When a band has no purpose or direction it's time to stop. Pearl Jam havent showed any direction since Vs. On Vitalogy it seems like Pearl Jam began to make music just because they can. The album is very disjointed and the melodies sound repetitive and offkey. \\"Betterman\\" is the only memorable good song. 'Corduroy' could have been a classic if it had been performed with the energy of thier previous albums. I now look at Pearl Jam like a 20 something year old who wants to get serious with thier life but doesn't know what to do or where to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"How time does change minds","review":"I remember when everybody I knew thought this album was a train wreck when it first came out. Really, the only decent song on this album is Better man, everything else is filler. This was a haphazardly produced album that has no tempo or feeling, but rather a compilation of songs to meet a production deadline. Apparently though time has softened opinions on this album, at least according to Amazon reviewers. So with this in mind, I removed Vitalogy from my cd case, dusted off the cover and placed the disk into the stereo. What I heard was exactly how I remembered it, mediocre material. Time definitely did not soften my opinion on this album! For all newcomers to Pearl Jam, stick with Ten, which has much more solid writing and production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage days are back for Pearl Jam","review":"Please Pearl Jam fans...give this cd to the Salvation Army...what a piece of pathetic words put together with music that doesnt make any sense...TEN is THE album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into it..","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm not here to bash this album. I am a fan of Ten and Verses, but this was one change from this band I didn't care for.To me their quality of music dropped pretty bad when they made this album. The high points to me were Nothing Man and Better Man. Corduroy had a moment but over all this album was more lyrically driven(which there is nothing wrong with because music is nothing more than expressing one's opinion). The quality of the music is way too simple coming off their last two albums.This is obviously an opinion from a fan who preferes the old Pearl Jam. Having said this, my opinion is that if you're a Pearl Jam fan period or a fan of their recent works, this would be the album to get because this is where the big change began. If you are a fan of the old, this album may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to go back to the garage rock","review":"Vitalogy is a result of Pearl Jam's milking the grunge cow too many times. A genre where all the songs sound exactly the same just cannot sustain a 3rd album! Pathetically simplistic music, only those totally consumed with image will be able to stand listening through a song as bad as \\"Spin the Black Circle\\". Trust me, that's not the only dud. Other bombs include \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Stupid Mop\\": Pearl Jam's failed attempt to make grunge music a legitimate artistic music. Most listners will scream \\"Can't this band grow?\\" or \\"Take some music lessons\\" since Pearl Jam's idea of creating a different song is simply changing the tempo and lyrics of another song. Definately not an album worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection","review":"A collection of pointless bad songs. How they release this crap after Ten. Soundgarden and Nirvana and AIC are much better. Pearl Jam just try to sound like whatevers on the Radio that day, this band is just a lie and spit on their grunge roots which got them where they are.

Woven with nurse Hillary, Victor realizes being strong and living life to the full is what really matters.

Does that mean you can use the card on a turn where you have already rolled the die? no way to know).My son played the game for a couple of weeks and then forgot about it.So, buy this game only if your child is obsessed with Bionicles.

In Japan,he meets beautiful Hiroko and falls in love with her. Hiroko ends up joining Jack in going back to the United States. Hiroko's father owns the Japanese team that Jack plays for. This is somewhat like the real-life union of Yoko Ono and the late John Lennon. After success in Japan,Jack is welcomed back to his American team.

The story is basically about an older baseball player (Selleck) who is getting stale and unfit to play for his American Baseball team. Because of this, his team trades him over seas to a Japanese baseball team. Most of the humor from this often humorless flick, comes from Selleck's goofiness in trying to understand and comprehend Japanese traditions and ways of life. Somewhere in there, they toss in a love story between Selleck and a young Japanese woman. I couldn't really recall because I was falling asleep due to boredom. As with most baseball movies of this kind, it follows a very simple formula of slapstick comedy and ridiculous acting.

Judaism is again portrayed as a nationality, not a religion that one chooses. Jewish history is paramount; Jewish theology, nebulous. It doesn't matter if one is secular, atheistic, agnostic, a convert to Buddhism or Christianity or Shintoism: if one's mother was born to Jewish parents, her offspring is embraced by Jews and Gentiles alike as inescapably Jewish.

The character, Carter Sugarland, is her long time boyfriend, not husband, who will never make a commitment to Natalie. The synopsis makes it sound as though Natalie left her husband.

No boundaries exist. Asif the affair wasn't enough, the therapist also breaches confidentiality. Hoffmantreats this all as okay.The relationships are shallow and the dialogue simplistic.

At first I was reluctant to try her b/c she has so many books I thought it would be too syndicated and just follow a formula. But after reading The Story Sisters I realized how amazing Alice Hoffman is! Angel Landing, however, is painfully bad. Perhaps some people can relate to this very strange female main character, but I could not. I can't even remember the character's name, she's so forgettable. This book drags on and on and it was a sheer force of will to finish it. I should've given up. The premise is stupid, and the only good theme in the whole book is the \\"disturbed aura\\" surrounding her client/lover, but even that drags on and on to the point the character is basically unreachable.

However if you scan around you should find what you're looking for.There is also a clock with a programmable alarm built in which I didn't have a use for, but it could be useful to some people.The radio is very light, has a good quality speaker, and is inexpensive.

Already the volume dial is not working. I paid $7 for shipping the first time, now I have to pay to ship it back to Coby and then pay another $6 to have them ship it back to me. All for an $8 radio.Very cheap material used, low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Tuning?","review":"It has a digital display for AM and FM radio, but the problem is the tuning itself is not digital. You spin a knob on the side to tune it... making this no easier to tune stations. Who knew they even made radios like this? I bought this so I could easily change the channels from AM to FM but it is not easy at all. In fact it is very difficult to get to the right frequency. Also, I could not get in an AM channel that I know other radios could in the same location. On the plus side, it was compact and cheap. You get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst radio I've ever owned","review":"This radio has a dial-wheel so crude that it's hard to make it stop at the station you want -- and when you get there, it's often unable to separate that signal from others nearby on the dial. I've given it one-star just to be sure this is posted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"Looks good. Worked great for say 30 minutes. Then the tuner went out. I would not recommend this item for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real piece of crap","review":"This radio is junk; an unbelievably crude product in a time when such things are no longer permissible. While the dial reads in digital numbers as you turn the tuner, it is NOT digital tuning. The stations drift all over the place for no reason with no positive lock, and tuning is inexcusably twitchy and crude. The band selector button has no positive stops and must be forced from one position to another. Reception of fringe FM stations is very drifty and unreliable. If I had bought this at a local dealer, they would have had it back within two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible am/fm tuner, drifts","review":"You can watch the digital read out change numbers as the tuner is so bad.

The only thing digital is the display. The tuner is analog, not easily tuned to the correct station and drifts badly. Even when tuned to a strong local AM station, the radio must be properly rotated in order to get adequate reception. I would return it but it would cost almost as much as I paid for the piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"We have only had it for a few days. The dial on the power button stopped turning off. It just spins. So now it can't be used with batteries, only by a plug in/out can we turn it off. Defeats the purpose. I am sure other things will stop functioning soon based on other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This is a terrible radio. I wanted it for work just to listen to some sports talk radio or music in the morning. Unfortunately, it basically does not pick up any AM stations. And the FM stations don't come in much better. The tuner is terrible too, as it is so sensitive you have trouble getting it to the station you want (if that station will even come in on it). All in all, i'm just warning you not to buy this radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea made TOOOOOOO Small","review":"Item has great features and would have worked well except that to wear it comfortably you cannot have a waist larger than 25 inches.

This puppy, however, is a disaster. This book wanders aimlessly. It does little to teach coding techniques or exam topics, in fact, many of the examples are absurd and wrong. The end of chapter questions are an exploration of the depths of triva and irrelevance. How did such a book ever happen?

Particularly, the Brahms' Double Concerto is an elegant interpretation.Instead, this is simply a warning that, as of this writing, the pieces on this album are all mislabeled with respect to the downloads, previews, and names. In other words, if you are looking to purchase a single work (or track), as I did, you will end up with the wrong download. Amazon have been notified about this problem but do not appear to have taken any action on it. Additionally, in the correct downloads of the Brahms' Double Concerto, both the first and third movements have a very disruptive, static-like high frequency sound that hurts the ears and is likely representative of a poor transfer from CD. I cannot confirm if the CD contains these artifacts. I can only recommend that you avoid this download until these problems are resolved by Sony and Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable and Interesting Book","review":"This was an interesting book.

None of the other reviewers seem to have mentioned it at all, other then they liked it. And in my opinion, its easily the second best song on the album after Hallelujah. Its in my Top Ten Favorite Leonard Cohen Tracks. Theres nothing else like it, it has a very dark reggae vibe to it. The music kinda reminds me of a slowed down \\"gangsta party\\" by 2pac. The Melody is lovely and mysterious, and the lyrics are very touching.I just wanted to give Leonard some credit for that song, I absolutely love it. thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching people","review":"Leonard Cohan has always been one of the best artist in the wold and i was always suprised to find out some many people never heard of him so i was able to give this as a gift and now there is one more person who is in love with his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for gift giving","review":"Various Positions makes an excellent gift to introduce friends to Leonard Cohen. They will have heard his music as backgroud on television shows but may not know who he is. Some of his lyrics reference Biblical themes so subtly many listeners will never notice.

After 4-5 calls requesting a repair manual and a return call, with not one call being returned, I was finally able to speak with a service rep. I requested a repair manual once again, which again fell on deaf ears. I have the inverter but not the guidance to install it. I emailed the company concerning this issue but did not receive a reply.

It starts easy and has plenty of power for the average camper. I'm not sure I'd want to hear several of these in a campground but out in the woods it wouldn't bother anyone and delivers what it promises.I give it four stars because according to the description of this product it came equipped with a volt meter. There is not a volt meter and this was the deciding factor for us when we chose it. The dealer responded and said the decription was in error. Hopefully it has been corrected.Over all I would recommend this product if you need power occasionally and don't want to spend huge money. I've seen them locally for twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Made in China Junk","review":"Both the choke and fuel control knob were broken on delivery.

The book is much more intelligent than the somewhat predictable movie Ken Russell directed.Signe Laine and Harvey Newbegin are both very memorable characters. \\"Harry\\"'s interaction with Dawlish is fun, as always and the little portraits of other characters such as Harvey's wife and General Midwinter are insightful, too. It's a fun and intelligent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was bored by it, then loved it.","review":"After \\"Nothing Feels Good\\", I expected something that would absolutely hook my attention. This didn't. It took about ten drives in the car with this on for me to realize that, yeah, it's okay. After a few go rounds in the discman, I was transfixed. I can't get \\"Jersey Shore\\" out of my head, and I think that my schoolwork is suffering. The album is amazing though, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably catchy","review":"While their debut, \\"30 Degrees Everywhere\\" is infinitely more admirable and ground-breaking from an indie/emo rock standpoint, \\"Very Emergency\\" showcases Promise Ring's ability to write incredibly catchy songs and really get you moving. These are the fun kinds of songs you just can't wait to hear them play live, so that you can dance around with the band. It's particularly for fans of the \\"Boys & Girls\\" EP, or along the same vein of \\"Why Did Ever We Meet?\\". Happy-go-lucky and bouncy without forgetting their thoughtful lyrics, and certainly more pop-punky than their previous efforts. It's admittedly not their best CD, but this one sure grows on you -- and fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great catchy album with only some minor flaws","review":"Imagine what it would sound like if you crossed Weezer and Green Day light. You'd get this collection of songs. This lbum has catchy songs like \\"Happiness is all the Rage\\" and \\"The Deep South\\". There's two mellower songs \\"Things Just Getting Good\\" and \\"All of My Everythings\\". I have several of their albums and musically this one is their best. Lyrically, however, a few of the songs fall a bit flat. The songs still rock but it feels like their creativity ebbs in songs like \\"Skips a Beat (Over You)\\". It repeats the same bouncy trite verse and refrain. Still songs like \\"Emergency! Emergency!\\", \\"Living Around\\", and \\"Jersey Shore\\" make up for that song. The only other song that's a bit on the weak side is \\"Arms & Danger\\". Other than that, it's a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good","review":"The guys in this band sound like they're trying to get it right.The only thing wrong with this record is that it is too consistent, too catchy, too accomplished, too well done, too straightforward, too well produced, too upbeat, too hummable, too much of culmination of everything they've done before, too overlooked by the record buying public, too much of a sunny day with nothing to do but drink beer and look at the grass grow and the sun shine (although it's 3 below outside).The Promise Ring finally got it totally right. If this record was 10 minutes longer it would bore with it's perfection. Their last few records were consistent in that they had a few really great melodic and poppy, punkish songs with some, slower, tossaways. This one charges through and only fails in being so \\"finished\\" and so dang right.Great band, great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun pop-record.","review":"Much-improved vocals.

Sure, davey can sing better, but there's nothing to lead me to believe that they finished writing the songs...it just rolls from one catchy but not-so-interesting part to the other. True, at least its not hoover-esque emo sludge, but if you want to call it pop, it ain't the Jam, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"sell outs","review":"compared to the promise ring's previous releases, this is extremely monotonous, boring, blink 182 pop. i have no idea where all that great songwriting went. each song on this cd sounds like it was the product of a teen mtv focus group. and the singer can sing now. thats blasphemous, and in some ways sad. how could a good band become so perverted? if you like the promise ring, stay away from this. you've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scans right into Outlook with no mistakes","review":"I was looking for something that would just scan cards directly into an outlook contact without going through clumsy intermediate contact management tools.

It does very well with simple cards. No editing required. If the card has lot's of logo graphics or odd fonts, it has some trouble. It will also occasionally mix up an 'i' with an 'l', but that is understandable. Recalibration reduces the problem. It also did not recognize hand written corrections on cards.The big plus however, is that it has a very slick interface with Outlook Contacts. When it scans a card, it loads what it read into the New Contact window and awaits your edits. It also drops a .jpg of the card right into the notes section for easy comparison. That makes corrections easy and allows you to toss the cards.I was not expecting a magic reader and it isn't, but it definitely helped me clean up Contacts and the hundreds of accumulated cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Licensing issues","review":"Beware: The bulk of the almost $200 cost here is the license.

I get home and pop it in and I nearly drop kicked my big wheel through the window, what was this junk? There was no \\"At the playground\\" and no \\"Iesha\\" instead it was this goofy sounding 80's music. Not just 80s music, bad 80s music. I was hearing songs like \\"Be Near Me\\" and \\"Look of Love\\". And the boys voices had really changed and gotten deeper. It was no Martika. I should've had a clue because instead of the boys on the cover it's some dude in a hoity toity bullfighting outfit.

The rest of it is a take-it-or-leave guide to the band's declining fortunes, wherein having milked every possible angle out of their glossy camp schtick, they tried their hand at writing serious music with predictably disastrous results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Group - Poor Remaster","review":"From 1981, ABC were one of the biggest selling groups of the decade in their native UK, and flooded the charts with slik, bubbly, snappy 80's pop.

I received it for a promo, but upon playing the disc, thought I was playing a worn out cassette tape, from my car's glove-box. It sound hissy, hollow, and for some odd reason, all the high ends have been killed through a tainted remastering job. I don't know what they've done, but as weird as it is, this CD sounds the same as a cheap audio cassette.Instead, see if you can pick up their albums second hand.

Also, it appears that True Grit and Shootout have some of the same location scenes shot from the same angle. One more thing - take a close look at the scene at the train depot and see if you cannot find a jet stream. I recommend Gregory Peck's, The Stalking Moon, over Shootout.

After watching it by myself, however, I realized there was no way I could share this. Despite the introduction it is not really an introduction to swinging. It is more along the lines of a cheap porn flick. They have a few unattractive porn stars act out various swing scenarios and then pretend to talk to a couple of therapists. If you are looking for a bad porn feel free to get this film, but if you want a real guide to swinging save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain","review":"For its price I definitely recommend all the puzzle lovers out there to get it. It's got some tantalizing, original puzzles in it, like they'll show you a close-up of an object and ask you to identify it. This is much harder than you think, but very entertaining. The \\"nursery rhyme\\" puzzles are truly one of its kind. They paraphrase a nursery rhyme into a mad-scientist's language and ask you to identify the jumbled nursery rhyme. Too bad there're only four such puzzles in it... And then there's also the silly \\"does canada have a july 4th\\" type of puzzles.

The question arises: \\"Where has the director been?\\". Some films may have turned out the way they were expected to, flattening the tension curve to yawning dimensions. But this product hasn't even the slightest bud of excitement, veni vidi - that's all. You fans of Andie MacDowell - she's \\"Too marvellous for words\\".

Wang is able to gently lead one into understanding, like the adept he is.Now, his Tarot deck leaves a LOT to be desired. I don't recommend that at all.

My recommendations are the Trachtenberg Method and Vedic Mathematics. Scott uses some of these methods, but does not refer nor cite them. One last thing, is do not believe the hype on this man. I saw the list where he was placed last in the 2004 Mental Calculation World Cup.

If you need to learn or teach math get a Spectrum Book. These were nothing more then a waste of money. I always look and find something good about everyone and everything.

Overdubbing, multisequencing, split track editing, these are things a producer shouldn't be concerned with. This book gives you a crash course and more.

Take it from me, to be honest it is one of the best hockey movies to date. Slap shot is about a hockey team that was going through a rough time and will to anything to win.

But why lie this film is such a Riot I LOVED IT!!! So when I bought it for my DVD player It was the first pre-1980 movie I bought and I have to say I watched it (after I went to a Kings game none the less) in a whole new light.... The Hockey sequences (especially in the Beginning) Sounded Incredible...I noticed little things that I have never seen before (look at the Hansons Jackets for example).. I was BLOWN AWAY!!!Also It is the original score of the film.... But I never know there were FLEETWOOD MAC songs in this Movie... (My VHS version has some crappy filler songs) Overall it was a great viewing experience and a MUST for all Hockey fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Old-Time Hockey\\"","review":"Paul Newman reunited with director George Roy Hill for this perceptive look at minor league hockey and its impact on a blue-collar steel town. Profane, violent and very funny, \\"Slap Shot\\" (1977) has grown in stature as a classic sports film. Newman delivers a career-high performance as player-coach Reggie Dunlop, complemented by a wonderful ensemble cast. And three cheers for the Hanson Brothers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"Paul Newman was hopelessly miscast in this pic.It was unnerving to hear the filth that came from his mouth.He is too great for that.Hard to believe this is the same man who excelled as Fast Eddie Felson or Cool Hand Luke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be whos doing the puck","review":"HOLY COW...More foul language f words & PORN .

With 25 years of build up, I was really looking forward to it. Wow, was I disappointed. I didn't expect technically good hockey playing, I know it's a comedy, but to me it really wasn't funny either. Maybe 25 years ago, when I was in my twenties, I might have laughed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've tried to find something very positive to say but cannot. I thought a Hill - Newman film couldn't miss but even as a comedy, this falls flat. The film ends up little more than a series of violent hockey games, even an attempt at 'old time hockey' at the end fails and team wins by beating up their opponents. Maybe the movie reflects the period of the mid-70s when it was produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slapshot","review":"Simply put a must have - one of the greatest sports movies of all time. The Hansen's are timeless characters to be loved by all. The movie features a ... tease that is widely touted, but detracks from the old time hockey of the Hansen's. Enough to make even Eddie Shore proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never play \\"Lady of Spain\\" again!","review":"Yes, perhaps my title is a bit non-sensical, but once you have experienced the film classic that is \\"Slap Shot,\\" these and countless other pieces of dialogue will roll of the toungues of you and your friends with much hilarity. It is a prerequisite to own \\"Slap Shot\\" if you are a hockey fan, or simply a fan of comedy. Though lude at times, the humor is not completely derived from shock value, but from clever and witty situations and unforgettable characters (the Hanson Brothers, Reggie Dunlop, Jim Carr, and Denis Lemieux). Definitely a film classic and a mandatory addition to your DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL HANSON BROTHERS","review":"To all of you who think the hanson brothers are a child musical group who umbopped themselves to stardom... your in for a real shock. This movie is the real hanson brothers. Slap Shot is a classic movie! the ground work for other sports parodies like Major Leauge and Necessary Roughness. If you cant laugh watching this movie , I suggest a funny bone transplant. Its a great nostalgic trip into 70's fashion, cars, and a killer soundtrack of 70's music.This cast of misfit hockey players, the french canadian goalie Denni Le Moiux's allergy to the fans, the iron leauges rejects the hanson bros., and the perverted humor of Morris( moe) is classic.Filled with hockey action on and off the rink, Slap Shot is a timeless and timefull classic. A MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I bought these movies because I once saw a trailer featuring the hansons and it seemed like a fun movie to watch. The original movie is really boring, there are only a couple of scenes worth watching. Slap Shot 2 is probably the worst movie I've ever seen...

The hockey games were funny but that was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was not happy to see Paul Newman, a great talent, wasted in this movie. Sorry, I had to turn it off and rewind after suffering through a little more than half of it. The language, not a complete sentence, just vulgarity, was carried too far. Hockey is a rough sport. Was it necessary to insult hockey players intelligence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOPHOMORIC AND BANAL","review":"I wish I could say something positive about this movie but that is impossible.The humor is on a high shool level at best, and at times plumets to new depthswith offensive sexist and homophobic humor. The use of coarse language only serves to pander to the lowest strata of our society. Glamorizing violence in sports only sets a bad example for our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this for a child hockey fan!","review":"I bought this for my son who is a huge hockey fan. This movie is not for kids, and quite honestly not for Hockey fans either. Most of this movie is focused on a bunch of sex crazed vulgar, middle aged, wanna-be athletes. This is a terrible example of the sport of hockey. The use of violence as a way for this team to succeed is not the lesson I want my young athlete to learn. If you want your hockey player to see a movie that shows the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship, buy the Mighty Ducks movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic sports comedy","review":"This is one of the classics. Who are these people giving this film 1 star? Are they too uptight to understand the humour. The story is great - anyone who has been invlolved in minor league hockey should enjoy this movie. I was invlolved in Roller Hockey for 3 seasons and this movie captures the mood and essence of minor league hockey players and their \\"happy-go lucky\\" spirit about the game of hockey and the game of life. The story within the story captures today's sports world. The team owners threats to move the team to Florida have become a reality in the 1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with time","review":"Beyond a shadow of a doubt the greatest sports movie ever made. Funny and truthful. Slap Shot shows you what hockey used to be. And what minor league hockey was back in the 70's. Nothing more than a brawl every night. 90% of the characters are based on real people and the life these minor league hockey players lead is the basis of this great movie.The movie was shot in the Northeast at various minor league hockey arenas in Johnstown, Syracuse, Utica, and at Colgate college.The DVD is awesome. You get commentary from THE HANSON brothers telling you where each scene is shot and real life stories about what happened when they played at these various arenas in real life. If your not a hockey fan, this will make you one. If you are a hockey fan this just reinforces why you are one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll be damned if he didn't hee hee hee!","review":"The quinessential late seventies classic.

It'll help if you've ever lived where kids learn to skate before they walk, but most everyone will get the idea. If they had left a lot of the profanity out it would have still been pretty funny. The way it is, it would be best if kids didn't watch it for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I was hoping for - EITHER","review":"Although the story has some different twists & that was fun, it's the artwork that spurred me to write a review. What a total let down. In one case Cinderella even looks mean & ugly. What a catastrophy for a parent trying to explain that to a confused child. I think Debrah Santini is the illustrator. She really didn't do the book the justice it deserves. Another example, see the cover & notice the look of her face. I hate to put an artist down, but the word disaster comes to mind. Try to explain to you children that they should look at the beautiful drawings and not at anyone's face, yipes! Run away from this one at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I was hoping for","review":"My daughter loves the story of Cinderella, so when we found this at the library, I got it for her. We were both disappointed. It's not at all what I wanted. Cinderella is in a slightly different setting, but the story is very traditional. The only difference is that she appears to live in a 19th century city. I don't mind that. But the illustrations are completely unmagical. Cinderella scarcely looks different from anyone else in the book. I really couldn't tell which one she was in some pictures. What a let down. Find another version and don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's New England in my life?","review":"Absolutely the best album I have heard in a long time.

However, one of my new found favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I sort of get it...","review":"The Promise Ring are from my hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I really wanted to give this disc a higher rating for that reason alone! However, this disc does not quite cut it for me. I own it, but rarely listen to it. In order to enjoy it I have to be in just the right sort of mood; one that craves rather disjointed music that doesn't really rise and fall at all, but just is. This is not a bad album. This is not a great album. It just sort of is. The first track is decent, but it does not go anywhere. The rest are rather forgetable. They all kind of run together. I enjoy some emo, but as others have said, I don't really care too much for the lead vocalist. Again, he's not bad, he's not great. He just sort of exists and drones in the same manner on all tracks. I remain curious about \\"30 degrees everywhere\\". Perhaps that is a better disc. Hit and (mostly) miss. I might recommend checking out the little heard, now-defunct band BLOOMSDAY as an alternative to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Didn't I Ever listen to The Promise Ring before?","review":"I first got this CD from a friend who didn't listen to it anymore. (Now he wants it back... mwahahaha...) I heard of TPR before that, but i only heard one of their songs before. Is This Thing On? got me hooked right away. This album is good to listen to in a mellow mood, and it's so powerful that it WILL put you in a mellow mood. Perfect Lines has a good melody and the drums fit in perfectly with the guitar. Even though Red And Blue Jeans has one line of lyrics, they managed to make it almost 3 minutes and it's very soothing. But, no song on that album can beat Why Did We Ever Meet? It is... just amazing. The song is so catchy, and the guitar riffs remind me somehow of Bad Moon Rising. The CD pulls off great and ends strong with B Is For Bethlehem and Forget Me... two great songs. This CD is just mouth-gaping good. Anyone would like it. I Promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak but easy to hum along to","review":"Heard a lot of good reviews of this record, but I think it's very weak compared to other records in the genre... try Jawbreaker's \\"Unfun\\" or SamIam's \\"Soar\\".

As far as the real life couples, they may be real but they are porn actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great at all","review":"This was just like a porno, I could not believe the people on the DVD were married or a couple for that matter. The men in the video sounded dumb, but if you are a woman you will find the men as eye candy and if you were in a relationship you would want the men to just shut up and get to business without saying a word ..lol..and if you are a man the women are above average- but the people that make these DVDs are not going to put unattracted couples in these, after all they want you to watch it; it is not worth the full price...get it used if you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"There's no educational value in this DVD at all. It shows me some locations in the house where a couple can make love like the laundry room. That's nothing new to me. The acting is awkward. They even did not do foreplay in the film.In short, be imaginative, explore all the locations or rooms in your house, try everything you like. If you do that, not only you'll save $19 but it will be also more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Hollywood morality tale","review":"The same, old, tired leftish cliche: evil, corrupt police and prison officials, noble (and, of course, actually innocent) death-row murderer -- you get the picture.

Delicate vocals, strong instrumentals, blend together, offering both passive and uplifting listening. Coming from a CD player, or uploaded to an iPod Renee Olstead is a subtle entertainment for any occasion. I remember when this young vocalist sang one time on her sitcom Still Standing; the storyline did not offer any additional opportunity at that time, but was sort of dismissed. It's great that she was discovered, now has three albums out and in addition has performed with two of America's premier entertainers: David Foster and Chris Botti at their concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skylark","review":"Renee Olstead has one of the best voices for singing Jazz, she did not let me down in this CD. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renee Olstead All Grown Up","review":"Wow... don't know why it took so long to see this newest album, but it was indeed worth the wait! Yeah, at 21 she still has that amazingly youthful quality but this set is sooooo much more than \\"cute\\". David Foster has crafted a sound and style that belies Renee's age and experience and, in fact, establishes a recognizable uniqueness that all singers struggle to find. Picture a mix of Joni James and Ricky Lee Jones... now double the talent level. Unlike many albums, this one is memorable for every track...no weak fillers here. If you love vocal swing with ear-filling, heart-pumping big band accompaniment, then all I can say is BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable Renee","review":"The beautiful voice we expect. Renee gets credit for writing some of these songs.Many songs are named \\"Hold Me Now,\\" but her's is special. I think it's the gem of the collection. I like the dream/fantasy feel of \\"Stars Fell on Alabama,\\" and \\"Midnight in Austin Texas\\" is just plain fun.This CD is mostly romance, and won't let her come through with the power we know her voice has, but it shows variety in her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been sucker-punched","review":"Renee, child, what were you thinking?Don't you have PEOPLE? Like others, I've been waiting for years for your follow-up, and those silly people ran ramshod over the making of this CD! Why did they suffocate you with this smarmy stuff, and the production is piss-poor...You and Mr. Foster put one on us with your epilogue cut, \\"nothing but the blame\\", by far the best selection.

It is 'easy listening' at its roots, not the later light music or beautiful music or muzak which I personally think of as easy listening. This disc has songs by Sarah Vaughn, Nina Simone, Julie London, and Judy Garland, amongst many others. Some, such as Fred Astaire singing 'Night and Day' are not anything like what I might call easy listening. They are jazz vocal classics. For that - this is a fine collection. For the easy listening radio favorites of the 60's and 70's - well, this album has none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to look at - not to play","review":"I had one of these. From the box the action was very high and hard to play. I had a shop asjust it and change out the low grade strings. The tuners aren't that nice either. The strings fall out of tune pretty fast.

These songs are mediocre at best. I can't recall the track, but one of the guitar solos has a section where the pentatonic scale used doesn't fit the key!

The video seems to break you in gently and then WOW! There were three loving couples, but there was one particular couple that I thought had the most passion and I gather that is why they put them toward the end. They were also in the bonus track: from Volume One, of which I think I will purchase. I enjoyed listening to the views of people on lovemaking and the sense of humor they had with it. All in all, I did like this video and it's wonderful to have a tasteful video on Black loving couples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good watch, but tedious in spots.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Most \\"rock stars\\" (or athletes for that matter) turned actor aren't worth the time spent to film them, but Dee Snider pulled this one out rather well. The plot, although a little cliche, kept me interested and the visuals were \\"stimulating\\". Coupled with a monster soundtrack, I think I would consider Dee Snider's freshman effort a success. My only problem with this film were Dee's \\"soliloqies\\". Too many times, we hear Capt. Howdy, waxing philosophical about the ancient traditions and rituals of pain and torture. It almost got to the point once or twice where it could be guessed at what he was going to say before he said it (and guess correctly). But, that wasn't enough to bring the movie down for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and plan on getting the soundtrack and the video (when the price comes down)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dee needs to stick to music","review":"Although his intentions are there, there is no atmosphere of fright in this movie. I think he should have directed it with someone other than himself in this movie.The plot is not a dull one and therefor should have been performed by someone like Anthony Hopkins. The scenes are sick and twisted but that is good however, Dee should really stick to making music as I didnt find him a bit scary but rather comical.If you like gore and sexual exploitation, this movie is for you. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I love Dee Snider and Twisted Sister and I read about this repeatedly in Fangoria.

It was actually somewhat interesting. Still, I hated this film, it hurt me to watch because it was so WEAK. The violence was very fake looking, the acting was horrible with the lone excpetion of MEDIOCRE Kevin Gage. Dee Snider's Captain Howdy was laughable, half due to Snider's acting, and half due merely to the way he looks. He wasn't menacing. The ending is especially weak. Pieplow's direction is completely bland and uninspired, never even once inspiring any sort of fear. The \\"philosophical\\" underpinnings of body piercing and torture and pain and etc. were as laughable as the rest of the script.

Turns out it was okay, but nothing great. There are some good ideas, and the plot sounded interesting, but I thought that the movie just didn't fullfill what it could've. I admit that it had its moments here and there, but not totally. Dee Snider did a pretty good job though. The scenes with the people in his torture chamber were quite bizarre and twisted I have to admit. I just think that the movie could've been better. I wouldn't even really consider this a horror flick. If you want that, pick up the Evil Dead Collector's Edition. Now that's horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dee Snider's Strange Land","review":"Dee Snider is the coolest.Strange Land is killer ChaptHowdy rule's.The freakyest online movie there is.Dee Snider is the master of scary He know how to make a movie that rules that has style and that's so out of it.Dee Snider know's how to make a movie and music go together so if you'r.Lookin to buy a good movie get Dee Snider's Strange Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever!","review":"I watched about 1/2 of it and turned it off.

What makes this movie great is it shows the aftermath of violent crimes and how hard it is for people to carry on. You'll need a strong stomach for this flick. Dee tries to do too much with his first film but it's still a great ride!

Captain Howdy is a character who can easily rival Jason, Freddy and The Tall Man. As old as you might get, you are sure to rightfully take the honor of being my parents' worst nightmare. This movie needs to be watched twice. The first time without narration, you'll get the horrific aspect. The second time with narration, it's a laugh attack (I still can't get over that extra who had to hobble his way on crutches up the hill!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: This movie is a loser.","review":"\\"Strangeland\\" is one of those dime a dozen movies that employs torture scenes that are meant to disturb the viewer. There is nothing suspenseful or scary about it. There is no atmosphere, and the story is lame and so is the script. There really isn't much of plot, and the villain in unconvincing in his over the top role. I was very disappointed in this trash. This movie is so stupid, and I guess that's one of the reasons people like it because it's so bad that it's funny, but those types of movies just do not interest me. You can have all the torture, pain and suffering that you want, but unless you have a good story, decent acting, atmosphere and suspense, you are not going to have a good horror movie. And, \\"Strangeland\\" is not exception to that rule; it's a total loser. And, on one final note, I must say that the guy with those piercings scares me about as much as that kid on the \\"Wonder Years\\". What a joke! LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misanthropy at its best.","review":"I've read every single reveiw on here and have noticed none of the people have a very open eye for creativity.This movie is absolutely amazing, educational in many ways, and everything else mixed into it. Failing to notice these points of veiws are just outright stupid.Charles Manson had a million and a half good points and so did the imfamous \\"CaptHowdy\\", but their mental instability kept them from releasing them in a positive way, and the others around them were to ignorant and blind to see past their shell and look into a new life, whats really going on in the world. You people fail to understand that this movie could very easily become a reality, the detectives weren't \\"stupid\\", the guy was using a stolen cell phone, stolen credit card, everything.

It was the most original horror/suspense shocker that has come out in a very long time. It had all the elements of classic horror as well as the psychological effects of films like Silence Of The Lambs and Seven. The Cyber-predator/Modern Primitive Captain Howdy is the Freddy Kruger for the new millenium.The character has what it takes to be the next big horror icon. This movie definetly has the potential to become a cult classic. I can't wait for the sequel STRANGELAND 2 : THE CULT OF PERSONALITY to come out, so I can see the further adventures of the Goulish Captain Howdy. In closing, if your into old school horror in the vain of A Nightmare On Elm Street and Hellraiser as well as films like Seven and The Silence Of The Lambs and aretired of those trendy garbage imitation horror movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer - than this film is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is amazing I love it","review":"Its one of the best intriguing movies i have ever seen this movie rocks, i cant wait for the sequal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness Abounds!","review":"So, another \\"shocking\\" portrayal of the seamy underside of life!

I later foundout he had not seen this movie. How I envied him. Boring and stupid. Those two words say it all. This movie tries to be a horror movie about this psycho played by Dee Snyder. Well Dee's performance and this movie are terrible. Nothing in this movie warrants viewing. The sight of a girl's lips sewn off is on the cover, which makes it look cool. Well this ain't cool. It's annyoing. Watching this film just got worse and worse. And then it hit me. From the corner of my eye I saw the stop /eject button. I ejected the tape and drove to the store to drop it off. I tried my hardest to forget this crap movie. But I have decided to warn others. If someone suggests for you to buy this tape or DVD or you are thinking of buying it. Just say no.

Watching leaves fall off trees is more entertaining then this wannabe horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dee Snider is the next icon of horror!","review":"\\"Dee Snider's StrangeLand\\" is a breath of fresh air for fans of the dark films and the horror genre. If you're sick to death of the typical \\"cutesy teens being slashed to bits\\" type horror, which has become the standard today, you will love this dark, new, reality-based approach of this film. Dee Snider plays an amazing villain who is far from predictible and, though thoroughly repulsed, we, the audience can not get enough of. This is a disturbing film that, though far from perfect, offers something different from the norm (Robert \\"Freddy Kruger\\" Englund plays a vicitim) and is an excellent first effort from fledgling actor and writer, Dee Snider. This film is a MUST for any fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"dee snider kicks a**","review":"watch dee snider f*ck sh*t up in this classic horror flic! they just don't make em like this anymore. if your into real horror film, you'll love this. it's one of the best. if your soft, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong stomach and open mind needed","review":"This movie in my opinion was a wonderfully made film of complete physical and emtional torture.

Needless to say, we were all sick with disgust. What a stupid, horrible movie. Not one thing is clever, scary, or suspenseful. It's just another hack gorehound wanting to be sick and disturbing with a movie with no entertainment or scare value. They just want to be cold tripe like Texas Chainsaw and other shock/exploitation films. We need less and less of these types of films. Do something better with your time and intelligence. Please!.

This is the soundtrack where I was first introduced to Indie rock queen, Liz Phair - the song Don't Have Time is absolutely amazing and comical. Eve's Plumb was a good band - the song Eye is very strange but good. The rest of the tracks I don't care for, not my cup of tea. But worth purchasing for Tori, she's one of my favorite songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT!!!???","review":"I read all 13 reviews and I did not even see the work Outkast.

Great movie, and great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Cable Spacesavers","review":"As I wrote in a previous review, for anyone who prizes compactness, these spring loaded roll-up cables are \\"just the ticket\\". Through a series of ratcheted stops you can extend the cable through several lengths - up to 3 feet and then, when finished, the spring mechanism will retract it back to its compact form. I have about 10 of these (since in addition to use with my laptop, I also use them around the house; where, by extending it to the exact length I need, saves me the headache of having to wrap and tie those loose unsightly cables that we constantly have to put up with between peripherals).The only concern with constant extension and retraction (when used with a portable system) is the possibility that the wire, being exercised will eventually break. With all of these cables I have had over a 10 year period, I have had only one fail - so they are pretty resilient."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep buying them","review":"I travel a lot. One of the things that drives me nuts is having all these cables tied in a knot. The retractable ones work as good as (or sometimes better than) the regular cables. I have 3 of these specifically (again, I have a lot of USB devices) and have never had a failure with them. I recommend these to anyone who travels as it helps keep things a lot nicer looking in your bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very striking artwork.","review":"The folktales themselves are interesting enough, but this book's outstanding merit is its illustrations, which, indeed, furnished the inspiration for it. The illustrator, Norovsambuugin Baatartsog, does his work not with brush and ink, but by cutting silhouettes out of black paper, freehand. They're intricate, and, aside from it being quite astonishing that anyone could do such work with scissors and no guiding drawing, they'd be striking in any medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"The papercut artwork is worth the price of the book.","review":"The Artwork done for the stories is grand.

It is very well written as a reference for the language. And it is interesting to read the motivation behind different features. I first used Rexx about 18 years ago, and I still think it's an excellent scripting language. I use the Korn shell every day, but I find it much easier to write scripts in Rexx. However, I don't think this is a good deal. [The cost] is WAY too much to spend for a xeroxed paperback copy. [Also,] it's NOT in a textbook binding..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for a REXX beginner.","review":"I used this book as my bible for the first 3-4 months I worked in REXX.

Perfect for a first-time REXX programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I want to make it clear that this rating has nothing to do with the actual content of the book, but the book itself. For the price, it is an extreme rip off. The pages look like they went through a very bad copy machine; to the point that some were not even readable. The binding is terrible as well.

I can even forgive Disney for not including one of the 1st season episodes (The Tick vs. The Mole Men) in this set. What I really despise is the dvd presentation itself. If you are going to release a great series that many have been waiting years for, please do not give us such terrible transfers!!!! For one thing most of the episodes are missing the audio for the first 4 - 5 seconds !!! Second, the transfers are not up to par for dvd standards!!! They look like bootlegs that you can pick up on ebay !!! I thought this was Disney . Stop using old analog masters and go back and strike up some new digital ones ! This is the 21st century you know. Unless Disney gets their act straight , I won't be getting any future releases. I've already returned my copy for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic","review":"The Tick is one of America's great comedy cartoons, made in the early 90s, and unappreciated in its own time by the masses, it creates an entire world of zany satirical super heroes and equally silly super villains. Even though the humor is sometimes childish, and the animation is raw at times, the comedy shines through.I believe that anyone with an affinity for silliness and super heroes will like this series a lot, and I can't wait for the other two seasons to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost but not Quite","review":"I love these cartoons as a child and still now as an adult. I was so happy that they were finally released on DVD. Annoying thing is This and Season II are both missing an episode (the Mole men episode is missing from this), & season III never made an appearance. So I still have the beat up VHSs that may dad originally recorded off the telly when I was little. I hope they get around to putting out the rest before they wont play anymore.

But he wants to be a force for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Luckily he has a sidekick with brains, Arthur, a former accountant who got into the \\"biz\\" after buying a moth suit at an auction. The Tick's sworn protectorate, The City, is swimming in not-so-effective superheroes, so it takes the Tick and his simple sentiments to make Evil cower in terror, or at least be very concerned.If you like superhero comics, or you just like to laugh, the Tick is for you. So sound the Tick's battle cry, \\"Spoon!\\" and order this great DVD today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"True, there are no extras.

I also didn't like how they made Christine so wishy washy and ditzy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another non-musical screen adaption (yawn yawn)","review":"Well...I must say that out of all the Phantom of the Opera's I've seen, none of them even come close to being perfectley exact compared to either Gaston whats his names book, orAndrew Lloyd Webbers fantastic musical adaption. I truly and honestly believe that there should be an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical stage to screen movie adaption. If there were, I know hundreds of people whom would go see it, including myself. Over all this movie sucked, and is not worth the time, or money buying or renting it, compared to how untrue it is to the beautiful opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber.Was this review helpfull to you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best phantom recreation ever!!!","review":"I can not describe how much I love this version of phantom. To say I am in love with Charles Dance as the phantom is a serious understatement. He is the sweetest most romantic phantom ever! As much as I love Michael Crawford (the second best phantom ever), and Gerard Butler, they do not compare to Charles. You never see Erik's deformity in this version, which I think was a good idea. It leaves it totally to you're imagination. I even liked Christine in this version,(except for at the end of a certain picnic scene!) which is big for me, as I usually can't stand her.This film mad me laugh at one minute, and bawl my eyes out the next. It's absolutley fantastic! If you want to see a version of phantom with a very loveable phantom, where there is some love between him and Christine, then this is the version for you. It is also clear in this version that Erik loves Christine too, and isn't just an insane stalker. It is worth every penny, you will not regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite phantom version ever!","review":"I was a little skeptical when I first got this because everyone had said it was too mushy. However, I am the sappy queen and I fell in love with this movie! I mean, any movie that can actually portray Erik as a good guy is okay by me and this movie did it in spades! It tells about his infancy, his childhood, his life. Plus, you really learn to hate the Raoul type character! He's a player in it! I mean you sit through it just begging for Erik and Christine to get together (or at least I was). Burt Lancaster added an interesting twist as Erik's friend/father. I loved Charles Dance as Erik and even though the lip syncing was pretty bad (all thanks to the flea scene with Carlotta) the singers who did sing were wonderful. Interesting thought though: was it just me or did Erik's voice sound different from when he was singing her to sleep and then when he was singing in his box with her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie","review":"I was so excited to see a made for TV movie in the DVD section.

Thank you for offering such a wide variety of products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting but script changes disappointed me","review":"The acting was great but the changes made to the original detract from the greatness of this movie. The father (who is the Persian in the original) shooting Eric at the end is awful -the whole conversion and transformation of Eric due to the unselfish love of Christine and his peaceful death in the orginal is very poweful. Much of the contrast and tension of the original is lost. Eric was never loved by anyone including his mother - that is why Christine's love for him at the end is so transforming. Oh well, the acting is great and the balance of horror and comedy is present throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Miniseries","review":"For those of you who know the Kopit Yeston version of the story, this movie's for you. Or if you just want to laugh - the character of Carlotta (and her husband) is hilarious. However, the story is a bit slow and 'obvious' in places. Don't get this expecting a work of art, but just some good entertainment. Also, it was filmed in the Paris Opera House, so that's another neat aspect of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too cool for words!","review":"I saw this movie when I was younger and fell in love with it.

He's totally unlike any \\"hero\\" you have ever met. He's rude, lecherous, devious, and doesn't trust anyone completely. He's looking for the angle he doesn't beleive in the goody goody stuff. He's selfish, greedy and many things. He does have a spark of good deep down inside, he does have some decentcy, not much. He fits more the bad guy kind of profile, than any hero form. This movie does have some very childish humor in it, like he picks his nose!! gross, and he has stink bomb farts, yuck!. Look beyond that and it's a cool movie, and hopefully there will be more, it does leave you hanging though, so that's no fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gokudo - Interestingly strange and enjoyable","review":"By the Way I am older than 13.

Gokudo(the main character) smiles evily...I am a HUGE fan of evil grins and that REALLY REALLY appealed to me.2. Prince Niari is absolutely GORGEOUS!!!!!!!! He is sooooo entirely your tall dark and evil type of guy...which appeals to me. (get the idea that I like evil? Well your right, I do)Now the story line is quite original. I mean I've never seen anything like it. It's very unaxpected and different than other ones.

Thats what happens to a band that loses key members. Given that they had a tough act to follow, Kasabian is better than this. I bought the CD the week that it came out, and it hasnt grown on me. I dont keep it in my cd book anymore because I have never had the impulse to listen to it after the 3rd time. When Amazon tried to recommend it to me, I said 'Not Interested\\" biotch.If you like Kasabian and have never heard this record, go ahead and give it a go.

No expectations, no preconceived notions. I found it at a listening station in a record store.Fantastic. If you don't like the stand-out tracks of Doberman, a non-linear opus that takes you for a ride, the wonderfully rocking Stuntman, or attention grabbing Empire, then there is no hope for you.Regardless of what they've done in the past, this album by itself, IS GREAT.

Over time I have come to appreciate it even more than \\"Kasabian.\\" The new Kasabian sounds very familiar to a new band from Norway called KEN, whose new album \\"STOP! LOOK!

The songs that I didnt really like on this cd were great live. It changed my whole perspective on the songs. After seeing them live and listening to the album again, I really, really like it.

This one is terrible. It's that simple. Apparently their main creative person quit the band and the results are evident.

This isn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their sophmore CD is pretty disappointing","review":"Kasabian dumped their lead guitarist while recording this CD and the remaining band went for a very different sound from their popular first CD. What we get this time around is more a collection of pop songs with the vocals often pushed up front. The dance/club/rave style of the first CD is not really represented here except maybe by the \\"sun/rise\\" track. Its a big change for the band and I dont think they carry it off very well. With the lyrics pushed up front in virtually every track, we are forced to listen to lyrics that aren't attention-grabbing. Just a fair warning that this CD sounds nothing at all like their previous CD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH boy, don't waste your hard earned $$$.","review":"I had a 200 square foot kitchen floor to tile and thought heck I'll buy a saw rather than rent one so I searched and searched and thought this one would be good. The saw arrived and it was just a joke! The tool was built like a cheap toy. The blade guard and it's mounting bracket didn't come close to fitting or lining up with the blade, in fact the bracket rubbed on the blade no matter how it was adjusted. The blade guard is very important because it's what keeps the water from creating a \\"rooster tail\\" and keeps the water focused on the tile and around the blade. The motor had such a vibration to it that I was afraid to run it. I contacted the seller and sent this thing back ASAP. I then bought the little 4\\" PlasPlug wet saw in it's place and it performed like a charm and I used it to make 145 cuts on my tile for the floor. Do yourself a favor and don't order this saw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap old school design","review":"This saw is the worst of old school cheap design.Too thin sheet metal with small screws threaded directly into the sheet metal. The motor is mounted to a wall of the sheet metal enclosure and the weight is too much for the wall to support. The motor was so far out of alignment that the blade would not turn until I disassembled the saw and straightened the wall. I have to assume that this was damage from being dropped during shipment even though both the inner and outer cartons were in perfect condition.I suppose it is good enough for the few tile jobs that I will use it for, but I shouldn't have to repair a tool before I can use it.I have heard it said that the best you should hope for is that you get what you paid for.

The was no major difference, aside from looks, I could notice between TurboTax and TaxCut. TaxCut imported all of my data from TurboTax flawlessly. Walks you through one question at a time and skips parts you don't qualify for based upon previous answers. The ONLY complaint I have is in it's error checking. My return passed TaxCut's error check until I went to e-file. Then, it caught 12 new errors! It was all because fields exceeded the maximum characters allowed by the IRS to e-file.

And for most people, this credit will reduce their taxes (or increase their rebate) significantly-- for me it was far more than the cost of this stupid software.If you want to be wary about your taxes, use Taxcut. If you want to miss obvious deductions and credits, use Taxcut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Options","review":"Unfortunately most of us are stuck with either TurboTax or TaxCut! I switched to TaxCut this year from TurboTax. Last year I had to boot up in safe mode to install AND run TurboTax. So I thought I'd give TaxCut a try this year. Low and behold I got the dreaded 21% hang while trying to load the mmvdpro.swf file. I had to boot up into safe mode again this year to install TaxCut. However, I was able to run TaxCut from normal boot, so a little improvement.Once installed TaxCut imported my TurboTax file and everything seemed to work smoothly. As TurboTax did last year. I'm not sure what these companies are doing with their software builds as the Tax software are the only programs I have installation problems with.Now, I just have to wait until I get the latest TaxCut updates (due in mid Feb) to submit my return.p.s.

This year I decided to be cheap and bought Tax Cut at Wal-Mart. BIG MISTAKE!!! A long story short, I lived in two states last year. The first one does not accept e-filing of part year residents. No problem I sent a paper filing. BUT, taxcut would not allow me to submit the second state because it said the first state couldn't be efiled. There is no way to submit one state and not the other. The software is so idiot proof that you can;t delete one state to circumvent the issue. I called technical support. They had no idea what I was talking about. They never offerred to refund what I paid for two state tax additions.

Apparently, Taxcut assumes that I downloaded Taxcut from the Web site, instead of from a CD.I tried to email H&R; Block and also tried their online chat. No luck.Their Web site touts \\"24 hour response time\\" for e-mail, but it has been three days now, and I haven't gotten a reply.When I tried their chat support, it kept saying that an agent would be with me shortly, but after 30-40 minutes of this it declared that it was terminating my chat session.After being a satisfied Taxcut customer for several years, H&R; Block has converted me into a permanent H&R; Block NON-customer.I returned the software and bought TurboTax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Bug","review":"TaxCut is not able to handle the Social Security worksheet.

If you have significant amount of investment related activity in 2005, you will have enter all of them manually. Based on my research, Turbo Tax has the feature to import this information electronically. If this feature is not important to you, then I would heartily recommend this product for its ease of use and better price value (CD version) than Turbo Tax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Tax Cut","review":"I wish I read all the reviews before purchasing.

I even bought a second copy from the Internet web site (first copy bought at Office Max) and had the exact same problem.As already mention the Technical Support is horrible and I have been bounced around in queues for about 3 hours.Going to try for a return if my current call (on hold yet again) doesn't work.

Believe it or not, there seems to be no place in the interviews, forms or worksheets to enter my quartely estimated tax payments made to the state of CA for 2005!! According to the actual forms this info is supposed to come from the CA \\"Background Worksheet\\" which seems to have absolutely no place to enter it. I called tech support several times in the hope of getting a knowledgeable person to help. Wasted a lot of time trying various things for them to no avail. My software is also up-to-date. I find it quite hard to believe that this is impossible to do. Even it it were possible I find is hard to believe it is so difficult to do because I'm very computer literate myself and CA is perhaps the most important state for taxation!

I contacted customer service but they did't seem to understand how moving expense works. I kept telling them this is the software issue but they insisted it is a tax issue and advised me to call tax advisor.

Technical support is confused, providing solutions that don't work. The last person that I spoke to acknowledges that he is perplexed about why the program is asking for a code when it should automatically accept the federal code since it is being sold as a bundle with the state program being free. His suggestion send it up the chain for some other techie to find out the problem. I mentioned that this has already been done and I only called back this morning because no one had responded to my previous call from Jan. 23.

I had used TaxCut Premium in the past, and was familiar with how it worked and always pleased with the results. However I always used the HR Block option of having a professional check my results and e-file for me, including the state return. This year though, I purchased the deluxe + state version and e-filed myself. With all of the rebates, you couldn't go wrong. I got a rebate for my federal return, which made the cost of e-filing only $15.95 total. I also got a version of Microsoft Money 2006 for free after another rebate. So all in all, I feel like I paid $9.00 for the program and $15.95 for e-filing the state return, and the price was right. Oh, and I forgot - I also got Deduction Pro, which I had never used before but it was great. I used it for my 2005 return, and now I'm entering information for 2006 to make my next year's return even easier! This was one great bargain, and I'd do it again next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never leave TurboTax again!!!","review":"I used TurboTax Deluxe last year, and had efficient results.

Big mistake. When transferring data from Quicken 2004, TaxCut entered all of my trades from within retirement accounts (tax-deferred). What a mess! And it took me a couple of hours to delete each entry manually. Note that these accounts are correctly identified in Quicken, and TurboTax has never had this problem (though, admittedly, it's had others on occasion).Aother problem: When entering dividend data in my federal return, TaxCut correctly asked if any dividends were from U.S. government bonds. It stated that the information would be used in my state tax return.

He wrote it when he was about 53 years old. I found it irritating how he was constantly paranoid that others were out to do him harm- he's just obsessed with this. I think he would have been happiest if he had filled a wagon full of books and then gone to live in a nice quiet cave. I liked how when he wanted to marry Heloise she did her best to dissuade him, saying that he was too intelligent to be \\"chained to a wife\\" and he shouldn't waste his time chasing around after a bunch of kids. If only more people thought like that today.The editor's intro takes up 20% of the book and gives lots of info about Abelard and his era. There's no table of contents.

They are slow to release the shows in box set so they can milk the individual sets. The transfer is at times terrible. The packaging is as cheap as they come (compare that to Babylon5, Hercules, Xena or even Stargate's packaging and you'll see what I'm talking about.) No extras to speak of.

The book is the sensitive and tender love story of a boy, nearing manhood. He is strong, intelligent, courageous and a loner, until he falls in love with his sweet teacher. Emma Harris realises that she could lose her job because of the relationship developing between herself and her pupil. However, she seems powerless to resist the lure of love.

Only flaw...The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences didn't award the Best Actress Oscar to Julie Andrews. What a shame! Best sequence in film? Julie Andrews performing \\"Le Jazz Hot\\"... Exhilarating!!Also, actor Graham Stark as 'the waiter in the restaurant' steals the 'cockroach in the salad' segment in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have musical delight","review":"What a joy to have this film on DVD! The last great movie musical(let's not put GREASE or EVITA in the same class)can be viewed in a crystal-clear, wide-screen disc which shows the film's stunning art direction to full advantage. The audio commentary with Andrews and Blake Edwards is informative and entertaining; one really feels as if one is sitting in their living room, viewing the film with them. As for the film itself, it is one of those movies which seems to get better with age and each new viewing. The performances are all flawless, with special kudos to the great Robert Preston. Why Lesley Ann Warren's career did not take off to greater heights after this film is a mystery; she is a marvelous comedienne, singer, and dancer. Thank you to Fox for bringing us this terrific release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie - 'Hot'.","review":"To the point:There is music, dance, comedy! What more could you want from this Blake Edward's classic! The more I see this film, the more I appreciate how cleverly the Broadway team changed this film into a Broadway show or how certain lines or scenes were fit into the Broadway musical like a seamless work of art. In addition to Julie, in this film there was Robert Preston and James Gardner, Lesley Ann Warren, all of whom contribute to this film's successful chemistry.Oh how I love this crazy film!! And Robert Preston! What an actor! What a voice! We will so miss you!! Check out Robert Preston in The Music Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Silly movie","review":"One of my old favorites. Funny little story and you get to hear Julie Andrews sing a variety of styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"With a singular exception, nothing in this movie convinced me. With the exception of Preston's room and dialog at the beginning of the movie, which originally raised my hopes, the sets looked fake. The acting seemed fake as either over the top or flying under the radar. The dialog was highly contrived and strained. The plot's chain of events seemed forced. Try as I might, including closing my eyes just to listen only, Andrews never convinced me that anyone would confuse her for a man. And that is a big problem when the plot of the movie hinges on it. The other actors in the film all wondered how Garner figured out that Victor was actually a Victoria. I wondered how anyone could conclude otherwise.I agree with reviewer J.C. Clarke about Preston's final scene. I felt embarrassed for him. I know it's a comedy, but ... give me something to laugh at, not something tiresome and clunky.I gave it 2 stars because it was a clever idea, no matter how poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we watch the same film?","review":"Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough to find this amusing or clever, but I was reminded of Hemingway's statement throughtout \\"Never mistake motion for action.\\" There is a lot of motion in this film, but it is dying, like fish floundering in those buckets at open-air markets. And with stupendously wooden performances and coincidences so outlandish as to be irritating, I never felt anything above annoyed, and certainly felt more than annoyed in many scenes.When the end mercifully arrived (is this movie six, or is it seven, hours long?), and I was supposed to laugh at Robert Preston playing Julie Andrews, I watched in a combination of shock and awe. Who would find this funny (apparently many people, judging by the reviews here). And who would try such a stupid scene? Blake Edwards hit the big time with some wonderfully talented people helping him, but this sterile, phony, insincere and stupid film is a waste on all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Jazz Hot!","review":"What a wonderful film with Julie Andrews at her all-time best!Nothing will ever come as close to fabulousness as watching Julie in beaded headress perform Le Jazz Hot. Other standouts include her Spanish-flavored \\"Shady Lady from Seville.\\"Webster's dad even makes an appearance to come out the closet. But did we really have to question, after all he has been married to Ma'am (Susan Clark) all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable musical.","review":"The concept seems pretty farfetched, but the execution is lovely. It was cast perfectly, and every character is sympathetic. The actors, particularly the big three (Julie Andrews, Robert Preston, and James Garner) all put on fabulous performances, and the chemistry is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have movie","review":"I don't buy many movies. So often when buying a movie, it sits on the shelf, gathering dust. Once you've seen it, you're bored with it and not interested in seeing it again. Victor/Victoria doesn't fall into that genre. There are scenes that you'll want to watch over and over again and they are funny every time. You'll find yourself singing along with the award winning music. Not only is the script great, but the actors are the best, Julie Andrews and James Garner.What is the movie about? Simply, Victoria, a starving soprano, meets up with Toddy who convinces her she can make it big if she pretends to be a man pretending to be a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Funny Movie","review":"If you're a Julie Andrews lover, this is fabulous. Even if you're not, this movie is very funny, a great way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Julie Andrews!","review":"Great movie! Fantastic comedy & wonderful music & songs. Julie Andrews and Robert Preston make a great duo getting themselves caught up in a scam that just leaves you laughing. A few mature issues so not for younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victor/Victoria","review":"I can't believe how fast I received this!!! This is a classic movie and still fun to watch!!

You will also not be able to see the image unless your are standing to the right of the frame and looking down. The viewing angle is sooo small that you will almost never be able to see the picture as you are walking past it. You have to stop and make sure the viewing angle is right to be able to see the picture as it would look on a computer screen.In addition, the screen started flickering horribly after about 5 months, needing warranty repair. It would stop flickering if the photo frame was left turned off for a few hours, but would come back after a few hours of being turned on.New photo frames are comming that are cheaper, have better viewing angles and higher resolution. I strongly suggest you wait for those."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly cheap product","review":"A great idea poorly executed. The construction is cheap. The screen is marginal at best.

With 4mp cameras the standard and 6 to 8mp becoming available to the average consumer, this lcd does not provide value for its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"USB frame easy to use","review":"The Memory Frame was exactly what the manufacturer said it would be. The included software is easy to use. Within 30 minutes of opening the box, I had downloaded my slideshow onto the frame and was watching my family pictures display. The one issue I had, was when I first turned the frame on, the display had a bit of a flicker. I downloaded the updated software, driver, and firmware from the Pacific Digital website, and after loading the new firmware onto the frame, the display was much crisper & the flicker was gone. In summary, once I inatalled the firmware update, the Memory Frame was worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Consumer Trash","review":"My Father in law got this for my birthday... while I was flattered, I have not been too impressed. It basically functions as a screen saver that you can put in your living room. I find it a bit tacky and wish I didn't need to put it out whenever my in-laws visit.
