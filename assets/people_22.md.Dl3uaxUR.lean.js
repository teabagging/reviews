Roger Fry came to see and apprecaite his contemporaries in visual art as making and having made important contributions. Time has proved Roger Fry correct and his critics wrong.

Very seldom they review boks not written in Japanese. This book is an exception. It is as skillful as the best manga and as easy to follow. The author understands Japanese business and other culture. He just does not speak in typical cliches. He assembles the facts, very many of them, and present why Japan must change and will change.

The floating compass does work if floated in a glass of water but is little more than a gimmick. DON'T trust this as a navigation aid use a real compass!. The only saving grace of the kit is the Fresnel lens this can be used to focus the suns rays on your tinder to start your camp fire and too help read the tiny print on the cards.

That rare find has been found......I await the authors' next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Magical Mystery Investigation....","review":"I was immeadately impressed by the author's realistic portrayal of Wiccan ritual magic. (He should know, he is a Wiccan.) It was the 'blurring' of the line between the real and the fantasy in the story that appealed to me. The intelligent, and realistic reaction of the cop, and the rest of the police at the station, made this a very 'real' mystery story, with extraordinary characters - good and bad guys, in a real world.This is a rich story, with rich characters, in a realistic world...this is not a story to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, but appallingly written","review":"Mr. Sellars is in dire need of an editor, and his publisher is in desperate need of a proofreader.

This is how I felt while reading this book! I thoroughly enjoyed every page! This is an author that knows how to tell us a good tale! I liked that he included factual information on paganism, yet was able to sensationalize where needed! I must say that I got so involved in the story of it, that I had to actually go back and reread to search for the things that the nay-sayers were busy complaining about.

Based on the high reviews I ordered the series, but the smug self-importance of the main character made the book nearly unreadable. To top it off the mystery/investigation element was poorly ploted.

And I know what I like. This, I do not like. The characters are boring and flat. The book is preachy.

I'm really sorry I bought this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harm None","review":"Personally, I LOVE the author. He is a kind and funny man, BUT I hate to say that I didn't like his book.

Then it took me a few months before I opened it. Then finally I sat down to read this remarkable novel and was glued to my chair and the book for like the next two weeks reading it. I was so involved with the realistic approach that I and others that I know deemed it necessary to find these locations that are in the book. Thank Goodness we live in St. Louis. Mr. Sellars your words inspired me to look past the here and now and to look further behind the scenes to really find the true meaning of things. I sincerely could not wait to read the next book. \\"Never Burn a Witch\\". More on that review later. Thank you so much for giving my mind something to hunger for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"First off let me say I enjoyed the book and would look forward to more from the author. My initial joy over finding a novel with a somewhat realistic pagan portrayal lost some of its joy when the stereotypical responses by his native american detective drew my attention away from the good. I had to consciously remind myself not to let the poor portrayal of NAs deter from a good pagan mystery. I think the author needs to research the historical connotations of such term as squaw and Tonto and realize to many NAs these are negative connotations, not to be used as lightly as demonstrated in this book. From a pagan perspective I enjoyed the book, from a mystery point it seemed a little weak, but overall an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must read the rest of the books in this series!","review":"I'm a big fan of mysteries where weird (at least to skeptical non-pagan readers like me) things happen. The pagan detective concept is not new: Rosemary Edghill's edgy Bast is my fave, although Mercedes Lackey's Di Tregarde is pretty cool too (much more along the lines of fantasy), but Rowan Gant is great because he's just this nice guy with a normal day job, a house, a wife, cats and a non-mainstream religion who happens to be able to use his religious experience to help a cop friend with a case. He's not singlehandedly fighting crime or anything outlandish like that. Very convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable thing I have read in ages.","review":"M.R. Sellars can spin a great story. The story line focuses on a witch that happens to get dragged into a murder investigation by his best friend. Sellars uses as much real witchcraft content in this book without going to far over the top. The characters were full of life and very real. I also liked how he left the ending open for another book.

The shoe is high quality leather, the seams are excellent, the sole is thick and durable and the support is great.

Well I still prefer the originals (nobody plays Miller as well as Miller!) but this band is the best new band I have heard. The arrangements are close enough to the original sound without being just another blatent copy with players who play well but don't quite get that original feel. This is instead a great band who play extremely well in the style and yet the arrangements are individual enough not to be a direct copy, yet original enough to bring back all those wonderful memories that the Big Band era is all about. If you like (or love) big band music, you will be impressed by this disc. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...WHAT A BAND!","review":"This is the first time I have heard this band and I have to say it's GREAT!

The \\"Justified Sinner\\" is a Scots Calvinist who comes to believe that no action of the elect is a sin. To put it another way, his theology drives him mad.Or does it? He insists that a young gentleman led him into some of the evil he does and that the worst of the actions attributed to him are not performed by him at all. Is the \\"Justified Sinner\\" mad or has the Devil lured him into sin and even taken on his shape at times? This novel is a forerunner of works like Stevenson, THE STRANGE CASE OF DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MISTER HYDE and of James, THE TURN OF THE SCREW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and thought provoking","review":"Hogg writes a compelling story about a religious fanatic.

The first does not apply at all to the tale befor us; as to the second, there are but few whose taste it will suit...;the third carried us through with that proud conciousness of martrydom for the public good, to which we are but too much accustomed when labouring in our vocation.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Misrepresents Predestination & Runs Many a Rabbit Trail!","review":"I tried to like this novel because as one who believes in predestination, I thought it would show some of the opposing arguments in fictional form; it failed to do this. James Hogg merely shows us a deranged human being (nothing new there!) who murders because he feels that he is 'destined for heaven' no matter what he does. Yes, he might have been saved from the fires of hell, but it would have been by God's grace, not by his own good or evil works. Isn't this what the New Testament is all about-grace in spite of man's evil doing? Whether one is predestined or 'chooses good or evil' makes no difference in the end-what matters is who saves you from your own mortal destiny which is death. This story fails to show any unique theological and/or psychological perspective.

All the other connections (including 2 USB ports & a network interface port) are on the back, where they should be. In fact, when not connected to its home-based wires, the whole panel hides behind a plastic hinged door, a effective solution.The processor is the basic AMD Duron. It's quite capable of most daily, non-graphics intense tasks, but not as good as the AMD Athalon or the Intel PIII mobile. Graphics are just okay, but the screen is unusually sharp. The 256K RAM is also okay for everyday stuff, and it can be increased to 384 megs. The 20 Meg hard drive is just adequate.

I went to Best Buy, Good Guys, Circuit City and so on. The price of this line got me interested but frankly the screen quality wasn't that great. It is an active matrix but it looks more like a dual scan LCD.I think I know where they cut cost. Otherwise the machine seemed fine. The Duron CPU was my last choice for processors (it is about as slow as they come) but they are cheap and who really needs a lot of CPU horsepower in a note book?So my advice is NOT to buy this notebook sight unseen. Go down and compare the screens first. I think you will find Sony and HP have much better quality screens.

I listen to all types of music so I don't have a biased opinion or anything. The group has talent and, with modern music, that's a rare thing to come across. You can listen to the songs over and over again and not become bored with them. They all have fun, interesting melodies and words. My personal favorite, \\"Automatic Flowers\\", has great lyrics and music. The great thing about the songs are the strange but musical vocal flips that the lead singer does. These are also prevalent in \\"Superman's Dead\\" and \\"Clumsy\\". Even the slower ballads sound good as opposed to the some of the recent alternative groups who scream and yell quickly, but couldn't sing a slow song if their life depended on it. The entire album is awesome, there are no songs that I don't like. In most albums there are at least two or three, but Our Lady Peace, with their original sound, keeps the listener interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP still has it","review":"Well, I wasn't sure if Our Lady Peace could make another album as beautiful as their debut, but they did it. Every song is powerful, original, and thought-provoking. Our Lady Peace is truly one of the best acts to come out of Canada that I've ever seen.

I'd never heard of them before, but their original sound really makes for some amazing music. I've since heard them described as a cross between Oasis and Nirvana, and they really bring the best of both. Raine Maida has an incredible voice, and his virtuoso voice solos fit perfectly with the alternative-rock music. \\"Superman's Dead\\" may be the album's best song, but the climax of the album is the ending voice solo on \\"Big Dumb Rocket.\\" \\"Clumsy\\" and \\"Automatic Flowers\\" are two other songs the band can really be proud of, but the album as a whole is really a masterpiece of the alternative-rock genre. Really, this album is a great listen, and it never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Our Lady Peace is an awesome band.","review":"I first heard OLP's CD Clumsy at a friends house and I bought it right away. I fell in love with the great songs the first time I heard them and I still can't get Supermans Dead and Automatic Flowers out of my head because they are so catchy.

If you like alternative, you just have to love the unique, original quality and talent of this band. The lyrics are great, the vocals incredible, and the music just plain rocks. The lyrics have meanings that can be related to, which are often hard to find in a rock album. This band has got tons of talent, and simply do not get enough credit here in the States. It's one of the few CD's that I can listen to over and over again without tiring of it. The vocalist, Raine Maida has been compared to Billy Corgan, but I don't think that the simalarity is really there. They both have unique voices, and Raine's haunting ballads just can't be comapred to.

I'm taking offers starting at a dime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a favorite in my home. I bought it and can't keep track of it... my teenage children keep borrowing it. I particularly like \\"Superman's Dead\\" which appeals to the darker side of a lifelong fan of Superman comix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but nothing new","review":"Truthfully, I bought this album strictly for the title song, which I have fallen deeply, madly, and unreasonably in love with. As for the rest of the album, I find it all quite passable and enjoyable, though not really groundbreaking on any level. OLP seems to stick to a mix of grunge/alternative that several bands before and after them have made quite profitable. I also have personal issues with the lead singer's voice, but that's just me. However, it's well worth the price of the full CD for \\"Clumsy,\\" and having the other songs to frame it works nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but too many negative songs","review":"I understand the album is meant to be emotional and sad, so the slow melodic riffs and almost whining voice of the lead singer give the music some validity and power, but some people cannot listen to this much depressing music without becoming extremely depressed. Personally, I like the CD, and I have no problems listening to depressing music, but an album like this will never be popular on a large scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Lady Peace is different and different is good","review":"Raine Maiden has a very uniqe singing voice and I think that is very good.The drummer is very talented and has excellant solos.The bassist has a good solo in Car Crash that shows he is tallented as well. The guitarist is very good and plays very well in all the songs.Our Lady Peace is one of my favorite and I think they don't get enough airplay on American radio and that's why you should purchas this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"a.k.a.

You won't regret getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm. Nope.","review":"I heard the song Superman's Dead on the radio and then proceeded to buying this album and I was horribly dissapointed. Nothing in this album, although not all bad, really interested me. OLP's sound is too generic and similar from song to song. I have only really listened to it five or so times through, but that was more then neccesary to know that this album will not grow on you. I would suggest something Weezer or Ben Folds Five before buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 good songs","review":"I got this CD only because I thought that all the songs would be at the level of \\"Superman's Dead\\" and \\"clumsy\\". Trust me, every song but those two is pure crap. If you really want just those songs, I recommend making a mix tape/CD. Luckily, I go this album for free. I would never pay full price for this terrible album, and neither should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"More modern metal music, will it never end?","review":"Once upon a time, I dreamed that metal music would go away; I even thought for a while that it had happened.

As our trip in July 2002 progressed, we relied more and more heavily on the book. The recommendations from sites to food to hotels proved to be excellent every time. I particularly liked that the lodging and restaurant recommendations had inexpensive through expensive listings, which we used as our budget-mindedness changed during the trip. For anyone beyond backpacking and Lonely Planet, this book is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Lonely Planet","review":"Took the Lonely Planet (published in 2006) and Frommer's (published in 2008) to Greece. The somewhat out-dated LP is so much better than the Frommer's and we used LP almost exclusively after the first 3 days. The Frommer's maps are frustrating and misleading. There is no (bus) directions for day trips out of Athens so you must either drive or join a tour.

It didn't offer intra-city travel options and most of the museum/sight information was outdated. We missed Rick Steves on this leg of our trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"My husband has been reading this book like crazy preparing for our trip to Greece next year. I like that it has itineraries for trips of different lengths, because planning a trip to a place like Greece without a starting point would be completely overwhelming to me. My only wish is that it had some pictures, because it would make it easier for me to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The content of this book is almost the same as its 2006 version","review":"I ordered this book because that in the description page of this book, it clearly wrote down Humana Press (May 19, 2010). It should contain the most up-to-date information of microRNA. I paid $139 and received this book from Amazon. One of my colleague pointed out to me that the content of this book is almost the same as its 2006 version. I went back to check the description page in Amozon and make sure it says may 19, 2010 and nothing about 2006 version. As miRNA is a rapid developing field in biology, the outdated information is certainly not worth $139 and not worth my time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, dreadful remastering on this release","review":"In the Heat of the Night is Benatar's best record, IMHO.But do NOT purchase this CD.The \\"remastering\\" job done on this release borders on the criminal, in that it doesn't sound appreciably better than the first CD releases.I understand they released another remastered version of these records in 2006. If you're buying these records for the first time, buy the later remasters.As for me, luckily I had the original vinyl versions, which sound 5x better than this mud when I digitized them myself with an $8 adapter from Radio Shack. Still, I wish I had legal recourse for wasting $20 on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaker a little weak, Crimes of Passion remarkable","review":"Heartbreaker as an album is a little weak, in my opinion.

Amazon nicely tried to send it to me two more times but each time it arrived damaged. It appears to be a quality unit and other reviewers confirm that it is. The problem is that it is very heavy and poorly packaged by the manufacturer. There is only one piece of crumpled-up paper around the unit and everything is beat up during shipping. I was told by Amazon that they are going to demand that the manufacturer come up with a better packing system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken!","review":"I didn't think it would happen to me, but it did. Several previous reviews mentioned the condition the item arrived in and I regret to report the same. I waited forever for this unit and it arrived like it had been packaged by a 5 year old. I knew by the condition of the box that it was going to be a bad day. The miscellaneous parts and connectors were strewn all over the inside, and the case was broken in a couple of places, making it impossible to lift the unit by the handle.

So here is one bad thing. This book was written by over 100 different people, each with a different opinion. On one page you will be told not to even think about cheating on your taxes, on another page you are encouraged to hitchhike via a rail car. Too many voices all giving a different point of view, ranging from goody-two-shoes to a free wheelin' slacker. All the tech info is so out of date that it is laughable. The chapter on work offers no advice on preparing a resume or interviews, but they go into great detail about how horrible it is to work for a female boss and how affirmative action makes life not worth living. One second they are telling you not to lie on your resume, the next page they are telling you how to bribe a cop. If you think that \\"The Man Show\\" was the greatest TV show ever, or if you watch professional wrestling, than this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a useful encyclopedia of skills for the modern man","review":"I first bought this book when I was stationed overseas. The information in it was as useful there as it was stateside.

However this one is good psych rock and psych pop mixture all the way. IT's a decent disc and has some fine moments on it like 'face without a soul' and some more average songs but the two disc version really gives you alot of kick butt stuff to enjoy so this is the version to get. Fans of later quo will want to get this one last probably , however it still has alot of good songs on it from the age of psych rock, this is more accessible too than lets say pink floyeds ummaguma which is a fine cd but less pop inclined. ALl in all this is worth owning for fans of psych rock, psych pop, and quo fans too."},{"rating":"2","title":"All tap dancers need this video!","review":"For quite a while, I have been looking for a Shim Sham Shimmy video or clear written instructions on the dance.

It is comprehensive with respect to species which nest on platforms and in boxes, and the plans are consise and easy to follow.

Tunes here I got the most out of were the title track \\"In Search For Sanity\\", the in-your-face \\"Lightning War\\", their decent cover of AC/DC's anthem \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and \\"Welcome To Dying\\". Might draw in fans of Celtic Frost, Possessed, King Diamond and Cryptic Slaughter {have always loved that name}. Not bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"This band, I don't know if they ever made it big, but they should. Their sound on this album is a little like early Metallica, with nice fast crunchy riffs and a little more \\"techno\\" sound for lack of a better word.Songs are excellent, especially the long, trance-like \\"Welcome to Dying.\\" \\"Blood Upon the Ice\\", \\"Power Play\\", the Title track -- all good.Don't be misled by the opening track -- it's just a warmup, not their real sound.This \\"platter\\" gets a lot of play on my \\"turntable\\" these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NoFx Since Punk in Drublic","review":"OK, so I have really not been the biggest NoFx fan in the past 4 years. I loved Ribbed, White Trash, and Punk in Drublic, but man these guys were on \\"The Decline\\". Maybe thats why they released this amazing song. \\"The Decline\\" is very different from the other NoFx albums, and I have to admit, the first time I played it I thought it was more of the same dribble that had been coming down the pipe from Fat Wreck Chords. But, like I normally do, I gave the album a second chance, and listened to it all the way through. Very impressive, and it grows on you fast. This is the best thing they have done since Punk in Drublic... The price is way to high, but the song is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PUNK ROCK MASTERPIECE","review":"Although the price I paid for this was ridiculous , I don't care.

If you have only listened to it once and you don't really like it, listen to it a couple more times and I can guarantee you will love it. I downloaded this song on another sight and I thought it was pretty wierd the first time I listened to it. About a month later I listened to it again while I was playing computer games, but since I was distracted I didn't really change my mind about it. I burned it onto a CD because I thought it would be cool to have an 18 minute song. I still didn't really like it, but after listening to it closely one more time I couldn't believe how much I had changed my mind about it. Even though I had it burned onto three CDs, I still went out and bought the Cd just to give my money to NOFX for making such a masterpiece.Inshort words, don'd let the first listen fool you, this is an AWESOME CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One more pill to kill the pain...","review":"Dude, what can I say?

My life has never been the same since. NOFX has the right combination lyrics that say something while not taking themselves to seriously and musical talant that has kept me coming back for more now for 6 years. The Decline is just another example of that. Fat Mike's lyrical prowess is amazing, El Hefe and Eric are increadably talented mucicians, and that drum player guy kicks my a**. Just when I thought that they were about warn out, they through this album out and remind all of us that they are still alive and kicking.

I hope they release a real album in the near future because I love these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the New Album from the guys who made White Trash?","review":"One twenty minute song is all they could do? I think these guys could have done alot better. But still, the album wasn't a total dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline of NOFX","review":"This CD is terrible, the reason its an 18 minute song is because even if you tried seperating the thing it would all sound the same. The problem is that NOFX somehow believe they can do whatever they want and get away with it. Musically this the worst album they have ever put out. All this thing is a bunch of riffs mangled together from old songs, and lyrics that reflect just how much this band needs to throw the towel in. These guys put out a lot of good music in their younger days, i just think its gotten to their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This CD is not worth the eleven bucks NOFX thinks their one eleven minute song is worth. While punk is supposed to be about social commentary, NOFX gives us the usual overdone whinings that we can all hear for free from Tipper Gore, or Rosie O'Donnell They need to listen to more Dead Kennedys before they attempt something like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL","review":"What the hell, if i wanted to listen to a rock opera I would have listened to my Styx album. This is the worst thing since sliced bread. Why in the hell would you want to listen to a 14 min song. I believe the title \\"The Decline\\" is in reference to the state of there music. Cuz it's on the decline right now. The only thing that this album accomplished was: goverment good, really long songs bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly my style, but pretty cool.","review":"I am a metalhead who likes some progressive and classic rock. I'm not generally a big fan of punk, but when i heard about this 18 minute punk song, I had to check it out. I have to say, while it's not exactly my style, it's cool to see a punk band do this. A long song, written quite well. Good lyrics. These guys can play their instruments, especially the drummer, and the music is pretty complicated(for a punk band, that is, for a metal or prog. band...maybe not, but hey, that's not the point of punk, is it?)and it's just a well-written song. Even though it's not my style, these guys impressed me, and I respect them for this song. If punk is your thing, get this, I bet you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!","review":"This is not only one of the best punk songs ever recorded, it's one of the best songs period. This song is as close to perfection as you can get, both lyrically and musically. You would think that an 18 minute song would be boring at times, but not this one. The changes in tempo and the scathing political commentary keep your interest the entire time. This is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole that is greater than the sum of its parts","review":"The Decline is amazing. It reminds me of a suite written by a classical master, like Stravinsky or Rimsky-Korsakov. Each part of the song blends into the next, like movements as parts of a greater whole. The chord progressions and key changes are complex and add a lot to the music, which is something that can't be said about a lot of punk out there. Each instrument adds to the song, with the trombone riffs being well placed, and the guitar never getting repetitive. The harmonized voice parts are especially well done. NOFX manages to find an underlying musical theme that ties all of the different vignettes in the song together, while maintaining enough variety to keep the listener from even thinking of getting bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for NOFX","review":"I don't listen to punk at all. I used to but it got old. Someone burnt me this CD. And well I was suprized that I liked it. It doesnt have that immature tone you get with most of their other stuff. Their are some subtle jokes and innuendos on things but it is not potty humor or anything like that. Im sure it took them twice the time to write this than anyother album they have released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!

They must leave this prison, Fontfroide!In 2010, the reader may find the \\"house of mystery\\" theme in this 1936 novel overfamiliar, and the 16-year-old girl lacking complexity.

But no, after many many cuts, a close examination under a 20x microscope shows almost no wear to the itty-bitty carbide tips. These blades are thin and light, but precise and surprisingly robust. The thin kerf means less power is required to cut through a given board. This really matters in 5/4 plywood or hardwood decking, but means faster work everywhere else. They are only \\"throw-away\\" because they cost less than the price of sharpening them. There might be enough carbide in the tip for one re-sharpening, but it would not be cost effective.

All of his incredible hits are included, mixed with fabulous lesser known titles. For the new listener who's been drawn in by Fogelberg's well known and often played \\"Leader of the Band\\" and \\"Longer\\", this purchase will continue to inspire and amaze. Dan Fogelberg's music is the mastery of poetry in motion. I remember hearing him on the radio as a young child but have only recently, in my late 20's discovered my deep love and appreciation for his music. I've attended his concerts each year for the last three years, and have been blown away. Some will say Fogelberg's music is a thing of the past.

Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it!","review":"What a talented singer and songwriter! We haven't heard from Dan in a while and listening to these CD's was like slipping on a favorite pair of bluejeans. They just make you feel good!

For fans only; casual listeners should buy the best of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Very Best Of Instead","review":"Wow - Dan has a few good songs but certainly doesn't have enough quality material to fill up 4 CDs. Also many of the choices here are not good (very bad actually) and why did they put a live version of Leader of the Band on the Hits disc -- the live version WAS NOT A HIT!!!! Where are Sketches and There's A Place In The World For a Gambler?? - probably his 2 best songs! Not a good box set - AVOID!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping historical mystery AND a wrenching emotional tale","review":"A brave soldier and a callous, sheltered rich boy become friends on the battlefield -- they exchange identities, so the rich boy's wonderful loving fiancee ends up marrying the soldier and the rich boy goes to war as he dreamed to. But the consequences of this tradeoff are so much richer, sadder and more beautiful than either man imagined possible. The story is seen through many eyes, not least through the eyes of the granddaughter of the Swedish cavalier.This novel is one of the sparest, most honest, adventurous and passionate works of art I have ever encountered.

This has got to be the worst I have ever heard from Mr Ocasek. The dark and often whiny sounds fit perfectly with the twisted lyrics. I guess its just too tough for old Ric being a millionaire and married to a supermodel. Really a shame...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Troubling","review":"If this work is any indication, Ric may be fading away into obscurity. There are some good cuts from this CD (Hang on Tight, Not Schocked, Society Trance and The Next Right Moment), but after listening to this CD a few times, most will grow old and tired, especially the title cut. Rarely do I listen to a CD of an artist I like and find that I enjoy it less when I listen to it more... this is one of them. If you're interested in some better solo projects by Ocasek, go for This Side of Paradise or Quick Change World... those are his two best. Some would argue that Beatitude was his best, and though I like that one too, it wasn't as solid musically as Paradise or Quick Change. Quick Change is out of print, so you'll need to peruse used CD stores or find it on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"his best solo album","review":"Most definitely some of the best stuff Ocasek's done. Billy Corgan helped produce this as well as play guitar on most (all?) of the cuts, and his influence shines throughout the album. Melissa auf der Maur (Hole) and Brian Baker (Bad Religion) round out the project. The sound overall is very tight and and the tracks are varied. The first five songs are the best portion of the album, but the whole LP is very enjoyable to listen to. It's great to hear Ric with a band and producer who can fully capitalize on his distinct voice and style. This is definitely worth buying, especially if you're a Cars or Smashing Pumpkins fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What range?","review":"I was counting on the brand Motorola, but...Design is nice, but 2 big compaints are:1. 3 AA batteries per walki's not to mention the weight.

It dries super quick, with a shine that I have not found in any other top coat - and believe me, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL! The shine stays even through dishes, swimming, typing, etc. I apply one coat every other day and my polish lasts for a week (also a first for me!) My nails are finally growing long and strong - even my husband commented on how great my nails are looking and in in 22 years of marriage - that's the first time he's told me that!

As a kid, in 1970 or so, I heard on the radio a Jonathan Winters routine about a bunch of guys hunting deer. I laughed and laughed at the time, and ever since have wanted to locate a copy of the recording. Well, I recently found it--on this CD. But, unfortunately, I am disappointed. It is not nearly as funny as I had remembered (and that one is this CD's best track). Moreover, some of his stories on this CD are surprisingly off-color. All in all, while I still think Winters is great, I don't recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theme Park","review":"Crichton became really famous for his dinosaur park turned nightmare called Jurassic Park. This movie however was his first foray into a theme park gone bad. Westworld is a classic science fiction with Yul Brynner perfectly cast as the can't be killed robot. The terminator before the terminator. It is a wonderful idea for a park that let you live out your fantasies as a cowboy or a knight(over in Roman world). When a virus causes the harmless robots to turn on the guests and the park employees, you really find yourself involved with the chase. A really well told tale and very ablely directed. It shows a little date with the bad hair and clothing, but overall it holds up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done","review":"Probably a 4.5. Catchy, crunchy, energetic. Song 2 sounds like an Oasis outtake, then you get some more poppy/punky numbers, plus straight ahead R&R. These songs do not run into one another; the album meanders down numerous paths. One thing that's consistent though; it's fun, and easy to sing along to. Nice album for driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Essential Reference for Cinematographers","review":"If you were allowed only one book to bring along on location, this is the one.

Although there are more pages to this edition than in previous editions, the extra content seems to contain more verbiage at the expense of tables and graphs.It is disappointing to note the absence of lighting equipment details (photometric data and equipment range) in particular. The focus (pun intended) seems to be more towards cameras, lenses, filters and film.My 4th edition manual has a better balance in terms of verbiage, tables and graphs, and covers lighting equipment in some detail. Although outdated in some areas, the 4th edition will still remain my primary source of information.The \\"novelisation\\" of this 8th edition has, to a degree, defeated the real purpose of the manual, the provision of readily accessable data via tables and graphs.If you are after lighting equipment details, then look elsewhere, if not, then consider purchasing this latest edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS the Bible","review":"This is the best book of its kind out there.

It was the most incredible music I had ever heard, and I've been a huge fan of his since. This music surrounds you with its beauty, a blend of traditional European classical music, American jazz, and ethnic rhythms. From moments of sublime simplicity to all out \\"blowing\\", each piece seems to be logically linked to the next, like four movements of a larger composition.

He is now 4 years old and this is the ONLY toy he plays with consistently everyday. At 2, he would build simple cars. Now he builds trains, cranes, bulldozers, replicas of star wars jets, guns (SIGH!), and anything he can imagine. These products are safe for younger children, but older kids come over to play and love them.

Brand-new it works after a fashion, but the angle of the ram and the surface supporting the can are so far out of parallel alignment that a fair percentage of the aluminum cans squirt out of the machine onto the floor rather than compact all the way. The angles of all surfaces that should be aligned are skewed (including the ram). The reviewers that claim that this item is well-made or heavy duty must work for the importer. This poor-quality item is extremely overpriced for what it is and should probably sell for $9.95 instead of $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"can crusher","review":"Device is generally as others have described.

Comes with three large wood screws, but has four mounting holes in the back plate. I used two screws, one in the middle of three holes at the at the top of unit, and one in the bottom hole.Heavy duty..crushes cans very easily, especially if you give their sides a pinch like the directions suggest. Be sure to lubricate the pivot points and metal to metal contact areas on the sides and back of the can receptacle. I would have given this unit five stars if it did not have a bit of metal flash on the handle that would have been likely to produce a small gash on my hand had I not noticed it during install. Used a file to get rid of it. Easy enough to remedy, but the manufacturer should have exercised a bit better QC before shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but cans slip out!","review":"I've had this crusher about 6 months. It's mounted outside on a 4 x 4 fence post under our back porch. I mounted it there as this is where my recycling containers are located.(3 color stackable containers also bought here) We discovered very quickly that the bottom edge is quite slippery and the cans come flying out when you try to crush them. I superglued a piece of rubber shelf matting to the bottom and this solved the problem. I noticed elsewhere on here someone recommended either bending up the edge or inserting a screw. I think those are great ideas and add weight to the complaint of cans slipping out of the crusher while being crushed. Great buy, would buy another if the need arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"smashing","review":"I like the product. It seems well built. I have only used it a short while and it has done well so far... couple hundred cans. Only thing I dislike is the occasional spit out of the cans even with the dent in the can to start.

My first lasted over 20 years but did little or nothing with bigger cans and didn't crush the typical soda can as small as this one but it was good enough. This can crusher is much better and reduces aluminum cans to an inch as advertised. I make a small indent using minimal pressure into the can. That makes it even easier to crush the cans and will probably make the crusher last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy crusher","review":"I had one of these at a rehearsal studio for many years, and it helped to keep the beer and soda can clutter to a minimum. It definately needs a little oil once in a while to reduce wear at the joints.

I had to modify it it using a small angle bracket to keep the cans from flying out at me when I tried to crush them. This was a very easy modification (in fact the hole I used to bolt it on was already there), but one that I shouldn't have to do. There should be some kind of lip at the bottom to prevent the cans from coming out. Other than that, it is very sturdy, should get many years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT IS PICTURED","review":"Nowhere near what is pictured here.

I wanted a beefy crusher, and this one is indeed beefy, but where it fails is that it has lots of metal to metal surfaces with no lubrication. It takes a lot of effort just to close it even without a can. The instructions say to lubricate it with household oil.

It also works as a stress-reliever when you're having a rough day. Crushing is fun! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the cans tend to fly out of the thing.

We have two, one upstairs and one downstairs... in our office building. After several years they have both broken. One has worn completely through one side of the pivot and the other has cut through the back where the bearing surfaces of the crusher plate uprights stop the crusher plate from folding over. We've worn about a 15 degreee angle on these parts.But we crush probably 100 cans a day, and this was looking pretty worn nearly two years ago when I joined the company. So another 40,000 cans have worn it to the point where it sometimes jams and sometimes kicks cans out the front, but it's still working."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT VALUE","review":"This is a great value for this item.

Weird controls - volume is via a wheel on the main unit; can't be adjusted using the remote control. Worked great for the first few hours, and then the screen went haywire - everything (including setup screens) gets awful ghost images, all of the colors except yellow disappeared, etc. Tried checking all the setup screens, and reset everything to factory defaults, but it appears to be a hardware failure.

On our very first trip with it, the main reason it was bought, the backlight went out on the screen. You can only barely see it when directly in the sun. What gets me now is after reading the poor reviews on this item that so many other people are having problems with it, when this afternoon I was on the phone with the people from Polaroid and they said they never have problems with these dvd players. To think, I thought i would pay the extra ammount for a namebrand I was familiar with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, poor quality","review":"I bought this unit because of the great features and the Polariod name...well, I have learned my lesson. I watched one movie on it on the way to the airport. Once we got on the plane and I turned it on, the screen lit up, but the disc would not spin. Checked the unit when I got home, the battery was fully charged and the player still wouldn't work plugged into direct power...I will be returning this and buying a new one, and not a Polariod."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good but works bad","review":"I guess this is the updated model for the dvd player that I have from polaroid the pdv-0800, but it looks like the same crap to me. I had 2 of these dvd players so far, the first one had problems so I sent it back expecting a well functioning product, but instead i recieved another dvd player that worked under par. They both had trouble doing what they are made to do , which is play dvd's. Most of the time the movies I were watching would freeze up during viewing for no apparent reason, and just other problems like a loud clicking noise during fast forwarding. I do not recommend polaroid dvd products at all, they should stick with film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had no problems","review":"I got this for Christmas two years ago and haven't had any issues.

I used it for about a year and a half than stored it for a while, and when I brought it out of stoarage it worked for about an hour and than just quit, never to run again. I opened it up to see if it was just a short or something easy, and it turns out that in the process of taking the top cover off, the wires are so short it bends the circiut board. I swear they make it like that. Also a friend of mine had one that quit in the same manner, which suggests that there is a trend. When it does mow, it does fairly well, because of the slower blade speed, you have to mow more frequently, if the grass gets to high, it will leave a lot sticking up. All in all I don't think I'm going to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Garden ROCKS!","review":"Savage Garden is the only new group out there right now in the 90's who can create good pop music. They do have their unique sound quality and Darren is a born singer. Savage Garden matches some of the other great artists out there such as Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Madonna. Their next album is going to determine whether I can truly call them the Prince's of Pop. I have wanted to call them that because I like almost all of their songs on their first album. I won't call them the Prince's of Pop until I see how this next album is. Well keep up the good work Darren and Daniel. I hope that you eventually have some of the biggest selling records of all time. Bring us into the Millenium with some of the best music that you can create."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique!","review":"I loved this CD because Savage Garden has a sound all their own. It's so unique. I can't describe the way the lyrics in Truly, Madly, Deeply make me feel. I Want You & To the Moon and back are awesome songs that'll make you sing with the tune. Even just buying this CD for one song makes it worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was deeply impressed","review":"Naturally I knew my 18-year-old daughter Juliana would review this album, with 5 stars of course, and by these two amazingly talented young men it is well-deserved. I'd like to just say that after hearing this album from Juliana I was so deeply moved by the sensitivities and deeply heartfelt nature of this music. It is one of the most honest set of songs I have heard in my lifetime. I see what the world is like with \\"boy bands\\" and headbanger music overtaking it, and Savage Garden shine the bright light among them. To all, men and women, young and old, listen to this album and you will find truth and beauty in this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Garden's music is truly sensation!","review":"This CD is awesome and I love all the songs in the album, this two duo did a great job making this album.

The CD contains 10 more tracks that alternately pump you up (\\"Break Me, Shake Me\\") and chill you out (\\"Santa Monica\\"). The best tracks are \\"I Want You\\" (though most people are probably tired of this one because of the extended airtime it received), \\"A Thousand Words\\", and \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\".Good music and a welcome addition to one's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully 'different'","review":"I found this album to be a pleasing, if somewhat eclectic mix of songs. 'Truly Madly Deeply' is a good ballad, and the sound of Savage Garden isof a somewhat different approach to music than so many other insipid bands. I feel, though, that their music is greater appreciated when one reads the trilogy of novels by Anne Rice-- the Vampire Chronicles. The moody 'Carry on Dancing' takes on new meaning in the light of the knowledge that it is inspired by the savage yet genttelmanlyvampires of her tales. Then we have 'To the Moon and Back', which, although not explicitly about these tales, can never fail to remind me of Lestat's strange yet powerful character. That it actually aspires to literature rather than mindless phrases like 'I can't live without you, babe'... (cf. Countless Boy-Bands) is surely inspiration enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another CD","review":"I bought this album a while ago, and I got more out of theese songs than I could imagine.Theese guys are talking right to your very soul.

I've never experienced music this way before.The first song I heard from the duo was \\"Truly madly deeply\\", and I thought it was a song that I would get tired of pretty fast. I was so wrong. When I got the album, I discovered that all the tracks where just incredible. I listen to the CD over and over again and I dont think I can ever get tired of it.The words does probably not have the same effect on everybody the same way as for me. It is really music that makes you think.Get this album and get carried away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Garden is the Best","review":"I totally love Savage Garden. without this CD i would probably die.

This CD is high energy mixed with intelligent and thoughtful lyrics that anyone can relate to. Suprisingly their music forces its way into your head and heart.Listen to it over and over again and you won't get sick of it. It reflects those feelings and anxieties that you have every day. So go ahead and listen (and don't worry that your friends might laugh at you) in the end you will enjoy the relaxing addiction that their music gives off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old quick","review":"Soundgarden was better, since their singles weren't played on the radio time and time again.

If I was to label the music as just \\"Pop\\" I would be ignorant and obviously deaf. They use so much strings and electronica and rock that it's a genre of its own! I bought this album like in '98 and I still enjoy jammin' to it occasionally. It puts me in a romantic and melancholic mood. I also like their second album. But is this one I'll always remember. Too bad the group only released two albums.

I love their voices, and if you like them as well, this album is totally worth having. I like their second one, \\"Affirmation\\" better, though. My favorite songs on this album are the first 3, although \\"To the Moon and Back\\" gets a little tiring after awhile (but I LOVE the lyrics) and \\"I Want You\\" gets kind of old too. I don't really like \\"Universe\\" because of the suggestive lyrics, and \\"Santa Monica\\" doesn't seem to fit somehow. \\"Violet\\" is a great song for anybody that likes the color purple...despite the disco theme...and \\"Carry on Dancing\\" is fun too. If you can only get one album, pick up \\"Affirmation\\", but if you're a fan, this album is worth having, if even only for \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\", which is truly one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Savage Garden's Self Titled Album/CD","review":"There as been very little music that has come out in the '90's I like.

The '90's music generally belonged to my two younger sisters.It is nice to know, I have found an album/CD that both my sisters and I enjoy. In a time of explict lyric warnings, it is nice to see a \\"decent\\" album/CD available.I don't have to ask the '90's crowd what savage Garden is talking about. In other words, you can understand the lyrics!Great album all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. I can't wait till thier next album comes out.","review":"Even though they are basically pop, they have songs that can be classified as other genres. I Want You is more like dance, and Break Me Shake Me is kind of like alta-rock. I love TrulyMadlyDeeply. The songs are lyrically and musically fantastic. The painting they chose for their album artwork shows their apreciation for art, and adds to the \\"Savage Garden\\" effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs for poetic losers in love","review":"Savage Garden. What can one say? Their crafted pop has made an impact on Top 40 countdowns the world over, yet many people outside Australia struggle to identify them when asked.Lead singer Darren Hayes tries too hard to be a great wordsmith; when one word will do, he instead uses a slew of them. Even then, his 'meaningful' messages are obscured. The sound of the CD is clean and almost too clinical. If you can get over the anachronistic touches of 80's synth pop, this CD will suit you fine.The dripping wet 'Truly Madly Deeply' looks certain to be the most played song at weddings into the 21st century. And a beautiful, affecting single it is too, but there are too few highlights here to make it worth your while. On the whole, not a bad effort, but is it worth your money?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah!!","review":"This CD was hyped up to be a great one but it wasn't at all!

Many of the choruses on this CD are just a couple lines repeating over and over again. It's almost as if this group couldn't think of anything else (or better) to say.Another thing I absolutely dislike about this album are the lyrics to a lot of the songs. \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\" talked about wanting to \\"bathe with you in the sea\\" and \\"lay like this forever\\" and that is sick and wrong. \\"Universe\\" is just the same. The first verse is:\\"Well I'd like to take you as I find you/ Imagine our clothes are on the floor/Feel my caress so soft and gentle/So delicate you cry for more/But you know baby/ You know baby does it right/And you know baby does it right\\" Many songs suggest things, and others swear.For any people looking for something good I'd suggest buying Jars of Clay, or Plus One."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Have To Get C-d!","review":"This a great c-d!

I was ready to come back here and trash it after I bought it. All I really like at first were \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\" and \\"Universe.\\" Now I love most of the songs. The only ones that don't do it for me are \\"Break Me Shake Me\\" and \\"I Want You.\\" Everything is wonderful. I love the lead singer's voice. It's sexy and intoxicating. With the exception of two songs, I think this album rocks, and was, by far, a wise purchase on my part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pop with hidden depth and energy","review":"A feeling-based album with a lot of sensual text-passages which create an atmosphere of love and comfort. There are included also some \\"harder\\" parts as in \\"Break me, shake me\\", but also these speak of the main topic \\"LOVE\\" (in a very rude but also sexy way). The album varies between electro, ballads, some kind of \\"rocky\\" stuff and brilliant pop-songs like \\"Tears of pearls\\". The most known song, I suppose, is \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\", a ballad about - what a surprise - Love. It's a great song with great lyrics and, of course, these are the reasons for it's success!

The Aussie duo is here to stay! My other fav trax are: \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\" \\"To The Moon & Back\\", \\"Tears of Pearls\\", \\"Break Me Shake Me\\" and \\"Santa Monica.\\" They incorporate a wide range of styles from synth pop to pure pop and rock. Believe me on this-Buy it! You will Not be dissapointed.

If you buy \\"Savage Garden\\" you won't have to worry about liking the songs....YOU WILL! Every single tune catches your every mood, making this album simlpy amazing in every way imaginable. I HIGHLY recomend this CD! Trust me, I am a HUGE music fan and have every CD out there right now!! \\"Savage Garden\\" still remains #1 in my collection. Inlight of their great album, I've also become their biggest fan! So, again if you want an amazing CD that's worth your time and money, look no further than \\"Savage Garden.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Darren and Daniel rock in the Savage Garden!","review":"Australians Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones rock in the Savage Garden with their 1997 debut album. They wrote their own music like many other pop/rock artists. Their debut single was I WANT YOU. It has some really cool lyrics like \\"chic-a-cherry cola\\". There's also the adult contemporary TRULY MADLY DEEPLY. Another hit is TO THE MOON & BACK. I like PROMISES,SANTA MONICA and BREAK ME SHAKE ME. The latter sounds like a Michael Jackson recording. Whoever the lead singer is,his voice resembles Jackson's. All the other songs are great. Fans of Savage Garden are also fans of other duos like The Everly Brothers,England Dan Seals & John Ford Coley and Peter Asher & Gordon Waller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop/Rock with a little heart","review":"Although I had heard their song 'Truly Madly Deeply' years ago, I did not know who sang it. The lead singer, Australian sex symbol Darren Hayes, has a fresh voice that slightly reminds you of Micheal Jackson's from the 80's, as the lead guitarist, British boy Daniel Jones, plays snappy chords. The songs are catchy and beautiful. Although this CD came out in 1997, it is still fresh to your ears each time you hear it. You will never want to put the CD on pause."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that started it all","review":"It's hard to believe that this album came out over 7 years ago. It feels like just yesterday I first became addicted to \\"To The Moon and Back,\\" the first song on this album. With the most amazing sound effects and facinating lyrics, it's easy to start singing along as you are slowly pulled into the picture Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones have drawn. As the album progresses, they further draw us in with amazingly pop yet startlingly original songs such as \\"Violet\\", \\"Tears of Pearls\\", \\"Promises\\", and yes, even the sometimes overplayed \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply.\\" There's a reason these boys from Brisbane have sold well over 11 million copies of this album in the US alone! And, lucky for you, it's not too late for you to own this astonishing album! I'm certain you'll fall in love with each of these tracks more and more as you play this CD over and over again, so what are you waiting for? Go add it to your shopping cart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't have this CD {yet} but I listen to Savage Garden!","review":"I have heard Truley Madley Deeply on the radio and seen the music video on VH1.

Anyone who has the time to listen should at least preview every bit of the albulm u can."},{"rating":"1","title":"My one star rating is very generous.","review":"This CD will go into my collection of one hit wonders. I bought the CD for the hit single \\"Truly, madly, deeply\\", which is easy listening, not a classic, but the rest of the cuts are really awful. Outdated, super sweet and non original. The lead singer sounds a lot like the lead singer from the 80's band, Breathe, and the music sounds a lot like their stuff too.

My only other favorite is their follow up to this one! I've never come across a CD in which I so utterly adored every single song until I bought 'Savage Garden'. I originally got it only for \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\" but soon learned just how amazing Savage Garden is. Their songs are phenomenal, addicting, and deep, speaking to something hidden just as deep inside of you. Every song I've ever heard by them I've simply *loved*. And this CD is no exception, I don't leave home without it. I can not praise their work highly enough!

The musical arrangements are top notch....well thought out, scored brilliantly, and exciting. A few are nostalgic, and will likely bring a tear, especially to anyone who lived through the era of WWII or to anyone who loves that type music. The unfortunate thing is that this disc is out of print, but it can still be purchased from a few sellers. Highly recommend getting it while it's still available.

The only downside, if you want to consider this as such, is that this baby is not light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave heroine, darling hero, fun book","review":"A fun book, quite well done. The flow of the book is really good; the author makes it seem so easy to tell this story. The timeframe is quick but somehow she makes it seem real even though it is so fast. I appreciate that the heroine is three dimensional and is brave. And goodness, Royce is a darling hero. The sweetest hero I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book very enthusiastically and with the best expectations after I loved so much the first installment of the series, thus the harsh disappointment. The story is very shallow, the characters' development lacks in depth. The narration goes on and on, too often repeating the same situations and the same mental looping of the main characters. No, this novel never managed to capture my interest, and I had to force myself to finish the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I really like this series.

I liked that this story was so different from FOREVER HIS and once I began reading I coudn't put the book down and it made me daydream. It is a very sweet romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"insipid","review":"Philip Glass didn't create anything new with this cd. He's not one of the most famous living composers because he's one of the greatest -- I guess just because he's one of the most accessible amidst all the brilliant creative innovation of the 20th & 21st centuries (which he did play an important role in, granted, 30 years ago). This cd is so boring to me. The swirling effect of arpeggiation is appropriate to the theme, & Mr Glass probably thought he was being so superbly minimalistic by isolating just that as the compositional element for almost all the music, but it sounds like it could have been made in as long as the cd lasts by absent-mindedly holding down a few keys on a keyboard with the arpeggiation button on. I think this is probably not music for one with an ear for composition. If you do like it, don't worry about me."},{"rating":"2","title":"El mejor disco de Philip Glass desde hace tiempo","review":"¡Hola desde España!

As great now as in the 70's. the quality is phenomenal, the fit is perfect. Once you get them on the first time, which can be a challenge, you'll think they were handmade for your foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Even worse Customer Service","review":"I bought these boots at a retail store in Chicago to wear on the motorcycle. They are 1 month old and have been worn perhaps a dozen times. The strap, at the top of the boot, to pull them on has failed. A call to Frye and they tell me that if I bought the boots online from them, they would pay the shipping to them for the repair. Since I bought them at a retail store I have to pay to send them back! $235 dollars for a pair of boots and this is the customer service you get. The strap pulled out of it's stitching because it is too short and has too few stitches at the point it is sewn in. I've had Frye boots in the past and not had any problems with them. This will be the last pair of Frye I'll buy. It's too bad that buying American made products has become a roll of the dice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some boots","review":"Have been wanting a pair or Frye harness boots forever, just recently found out they made them in wide sizes. They fit pretty true to size, have decent arch support, and feel like armor on your feet. The leather is heavy and can be a little warm in the summer. My only real complaint is that the toe is REALLY squared off. Almost unfashionable. Still, all in all, very good boots made in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Boots","review":"Nice boots.

There weren't many glaring typographical errors. It was a but slow but with an unexpected twist at the end. But there was nothing entertaining about it either.

If you're looking for frightening futuristic government take over, try 1984 by Orwell. DeChancie tries to throw in a twist by using nanotech as his instrument of subjugation, but it was just another means to the same end, and weakly utilized throughout the book. Nanotech, like distopia, has been done before and been done better. To top it all off, John throws in a little romance that's cliche all the way. If anything, this book is less than the sum of its pathetic parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome mixer","review":"This Mixer is designed for the professional.

The quality of the neoprene seems good, comparable to my Body Glove wetsuit. I wear coolmax briefs under the shorts for additional comfort. When biking I wear my bike shorts over them. I also surf, boogie board, etc. and they've become my favorite bathing suit. Obviously they're nothing like even a shorty wetsuit, but they cover enough to make cool water more comfortable, and they sure beat having yards (What's with men's bathing suits anyway these days?!?) of wet material dragging you down.

Mr. Subby through his clear and concise writing style as well as personal experience as a codependent, kept my mind focused on how I might have gotten where I was but also gave me tools to break the cycle. A lot of self-help books are not really helpful and can lose the reader with a lot of psychology speak. This book did not. I would recommend it to anyone; especially as an introduction to codependency; who feels abandoned and that they have lost themselves in relationships and come out of them feeling drained, empty, alone and not knowing really who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly!","review":"At the time of this review there is one being sold for $80+ as collectable here.

I really liked \\"New Skin\\". So I bought it like 3 days after. I am the hugest fan. I love how the singer uses bongos and a didjeridu (spelling ?) those Australian instruments. If you like (hed)PE or Limp Bizkit you'll really dig this because Incubus also uses a DJ. Sometimes It's pretty hard at times then5 seconds later it slows down. Like \\"vitamin\\" and \\"glass\\" starts outs pretty weak then gets hard. Thats it. BUY IT! 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cure For The Tired Ear","review":"All the songs have Korn -like guitars, 90's hip hop, and a unruly sound. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is all but mainstream, creating the first original sound I've heard in years. I've also read that Incubus is astounding live. If the music is the same, that can be trusted. If you, as I am, are sick of all the same old tunes, and have a taste for hard alt. and hip hop, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a must buy. Hell, it's a must buy no matter what you like.

I don't mind a little of it, but this band goes WAY overboard. Some guy is getting paid a lot of money to scratch a freakin record on a turntable. Unbelievable.

Korn, Incubus and Orgy. november 2nd 1998. At first i wasnt sure if i would like them, but 2 seconds after they started playing i loved them. a week after the concert i went out and bought the cd. And unfortunately i paid way more than what i would of paid through amazon. This is a great cd for all them Rage, Korn, Deftones fans. I really love this cd. When i first bought the cd, none of my friends knew who it was. Then they were all into it, they all own a copy now. So go ahead buy it, you'll never get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really cool music.","review":"I downloaded an MP3 of New Skin, and I thought it was really cool sounding, so I bought the CD. The name of the CD is appropriate because they experiment with a lot of sounds. I especially like Redefine, Calgone, and Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity...). Thier first CD is pretty cool, too. This CD is a lot heavier, which is nice. I like to listen to Enjoy Incubus when im in a melancholic (spelling?) mood, and S.C.I.E.N.C.E any other time. The bassist is really excellent, and I like the drummer using other percussion instruments (the bongoes stand out the most in my mind). The lyrics are good, and the vocalist has a good range compared to other vocalists in the metal/rapcore genre of music. All around, it is a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome!","review":"I've had this cd for a while and I think it is the best cd I own! I don't care what others say about it, it rocks! With songs like \\"New Skin\\", \\"Glass\\", \\"Calgone\\", and \\"A Certain Shade of Green.\\" it is the best cd ever. The ECD is quite weird but interesting, because you can access their secret website. I espesilly like \\"Calgone\\" because of the ending and the long set of hidden tracks, 11 to be exact! It is also great to skateboard to! If you like Static-X, Limp Bizkit, and KoRn, this cd is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have","review":"This is, to date, Incubus' best album. They didn't become famous because of this album (that was Make Yourself, which wasn't bad either). This is one of the few CDs that I can continue listening to without skipping any tracks because I love every single one of them. ^_^Even the lyrics are rather snazzy, unlike the overdone lyrics that are splashed throughout the music market today.This album also shows the range that every band member has, but what really, really impressed me was DJ Lyfe. In a time when incorporating turntabling was just awakening, this guy was already opening some cans of whoopass. :PFantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT INCUBUS","review":"i am a fan of incubus, i wouldn't say a particularly huge fan, but this in my opinion is their best album! well i can't really say that cos i have only got this, 'morning view', 'make yourself' and 'enjoy incubus', but out of them i feel this is the best! i prefer this to the latest two because i feel it is harder and funkier than 'make yourself' and 'morning view'. i am actually going to see them this friday at manchester and i can't wait! and i am really hoping they play a big mix of their songs and not just stuff off 'morning view', but anyway that has nothing to do with this review so i will get on with it! if you wanna download to check them out i would recommend downloading any of the first six songs!! they are all brilliant, but i love all of those songs!! so yeah if you like funky, hard, original music then you should get this now! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD, one of the best in my player.","review":"Other than the other 3 incubus albums I own, this is the only CD I can continue to play and enjoy. The music is amazingly brilliant and fun to listen to. As much as I miss this sound in the new CD's I know I can always go back and listen to S.c.i.e.n.c.e. A Certain Shade of Green was what originally attracted me to this CD, but there is not one track on here that I can pick apart as bad. Even thought the funk beats are much more mellow on this album, they are still in the undertones of the notes on this CD and they provide a fantastic backbone. Anyeone who aspires to be an Incubus fan should buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Yeah!!!!!","review":"Its one of those albums which 1 song (A Certain Shade Of Green) made me buy it- saw it on MTV and was sold!!!

Since then, I've listened to little else as other bands seem weirdly untalented in comparison. Incubus is one of those bands with so much to offer that they actually make you thank whatever god/religeon you subscribe to for allowing you the oppurtunity to experience them. The S.C.I.E.N.C.E. album is their most powerful and inspiring project. INCredible vocals, INCredible guitarwork, INCredible mixture of hardcare/funk/jazz/techno/hip-hop beats, INCredible lyrics... need I say more? ..or have I already said too much? =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOT TO HAVE!","review":"I just wanted to say that this CD is just about the best one I own! There is not one song on the entire CD that I could not stand to listen to 100 times! If you're interested, I personally think the best songs are A Certain Shade of Green, Idiot Box, Redefine, and New Skin. Oh and I know Magic Medicine is a little umm...different at first, but soon you'll love it! And defintely pop it into your computer for a really nice treat:)Brandon-you ROCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great example of a great band.","review":"I first discovered Incubus only a couple of months ago when I first heard Make Yourself. However, the first time I experienced S.C.I.E.N.C.E. I was absolutely blown away. I can only name maybe four bands in my life that have totally changed my outlook on music and even life. Incubus is the most recent addition. The fusion of metal, techno, funk, and hip hop proves to be amazing when put out by this band. Anyway, stop reading this and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous","review":"Adventurous is probably the best one word description to give this album. Straight up heavy riffing one track, smooth jazz riffs the next. Amid all this musical chameleaon act, the album still holds together extremely well. Incubus goes from the hard rock of Favorite Things to the jazzy lounge music-like Summer Romance to Nebula, which is just insanity at its finest! And that's what makes this CD so great - you get a little bit of everything. The band's energy remains high throughout, and it really shows. Take a listen, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I've had this cd for awhile now but I just haven't gotten around to reviewing it yet. S.C.I.E.N.C.E is one of the best albums I've heard in awhile. Brandon Boyd with his Mike Patton-like vocals(Faith No more and Mr.Bungle are the greatest bands in the world), Kid Lyfe with his own unique style of scratching, Jose Paillas with his percussion, and so on. The bassist puts everybody else to shame. Except for Les Claypool."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BANDS FINEST WORK","review":"Buy this CD if you are an incubus fan. I loved it from beginning to end. I'm very satisified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is like, one of the best albums ever. They've got so many different, wild beats, catchy choruses, entreguing lyrics and meanings... everything. If you like Incubus even the slightest bit, you'll love this album. It's their best one yet, and definetly surpasses Make Yourself. While Make Yourself is also a wonderful album, it's nowhere near as playful as S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and even sounds somewhat worn out after listening to them both. We can only hope their next album is at least as good as S.C.I.E.N.C.E."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why dumb down a potentially cool binary watch?","review":"I was excited when I discovered these watches, until I noticed the base ten digits printed on the face to help wannabes read binary.

All those with questions about why the present generation has such problems with obesity and the concomitant lifestyle diseases that accompany modern living compared with the relative simplicity of the past and its accompanying dearth of horrible diseases needs to read this book and take its message to heart.

According to the authors the foods we eat can either encourage or damage our health.A big part of living a long and healthy life involves your spiritual well being.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Are You In Spiritual Darkness Or Are You On The Path To Enlightenment? +++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you buy or read you should research","review":"An amazing deconstruction of the flawed use of statistics and the scientific method found in this book is here[...]How in could the funders of this project allow such a slip shod product to be constructed from the data I'll never know.the data should be released for all to see and run there own statistical correlations , by crowd sourcing the data we will limit the bias that can be present in the researchers"},{"rating":"1","title":"China Study debunked","review":"The China study was an observational study. Correlations deduced from an observational study do not - in fact, cannot -- prove causation. As Dr. Eade points out, all you can really do with data from an observational study is to form a hypothesis, which must then be tested in randomized, controlled trials, to ferret out the truth about whether or not x actually causes y.In many cases, the data (presented in arduous detail in the book Diet, Life-Style and Mortality in China) do not show statistically significant correlations between animal protein consumption and disease such as cancer at all. ****On the contrary. It would seem that sugar and carbohydrates are correlated with cancer - not animal protein**** In addition, the data indicate that fat is negatively correlated with cancer mortality, which again contradicts the claim that meat is harmful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Many claims made in this book are in defiance of medical history and common sense.Degenerative diseases emerged explosively in the 20th century (following the invention of the high speed steel roller mill, which made white flour and white sugar very cheap). Yet people have been consuming animal products since long before the 20th century. The explosive growth of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease does not correspond to an explosion in the consumption of animal foods.The book doesn't mention America's premiere thinker on nutrition and health, Weston Price. It doesn't explain why the French, Swiss, and Eskimos are healthier than Americans, despite their diets rich in saturated animal fats.This book was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title of Book Is Deceiving!","review":"Most of the people reviewing this book give it stars based on whether or not they agree with what the book says or not. I have to say that my review has little to do with my agreeing or not agreeing with the content.I am giving it only three stars because it is called the China Study, so I expected the book to be primarily about just that, the China Study. However, not even 1/4 of the book was about the China Study. It doesn't go very in depth about the study. If you've seen Forks Over Knives, then you know about 90% of the content of the China Study portion of the book. It's very deceiving to name the book after a study and then not actually have the book go that in depth into the study. So whether you agree with the book or not, don't expect to learn extensively about the China Study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Capitalism really cause so much evil?","review":"This book explains scientifically a MAJOR cause of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease that if action were taken to implement the findings, the dairy and beef industries and all those business sectors that depend on the dairy and beef industries (like pizza) would be financially destroyed. Also, the industries that profit from treating cancer, diabetes, and heart disease would be decimated as a result of the near elimination of these diseases from society. Likely, that is why the American Cancer Society, which provided some of the funding of this 20 year study, has remained so quiet about the findings as has the \\"leaders\\" in Washington who funnel BILLIONS of dollars to fund \\"the fight against cancer, heart disease, dibetes, etc.\\" Christians, by their very credo, are SUPPOSED to love their neighbors as themselves.

But The China Study brings it all together with tons and tons of data that have been laboriously, meticulously gathered on diets and diseases- and over a long period of time. These things together mean good statistics, not people manipulating numbers to play grand games of denial.

I say \\"bad\\" only in the sense that it is not for the millions of consumers who just want to get the basics without being overwhelmed by the numbers and technical jargon. Sometimes the numbers get in the way. I think it's too much of a text book for most people which is a shame because I wish everyone would read this book. For me, personally, as a consultant to the biggest food manufacturers for twenty-five years, I loved it and poured over the numbers.

He even calls this a \\"belief\\" of his. My jaw dropped when I read this. How can you generalize from casein to all animal proteins? Why not generalize to all milk proteins? Or all protein in general?After five minutes of online research I found an article finding that dehydrating casein makes it carcinogenic, presumably because it is exposed to oxygen and light. So you can't even generalize to all casein products (i.e., milk).Please, when you read a book like this, map out in your mind the argument of the author and make sure it really makes sense.

Even some of theresearchers on the project quit because the data they collected did not support the study.Do your home work and Google the Study and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have seen. It could have been written in 1/10 the amount of words. It is very flowery with tremendous amounts of useless background and extraneous information and just verbage. The book can be summed-up in one line: Eat fruits and vegetables (plant based foods), do not eat animal proteins (meat), and do not eat dairy products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscientific garbage","review":"I tried to read this book with an open mind, I really tried. I got as far as the blatant pot-kettleism between the nitrite studies and Campbell's own casein study and the diagram portraying cancer as Pac-Man with sharp teeth and then had to put it down.D. Tosh, Joseph DeMarinis, and other reviewers have done a good job picking apart the obvious errors and propaganda in this book so I won't repeat them. Suffice it to say that if you think anything in this book provides a scientific basis for vegetarianism or veganism you are sadly mistaken.If you don't eat anything containing animal products due to your moral views, great, good for you. But propagating obvious errors and outright lies because they happen to agree with your personal biases is not \\"science,\\" in fact it's the polar opposite of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"He had a point to prove","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. There are quite a few chapters before he even gets to China where it becomes clear that he is anti protein. He did 10 years of studies on how one protein, casein, affects the growth of one kind of tumor, liver cancer from aflatoxin and uses that to make all kinds of judgements about what people should or should not eat.As the Weston A. Price Foundation points out, some forms of casein, because of how they are dried, are carcinogenic. They also pointed out a fact that Campbell ignored, that those who ate the most saturated fat were protected from cancers and diseases of degeneration.It's a good read if you want to justify being a vegan, but if you really want answers, it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is another confusing book for the public to understand","review":"Perhaps people should keep in mind that mediterranean diets have been known to contribute to long healthy active lives.

Dr. Campbell goes to great lengths, thoroughly and consistently examining what he and other scientists have discovered to be the real culprit to human diseases; animal-based foods. Americans are deeply addicted to meat and dairy, and The China Study flies in the face of our food traditions and beliefs, however, the 35 years of consistent study results is so compelling, I embraced Dr. Campbell's message without any resistance.

Ate lots of fish, fruits, veggies and nuts. My numbers were pretty good and at least I haven't had any more heart procedures, but I still noticed a sharp rise in energy within 72 hours of going vegan. As a result, I've gone off of several of my medications and continue to feel fine without pumping so many toxic pills into my body.Unless you're part of the food or medical community, THE CHINA STUDY will blow your mind.

Not so much because of the content of the gags but more a result of the quality of the recording. The first half of the CD is great, primarily focusing on the hilarious Delirious stand Up Routine. However the latter part of the CD was barely audible. I exchanged the CD twice in the vain hope that I had a defective copy. Unfortunately it was not to be.

That said, I adore Brahms piano music, and this is a wonderful recording. Beautifully performed, not overly sappy or sentimental, Van Cliburn has a wonderfully balanced approach to Brahms' stunning romantic music. For those of you who have mixed feelings about classical music, this is a wonderful alternative to the \\"New Age\\" piano music so popular right now (and which I enjoy as well).

If you like the way Pavarotti sang, you'll like the Cliburn plays, pretentious romantic heroes both, coming in Byronically, and banging, just plain banging away, hair flying.Even in the Liebestraum, he does so, as well as hovering before each banged chord as if it's too, too beautiful actually to be played, and then whipping dotted rhythms into double dotted hysteria in an all to casual virtuosity whose purpose seems to be to geewhiz his hearers and to cause them whiplash.Fech!No wonder some of my teachers put a \\"Help Stamp Out Opera\\" sign on their studio doors.People, people...Placido Domingo, Murry Perahia, Please.This kind of thing drives young people away from serious music in droves."},{"rating":"1","title":"very British","review":"This book contains many facts, and many, many of the author's opinions.

It isn't a hard, complicated story to understand. I loved it and finished it in a day.

He beats Karajan by seconds in the speed he dispatches the orchestra in the second movement. The third movement holds it's own with the memorable horn calls. The final movement sounds improvistory without sounding confused. This is a true performance through and through. The Royal Philharmonic beats the Scottish National Orchestra under Jarvi and comes in a close second to Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic. The prices used at Amazon beat both Jarvi and Karajan.

Other reviews I have read explain my situation perfectly. It overheats and freezes much too frequently. I understand that an occasional lockup is to be expected, but this is ridiculous. It happens at least once a day.The 1.4 GHz Athlon is great... when it actually runs up to speed. I still like the AMD, but other hardware issues have plagued my Compaq.As we speak, my Compaq is in the hands of Best Buy. Thankfully I purchased the warranty, because the power supply completely broke and needs repairs.Heed the warning and do not buy a Compaq. Go Dell!Compaqs are cheap and unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"I purchased this laptop approximately one year ago thinking that it was a good purchase. I was dead wrong. The machine is incapable of running many games it consistently locks up an issue compaq technical support is incapable of solving. In addition the headphone jack failed on the unit and compaq technical support refused to acknowledge the problem claiming it was a software issue that would be resolved by reimaging the machine (I subsequently fixed it with a paperclip). I am also suffering cracking of the case which apparently is a very common design defect that is present in this series. Although the laptop is quite fast I would not recommend this unit (or any other compaq) to anyone due to the poor customer support provided by compaq I have never had to deal with such a poor support staff among all of the other companies I have dealt with in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I give this laptop only two stars?...","review":"...because it OVERHEATS way too much. Although the hardware and specs are nominally desirable, in practice I can't finish any of my high-end, video-demanding games because after a while, it heats up, then locks up! VERY FRUSTRATING!! I can't believe that the Compaq engineers and beta testers were aware of this problem. It didn't take me long to discover it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"READ before buying","review":"I got this computer about two months ago and I am very disapointed. It locks up all of the time without any way to un freeze it forcing me to shut it down and lose what I was working on and start again. It automatically shuts down without any notice for no reason.This happens most when I am trying to create movies on the movie maker that came pre-installed on the computer. It has recently started making all DVD's I try to play skip. These problems make this computer very frusterating and hard to use. I sent in an e-mail to technical support about a three weeks ago and I am still waiting to get a response. The compute does have some good features like nice sound and a good display but they aren't worth the load of problems that they come with. I am taking it in soon to see if the problems can be fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presario 700","review":"I can not work with My Presario 700. It just freezes a lot of times during the day.

It was very appealing and had nice features.This machine started to give me problems right away it kept shutting down and overheating and lagging. Like it was running Pentium I or something it took for ever to start after powering up. I should had known, what are the odds the day I purchased this labtop a customer was bringing one in for service.This is the worst investment I have ever made.

The material is easily assessable, as entertaining as it can get, considering the subject matter. It is also a valuable resource for couples contemplating marriage because then the couple can go to a lawyer somewhat educated as to their concerns and draft a pre-nup that covers those areas of concern in case the marriage does not pan out as planned. I was able to skip from subject to subject with ease with respect to learning about the areas of interest that concerned me. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the DVD is so great, why the fake reviews?","review":"WARNING: all 5 reviews of this DVD obviously are fake, as the reviewers' account names clearly are bogus, and none of the reviewers ever reviewed anything else.

Clouds of dust drift upwards whenever you gently run the scoop through it. The dust then settles on every surface of the room. Not to mention your hands...well ok, let's mention them. I scrub my hands after using this stuff and I swear the sickly sweet perfume odor cannot be washed off! My hands stink of grandmother perfume for an hour afterwards as though I had been building sand castles on a cat litter beach. And this is just from touching the scoop and being in the vicinity of the ominous dust cloud. Yikes. At least when strangers visit they don't immediately comment on your owning a cat. No, instead it's \\"Oh does your grandmother live with you? And what's up with all the white powder? I thought people quit that stuff back in the '80s.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What Wrong?","review":"The retail product price for this item is $12.95, not $57.00. Is this a package of 4? 6? It's a good product and I use it for my 2 cats, but if anyone buys this \\"deal\\" for one 14-pound container, they are getting a very raw deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an odor free apartment!!","review":"Living in an apartment, it's hard to keep it smelling clean when there's a cat around. I was using Arm & Hammer for a few months until I realized it wasn't doing a damn thing about odor. I bought the clumping, multiple cats Arm & Hammer litter but even after my cat would use the litter box once, it would imminently stink up the place! Finally I decided to buy a new brand and this one works amazing! I live in a one bedroom apartment and you could imagine how hard it is to keep it odor free, I've had this litter for two days and already I notice a BIG difference. I come back from school/work after a few hours of not cleaning the box and the apartment smells fine, no nasty kitty poop and pee smell! This is a big sigh of relief. And the stuff clumps up pretty well, almost leaves no residue behind. Will definitely continue buying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for going \\"off the beaten path\\".","review":"I purchased this book to help me find some 'off the beaten path' locations in and around Washington County. Its not written as a guide book for the casual tourist. Rather, its really meant for people who are already familiar with the general locale. Familiarity with the general streets and locations will aid considerably for successfully locating your 'out of the way' place of choice. Once you get the hang of the book and it's instructions it you'll find yourself in places you didn't know existed. I was particularly excited about the volume of cemeteries mentioned in the book. These hold incredibly rich clues to the life and times of the areas and can be a valuable source of local history. This is well worth the $14.95 I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD!","review":"Wow! What a great product. I am just starting out learning Delta Blues guitar and really wanted to learn \\"I'll Go With Her\\". I use tabs though I can read music I am very slow at it. Actually, I am slow at learning through tabs as well but coupled with the video instruction, it was a breeze. I mastered the song much more quickly than with tab alone and really enjoyed the teaching style of John Miller. I understand now what country blues players mean when they say a student needs to learn from another player."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so content, hard to read","review":"Like most Dummies books Boston for Dummies has neither in-depth content nor genuine humor. What it does boast of is a low price. There is a lot of information in the book -- information you can also find online for free or in other guide books. My personal favorite is the award-winning \\"The Rough Guide to Boston,\\" which features better writing and better editing than this one. If you are visiting Boston or plan to go to school there, get the Rough Guide to Boston to take advantage of everything the city has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Debut!","review":"Latrell Mickler has done a wonderful job of meticulous research and attention to detail. This is a book of historical fiction, about a Minorcan couple in Florida in the 1700's.

Christopher, Jalil, April, and David are here because of Senna, the witch, and they cannot get out without her. They face new dangers each day, the Gods, Dragons and creatures never even heard of. All they have to protect themselves is a little pocketknife and Galahad's sword. Now they have made a mistake.

I really enjoyed the book, but like anyone am confused about the people. These two led a more \\"by the numbers\\" life than I do. Just because they lived in the country does not mean they did not have the same pressures we all have. they just had them in a different way. Don't look to these two to start or continue a good marriage. this is not how to communicate.I still wonder about the events with his sons (read the book and you will see). How could a father not go looking...??????very interesting book, and highly recommended.frustrating, but interesting review of how we are as people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disturbing","review":"Although this book has many interesting moments, overall it was quite disturbing. That the author/wife allowed and enabled Guy's (husband's) suicide makes one question her motives. Was she so very angry? Had she so lost her own sense of self? The deeper family issues are glossed over in part as well. Two of Guy's sons were also suicides. Instead of requiring that her husband get help, she allowed him to disintegrate into his own depression and, indeed, she knew quite well when he was going to kill himself. I don't want to blame the \\"victim\\" but I do question the decisions she made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I couldn't decide which character I disliked more in this book--the depressed husband or the enabler wife. Their marriage never seemed like one of true love to me. He treated her as a working roommate and she never (or rarely) stood up for herself and what she wanted. He was not a likeable character. His relationships with his children should have been an indicator to her that he was not capable of sustaining a long term, normal, loving relationship. And the strange, year-long waiting period before he actually committed suicide seemed ridiculous.I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was depressing and uninteresting, and in no way did I feel empathy for the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"The Caedmon recording of As You Like It is well worth the purchase just to hear two Redgraves soar in their performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"I didn't understand it.

The problem I have with it is that it is very badly written. I realise that being a writer is not this guys job but how it was printed like this is beyond me. I can get over grammatical mistakes and bad punctuation to a point. This book is written so badly that at times it is very difficult to get the meaning of sentances.

Taking a unique theoretical approach, this book explores perceptions of law within national, corporate and the individual contexts, analyzing the potentials of each level to influence the social understanding of law and the wider role of law in society itself.

I don't have anything against those who are Charismatic - but this book is not spiritually sound nor is it spiritually safe in regards to what are spiritual matters. If you are of a sound mind and truely love Jesus Christ - do not buy this book with the intentions of growing closer to Him. It is a good book to read if you want to learn about how twisted and mangled someone can make Paul sound. The particular danger in this book is how the topic is conveyed.

Finally, it seems clear that the male author doesn't respect his wife, from the dismissive way he discusses her.

I used pork Char Siu in with it, and that was fine, as I said, I am a big fan of NOHs Char Siu, but this stuff was about useless.I added extra Teriyaki sauce, just to give the rice some flavor, and it actually got better tasting the 2nd day. I am going to try this again with about 2 cups of rice, just to see if its better in a smaller batch.

The book contains the history of the women's movement and articles from a variety of authors concerning the lives of women from different social and cultural backgrounds. The issue of race and sexuality are important topics in the book because depending on their background women have very different experiences with sexism.

I give it 2 stars for the live tracks (which I do not have, I don't even have this album. I have the remix burned), which must be good, because Slipknot's always good live, or so I heard.

That said, prepare as directed and the flavor is exactly like the familiar Chinese ribs you get in a restaurant. My only concern is the vibrant red of the marinade. There was a real scare about red dye in foods a few years back and I'm still a little wary of any product that uses dyes (such as red dye #3, used here). I'll probably use what I ordered but I doubt I'll use anymore because of the dye additive. Seriously, why does it have to be red?

This is perfect daytime stoner rock, for cruising in the van, whereas most of the music in that genre is based around sunset in the desert.

The characters are beautifully drawn. I felt as if I knew each of them. No confusing one for the other as in some novels.From the wastrel Sydney Carton, who became the ultimate hero to Jarvis Lorry, who saw himself as only a \\"man of business\\" and who developed a love of Dr. Manette and his family that lead him to endanger himself, and even to the bumbling, Jerry--Mr. Jarvis' messenger at the Bank and part-time grave-robber, each character came alive for me.I never fully realized before the horrors of the French revolution which was a reaction to the horrors of the way the aristocracy treated the poor. Although this was a stark example of how low the human being can sink in to depravity, the nobility of some of the characters shone in contrast.I enjoyed \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" so much I will probably read it again some day--and reading something twice,I rarely do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent copy of the classic","review":"I regularly read and / or re-read the classics.

I liked their song \\"2Wicky\\" so I thought I would give them a try. This group has to be one of the best if you enjoy a melodramatic blur of musical effects, topped with a very soothing female voice. You know those days when you come in from a hard day at work, and get in a mood where you can't pick which CD you want to listen to? For some reason, Hooverphonic is one CD you can enjoy no matter what type of mood you're in. Whether you feel down and dreary, happy and hip, evil and sarcastic, this music is indeed a good choice for the can't-make-up-their-mind people. The newer CD is good to, but this one is a classic in my massive collection of over 500 CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are there any smokies with ears on?","review":"Excellent.

The singular purpose of the production is obvious, and possibly makes the album seem a bit shallow at times. But each song is so unmistakably beautiful, and Liesje's ethereal voice is so hypnotic, there is no denying what a powerful work this is. And of course, the programming is brilliant, and Hooverphonic hits Inhaler and 2wicky are untouchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!! Excellent!","review":"I've heard the term \\"A New stereophonic sound spectacular\\" used before in a number of Pizzicato 5 songs. Now, thanks to Hoover phonic, I know what that means. This CD would be best termed as a mixture of three genres. Trip-Hop, Electronic and sort of Rock/Alternative. They get you started with \\"Inhaler\\" which is a great electronic song with a good guitar riff in the background and then they hit you with songs such as \\"Plus Profound\\" which is an example of a song with excellent repetition. \\"Someone\\" is another standout on this CD. The fact that I love most of the songs on here, it was hard to come up with ones that I thought were standouts. I'll tell you this, I'm glad of businesses such as Amazon.com because without them, I would've never heard of this excellent CD. You see, that's the problem with Radio.

And now, Hooverphonic, who have not failed to amaze me. My love for this music has grown tremendously from listening to this album.

I had heard the samples that amazon offered and was pleased. This album though, on the con side, is a little dull. Though it is a sample of typical trip-hop, the singer's voice does get a little hazy after time. She almost makes you want to sleep. The lyrics are random and apparently not well contrived but most of the time it's just the singer speaking out the lyrics instead of singing, so it adds to the atmosphere. It is very ambient and calm, nice foggy sounds and beats, but a little monotonous. The style of the album is as its cover depicts: a little dark, dull, alone, and not quite captivating. I still gave this album a good rating because it does make one feel calmer and more relaxed. This is a good album to listen to in a dimly light living room, on the sofa, with a glass of wine, candlelight is recommended. Nothing really sticks out about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"I am really impressed with the series narrated by Howard K. Smith.

This is not just a history of war or presidents but also of technology and fashion.I'm not a fan of sound bite presentations read have five people and you rotate the room over and over and over again instead of concentrating on one person telling a total story. However, this presentation lends itself perfectly to such a presentation.Many of the facts that you hear about and read about in the 20th century seem isolated and have no relevance to other things happening. However, this series puts them in perspective. You know what is actually happening in 1936, instead of just the Olympics you know when amendments were made to the Constitution not just why. You get a new perspective on presidents and wars.You may not want to take the whole series and in one viewing but it is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been much more user friendly!","review":"Although it is a decent production, any appeal is lost here with no chapter breaks to frame the events in this huge historical review. \\"Remarkable 20th Century...\\" becomes a tedious beast to manuver through, unless you intend to watch each decade/chapter all the way through, and who does that with a reference production like this? You'll navigate to a topic,fast-forwarding/rewinding much as you would have with a VHS format...so the technological advantages of the DVD format are lost. As a reference, considering that lack of any index... not only as a menu item, but no clues on the packaging either, these discs become even more mysterious, ponderous, and disappointing.

Yes, it and the series it's part of are landmark works of lesbian fiction and it's worth the read for that reason alone. Still, that doesn't make it enjoyable. The forward by Ms. Bannon sheds a lot of light on why this book is as dark and self-loathing as this one is. Still, as I said before, it just wasn't enjoyable. It was angry and very bitter and quite sad, too. Lots of violence and very little empathy. Just a bunch of people at absolute rock bottom.

Texas Across the River is a good one.It offers campiness, fine sight gags, the oh so easy to look at Rosemary Forsythe (whatever happened to her anyway?), and good performances from Alain Delon, Joey Bishop and a host of 60's stock performers.Holding it all together is Dean Martin. Martin plays a character who is humerous, tough, perplexed and believable as the gunrunning Sam Hollis. The plot involves the competition between Martin and Delon for the charms of Forsythe with segues into a variety of subplots and comedic situations involving an Indian war party and the Cavalry.It is Martins performance that holds your attention and keeps the film from being nothing more than a series of blackouts. He is truly good in this film and it is an example of how underappreciated he has been as an actor, especially a comedic actor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!!!","review":"I have been looking to own this for years.

We wanted to be able to coordinate gas, food, restroom, overnight stops on the road without using our cell phones. We used only the FRS channels with a privacy code, since the owner's manual said GMRS channels require an FCC license. Most of the time we were within 2 miles of each other. We were also on I-95 most of the time, and rarely out of \\"line-of-sight.\\" We only lost contact one time, and we were probably only 2-4 miles apart, and possibly on opposite sides of an ov erpass.We charged the batteries each night, and never had an issue with lack of charge.We will try them on a boat trip later this month.They worked great for road trip communication.I will check into FCC licenses to see how complicated/expensive that is. It would be nice to have the 26-mile range advertised on the water when one of is in port or on a dingy.Steve B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Radio for a cruise ship","review":"I bought six of these radios for a family cruise. I couldn't be happier with our results. The batteries had plenty of power for a long day and were always fully charged by morning. This radio has three power settings, we found that the medium setting provided enought power to cover the entire ship. One can turn off the ring tone and the beep after talk tone so it is less annoying to the other travelers. There are many options that are programable and the instructions make it a simple task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge size turned us off","review":"I ordered these radios based on other great reviews, and to replace a set of Motorola radios we felt didn't last as long as they should.Upon opening the Amazon box, I was astonished to see how large these Midland radios are. Remember those old two-way radios you had as a kid? These are about the same size, and look just about as clunky!Our old Motorola units, although a bit larger than a cell phone, could easily be slipped in a pocket - there's no way in the world this Midland would fit in any pocket easily.Since we use these while working around the house, we need something small enough to easily carry.I'm returning these and looking for something a bit less bulky.Although Amazon is great, I do wish they would give dimensions on items like this - instead of just box dimensions. If I'd known the size before ordering, I definitely would have kept looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Midland GXT710VP3 Two Way Radios With26 Mile Range","review":"Be very careful of what you are buying. It says up to 26 mile range under best conditions, what it doesn't tell you is if you are on a FRS Channel that you need to be on, because the other channels are restricted by the FCC. You can not set your levels to low, medium, High. High gets max miles and low gets least miles. Your Two way radio goes to low and the most distance we have gotten from our radios is less then 2 miles. This has been very disaponting to us. We weren't expecting 26 miles but we thought 8 to 10 would be good as our daughter lives about 7 miles away from us and she and her mother were going to use them instead of their cell phones all the time.Not to much use to us with that range."},{"rating":"2","title":"midland mod. gxt710 walkie talkies","review":"this set of walkie talkies are very good, much better than the ones i had.i haven't tested them for a real long range but they work fine at 8 miles although i was elevated and had a straight shot to the one i was talking to.they also work fine anywhere in the small town i live in anywhere i've tried them and in the surrounding area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works ok","review":"We have 4 Midland walkie talkies in a group in the mountains (alps Austria)Distance of communication is very good (of cause it will not go through mountains)Think about one thing for good communication: Push the PTT button for one second before talking !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hits And More","review":"If you are looking for the hits of Billy Joel, this is the place. All of his major hits are here and in one place. There are no live cuts, no alternate takes, just song after song from one of the best musicians of the last 30 years.If you have some of his other CDs, you may quibble about some of the choices on the set. For example, I have a soft spot for \\"Leave A Tender Moment Alone\\" and that is not here. But that is minor.The 4th CD in this set is a gem, from his talks on the \\"business\\" of music, how records actually do get made. You get a feel for Joel as a person as he talks about growing up as he explains how and why he wrote songs such as Scenes, Vienna and Piano Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"If my mom loves it, then that's all I care about :)","review":"I purchased this for my mom who is a huge Billy Joel fan! She has seen him in concert so many times throughout her life (I've seen him a few times along with her). I know that every one of Billy's albums are her favorite, but I wanted to buy her a cd with most of his greatest hits so she could keep them in her car. She is very happy with this set. She loves the information in the booklet/sleeve. Her only complaint was that her all-time favorite song was missing from this collection...\\"You're My Home\\". But, luckily she has that song on another cd. :) I plan on buying this set for myself in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compilation","review":"Billy Joel has had a long and storied career as a singer. His style has morphed as his life has. This compilation of his hits spanning over 2 decades is both a tribute to his longevity and style of music. Listening to these songs gives you a great appreciation of how this style changed. From the catchy lyrics to the soulful ballads, this collection has it all. It's easy to just put a CD in the changer and get lost in the melodies that you grew up listening to. The quality of the sound from this collection is first-rate. If you are looking to follow along as a singer/songwriter matures, this is a great way to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music and interactives","review":"Music, insight and lyrics.

This collection has everything you've heard before if you're like me. It has plenty of other songs that you haven't heard too, that are great. I'd recommend this to both avid Billy Joel fans, and people who just enjoy his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this Boxset!","review":"Being a Joisey gurl i have loved Billy Joel since the early days of WNEW-FM. This compile is an absolute must for anyone interested in what he has to say and feel how only he can say it. if you want to feel his passion, feel his concern, feel his love & desire for raw life, treat yourself to many hours of enjoyment, and on the fourth disc laughter, with his woven stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Just Can't Get It Right","review":"Wow its not that hard people. What is here is good but where are Honesty and Leave A Tender Moment??? Inexcusable!!! Instead of a worthless 4th disc, just add those songs (and maybe a couple more like Miami 2017) and you'd have it right. The Essential CD is even worse!! Even with the 3.0 version you miss You're Only Human and Keeping the Faith. What a mess!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"I always loved Billy Joel and was looking for a collection of his greatest hits.

Rather than packaging his previously issued Vols. 1 and 2, which underrepresented his early hits because of LP space limitations, Columbia/Sony might have tacked on some of his other hits from the earlier era (\\"Honesty,\\" \\"Sometimes a Fantasy,\\" \\"Leave a Tender Moment Alone\\"). If they could pass off the never-a-hit \\"Leningrad\\" (undeniably a great song, however), why not the songs that actually *did* sell?Nice booklet, good package overall. Worth the investment for the fan. But it won't replace the individual studio albums in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this collection.","review":"I think this is a very good collection because it has almost all of Billy Joel's best songs and an interesting case with information about the artist, plus the fourth cd with commentary and some songs that were left off the greatest hits (cuz they weren't, they were just greatest songs). Also, I think Billy Joel is a great artist especially for his songwriting ability. If you really like him and play an instrument you should consider getting his Billy Joel Complete vols. 1 and 2. They have all his songs, I don't know how you'd say it, but like sheet music in a book. He is an excellent music writer and I have played his songs for a few years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE Billy Joel Collection to Own","review":"If you are a Piano Man fan and want to own all of Billy Joel's best music, this is a must own collection. The first 3 CD's span virtually all of his greatest hits in chronological order. The listener is then given an added treat in the 4th CD of Billy Joel doing a live \\"music business seminar\\" where he delights his fans with witty dialogue and, of course, brilliant displays of his composing and performance artistry. The set is worth the purchase just to hear him perform \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaraunt\\" and his live rendition of the Beatles classic, \\"Hard Days Night\\". Additionally this set is attractively packaged with photographs and a written biography of Billy that explains how his personal experiences affected his music. Get this CD and bask in the musical wisdom and genius of the Piano Man. Truly one of the classic greatest hits collections!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"For what this costs, if you found a good sale, you could purchase most of his albums. You would then be the proud owner of \\"Angry Young Man\\", \\"Ballad of Billy the Kid\\", \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\", \\"Miami 2017\\", \\"Honesty\\", (insert your favorite)... none of which appear here. You would also own the full-length versions of \\"Just the Way You Are\\", \\"My Life\\", \\"Pressure\\", and \\"Captain Jack\\", instead of the truncations that DO appear here. Forgive me, dear marketing/repackaging people, but I simply cannot believe that the booklet or the bonus 4th disk could possibly justify the purchase of this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic box set of all the hits, plus more.","review":"This box set is awesome. It contains the whole of his 3 Greatest Hits cds, plus a bonus disc which contains Questions and Answers recorded live at Columbia University in 1994, plus 6 previously unreleased songs. I already had the double cd \\"Greatest Hits 1 and 2\\" when the remastered edition came out, and I was going to replace it with that and also get the \\"Greatest Hits volume 3\\". But when I saw this set, I figured it was a much better buy, especially with the 4th disc that is unavailable anywhere else. Plus the 44 page book is pcked with photos, all the lyrics and an in depth essay called \\"A portrait of the artist\\" by Timothy White. A must for Billy Joel fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic collection","review":"This box set is one of the best I've seen for Billy Joel. All of his major hits are on this and it includes a liner that gives lyrics and information. If you're a Billy Joel fan, this is the collection for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling and Unnecessary","review":"What a pointless box set. Now I personally think all you need from Joel is Greatest Hits I & II, a cheap and concise package that sums up his glory days quite nicely. But even if you must have the third volume, which does have big hits like \\"We Didn't Start The Fire\\" & \\"River of Dreams\\", it is cheaper to get it seperate or even in the 'Greatest Hits I, II & III' package. This box set just adds a lot of pretty packaging, plus a fourth disc - made up of interview sound bites and some live rarities. Since this fourth CD is mostly dialogue, it is not likely to be played much either. Won't the dedicated fans already have these songs? It's a shame that they would have to shell out so much cash for three discs of stuff they already own just to get the fairly interesting bonus CD. And what casual fan would opt for such a pricey & extravaggant package, the meat of which is available elsewhere for less money? I fail to see it's relevence."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMASH THIS WALL WHILE YOU STILL CAN!","review":"These moonshiner hillbillys demolished pink floyds classic into a goofy country CD!

Only it wasn't Pink Floyd. There was some funky banjo noise, some steel guitar, and some Hillbilly singing. At first I groaned and lamented the \\"massacre\\" of classic music I grew up on.

I wonderd if the rest of the soundtrack rules this much scence the movie mostly has a score rather than HardRock in the back ground while all the action is tacking place. I bought it and for the most part was not let down.I never listend to Everlast before, but \\"So Long\\" is an awsome song. Even though it's style is not what I usually listen too. Prodigy, Korn, Rob Zombie, Stroke, and even Limp Bizket carrie out the albums highlights. I don't even like Rob Zombie that much and I hate The Limp Bizket.

Definately one of their hardest songs to date, while the new songs from \\"Korn\\" and \\"Limp Bizkit\\" are suprisingly mellower, but still solid.

I have not heard much of new GNR's music lately(with the exception of \\"Oh My God\\"), but it seems unlikely that without the help of Slash, anything memorable is quite remote.

Examples follow, in order of quality entertainment; PMM,Everlast,PM5K,Korn,Creed,Zombie,Bizkit and Prodogy(many of which have a good high energy beat). The dismal performers, and ones to skip are Eminem and GnR. The final two are so-so. I received the Matrix CD with the same order, and found that it is much more intense and energetic.

The songs that are truly his are great no doubt, but the mixes, they might not be terrible but they aren't great either. And why do his singles always have those stupid remixes anyway. You buy a single and find a hundred other remixes which all are the same except from one computerized percussion somewhere in the background. May god save you if your a fan of this guy, you feel obliged to buy everything but what do you get, only remixes. Like with the 5 different existing versions of stranger in moscow. five times the same song and 30 remixes. now wow, that's just what i wanted, NOT!!!!!

I would say that the best remix is the remix of \\"Scream.\\" The five new songs will take a while to get used to, but after that they will sound good. Some of the songs sounded a little too \\"hard core,\\" and I think Michael Jackson should try not to put as much synthetics into his songs and he should try instead to build on some of his past success. He shouldn't copy his past works, but try and continue with the style from the \\"Dangerous\\" album. This is a good album for fans of \\"HIStory,\\" but other Michael Jackson fans may find it to be a bit more \\"hard core\\" than they are used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael is good but that...","review":"The new songs are really good, nice and perfect.

The title song is such a superb dance number, stylish, groovy and with awesome beats. Don't know why he didn't put it in History album. Morphine is a great song, very creative, and sadly its tells MJ's own story as it he goes to sing \\"demerol, demerol, oh God he's taking demerol\\". Ghosts is very catchy, and MJ's has shown some of his best dance moves in its video. Is It Scary is a true gem. MJ's vocals are at their best and lyrics tell how much pain he was in due to media and ignorance of people. That time people didn't care but now if you listen it it brings tears to eyes realizing how much trouble MJ was in and no one cared. It is a haunting song.

The 5 new songs, cuts from the history album are phenomenal and then there are the remixes I must admit the only good remix on this album is the last track \\"History\\" the rest are cheap and very dated club mixes not my style! but what makes the C.D are tracks like the grungy morphine and the hip and groovy Superfly sister!Buy this C.D for the 5 new songs and if your into the club schene use the remixes thats my advice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thing of Pop","review":"Only for fans of HIStory album.

That situation created so much negative publicity for him that he had to marry Elvis Presley's daughter just to get the news media to stop talking about the sex scandal. No album he released at that time was going to have much commercial success.I am a big fan of Michael's music, but this is a throw-away piece and it was intended as such. Look at the obvious amount of effort that he has put into all of his other albums, both before and after this one.This album was damage control, plain and simple. But I still liked a couple of the tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood on the Dance Floor","review":"This review deals with Michael Jackson and a total let down of his talents.

The album consists mostly of remixed versions of songs from the HIStory album. This is the perfect album to play at clubs and serves as a great party album. It features almost 80 minutes of music, and features some of the hottest remix tracks ever put out on an album. Michael also includes several new tracks. The title song \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" kicks the album off and is a KILLER dance track. The album's finest moment is the remix of the song \\"HIStory\\". It has some of the best remixing ever put into a song. You have to hear it to belive it!

I bought it for the chou chou, but find that the Corrolle dolls like it too. It helps them sit up for doctor checkups or when \\"mommy\\" has her hands full with more than one doll, and the cloth part detaches and acts like a light weight carrier (perfect for my 3 year old).

In previous years I had read a one year devotional bible that my husband was given. We shared it. It was not \\"Catholic\\" persay, however the way it was organized was very nice. Each day it offered an old testament reading, then a new testament reading and lastly a psalms. You got a little bit of all of it each day. It was clear as to where you stopped and began each day. In the above women's devotional bible... it just starts from the beginning and randomly sticks in \\"thoughts of the day\\". I found myself wondereing where exactly I was supposed to stop reading and begin for the next day. I didn't care for how it was set up.

Her story is a stinging indictment of parenting, religion, employers, doctors, etc. as they existed and were accepted at that time.

After preordering and waiting so long for it, the movie is not at all what I was hoping for.

It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.Read his books. Avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty","review":"An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual, Dark Comedy","review":"Picked this DVD up at the library, believe it or not. Sounded interesting. Had NOT read the book, so we were able to take it at face value.My husband and I found ourselves laughing and getting into the lives of these quirky characters, even though they had very little for us to identify with. Jennifer Jason Leigh was very good, as were Mischa Barton and Bug Hall.The best part of this movie was the scenic views of Wyoming countryside. Okay, I read that it was actually filmed in Canada. But they did do a good job of presenting the natural side of their area.Overall, this was a good movie, although not in my Top 20 favorites. Worth watching, especially if you can check it out for free from the library.By the way, I know nothing about this, but apparently there is another movie (a prequel, at that) with the same characters from the trilogy by Tim Sandlin: it is called Floating Away.

I have a small living room and I did not want to move furniture around or clear a wall. You don't need to rearrange a thing when using this system. Just pull up the screen, plug in your projector and subwoofer and you are ready to go. The 80 inch screen is a great addition in this package. When you are done, you can hide the screen under a bed and hide the projector away in a closet. There are some negatives as it is not HDDVD compatible, and it does not accept component inputs. But most people will simply use it to watch regular dvds or hook up one's own video game system.

You never get bored with it, and Wyclef doesn't talk about his cars, money, etc. like most other rappers do. Finally, didn't anybody listen to Apocalypse??? It's the best song on the CD.

These turned out to be the only decent tracks on the album- and they're not even that good. The rest of the cd is a bunch of weak songs strung together with stupid off tracks which sound as if they were accidentally recorded during a midday blunt session. My advice- forget Wyclef- but check out Lauryn Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carnival Size dissapointment","review":"I bought this cd because I previously had heard some of Wyclef's songs, I thought his lyrics and voice was tight. I thought I would by it, the songs I liked in the past were drowned out by about 5 intros and about 20 songs that don't feature Wyclef (the whole reason I bought the cd).

A one word description of this album could be versatility. Where as most artists make the mistake of \\"making something for everyone\\", Wyclef made this album for himself, which keeps the theme of the album nicely focused. The appearances of John Forte, Lauryn Hill and Pras (probably the weakest, lyrically, in the group) are a bonus. Pick it up today."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, NO, NO...maybe next time Wyclef!","review":"I fail to see his rapping talents! Yes he can play the guitar, but his rappin' skillz are waaayy down!

Little did I know that it would arrive broken and the return policy for this item expired 48 hours after it had arrived at my home.

The diaper areas in the front do not hold many diapers at all. The top doesn't have a non slip grip, so the box of wipes just slides all over. PAIN IN THE REAR.

Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me.

This is an album which will surely grow on us. The vocals speak with depth and insight and the quality of the song writing is once again underpined with complex and challenging scores. Counting Crows continue to prove their musical genius; although this album is certainly more contrived than any others they have produced. The result is a diversity of emotion which keeps the audience captivated throughout, and leaves us contemplating the messages and stories within. This album may not have the instant appeal of \\"August and Everything After\\" or the live electricity of \\"Recovering Satilites,\\" but it will doubtless succeed as an enduring song-writers album and is certainly worth a look..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment","review":"this album was disappointing, after waiting for it for so long and listening to all the hype it was a let down. the music is more country-western than the counting crows i used to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Satellites and August!","review":"I was really happy the first time I heard that Counting Crows were coming out with a new CD. I picked it up, and loved it! Almost all the songs were great! (Colorblind and Mrs. Potter being the best in my opinion) However, I don't think This Desert Life is as good as August and Everything After or Recovering the Satellites. But, like me, if you are a Counting Crows fan, then you'll love the CD. In my case, I just love Adam Duritz's voice, so it was a \\"must\\" to buy this CD. Also, I heard \\"Colorblind\\" on the movie Cruel Intentions, and knew this was the CD for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy","review":"Despite what the one star folks say, this CD does grow on you. It starts out great with Hangingaround and ends with a great song (St. Robinson) similar in style to Omaha from their first one. Even the hidden bonus track is a blast. The rest of the CD goes by like a scenic highway; lots of neat stops along the way. If you like the Crows, try a group called the Push Stars. I think they're even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counting Crows score a goal on their third album","review":"The Counting Crows first album, \\"August & Everything After\\" was an excellent debut album. Their second album, \\"Recovering The Satellites\\" was a little more somber and did not contain songs that were so evidently pop. However, I felt their second album was much much solid than their first album. While their third studio album, \\"This Desert Life\\" does not stray significantly from their first two, it is a little less somber than \\"Recovering The Satellites\\". The songs \\"hangingaround\\", \\"Mrs. Potters Lullaby\\" and \\"St. Robinson in his Cadillac Dream\\" are good examples of how this album contains songs that are a little more upbeat. Overall, I feel that \\"This Desert Life\\" is a very good album, just short of great. It is good sample of what kind of group Counting Crows is shaping into."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks my Counting Crows - loving world!","review":"I guess I can vaguely understand how you might not like this cd if you are not already a Counting Crows fan, but I guess since I am a Counting Crows fan I am entitled to love it, and I do. The songs are more upbeat, in general, and you can definitely hear the R.E.M. and Van Morrison influence, which is in no way a bad thing. Basically, this album just rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crows continue to redefine themselves with This Desert Life","review":"I have to admit that on first listen to This Desert Life, I felt that my anxiety for its arrival was overstated. However, the more I listen to it, the more I realize just how good this album is. I can see that true fans will love this and those who were lukewarm to the Crows before will remain that way. I found this to be a much more technically precise album with some interesting overlapping sounds that is mostly atypical of the previous CC efforts. While this is not my favorite of their 3 albums, it is strong enough to keep me listening over and over and thirsting already for the next offering from Counting Crows. For all you nay-sayers, yes, Adam is self-indulgent and whiny as can be, but his passions cannot be denied. My recommendation? Go with it and enjoy the music, it's quality far exceeds most of the garbage being belched out by the corporate music machine, catering to the narrow-minded MTV crowd. Let's hear it for integrity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry; but I expected more:","review":"Recovering the Satelites had more hits on it than this one; the music is just not in sync as it has been with the other two; I may have been too excited & as a result was rather disapointed. For die hard fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"why have they forsaken us?","review":"i am a fan of counting crows and then they do this to me! I listened to august and everything after until it wore out then i bought another. all I wanted was some counting crows to enjoy. this is NOT COUNTING CROWS! i am so sad, i loved this band. they are pretty much the only band i listen to anymore. light a candle in memory of their greatness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst CD Yet","review":"I thought the last one was bad, but this takes the cake. Whine, whine, whine. The guy spends his time hanging out in bars and banging actresses. What's so bad about that? I would trade places with him in a second if he wasn't bald."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself some money","review":"This CD really bites. Hanginaround, though a fly tune in and of itself, is false advertising for this CD. While that tune is the crank it up, pull some tubes feel good hit of the winter, the rest of the disc drones on like a slowly dying animal. Save yourself some money and just listen to Hanginaround on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excitingly different, then more of the same!","review":"I thought for a moment I had actually heard Adam Duritz smile. I bought the CD after hearing Hanginaround and thought the Crows had decided to go a different, exciting direction in their music and not be so dark and gloomy. I listened, track 1 was great, I listened some more, track 2 (Mrs. Potters Lullabye) was also upbeat and enjoyable. And then it happened, similar to Recovering the Satellites though worse, the album went flat. The remaining eight tracks are more or less interchangeable. After two albums of angst and sorrow, its time for the Crows (or Adam since he wrote almost all of it)to go in a different direction. This Desert Life starts down that road but inevitably and predictably ends up where August and Satellites did, a dark, desolate, lonely place that 75% of the Crows songs seem to be about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album !!!!!","review":"This is a great album! The songs that really put the album together are... Oh yea The whole album is perfect!!! If your looking at this album it is a grfeat thing to buy. Can you find out why there is a big break after the song \\"St. Robinson in his Cadillac Dream\\" Well I have. I hope you find out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"in love with it","review":"i disagree with the people who say this is a poor album to start being a fan with, because when i bought this album, i was just getting into the band and i bought it at the same time as i bought august and everything after, and i didn't automatically make a comparison between the two. i just viewed them both as musically and lyrically genius albums. people thinking this desert life had to live up to a standard set by aaea are really missing out a truly great album, and i am glad i purchased it first, because then a cloud wasn't covering my eyes when i first listened to it. give it more of a chance! i know a lot of people who loved this album and it was the first crows album they ever owned. i'm now a diehard fan of everything the crows do. my favorite songs on the album are 'mrs. potter's lullaby,' 'amy hit the atmosphere,' 'all my friends,' 'high life,' and 'speedway.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent- for anyone","review":"I think the only disapointment of this CD was the fact that it only had 10 tracks(11 if you include the bonus track). I thought that this release was definately a great way to feed the CC's fans, since the band's last studio release was in '96. It was well worth the wait. The first track and single \\"HangingAround\\", is an excellent way to start the album. the last track, and my personal favorite, \\"St. Robinson and his Cadillac Dream\\" was an wonderful closer. the eight tracks inbetween are all crafted with excellent taste. Some might find it hard to get past \\"Mrs. Potter's Lullaby\\"(seven minutes and forty-six seconds), but the rest of the CD is great.if your looking for a way to spend $12.00 this it. The only thing that can top the CD is to see them in concert, which is also incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their best cd ever","review":"This is their best cd ever. All of these people who don't like it have no idea what they are talking about. If you liked the other two cds definitely get this one. Just make sure to play it loud enough so that you can listen to all of the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am glad i bought new counting crows cd","review":"just like the last cd, recovering the satellites, this one took 5 or 6 listens to grow on me. however, now that it has, i am very pleased to have bought it. it has a very good mix of the usual gloom along with a few more upbeat tunes, all of which i enjoy. is more similar to recovering the satellites than is to august and everything after."},{"rating":"1","title":"All i have to ask is: what is with the cover?","review":"I dont know much about the album, but what is with the album cover? Pink Floyd used nearly the same picture many years ago when they released \\"Wish You Were Here\\" as a single. The only difference in Floyd's cover is that there is a man and a woman with fish bowls for heads. Notice the \\"two lost souls\\" swimming in the fish bowl... get it? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a radio friendly CD","review":"OK. I'm not a die hard Counting Crows fan like some other reviewers. I bought this album based on the 1st single (\\"hanginaround\\") and my liking of August and Everything After. If you are looking for more songs like \\"hanginaround\\", forget it. The rest of the songs are much more somber and slow. Although the lyrics are good, I would also like to have a good tune to keep me going."},{"rating":"1","title":"for pop it's OK but for CC it's awful","review":"this is not the kind of music we've come to expect from the counting crows. there are no songs here to really go crazy for... it's nothing compared to the other two albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new album is like a happy version of \\"August...\\"","review":"This is a great album. I highly recommend it. It has a very Bob Dylan like sound, but as only the Crows could do it. It seems to have alot of country and Van Morrison type influences. Already one of my favorite albums that I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish","review":"I am sorry to see that Counting Crows have swiped the cover to Dave McKean's children's book masterpiece \\"The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish.\\" The book is awesome, but couldn't Counting Crows have come up with something else? How unimaginative. How disappointing. Go get the book, forget about the Counting Crows, they are so over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was that all?","review":"I had meant to write this review much earlier, i.e. right after I had rushed to buy TDL after a much too long wait for Counting Crow's new offering after two excellent albums. Need I tell you that I was dead disappointed? While \\"August ...\\" was my favourite 1994 album and \\"Recovering...\\" showed that the Crows can rock, TDL is a step in the wrongest of directions. The sound is probably meant to be \\"experimental\\" but in fact the Crows often sound like CSNY practising. Simplistic tunes (the awful \\"Hanging around\\"), childlike guitar play and repetitive choruses, combined with weakish lyrics - nowhere near as gripping as on the two previous CD's - make this a very bad buy of which \\"I wish a was a girl\\" and \\"All my friends\\" are the only recordable songs. I hope and pray this was only a provisional low before Counting Crows get a grip on themselves again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title sums it up- the album is a wasteland!","review":"Being a Crows fan, I eagerly anticipated this album. It seems the two year vacation, was more of a retirement party."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no stopping these guys...","review":"Not since the Beatles \\"White Album\\" has this reviewer listened to such symphonic bliss. The 'Crows mix of blues, rock, and classical influence has me in awe. While most mainstream bands today seem to run out of steam after their first album of two, the 'Crows just seem to get better. The reign of the Rain King, the saga of Elizabeth, the uplift intertwined with the saddness. It not only makes for an unparalleled musical experience, but it's damn fine storytelling at it's best. Keep up the good work, guys.M.J.'00"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, an excellent encore!","review":"I received this cd, after much hinting and begging, for Christmas. It was all I expected it to be and more. I have been absolutely captivated by their lyrics and folksy funk. I have been a fan of CC since August and Everything After, and have been equally impressed with both prior cds. If you buy this track, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. There is a trick to listening to CC. Listen to the cd once (the entire thing),then listen to it again. It's that second helping that does the trick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans will love it but others will remain unconvinced","review":"I didn't quite like this CD the first time I listened to it. Or the second time. But after the third spin, I was hooked; and it is a really good album. I am a CC fan and was hoping for a lot. This was a satisfying experience. Buy it.I hope CC keeps writing. I am not so interested in the lives or motivation of the band - I just like their music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This CD is by far my favorite Counting Crows recording. It has a great mix of music styles that are upbeat and fun. It is a must have for any Counting Crows fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Track","review":"THERE IS A HIDDEN TRACK on his album and it is really good. The normal 10 songs live up to expectations, and a hidden upbeat rock track plays about five or six minutes after track 10 is done. I think it is called \\"Kid Things\\". This album is more August-ish and less Recovering-ish, but a great addition to your Counting Crows collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing beats this desert life.","review":"Counting Crows are eclipsed by no one. Their lyrics and their music are out of this world. When you listen to this album you will find yourself drawn in by the emotion and the feeling. No other band in the world can write music quite like Adam Duritz can. From 'Hanging Around' all the way through to 'Kid Things', the hidden track, you find yourself taken through the thoughts of a genius mind and love it. Stand out tracks are 'I Wish I Was a Girl' and 'Amy Hit the Atmosphere'. I am seeing them live on March 2nd at the Forum in London and I strongly recommend that you do too. Wherever you can get a ticket for ,then go. Because seeing them live is the ultimate top off to 3 great albums. If you cant see them live then just buy 'Across the Wire - Live in New York' because that is as close as you will get to it. All Counting Crows fans should already have this, so if you know one then dont just take my word for it. Ask them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read my review and say that you like it","review":"Don't get me wrong, I have been a fan for a long time, but there is something lacking in this album. I gave \\"This Desert Life\\" four stars because although the actual number of good songs is lower than some of the previous albums, the quality of the good songs is very high. In other words, there aren't too many brilliant songs, but I love the ones that are. In particular I like High Life, but then I have my reasons. If you don't agree with me that's okay - each to their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to form","review":"August And Everything After was a very good album, Recovering The Satellites was a huge disappointment, This Desert Life represents a return to form but a change in sound - brighter, quirkier songs and more piano. My favorite song? - Mrs. Potter's Lullaby."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album takes a more ubeat twist","review":"It seems as though This Desert Life while still maintaining the poetic and deeply scaring lyrics of Adam Durtiz accompanied with the emotional guitar and piano solos takes a more posetive spin. Has Adam learned to deal with life's continued kick in the shorts?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to top form...","review":"A real slow burner, This Desert Life is an improvement on Recovering The Satellites...but give it a chance!On first appraisal TDL is very disappointing, the sound of Duritz churning out the same emotions as if on auto-pilot. After a few plays, however, it reveals its true spirit, akin to August and Everything After, and running it damned close for true brilliance.In reality, it's the two most upbeat tracks, Hangin' Around and St Robinson in his Cadillac Dream, that are the drawbacks. They sound tagged on and lukewarm and it would have worked better without them. That said, everything else is classic Counting Crows.Particular favourites are High Life, Colorblind and the staggering live favourite Speedway, which is incredibly emotional and begs out for a repeat of the chorus, but still hits very hard.A must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am definitely a counting crows fan and looked forward to this cd, but was disappointed after one time through. Most of the songs sound so similar to the fist 2 cds that it's hard to be excited about something new. I'm actually surprised to read all the favorable comments. If you like routine and familarity, you will like this cd. Also, seemed short, 10 songs...maybe it's just me...and the bonus song to me wasn't really a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus Track","review":"Don't stop listening to this CD after St. Robinson in his Cadillac Dream. There's an unlisted bonus track after about 1:30 of dead air. IT'S GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best effort by the Crows","review":"I've always liked the Counting Crows, and I have most of the CDs, and when this album came out I was suprised how muched I liked it. On the surface it's very similar to other Crows albums, but this one has a different energy behind it that make it better to listen to it the more you here it. The 1st track is the type of song you listen to when you get up in the morning and it puts you in a great mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"POETRY","review":"The first time I listened to \\"August and everything After\\" I cried. When I listened to \\"Recovering Satillites\\" I did the same. \\"This Desert Life\\" was an addition rather than an exception to that rule. The new album is wonderful. It has the most important component of all CC songs, and that is the ability to touch you somewhere deep in side. The lyrics and the music and the sheer power of are astonishing, as are the previous 2 albums. I think that you either love this band, or you hate it. Duritz's voice either makes you want to scream or to cry. As long as I keep crying, then I will continue to be a fan. It is very rare to own 3 albums by a band and honestly say that you love every song. In the case of CC though, it is true. At least for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"I WAITED TO BUY THIS AT A DISCOUNTED RATE, BUT WHEN I FINALLY LISTENED TO IT I REALIZED WHAT I HAD BEEN MISSING. THIS ALBUM IS GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Keep Hoping...","review":"That CC will put out another CD with the freshness and variety of the first, and I continued to be VERY disappointed. Recovering the Satellites was a major setback and this CD, although a noticeable improvement over that is still a far cry from the debut.Were these guys a \\"One CD-Wonder\\"?Flash-in-the-Pan?I think so. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kris B I Agree","review":"All I can say is that the first review from Kris B says it all. If you understand good music you will like this Album. It is hard to find better songwriting out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"rock responsibly","review":"The Crows' third studio album finds them settling at last into the comfy, riskless limbo where too many roots bands end up. If it lacks the townhome bluesisms that make an Edwin McCain so dreary, it's awash in the languor of talented musicians who are quite content to make languor sound appealing (decorate dull songs with sweet sounds; repeat as required). The interesting thing is that it's no longer singer Adam Duritz who drags them down -- he's less cloyingly earnest than ever. But his lyrics always need musical bolstering to keep from sounding self-obsessed, and this time they don't get it. \\"I Wish I Was a Girl\\" is melodramatic enough, but the songs about us staying and our friends going away never get anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"this album is worth owning just for \\"Mrs. Potter's Lullaby\\". that is really the only song i listen to on a regular basis. not that the other songs are bad. \\"wish i was a girl\\", \\"hangin around\\", \\"amy hit the atmosphere\\", \\"all my friends\\", \\"St. Robinson\\". those are all good songs. but no single song of the counting crows on this CD or any other comes close to the tranquil cloudchasing existence of Mrs. Potter's. the words are outstanding, and the music is simple in a way. but the more you start to listen to it, the more intense it becomes. the whole album is rather like that actually.defintely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Desert Life is Not too Shabby","review":"After a small disappointing turn in \\"Recovering the Satellites\\", I found the latest edition of the Counting Crows saga, \\"This Desert Life\\" to be the charm the third time around. From the loosy-goosy melody in \\"Hangin'around\\" to the descriptive narrative throughout \\"Mrs. Potters Lullaby\\" to the great melody in \\"All My Friends\\", this CD is a great improvement above the previous album. Adam Duritz rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crows Fly Again","review":"There are moments of absolute brilliance. \\"Mrs. Potter' Lullaby\\" and \\"I Wish I Was\\" contain Duritz's best lyrics to date. \\"Four Days\\" sounds like 'The Cure' with a guy who can actually sing. \\"Speedway\\" contains that brutal self-critique we've seen in Duritz before ie 'Perfect Blue Buildings'.He loses me a bit with 'Colorblind,' which is dull musically and a case study in self-absorption. There is a difference between self-analysis and self-pity, and Adam crosses the line on occasion.But in full, this is a terrific album. Not many 90s bands will be remembered twenty years from now. The Crows are one of the few who will survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent album from a band who keeps getting better","review":"\\"This Desert Life\\", the newest album from The Counting Crows, seems to bring together everything that fans love about the band, Adam's dense, and incredibly meaningful lyrics, a multitude of instruments, and some wonderful harmony all have a chance to showcase themselves. Old themes, like 'Anna' and 'Maria' surface again, and are joined by 'Amy'. My overarching impression of this album as compared to the others is much happier. 'August and Everything After' seemed to swirl around losing yourself by making yourself a household name. 'Recovering the Satellites' was very dark. 'This Desert Life' is more upbeat, and had (to my ears at least) hints of CSNY (see 'Four Days')and the Black Crows (see 'Kid Things', the bonus track). I am hoping that the band will keep experimenting with musical styles (they cover a LOT of ground here), and instrumentation in the future. All in all, a wonderful album for CC fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Recovering the Satellites","review":"This is a really great album, although I don't believe the Crows will ever top August and Everything After. There is definitely some great stuff on here, like Hangin Around, Mrs Potter's Lullaby, and All My friends. Better than the last album. These guys are one of the few new groups out there to actually put out quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"it just keeps getting better","review":"It is so refreshing to hear new music from a band that lives life in order to write their art. There are so many bands that sing anything with words, but the words of Counting Crows are chosen carefully. They are beautiful, with tunes to match. With this third original album, Adam Duritz has grown out of just his soft, sad songs into hits like hanginaround and I wish I was a girl. If you liked any of the earlier albums, you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admit it. This CD is awesome and you know it.","review":"First of all, don't knock Adam's whining. He just gets emotional. Wouldn't you if you were singing about St. Peter and his Cadilac? Oh yes, that IS the best song on the disk, next to Mrs. Potter, which I'll admit is a little on the long side, but it gets away with it. Second of all, for all of you who have questions about the CD COVER: It's taken from a children's book called, The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, which is a great book to read to your local 2nd grader. I think it's a nice touch. This CD is in the same spirit of the previous two disks, but it's a bit more uplifting than the last one. Check out the hidden song off #10."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Desert Life mixes great ballads with great upbeat songs","review":"The Counting Crows disappoint nobody as they realease another incredible album. The CD has some of the slow ballads the band is known for, such as Amy Hit the Atmosphere and Colorblind. It also contains some great upbeat songs like St. Robinson..., I Wish I Was a Girl, and All My Friends in addition to the first single, Hangin' Around. The CD is a must buy. The best ever...since August."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Desert Life lives up to Crows' standards","review":"Counting Crows deliever once again with this awesome new disc that completely lives up to the high standard set by the previous three studio albums. \\"Colorblind\\"; \\"Mrs. Potter's Lullaby\\"; and \\"hanginaround\\" stand out as the best tracks...excellent release and a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD but has a few R.E.M.-like songs","review":"A great CD, especially \\"Four Days\\" and \\"Amy Hit The Atmosphere\\" but \\"Mrs. Potter's Lullaby\\" sounds too similiar to R.E.M.'s \\"(Don't Go Back To)Rockville\\" and \\"Four Days\\" has the jangly R.E.M. sound. That aside, a very good CD, much like the first 2. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a culmination of many years of playing together","review":"The latest album from Counting Crows shows the bands ability to play live and make a killer studio album. The album sounds like a combination of the band's two previous albums. Five stars, go buy this album right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back the \\"August...\\" vibe.","review":"If you are a Crows fan left a little less than satisfied with \\"...Satellites,\\" then this album is what you've been waiting for. After \\"Hanginaround,\\" the songs settle into that moody vibe that permeated throughout \\"August...\\" Every song is a standout. I couldn't skip ahead or back through three full listenings. Duritz's vocals are beautiful and understated. This is the album I expected three years ago and am glad to see, after the overly electric \\"...Satellites,\\" the band is back to the kind of mellow rock that made their debut a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true masterpiece!","review":"The long expected album was totally worth the wait. Adam Duritz and the rest of the band are real storytellers. They are a shining light in a music business, where everyone tries to go with the trend. Their songs are as melodious as timeless. Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a big Counting Crows fan: I loved their first cd and I think their second cd was also good. Their live double album was great, full of emotion, and made me more interested in their music than before. So I was really excited to hear this, their latest album, knowing I'd love it. Well after listening to it, trying to like it (really trying!), I realized that it just didn't stack up to August and Everything After and Recovering the Satellites. While I must note that the Counting Crows are rather brave for creating a new sound, a very different, jazzy-style sound, I don't think they needed to sacrifice their lyrical strength for it. I do think that the new sound is somewhat catchy. However, I'm not sold on it, and I think that they seem to have lost their knack for great lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Convert","review":"Working my way backwards as one not familiar with the Counting Crows until this release, I find the album exciting. The two songs that prompted me to buy the album, Hangin' Around and All My Friends, blend wonderfully with the rest of the selections. There is not one song on the CD that I do not enjoy. In fact, the more I listen to the CD the more I get out of it. The vocals are so highly emotive, very unlike what I grew up on in the '70's. Although I have no idea who Mrs. Potter is, I listen to the song to try to understand! In fact, the lyrics on all the songs are such that the depth is appreciated the more I listen. Having had this CD for almost three months and not being tired of it, I have decided to acquire their other recordings; in effect, working my way back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing singer songwriter selfish attitude folk rock.","review":"Not even David Lowery (Producer/Cracker Frontman) could help this sinking ship. The band's musical intentions are good, but again, the selfish-singer-songwriter mentality takes over this project. How many times Adam are we suppossed to feel sorry for you because you're famous and aimless? The lyrics are pathetic and full of \\"rain\\" references, again. I really wanted to enjoy this, but it's heartless, boring, and whiny. Wah, wah. I feel sorry for the band, not you Adam. Take up rent with Mr. Vedder, you two belong on Broadway. Long Live Jeff Tweedy! The 90's smartest gifted songwriter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill all the way.","review":"The 1st album was great. The 2nd album was above average. This, the 3rd album is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars if I could","review":"This band, along with Hootie and Dave Mathews, has killed alternative. Alternative used to mean punk and keyboards. It used to mean non-corporate/underground bands that didn't sound like everyone else. Now it means a whining wussie folk music. This band's career has gone one \\"wayee wayee wayee too long.\\" And how dare they defile Dave McKean's wonderful art by putting it on the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing: broken promises.","review":"After two great works (three, if you include the auto celebrative Live) CC's totally failed to reach the target. No rythm, no passion, no emotion: please, Adam & C, don't listen to the syrens and come back to what you are, a great simple pop group. Next chance will be the last one, I believe, to understand if CC's are history or dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found this CD in my son's computer","review":"In December '07, I pay a visit to my grandsons in New Jersey and I found a strange song in the computer of my son. The title: \\"St. Robinson in his Cadillac dreams\\" of Counting Crows and........I like it. I collect LPs and CDs of popular music from 1960 from USA and United Kingdom. For me is the only song of this CD that I recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a star","review":"Sorry to spoil the party, but this cd is like Counting Crows trying to be like Counting Crows."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Desert Flop","review":"The sad clown act has worn thin on many fans of their first album. The Crows follow Recovering the Satelites with another sad sack, depressive, no punch compliation. This may be their last album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss this album!","review":"I too had this album on LP when it came out. It was one of my favorites of that era. Very different from her earlier stuff. (Despite the greatness and my affinity for her early stuff, my favorite of all time of hers is the \\"Hey Now Hey\\" album, which I also have on CD.)

These men of the German Luftwaffe were truly heroes and men of steel. They served with valor and patriotism, although misplaced they worked harder than any other service in the military. They were only taken out of service by injury or death. This is unlike the American pilots who were for the most part taken out of flight service after a very few number of mission.

It comes with a matching wall transformer and a jumper wire to connect any other headphone output to this system. If they say it charges an Ipod, it's a lie. I tested the I-Pax to see if it charged my Shuttle, and it did NOT charge the Ipod with any combination of settings. Otherwise, it is a nice sounding speaker system with a unique feature that sonically makes the speakers seem like they are 3 or 4 feet apart, producing very good stereo effect. The I-Pax can also run on 4 AA batteries to be completely portable. The I-Pax has a lot of volume and uses a tuned reflex port to boost the low end responce. I like the I-Pax sound better than the I-Sound dock, but it costs more and takes up more space. The I-Pax also has a nice storage area between the speakers for earphones, wires, etc. It's a nice little unit with no reliability issues since we got it.FGS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable sound","review":"Just as the 5 stars said.

Ugh!","review":"This book is a waste of time, a waste of space, and a waste of money. Demonstrates amazing ignorance about the places and people she visits, and arrogantly assumes the right to make judgements about things she clearly does not understand. People who've lived in the areas she bikes through, especially those who've done any work relating to AIDS or women's issues, have an involuntary gagging reflex whenever someone mentions this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"This is an unusually well-written and consistently interesting travel narrative. The author does come across as a tough old crow at times. (I can't imagine why she feels entitled to sneer at hikers who use the Lonely Planet guide.)

Alas, the great man has no knack for philosophical allegories. In this numbingly symbolic tale, a smug clam named Columbus (get it? He's on a voyage of self-discovery) meets a clam named Agape (get it? Love helps us make those discoveries) who helps him understand his limitations. I kid you not. The story is actually about clams trying to look beyond familiar confines and open up to the greater world. Or something.There are plenty of strained metaphors (Columbus refers to \\"The Book of Clams,\\" a thinly-disguised stand-in for the Bible), long digressions in which Columbus ponders his state in life and what it's all about, and tortured quahog jokes. Whatever Templeton's trying to say, it just isn't working.

This is the first baseball book in ages that I haven't felt compelled to finish -- and I'm a Cubs fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"I grew up as a Cub fan. I've changed loyalties since the late 70's, but the Cubs of Claerbaut are still my heroes. This book, however, is the WORST I've ever read on any topic. As a history teacher of 31 years I've read somewhere in the vicinity of 1,000 books. Never have I seen a tome that has had as many incorrect spellings, botched facts, inane analyses, and poor writing style. I now regret having had my wife lovingly dish out my hard-earned money for this literary trainwreck. She could have gotten me a highlight tape of the '69 Mets and it would not aggravate me as much.Here and now I'm warning any Bruin-backer (as Claerbaut would label him) to save his cash, keep an eye on ESPN CLassic, and have the patience to wait until Leo's era in Chicago is profiled.After all, if a Cub fan has been waiting 57 years for another pennant, he can bide his time a little longer for a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Joy","review":"I read a lot of books and am pretty critical. Sports books are often badly written. Not this one. When you see the hysteria surrounding Wrigley Field whenever the Cubs are in the hunt, you need only read this fast-moving book to realize how it all began.The modern Cubs are the sons of Durocher's Cubs--Ron Santo, Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, and of course, Leo \\"The Lip\\" Durocher. The soap opera of those on-the-edge-of-your-chair years is wonderfully captured in the pages of Claerbaut's book.Even better, the book is so up-to-date. Its analysis of why this great team didn't win is something everyone from Billy Beane to Dr. Phil would have been proud of.History comes alive here. This book is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book","review":"This is really an excellent book. It captures all the excitement of the period and provides real answers to why this team came up short. It's terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durocher's Cubs makes its point OVER AND OVER AND OVER","review":"Durocher's Cubs is a pretty good book analyzing the Cubs best years. However at times I felt like I was reading a media guide and not a book. He proves time and time again that Durocher was not the same manager as he was compared to his years in Brooklyn by giving us countless game situations. He goes into too much detail about Durocher's childhood and demons that he faced. All of us have our demons but the author treats these as the only reason the Cubs couldn't win. If I remember correctly, Durocher never threw a pitch, swung a bat, or threw a ball that year. For a better Cub history book, read The Chicago Cubs: The Million to One team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"In the 14 years of building a CD collection (over 1200 titles so far), I never managed to locate a decent \\"Neil Sedaka Greatest Hits\\" compilation that covered both his ORIGINAL RCA Hits and the later ones on the Rocket Label (Queen of 1964, etc.). Browsing thru your web site I came across this title which looked like it was what I was looking for. So I made the plunge and purchased the Double CD. But I was totally disappointed. Most, if not all, the titles are Re-Recordings! Good re-works I must admit, but NOT the orignals. A shame and a pity no details to the content were available.

However, it was a huge let down. It did not include any of the same characters from the first 2 books, so I am not sure why it is considered a part of the trilogy other than the fact that it had a business similar to what was in the first two. It did not have much of a plot line and the characters were very flat, unlike the ones I came to love in the first two books. The only reason that I read the whole book was to see if it got any better or if any of the past characters showed up - neither happened. The first two books of this trilogy are wonderful, but don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Promise With Plenty of Problems","review":"This book is a great resource for those interested in architecture in Los Angeles, but it has MAJOR problems. Not only are the maps inaccurate about 50% of the time (wrong intersection, wrong place along a street, or just plain wrong), but I have also found several listings for which the street address is wrong, including one for which the wrong street name is given. I have also searched for buildings only to realize that they have been demolished. While Los Angeles has gone through a lot of changes in the last few years, several of the buildings on question were demolished before this edition came out. So if you going to use this book to discover architecturally significant buildings, bring along a good map, a great sense of direction and allow plenty of time, you're going to need all of those to overcome the mistakes made by the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practicing what she preaches","review":"Within this very credible work of scholarship Dawn has not shied away from her own faithful testimony of our own power's coming to an end in weakness. This is a prayerful study, a humble study, and, consequently, a powerful study of the vocation of the Church in the world. This book has opened my eyes to some of my own violation of that true calling. This is the work of a balanced scholar and sister in the Lord. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously disappointing waste of money","review":"I did not ever think I would have to give any book a single star and if zero stars had been possible it would have qualified. But I guess the bibliography is worth a star. The text certainly isn't. The book deals only with a tiny portion of the material and then does it embarrassingly badly. There is also absolutely nothing new in the book but is merely a collection of information available in old works with little understanding of recent work. I suspect that the author does not know much about Buddhism, let alone Buddhist architecture - but it is hard to tell because neither topic is to be found in this book. If you want to spend a small fortune (look at the price!) on a half way adequate bibiliography that you could easily put together in a day or so of basic research, fine. But is you want a book on Buddhism, on Buddhist architecture, or on Buddhist architecture in Gandhara, forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"first rate","review":"I enjoyed this original and highly readable work enormously. Through its reliance on facts and logic, it makes a compelling case against the victim mentality of radical feminism. The author shows females to be as capable as males of making the choices most consistent with their interests and values--and that these often (though not always) differ between the sexes for reasons best explained by the science of evolutionary psychology.I share the concern echoed by other reviewers regarding the bizarre comment submitted by a \\"reader from Northeast USA.\\" Any reasonable person who has read one of Kingsley Browne's many papers or heard him speak at conferences on evolutionary law will realize that his only agenda is to call the facts and their policy implications as he sees them. This is a scholarly agenda--unlike anonymous ad hominem attacks, a classic tactic of those whose agenda is truly political in nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"evolutionary theory gone wrong","review":"I would really recommend reading books on evolution by people who know how to apply the theory, and that would be scientists. Mr. Browne is a law professor who clearly opposes certain discrimination laws and thus has his own motives and bias in the subject. I doubt his credibility in understanding and applying evolutionary theory, especially since these days many people assume they are experts in the subject without having the proper credentials."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Point of View","review":"If you're interested in a different point of view on this subject, this books offers much to think about. Today, it's very difficult to find readily available information on this subject that is not politically correct. So, if you'd like to see what might be on the other side of the \\"Glass Ceiling,\\" I'd read this very short book. The best argument I can make for reading this book is to read the ad hominem arguments made by the other reviewers; that's what made me buy it and I'm glad I did.

It also doesn't come with cup holders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller for young babies","review":"This stroller is fun and easy to push. The fabric is stylish and it goes great with the companion car seat. My concern is that my 12-month old reaches the foot rest, and he fills the tiny seat. This is a great stroller for a young baby, but don't plan to use it for a 2-year-old.It is rather heavy, and folding takes two hands. It's rather difficult to get it folded without scraping it on the ground. The sunshade is small but you can buy an add on. So, just be aware that while the stroller itself works great, if you need to fold and unfold it a lot, or if you have a toddler, this is not the best choice.Overall, though, I look forward to a walk with the baby each day with this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOPE","review":"Computer only reads one of the for ports.

Brimming with memorable passages and unforgettable characters, it is a well worthwhile read. But what is Charles Portis trying to say with this novel? Perhaps that \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same?\\" Possibly \\"you can't teach an old dog new tricks\\"?

This sounds like hyperbole. It is short; there is very little in the way of plot; the characters do not develop in any way: yet the book is as engaging and entertaining as anything I have ever read. Before embarking on my second reading (just a fortnight after I finished my first) I planned to write down my favourite lines from the book.

Like all Portis' books, Dog of the South is laugh-out-loud funny, and the prose is so fluid it gives me the feeling it was rendered without much effort. That's what I mean when I say Portis hides in the light. You can't tell how good it is because it feels so natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I loved this book.

I was left feeling that most of the individuals needed way to much to relate their less than interesting and extensive backgrounds to Midge. The dialogues and realizations ostensibly from a sense the character is either inebriated, drug imbued or just plain dumb. The non-sensical aspect of some of the conversations are maddening.This may have made sense relating to this time period that brings about a curiosity in the reader that soon wears off, It just gets hard to deal unless you like to swim around in a philosophical molasses of individuals that gets you there eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"abe simpson is much funnier","review":"many reviews state how hilarious this book is -- even several on the jacket cover.try as i may, i didn't find myself laughing.lots of long pointless rambling monologues that are much funnier when provided by abe simpson.i give it two stars because he does manage to capture dialogue very well (rambling and aimless as it may be).the story is pointless - but the joke may be on us.maybe portis' goal was to write a rambling tale about nothing just to see how many of us would actually finish the story awaiting something to actually happen. and then laugh when he read the glowing reviews.jerry seinfeld would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know what I was supposed to be appreciating","review":"I think I would've enjoyed this book more if I had known that I was supposed to be appreciating the goofy characters that Ray Midge encounters and not necessarily Midge's attempt to track down his cheating wife. The point of the book is certainly not the plot. Make sure you understand this before you start reading it.The first half of the book, when Midge is hot on the trail to Mexico in pursuit of his wife and her boyfriend, was my favorite part of the book. Probably because it is before he gets bogged down in Belize. At that point, the book transitions from plot-based to character-based. Since I mistakenly got too focused on the plot, the book stagnated and became boring.Since I had already read True Grit, which was plot-based all the way through, I was expecting more of the same. As such, I was disappointed with this one. Maybe it will take reading it again to fully appreciate its strengths. Until then, it was fairly \\"meh\\" to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portis puts Shakespeare in the S____house ....","review":"Charles Portis is the greatest author of our time.

Pure nitro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I ordered this book based on the reviews I read, and was forced to conclude that either my copy originated from another planet, or my taste is radically different. Portis picks a milieu rich with possibilities (the pursuit of a runaway wife from the American south to Mexico and Honduras) and proceeds to imbue it with a rambling, inane collection of dialogues and reflections that are tedious and uninteresting. Though he does a reasonable job of character development, there is not a single one that drew me in, or piqued my interest in any way. Only one thing amazed me...I can't believe I finished it. I guess I kept hoping there would be some redeeming quality. That needle remains in the haystack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone must read this book","review":"This is the funniest American novel since Twain.

The live quality is excellent. This is the reunion concert of the first band to perform at the original Woodstock. They had the potential to impact and change the direction of music in their day. The tragedy that struck this band with Nanci's car accident not only affected her and the band but we all lost out too. When you listen to this CD it's hard to believe this band just got together again after 30 years of being apart and out of music. They can still ROCK with the best of them and do. They were ahead of their time in many ways. If you want to learn more about what happened to end their rise to fame before their time see the video \\"Sweetwater a True Rock Story\\". ...If you are a fan of Sweetwater, Woodstock, the 60s and early 70s; if you are music history buff or just want to experience some darn good, new to you, but still Classic Rock, check out this CD. It is really cool. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fish or fowl?","review":"The original Sweetwater stood out as a rock-fusion band without a guitarist, the only one of their era. This reunion gig has taken on a guitarist with a heavy, dominating sound, so it doesn't really sound like Sweetwater.

But after examining it in the movie, I'm pretty disgusted. Since when did Jango have Slave I's engine pod on his back? It's absolutely huge and unwieldy by even the strongest of hunters! And the role of this huge clunky hunk of plastic? To play horribly regurgitated ideas of what sounds Fett made in the movie. And sort of like Kamino and Final Battle Jango, this thing is removable, but makes Jango hollow at the torso.

You wouldn't believe how just one line sung in that moose voice can ruin a song. Also, the songs aren't as peppy as the ones on Cow Tunes.

The original Baldur's Gate alone will take hours and hours to complete. Add to this the expansion Tales of the Sword Coast, and you have a game that will take you months to complete (unless you do nothing but play video games, then it may only take you a few weeks to complete). The storyline is really good, and the graphics, although now dated, are still very good. I enjoy the over-the-top view that this game offers, rather than the first person view of some other games. The only game I have ever played that offers the first person/over the shoulder view that works well is Morrowind.Needless to say, pick this game up and enjoy the old school RPG at its best.Overall = Excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"This is a great game. Its an epic and engrossing adventure. Its one of the best RPG's of all time. If you like RPG's you cannot go wrong with this game.You start out as a level 1 character (you get to pick among all the base AD&D; 2nd edition character classes) and you have to work HARD to gain a level. By the end of the game you will be lucky to get to level 7 and every level you advance is a real accomplishment. This is not a Diable style hack and slash, it requires and incredible amount of strategy, tatics, long term planning, and plain good luck.This is a classic AD&D; game that comes as close as the computer can to the tabletop experience. You get drawn in and truly feel like your a part of this world as you play. You'll lose a lot of sleep over this game. Buy it and enjoy!

The battles are the most awful thing, the characters are the ugliest thing, the gameplay just makes you want to hit your head with the CDs and the box of Baldur's Gate and throw up on it.

His throaty growl shapes these songs about the street, the mixture of the sacred and profane, and the everyday downtrodden in loving, if occasionally jaded, ways. The songs themselves are eminently accessible and listenable. His lyrics are genuinely moving (\\"Everybody Looks Good at the Starting Line,\\" \\"Downtown Babylon\\") and poignant (\\"Mission Temple Fireworks Stand,\\" \\"Rise Up\\") and wear their heart on their sleeve nicely (\\"I'm a Lucky Man\\"). He really seems to have something spiritual (not religious) to say without taking the easy or preachy route (Ain't Livin' in Sin No More,\\" \\"Nothin' But the Devil\\"). The musicianship is superb, reminiscent of the snap of a good Hiatt or McClinton CD, but Thorn has his own voice and style even in his given genre, a rare find in this dime-a-dozen musical climate. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty And Nuanced, Yet Poignant","review":"\\"Mission Temple Fireworks Stand\\" is one of Paul Thorn's masterpieces. From the quirky artwork (by Thorn himself) to the oddball mix of country, blues, rock, and comedy intrinsic in the music itself, this CD is hard to beat.I have always liked Thorn, and especially his peculiar offbeat funny songs full of comic hostility (\\"Burn Down The Trailer Park\\" is the best example). This CD not only gives the listener some more conventional pop-like songs, but several original alternative comedy songs full of both broadside humor and subtle nuance, the best example being the title track. This CD has really earned its five stars, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"When life hits you like a truck... listen to Paul Thorn!","review":"I first heard Paul a year ago and was hooked.

The mysteries are somewhat formulaic but an appealing cast, led by the very handsome Yannick Bisson as the stoic and cerebral Murdoch, keeps things moving.

This is a wonderful production from Canada that few seem to have heard of but is unforgettable once you do. Set at the turn of the century, Murdoch is a Renaissance man of his day with interests that extend the gambit from religion to electricity and beyond. With one of the best casts I've seen in awhile, this group of police officers and a pathologist meet some pretty amazing people; from Arthur Conan Doyle to Nikola Tesla, Buffalo Bill and his Western show to Houdini. This is the second season, so if you haven't watched the first I'd suggest checking that out first. While the price is kind of steep (this from someone who buys BBC Mystery sets), these shows are of a quality that is rare to find in mystery series. If you are a mystery lover, I strongly urge you to get to know Murdoch and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murdoch evolves","review":"Writers have improved in second season, but dialogue remains stilted.

So we just help them along withthis rule...giving each child a chance to win a tile...Also I would recommend that an adult or older responsibleperson help with this game...the tiles are a bit hardto put back and if little ones are trying by themselvesthey won't have success with this part of the game andif they are rough on things they could break it...SOHAVE AN OLDER RESPONSIBLE PERSON HELP.Overall, I think it is great and I am glad I purchased this forthem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for sight word learning","review":"My son and I love this game.

It's a quiet game that requires no batteries - yeah! My 2 year old loves to play but can't play quickly. He is learning to identify things that are the same. It keeps the players on their toes to be the first one to get \\"Zingo.\\" After 2 weeks, this gift continues to be played daily. My son has now asked to give it to his friends for birthday gifts. I highly recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids struggling with speech","review":"My son has a speech disorder. This game is fun and also allows him to practice his speech.

However both of my kids, ages 5 and 7, love Zingo. They are finally playing a game nicely... together!

It was a hit on Christmas night with the grandparents too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages!!","review":"This game is fun for all ages.

Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zingo for a 5 year old BOY!","review":"Zingo is like Bingo with pictures instead of numbers. My grandson liked it at first and so did I, however by the third game he was ready to turn the cards over to the harder sides, was ready to play two cards at the same time, plus two cards for me, plus two cards for his teddy bear--all at the same time. The tiles, while very durable, must be loaded into a gadget--a timeconsuming, no fun chore that will be left to the parent or older child. And it is harder the bigger fingers you have. I like this as an alternate game, but not if you only just want to buy one to refresh your game stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy it!","review":"I'm 38 and have a 4 year old daughter. She constantly wants me to play with her and sometimes I dread playing because the games for her age group are so dang boring. This is one game I actually enjoy playing and although it's a game of chance (more then skill) she almost always wins, which makes it one of her favorites too. It takes up little space on the shelf and the game (and the box) is very sturdy. This is the type of game you can give away or sell when your kid outgrows it because it won't show wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Yelling and Gabbing Game","review":"It's hard to put the plastic chips into the dispenser slot.

She and her 4-year-old sister love to play this game daily!! Now I am buying more to give as birthday gifts to friends/family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick fun game of speed and recognition","review":"There isn't a lot to this game, but its fun when you are looking for just a quick game without too many rules.As my daughter gets more confident in her reading, I've been revealing only the word, not the picture, so she has to quickly read it to see if one of the cards is a match.When played in a group, it can get a bit aggressive with kids all grabbing frantically at the same time and potentially scratching each other. When playing with older kids, we institute a \\"lose a turn\\" penalty for grabbing a tile you didn't need, to cut down on any craziness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for many ages.","review":"This game has been surprisingly fun! Finally a game that my 4 year old and my 8 year old can play together on an equal playing field. It does take luck more than skill to be successful at this game but it helps to have a quick eye- in that way, it is only mildly competitive, so it's good for preschoolers who are working on being good losers. No reading required. Would be good for autistic or other special needs kids- as it is mostly picture matching, no language, and the directions are simple. Also, this would be a good game for grandparents to have at their house, it is compact and the fun doesn't soon run out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit with the grandchildren!!","review":"This game keeps both my 4 yr old and 5 yr old grandchildren interested.

You won't be sorry.","review":"I was looking for a new game (I've just about had it with Candyland) and bought this based on therecommendations of others.

How can you beat that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get her to stop playing","review":"I don't know what it is about Zingo, but it appears to be one of those games that kids just can't stop playing. My three-year-old is obsessed with it. (And when I need to punish her, I can threaten to take it away.) She's actually quite good at it, and I think the cleverly constructed (and simple) tile dispenser adds to her fun.Now, if I could only find another game like this for Christmas ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game for my 4 year old & 7 year old","review":"I purchased this game for my 4 year old and he really loves it. To my surprise, his 7 year old sister loves it as much as he does. There are few games that they both enjoy, and this one hits the mark! Great game for family night and it's also been a go-to game for play dates. I highly recommend Zingo."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kids' Favorite game!","review":"My 4.5 year old daughter and 2.5 year old son love this game - they play it together all the time. I like that it works well across the age span. Each loves to take their turn dispensing the tiles and the older one often helps out the younger when he's not so quick to notice a tile that matches his card. I agree with another reviewer -- it would be better if the tiles were printed on both sides for ease of reloading. But my kids have found that they like to reload while they're playing, but putting any non-matching tiles right back into dispenser on the spot. This makes for much easier clean up at the end of the game. Definitely recommend this game!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I couldn't believe that my 2 and half year old son played this game with my 6 year old nephew and my 4 year old nephew. They loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids of all ages","review":"Length:: 0:30 MinsThis is a children's game modeled on Bingo but adults enjoy playing, especially if they are grandparents.

This was the first family game we played when my daughter was not yet three and my son was almost 2 (he was the \\"dealer\\"). We've been playing it ever since! My kids are now 4 1/2 years old and 3 years old and they play this every day. Its a game I enjoy playing as well so that's why I gave it 5 stars. We don't have the math version yet but I will eventually get it. My sister's family has it as well and their oldest is 13 and they still all play it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for the family","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 and 5 year old sons and they love it.

Well orth he money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"When I called my sister to see how her son (5 years old) liked this gift, she laughed. Apparently he burst into tears upon first seeing it because it wasn't another super hero action figure. She sat down with him and his older brother (6 years old) and they played a round and they've been playing it daily ever since. She also mentioned that her 5-year-old tends to be a bit of a sore loser and this game has helped her to help him overcome that tendency."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my daughter's favorites...","review":"I was looking for some games that were fun, had some educational aspect and that didn't take a long time to play. This was a great purchase and is one of our favorites. With three of us we can play several rounds in about 10-15 minutes. We use games as positive reinforcement for our daughter and she generally picks this game over all of the others. She loves being the \\"dealer\\" and picking our cards for us. Overall a great and easy-to-play right out of the box game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for younger kids!","review":"I just spent over 30 minutes playing this with my 2.5 year old. He loves this game and running the tile machine for everyone. My 4 year old daughter also enjoys this game. We play cooperatively and all have a great time. It is very durable for toddler/preschooler use and is one of the few games I will let him get out and play with by himself. I'd reccomend this game to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zingo: Bingo with Lingo","review":"Perfection for early elementary kids! Even my 2.5 year old loves this game. Just glancing through the previous reviews I have again noticed that some parents expect board games to prepare their kids for college level learning...people, let's just have fun; our kiddos are going to be fourteen before we know it. Hey, don't get me wrong- the word i.d. deal reeled me in, too, but then the fun factor just kinda took over. Don't even get me started on the set-up subject (please see my review on \\"The Honey Bee Tree\\" game). The above toddler loves attempting to put back the tiles- it keeps her busy, and I can enter La-La Land for several minutes. Note: there is an open groove in the tile holder to facilitate the actual tile placement, so if you are not a Yeti, obtain this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this game","review":"Perfect for my 3 year old. As adults, we play the adult games (Yahtzee and stuff) and the little guy is left out. We always throw a round of Zingo in and everyone has to play. My 3 year old had no trouble figuring out how to play this game and is learning about rules (which is awesome). The adults even get a little competitive when playing. lol Would definitely recommend to others. I love the way you slide the thing forward to get the next two tiles of play, etc. Better than bingo where you have those balls that go everywhere. And it's perfect for my son's age as it's like a smaller version of bingo...you don't have to play very long for a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond 5 stars!","review":"This game is a lot of fun. We bought it for our daughter when she was sick. It has become one of our favorite games. The gameplay is easy but entertaining. Both my husband and I enjoy the game. The game pieces are sturdy plastic. The cards are coated, heavy cardboard. The entire game is definitely durable, and the gameplay is so fun that it's a game we play a lot! I definitely recommend. We have another game buy ThinkFun too and it's a huge hit as well. I will buy more of their games."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS GAME FOR YOUR 3-6 YEAR OLD NOW!!!","review":"This is the BEST family game for young children!!! It is like an easier version of bingo - but the nifty card sorter is very fun. The cards have 2 sides, and one side is easier than the other (if younger kids are playing.) I bet a more advanced 2 year old could play this game. We brought this game in to my son's pre-K class for \\"game day\\" and the teacher said it was the class favorite, and asked if we could bring it in again. We bring it on every vacation - it is a great rainy day activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for great fun","review":"I purchased this game for a little girl's 4th birthday..I thought it was a traditional Bingo game with pictures but it's a bit different. The first player to yell out they have a picture on their card to match a revealed tile, gets that tile for their card. Once we understood the rules, it was real fun! She loved it! 3 adults and the little girl played the game. Of course it was the adults who didn't follow the rules. They kept grabbing the tiles instead of letting the dealer hand them out! The tiles are plastic not cardboard (more durable) and the tile dispenser isn't as hard to use as one of the reviews indicated. A nice inexpensive game which is guaranteed to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love this game!","review":"Got this as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old girl. She and her 6 year old brother love this game. She wants to play it constantly, and luckily it can even be fun for adults, so I'm not too annoyed by it yet! It's very well made, sturdy, and should last a long time. My only complaint is that resetting the tiles before each game is kind of a pain. But that's a minor point (helps to teach kids to clean up after themselves!) It was a good purchase, and seems to have lasting play value. I'd definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure seekers delight","review":"This youth story rivals The Hardy Boys, Tom Sawyer, or Huck Finn any day of the week -- and it does it with the Mickey Spillane style.

Mickey Spillane shows he can write childrens stories with the same quality of his famous Mike Hammer series.

It is hard to find copies in good condition, but a clean copy is quite nice to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much going on","review":"Ms.Brockmann has too many stories going at once. The main characters Wild Card or as I call him CryBaby and his love interest were interesting. The grandmother who was a spy during WWII was interesting. But the missionary and the opportunist drag the story down.Perhaps I am being a bit harsh because I couldn't figure out what the hell happened to the Starlett story line. How does this make him a good man when more people are miserable than happy? I guess I am asking for too much. I just thought the story was sophisticated and perhaps it would continue to develop its characters without cliches but I was wrong and i will say it again sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"The book started on a good note, seemingly fast paced but then fell off in the middle. My biggest problem with the book was how weak Ken was. He kept refering to himself as a loser. Come on now I don't want to be reading a book with a \\"loser\\" hero!I liked the Molly/Jones story and would love to find out what happened once Jones went to Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Control","review":"I couldn't put it down right from the first chapter. I am enjoying the series and thought that this one had a lot of suspence."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Just Keep Getting Better","review":"This is the fourth book in this romantic suspense series and they do just keep getting better. There are 3+ (!) romantic story lines, beautifully interwoven (even better than usual, I thought). Front and center, it's Wildcard's turn, and it's everything I hoped it would be for him. There's also a romance between a missionary and a smuggler, the WWII romance (spy-themed in this edition), and an update on Alyssa and Sam. The action and hot love scenes are great as always. This author has a way of pulling me in and not letting me go until I've finished the book. So far, they've all been almost impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get through it","review":"I think all authors go through a time where the series they are writing kind of taper off...and I think this is it for Brockmann's troubleshooters. I couldn't even finish this, after I got to about half, I just had to let it go. Not worth your time, but give the other books a try, I know I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"What a great read. I ended up falling for the side story with Molly and Jones as much as I did for Ken and Savannah. Very exciting and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else notice?","review":"I slogged through this book just wanting to see how the author would end the all too many story lines. Some of it was interesting. But I had a difficult time believing anything in the story after the mistake in chapter 4. Earlier the characters Ken and Savannah discuss (at Ken's house) the fact that he was a SEAL. He even accuses Savannah of being a \\"SEAL groupie\\". Then in chapter 4 Savannah \\"slips\\" and says he is a SEAl, and he gets mad! What was up with that? Am I the only one who noticed? Ms. Brockman needs to slow down a bit, not have so many story lines and try to keep her own story straight. This was one of the worst books I've ever wasted a weekend trip with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Adventure","review":"Brockman gives us a romance novel with a lot of adventure laced with some historical moments. The subplot I found to be more exciting than the main plot. Savannah's grandmother's autobiography about her time as a WW II spy was intriguing.In order to deliver the ransom money to Indonesia for her uncle's life, Savannah employs the help of Ken \\"Wild Card\\" Karmody, a seal and the romance begins. Pursued by drug lords and other equally dangerous enemies, \\"Wild Card\\" must use all his training in order to protect Savannah. Good intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Control is a great blending of stories!","review":"Out of Control: All of Suzanne's books are great...good story line, great caracters, marvelous dialoge...wonderful book. Couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another keeper from Suzanne Brockmann","review":"This book, like its predecessors, is fast-paced, sexy, and fun. It is the fourth in a series that has many readers hooked. The author has taken a minor character from her previous books, the obnoxious computer whiz SEAL Wildcard, and turned him into a terrific lead. The subplots are engaging and well-woven into the story. The book stands well on its own for those who haven't read the first three, but there is a continuing saga of two characters, Sam and Alyssa, that has built (and hooked readers) throughout the earlier books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't disappoint!","review":"\\"Out of Control\\" was a terrific read! I'm a huge fan of the Team Sixteen Navy SEALS and look forward to the development of each of their personal stories. The dialog between these two lead characters, Wild Card and Ms. von Hopf, often had me chuckling.I liked the suspense, the heat, the sexy fun! I, too, look forward to Suzanne's next book and updates to the relationship between Alyssa and Sam. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the ride! -- Well done, Suzanne!

As usual, I'm never disappointed. Learning Japanese with the Pimsleur method is so much fun. I'm just fascinated as to how much information I've retained within a few short lessons. I also feel very comfortable speaking the language, once I've learned it. This set of CD's teaches the student a lot about the Japanese word order and a few tidbits about the Japanese culture. I usually supplement the rest of my Japanese education with the \\"Lonely Planet Japanese Phraseook\\", until I can afford the comprehensive set.

Obviously, this type of product is a must for any serious aquarium owner, but the Python version of this hose is seriously crappy compared to the Aqueon. The piece that connects to the faucet leaks and is not well built. Just tonight I was cleaning my aquariums and the faucet piece broke in half while filling and sprayed water all over myself and my kitchen.

The fact that it comes with a brass sink mount is even better!

It works just as well as my 1st one although when I moved the tank we had to add some tube (a trip to Lowes for some tubing & a connector was a quick fix) as I didn't order the long one (originally didn't need it). Not sure what people are doing to these things to break them, they are mostly plastic so common sense should tell you how to handle them (dont run it over, force it or reef on the thing...), personally, I find it perfectly durable enough for it's intended use.

Watching \\"The Secret\\" introduced me to a whole new way of thinking of the universe. There was always something inside of me that told me that there was more to life than what it appears to be. The meditations in this book are very helpful; I particularly like the one where you imagine yourself in a bubble floating high above to a spiritual library that holds the key to what your purpose is in life. I recommend that everyone read this book that feels a little incomplete in their life or wishes to become more connected with the inner God or source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I keep an open mind when it comes to spiritual topics and can accept that we can develop more awareness with the Universe.

I can't even remember which girlfriend it was, but I have never forgotten the Book.I now have a new copy, and I am not lending this to anyone. And I have to say that re-reading it really has felt like I have found an old friend.Basically it is a manual to connecting to your higher self, we all have one. And some simple techniques described by Sanaya Roman, (as a channel for Orin, her spirit guide), can assist you to see life beyond our present existence and connect with an inner wisdom, and that can answer so many of the questions that we all have.I cannot recommend this book enough...******(Six Stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my second copy of the book","review":"It's a great book and I highly suggest it to help with a detailed method to \\"re-center\\" and basque in positive energy, but the quality of the used \\"LIKE NEW\\" condition... was not... very good.

Not only is this not true, but Lanning's book begs the question \\"If these are all the failures, where are all the successes?\\" The answers to this question would fill innumerable volumes (Saratoga, Antietam, et al.). Lanning needs to find a new day job and perhaps look beyond his own narrow field of experiences with the MI community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless Writing","review":"Lanning jumps on his petty position that military intelligence is to blame for all the military's shortcomings and never lets go. His arguments are shallow and unfounded. He then goes on to make some of the worst suggestions ever proposed, especially by by a military veteran--reduce our armed services to only an army and navy, shut down all but one of the service academies (he must be disappointed he couldn't get accepted to West Point)--what exactly do these issues have to do with the intelligence community? I just find it very interesting that someone who has never served as a military intelligence officer thinks he is a credible source on the subject. I guess he spent a little too much time in the infantry and lost his common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"stavesacre best yet","review":"this album is one of passion and intensity that will grip your heart and move you. the cd is on the lighter side of there previouse work but it does not take away anything from this cd because this is the best yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows me away","review":"When I first heard Stavesacre, it was their single \\"Shiv\\" from their second release, Absolutes. It dawned on me that this band sounded different. I didn't pursue it much, though. Later, I downloaded the entire album on a whim. Wow! Their sound is heavy and hard but sensitive and melodic. This is heavy music with true emotion, not just raw fury. Speakeasy takes this 10x further. Poetic lyrics and intertwined melodies set this apart. Plus the music kicks. If you think hardcore needs to go somewhere new... this is where it'll end up. Beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid CD","review":"This is the first CD I've heard by Stavesacre -- overall, it is excellent. All the songs are enjoyable, but Sundown Motel and Keep Waiting are by far the best two songs, with a perfect mix of good, hard rock and catchy melodies. Minuteman is also an excellent song. These three stand out from the rest of the CD, but that's not to criticize the other songs. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves great Christian rock, or bands like Fono, All Star United, Audio Adrenaline, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAVESACRE IS GREAT ....","review":"Stavesacre kind of seems to have a mystery about them a little. They are very good artists. A very mature, well-tuned band. Everything is first rate. They are hard, yet somewhat soothing to listen to, not quite what you'd get from other bands in this genre. Add it to your collection you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stavesacre: The best band in the history of life","review":"Stavesacre has been my favorite band ever since I picked up Stavesacre's first cd \\"Friction\\" back in early 1997. I have listened to their cds more times than all of my other cds combined. While, I'm not sure whether I like Speakeasy better than the other Stavesacre cds, that's not to say that it isn't amazing. There really isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said, except that \\"Gold and Silver\\" is perhaps one of the best songs ever written.Give this cd a listen...you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh this is good","review":"mark solomon is the man . and that's the bottom line. after having read an article about how they wanted to get away from their \\"tool\\" comparisons, \\"speakeasy\\" should do nothing more than solidify stavesacre with their own style and sound. alternative of \\"non contemporary\\" Christian music always walks a fine line between staying true to the music and trying to deliver a positive message. stavesacre are the masters of doing just that and this album proves it. this is by far their catchiest album and yet they didn't lose any of their hard sound. the addtion of a new guitartist to the mix has really developed their sound and new and old fans alike will be pleased with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have for everyone who loves music done right","review":"This album is a very heavy hitting one, it picks up where the band left off after their 2nd album 'absolutes'. I have to say that the melodic vocals and lovely instrumentantion are done so well that this is what I would say to be the most important album of the decade. Its just that good, if you are a fan of any kind of music you need this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 90's","review":"4 and 1/2 stars.Stavesacre has been a favorite of mine for many years, and Mark Solomon before them as vocalist for Los Angeles-based hard core/thrash band The Crucified. I love this disc-it has all of the power and depth of their (Stavesacre) earlier recordings along with great vocals. Bryan Carlstrom once again produces a masterpiece. His engineering and mixing are among the best I've ever heard in rock. Period. Staves always has a thick bass sound and up-front drums and their guitar-work is always top notch. Listen to \\"free fall\\" and tell me it isn't gripping and emotional. This is amazing hard-core/power metal. Don't care for two songs-the rest are great. Don't miss out.Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav band","review":"These guys are my most favorite band ever. I bought their cd about 5 years ago, and liked a few songs, but couldn't quite feel the voice or the beat, cuz i liked the mainstream sound that everyone else did. After Speakeasy came out, I heard Gold and Silver and got chills. His voice can carry out for so long, and the way it builds up sent chills all over my body. They also have the song Wither/Ascend that i want played at my funeral. If you hate hard rock, or rock in general, then buy this cd for the lyrics, they will amaze you. Mark has a passion for Christ and his music, and it's evident in his heart pounding lyrics. The way they integrate the music into the lyrical side is chilling almost. There are a few songs that i don't care too much for, but the lyrics on them are still incredible. I went to a concert, and heard some of the new songs. I will be the first in line to buy it. I definetly recommend this cd, because they rule. And so do project 86!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does SOUL like the BOYS form the BAY!

Although by the end of the album it all tends to run together and sound the same. There aren't any real standout tunes here, that is until the last song: \\"Spank-a-Dang\\". The price of the album is worth the last song IMHO.

Unfortunately when it arrived I realized it had a major flaw. It is NOT form fitting. It is actually shaped completely differently and quite a bit larger than it should be. This causes not only there to be a large air pocket in the case that lets my palm rattle around but also makes my slim palm twice as bulky as it originally was. Having already bought the clear case (which while not the best looking case is the most functional and I do recommend it if you have to make a choice) I decided to modify the PDair case. I removed the back plate and cut the latch off. Now its just a tad bit thicker but it completely covers the front of the palm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Aluminum Case for TX","review":"Very nice black powder coat finish on the outside with thin but adequate foam padding on the inside with a slot for a spare SD card.

The color-coded notations are easy to identify, making installation a snap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Maced!","review":"This is the best figure from Hasbro's new Deluxe action figure line from Episode 2. Mace stands ready to kick some serious Battle Droid bootay. He comes with his purple electrum lightsaber. The blade is detachable from the metal hilt that is magnetically attracted to his hand using the \\"Force\\". Best of all, Mace can shoot \\"Force\\" balls out of his wrist at an opponent or knock them back with a pretend shockwave projectile. The included Battle Droid figure is pretty much worthless though. The two halves of the body don't stay together when you try to stand it up. A magnet to secure the body and torso would have been nice and I am surprised Hasbro didn't just recycle one of these figures from their Episode I Theed Hangar playset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this junk","review":"This is a pathetic waste of money. The Light Saber comes apart and the only way to get it to stay together is with glue. why this was made in two peices is beyond me. the glue ended up not working either. the droid wont stay together long enough to get blown apart so we ended up gluing it as well. O yeah it does'nt stand up well either. all in all a very poorly desinged peice of [garbage].My son is very disappointed with this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price it was o.k","review":"The Battle Droid comes apart but then would not go back together so you basically get 1 1/2 figures.

We didn't think my daughter would like it as much as she does. My baby is only two and a half months but if I help her grab it she'll play with it for hours, looking at it and trying to get it in her mouth. It's soft too, so if my baby accidently hits herself with it it won't hurt. For the price, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"great teether","review":"This teether is great-I really like the colors, appropriate for girl or boy. It's easy to take places (doesn't make a scene if Baby drops it in church) and is easy for baby to grasp. Also very easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"This teether doesn't get played with much, but when my son is in pain & nothing else is working, this is a lifesaver.

But the T&A was minimal, only a couple of quick scenes. And the movie was only slightly entertaining. Since the movie wasn't very entertaining for me (a male), and most of the stars of the movie are female...and the males in the movie are portrayed as idiots (fools), and the plot is mostly about girls trying to get into a sorority....I'm thinking this movie must be a \\"chick flick\\"...a movie for girls. Guys will hope to see enough college girl nudity to be interesting, but they will be disappointed. Some Paris Hilton fans may like the movie, but be sure to note that Paris Hilton does not get naked in this movie (...but a few other girls get topless).

He has been one of my enduring favorites ever since I first heard his music several years ago. Steve Tibbetts is not very well known, but he should be. His music is a rare obscure treasure, charged with a profound spiritual atmosphere rarely met with today. Tibbetts albums are a montage of primal spiritual music from all over the world; from Tibet,Burma,Africa,India to America. Jimi Hendrix meets the Dalai Lama! A MUST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy, Captivating Creepiness","review":"As of this writing, this is the fourth album of this artistthat I've heard, so the tendency is going to be to start comparing,which is probably an injustice since this guy is SO original and creative. I've heard enough to know that I must get everything available. Based on what I've heard so far, the sound of this one falls somewhere between \\"Safe Journey\\" and \\"The Fall of Us All\\". Without any lyrics, this album shook and shocked me with it's POUNDING polyrhythms, beautifully bizarre vocals, and, of course, intertwining of acoustic and ELECTRIF(R)IED guitar.

Anne Rivers Siddons writes in such a way that you feel, sweat, breath, smell, and live her stories right along with the characters...you become another character in the story almost. Her descriptions of the south are sensual, tactile, compelling, and ultimately, full of love for such a mysterious, and sometimes dark place. She truly understands and is able to paint portaites of people that we all know, in scenarios that we haven't thought of before perhaps...but in a way that you just can't walk away from these people. She's one of the most lyrical, and compelling authors of our time. More than a few of her books should be on the \\"modern classics\\" lists everywhere.

When my parents called the company, the company did not even try to talk my parents through troubleshooting, they just said \\" you can get your money back\\", I feel(my opinion) that they know this is a defective product due to the fact that they were unwilling to even try to help figure out the problem. The company should recall all of these items and save the public the hastle. I can just imagine the poor parents and children over christmas. This item has been reduced to $50 from $100.

However, I excpected it to be a USB keyboard, which it is not, and I thought the USB ports could support all devices, which it can't. The primary reason I own a keyboard is for typing, so I think that should be the focus. This is a great keyboard to type on, and I recomend it for that purpose. I also find the hotkeys extremely well placed, and choosen. They are very usefull. The USB functionality is only semi-useful (hence the four stars). I couldn't make all my devices work well on it, nor is it a USB keyboard (it still needs the PS/2 port). Neither of these things were huge downfalls for me, but the were annoying, as it was not what I was excpecting. I do highly recommend this for typing, but if you absolutely need USB functionality, buy a USB hub."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the high rating for this keyboard","review":"I got my employer to buy this keyboard thinking it would be as good as the one I got at home, the original Microsoft Natural. Well, I am a bit disappointed. Yes the correct layout is back. But some keys catch... they don't get down easely as I press on them, particularly the larger ones. I don't know if that was a problem with the keyboard I got, but the feeling is definitly better with the original. It seems like cheap manufacturing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing movie experience.","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite movies, and after reading the book and seeing both movie versions, I felt that this one is the better of the two. Kenneth Branagh's performance of Victor Frankenstein is a bit pushed at times, but still manages to hold out for the duration of the film. Rober de Niro's performance of the monster creation is brilliant, and the make-up and costuming used to create the monster is well-crafted. As always, Helena Bonham Carter's performance as Elizabeth is masterful and empowered, delivering feeling to the film. All of these elements, combined with stunning sets and scenery and a totally mesmorizing score by Patrick Doyle, make this version of the classic novel a wonderful film, one that cannot be shaken from the mind once it is seen. This DVD is excellent, including French and Spanish language tracks, theatrical trailers, subtitles, explosive sound and vivid picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of resources","review":"De Niro is apparently a brain-damaged monster in one scene and then an articulate philosopher in the next. I saw this film the week that it was released. People were laughing at scenes that were'nt supposed to be funny. The film was inadvertently a runner-up to Young Frankenstein in the comedy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent effort","review":"This is, admittedly, one of my favourite films, although I don't care much for the gory excesses or the seeming self-gratification of Kenneth Branagh in his scenes with Helen Bonham Carter. Also, they have taken some liberties with the original story, although mercifully we are spared a lot of the verbal 'Victoriana' of the original book. In most ways, it is no more or less of a winner than the classic version with Boris Karloff (admittedly more effective in that it doesn't make people giggle when they see the newly-animated Creature). Perhaps the best thing about it is Patrick Doyle's score... he has worked for and with Branagh since 1989 and his every effort on the film's music has given it the most magical and effective atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really, really bad","review":"First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"It came brand new with the wrapping still on and the movie was so beautiful and so flawless.. just loved it! <3!GREAT PRODUCT, CAME BEFORE DELIVERY DATE AND OVERALL 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This movie is so great. It has been the best movie I have seen in a LONG time. I can't believe I had never heard of it until now. It was definatly worth 4 hours of my life to see such a great film. DeNiro was great...and I can't believe the director starred in it! Damn...it was just...good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a grevious error","review":"This movie was wildly disappointing to anyone who has actually READ THE BOOK.

It never occured in Shelley's book. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!!","review":"This is quite simply the most boring movie I have ever seen.

It is about Victor who creates a man with out responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"the critics obviously don't know shelley's work","review":"yes this movie doesn't match up to the classic films, however, this version does follow the book very well. While the other versions of this movie prefer the the 1950s mad scientist, this film used shelley's frankenstein. this film contained the fears of shelley, and not necessarily the fears of the audience. this film is unappreciated but thats ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an authentic adaptation of the book, but still fun.","review":"\\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" is an incredibly melodramatic adaptation of the book that takes huge liberties with the plot, but I still find it thoroughly entertaining. The movie is perfectly cast, and I think that the embellishments that Kenneth Branagh takes with the story only make the film more enjoyable. Even though I doubt that Dr. Frankenstein ran around without a shirt on as much as Branagh does in the film, most women will probably find it quite enjoyable. Robert DeNiro is amaing in his role of \\"the creature,\\" and Helena Bonham Carter gives a great performance as Elizabeth. If you're the type of person who detests it when filmmakers stray too far from the text of the book they're adapting, then this film probably isn't for you. If you're a bit more open-minded and are just looking for an entertaining movie to watch, this is a perfect film to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic.","review":"The movie is a close adaptation of the novel.It has good special effects.It is really tragic because the body count is big and made tragical it is made sad when someone dies not like in F13TH you feel sad for each victim.You see The Bride of Frankenstein not like in the original UNIVERSAL film.You see Frankenstein's brother in this version and it is tragic that he dies.The movie overall is sad.The monster is ugly.Proffesor Waldman appears.The movie has a dark tone of revenge and the monster has his revenge not by killing Frankenstein it is by killing his loved people.Frankenstein has a reason he is angry with dead...who isn't.Helena Boham Carter strangely has contact she plays Elizabeth who later turns The Bride of Frankenstein.Henry Clerval gives some kind of comedy tone to the movie...not darkness like Robert De Niro our monster.The bride looks groase she is uglier than The Monster.Finally the monster is ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The closest yet","review":"This movie is the closest adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel I have seen yet. To my knowledge this shows the creature as it was, not some big green monster with bolts in his neck. The creatue is intelligent, has feelings (DeNiro does a great job with this character) and wants to be accepted. A great cast fills out rest of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIDESCREEN","review":"I watch this movie every year for Halloween. It's admittedly not the best film ever in my opinion, but it's still very entertaining. FINALLY I get to watch it in widescreen. Previously I was only able to find it in full-frame on DVD. Now you get to watch this the way the director of photography originally wanted you to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic movie!","review":"Great, modern interpretation of a classic. Visually it is stunning, and the acting is very dramatic (as it should be for such a dramatic tale). Plus, Robert DeNiro plays the Frankenstein monster...need I say more!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST VERSION EVER!!!!!","review":"This movie is AWSOME!!!! Kennith Brona and Robert Denero areexcellent as victor frankenstein and the creature. This versionbeats all the other versions hands down. So by all means buythis movie it's the best horror film of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly not Mary Shelly's.","review":"If this were another typical Frankenstein movie it would have been the best. However, in the title, it claims to be Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, implying that it was based off the book. I have just finished reading the book by Mary Shelly, and the movie itself is missing so many important details that it distorts the book completely. In the movie, The introdction of characters is wrong, the creation of the monster is wrong, EVERYTHING IS WRONG! This is in no way Mary Shelly's. Now, I'm not knocking the movie at all. It was a rather ok movie. But if you're expecting it to be like Mary Shelly's book, then you will be greatly disappointed, much as I was. If you want to see an accurate Frankenstein movie that is stricly based off the book, then I suggest tuning into the Disney Channel. Mickey always seems to get things right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Branagh's Frankenstein","review":"Having taught the book for some years and having admired Branagh's talents as well, I was excited to see what he did with the book. His acting talents are remarkable, again; the sets are exceptional; the liberties taken deplorable. He ruined it. Killing Elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable. The end of Justine is pointless. Deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster. Minimal script that truncates and eviscerates. Horribly disappointed, especially by the maudlin sentimental ending...bathos supreme. Frankly, disgusted. Kenneth, what are you doing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful film. Ridiculous script. Skip it.","review":"Kenneth Branagh's take on MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN, while faithful to the novel and featuring Robert De Niro in an interesting take upon The Creature, is still incredibly silly. It's an overdone, melodramatic, silly mess of a film.I recall, in particular, the scene where his character and his \\"sister\\" played by Helena Bonham Carter admit their love for one another. Carter looks at him and says, \\"Brother ...,\\" and he replies, \\"Sister ...,\\" and then together they say, \\"Lover!\\" I laughed out loud in the middle of the theater because it was ridiculously handled and delivered in such a campy manner.The Creature, played by De Niro, is more human in this adaptation and thus more sympathetic. But, of course, the ridiculous screenplay gives him some really ridiculous lines. His Creature does read and write, proving to be quite an effective, even mature, villain.But I don't like this Frankenstein or this Frankenstein's monster. I don't like them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it if you want........","review":"Kenneth Branagh seems to think he is the main charcter not the poor monster who is the victim of great prejudice, the monster is not evil his made evil by society. Branagh is a heartless monster whom abandons his baby at birth. But he likes to overact someone should tel him its a horror not baywatch as he like to take his top and show his unintresting torso. watch it if you want run of the mill predictable horror. But be warned ther is much better films out there......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precious Little to do with Mary Shelley","review":"Yep, this is another one of those \\"Completely Faithful to the Book\\" well, no not really situations. If Kenneth Branagh were any more of a ham, he'd be stuck through with cloves and topped with pineapple. He is just terrible! The movie begins, like the novel, with a wooden ship out there in the icy waters. They take on a mysterious stranger, like the novel. But then Kenneth Branagh fairly shouts at the captain, \\" I..Am...Victor..........FRANKENSTEIN!\\" Like, why would that mean anything to the captain, y'know? It's not as if he said he was Napoleon or some other indisputably famous person any seafaring man would have heard of before. And Robert DeNiro--what's with the baseball stitching on your head? No, it's just an unholy mess. You'd be much better off with Colin Clive and his monster, Boris Karloff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankenstein","review":"Not a bad movie at all, though, a bit slow at times. I've always loved the story of frankenstein and warewolves and such. This is a rent once a year for halloween kinda movie. Not something that I think is quite worth buying. I mean once ya seen it ya seen it but good to see once and a while. It's the classic story of man builds a man then things go wrong. Actually I give it 3.7 stars not quite 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scene:","review":"When the monster is chased off by the young man, after trying to befriend the family he's watched and learned from for about a year, he goes off and cries, it is one of deNiro's best scenes ever, and it adds so much to the monster, its sick and pathetic to the fullest, and confusing.Overall, its a little gory to the point of sillyness, and gets ridiculous with the killing and bringing back to life of Frankenstein's girl, and then the re-killing of her, and all that other stuff that was not from the novel.Brannagh's Frankenstein is pretty good, a little too jolly during the jolly times, though that's importnat. Overall, pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monster has a New York accent!!!","review":"If you spend more than 10 cents on this film, it's a dime too much.Kenneth \\"I should stick to Shakespeare\\"Brannaugh's adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel is flatulent at best. If you are a true horror fan in need of some heavy-duty laughter, this one's for you!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly over the top","review":"It's appalling how over-acted this film is. Everything from the death of the mother, to the kites in the stormy field to everything else that follows, is just hideously over-done in every way possible. A wasted budget, a waste of an amazing performance by De Niro, a waste of time, really.2 and a half stars for De Niro and some quite vivid cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!!!","review":"This is unlike anything you've heard! Yes, there is plenty of Janis Joplin in this album, but there is also so much Big Brother and the Holding Company! You have both male and female voices on this album!

There is a little of everything on this album, mainly because Joe basically DOES IT ALL, with the exception of guitars (provided by Joe Walsh, Phil Keaggy and Rick Derringer). Joe plays percussion, flute, keyboards, etc. and the songwriting is absolutely superb.The music holds a very dear place in my heart and the CD was along-awaited addition to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Vitale is no Joe Walsh","review":"Sufice it to say that most people who buy this cd are desperately searching for Joe Walsh music, since he stopped doing his solo work many years ago... but don't be sucked in.

Plenty of \\"who is it?\\" element all the way through.You wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged... why?","review":"I, too am disappointed that the new edition is abridged. One reviewer noted that only about 30 pages were taken out, but for serious readers, students, and teachers, it is important to have the book exactly as Durkheim wrote it. I am a professor of sociology and I suppose this edition would be OK for teaching (the introduction is fantastic), but for my own scholarship, I could not depend on itbecause I am unsure what has been excised and the rationale. This is not just the idle complaint of a pedant - this is one of the most important books in the history of modern social thought and there is no excuse for abridging it, especially when the cover DOES NOT note that it is abridged. In a classic, every word counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Modern","review":"I've read Suicide and Division of Labor and was interested in a historical sort of way. Elementary Forms is positively shocking. Pages 8-18 and 433-48 will change your life. In those 25 or so pages he outlines a sociology of knowledge that presages the works of Mead, Berger, and the phenomenologists. He's 50 years ahead of Merleau-Ponty's great Phenomenology of Perception which treads over much of the same material. The rest of EFRL is interesting as well but if you read nothing else of Durkheim's read those pages. They completely reinvigorated the stuffy \\"father of sociology\\" I had known."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is very early Benn Hill in B&W.","review":"Frankly I was dissapointed.I did not realise this was a B&W set of videos from early TV shows.

The effect of her essays was to make anthropology just another of the many contemporary genres that inflate \\"personal experience,\\" rendering it melodramatic and marketable. If I were more interested in the individual doing the telling, perhaps the book would be more compelling, and I found myself reading on in the hope that at some point the author would succeed in making herself an interesting subject. Unfortunately, the finale left me with the suspicion that she is not a particularly good writer, though she may be a very good academic, one who sells books to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Love","review":"Anyone who has heard Daniel's music knows that he is, without a doubt, one of the kings of home recording. His records rarely sound like they had a budget of more than $100 and \\"1990\\" is no exception. The subject matter varies from tragic anthems of love, to warnings against making deals with the devil. Delightfully innocent and strangley beautiful, Johnston sings with an uneasy quiver that reeks of sincerity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Bola Sete w/ Primative Recording...","review":"The playing is very good & the recording was primative on these early '60s recordings of master Brazilian guitarist Bola Sete... BUT this collection is much more traditional Brazilian guitar [a la Baden Powell]& not the full-blown genius that is exhibited on Ocean Memories... Bola definitely matured into an amazing solo guitarist after these recordings were made & had a better studio 'n' effects to help him create an unmatched acoustic sonic environment later w/ \\"Ocean Memories\\" [his masterpiece recordings]... still, despite the poor sound quality 'n' percussion-heavy mixes, this is still a great acoustic Brazilian guitar CD for fans of such music... BUT i'd recommend \\"Ocean Memories\\" to those who want to hear the best of Bola Sete !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty As Charged","review":"Kenny Jones left his gig with The Who for what was to be yet another supergroup, teaming up with Paul Rodgers of Free & Bad Company fame, as The Law.Guest appearances by David Gilmour and Bryan Adams could not save The Law from being shot down by critics and fans in 1991. The album was a budget-breaker in production, pushed heavily for FM radio play, but never was able to crawl out from the bottom of the charts.After the cut, Laying Down The Law, it is nothing more than rehashed posturing from a pair of rock legends who should know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most creative","review":"One of the most creative blues albums ever recorded, I think it's the best Junior Wells ever recorded. The drums and bass are outstanding and Buddy Guy plays it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"First real blues album","review":"The appeal of Hoodoo Man Blues is that it was conceived as an album instead of a hodgepodge of singles and other tracks. When Junior Wells took his backing band with him into Bob Koester's Delmark studio, he had an LP in mind. Hoodoo Man Blues sounds as if it had been recorded in at some dingy nightclub in downtown Chicago at midnight. No particular track on the album stands out above the rest. What there is here is wall-to-wall classic blues. Wells makes no apologies to the purist crowd and throws a little James Brown-esque funk into the mix. He was a harp-toting gangster. He may not have been technically as good on the harp as Little Walter, but Wells had the attitude. Wells employs ace musicians to back him up like Buddy Guy on guitar, Billy Warren on drums, and Jack Myers on electric bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"In case there's any confusion, this isn't just the greatest blues album of all time, this is the greatest album of all time. Don't doubt it. It's perfect. As good as it will ever get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, Surprise!","review":"This is almost a must have, not only for Junior Wells fans, but for Muddy Waters or Buddy Guy fans also. This compilation shows Buddy in his youth and you can really appreciate where he was and where he is going. Some really stylised tracks all with the same musicians, I'm guessing their first releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"Why does this secure such glowing reviews? Yes, it's okay but not much more. Buddy Guy is rock solid here rather than inspired and the suggestion in the sleeve-notes that Wells is an outstanding singer is well wide of the mark. Ordinary. He was by all accounts an outstanding drunk, but that's another matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-s-s-e-n-t-i-a-l B-l-u-e-s? You better believe it!!!","review":"I got a whole lotta blues disks -- vinyl and CD. But this is one of the few I got two of -- in case one ever gets busted or lost. This is hands down the finest set of blues tracks ever laid down in a studio. I recently had the rare privilege and good fortune of meeting Buddy Guy at his club in Chicago, and he confessed that while it was among his and Junior Wells' best work, he also claims they barely finished in the short session they could afford with all the hooch they bought. Still, you'd never know this is a 1-day in the studio effort (according to Buddy), but if you get the CD you'll be treated to a couple of bonus tracks where some of the glitches can be found. (Catch the pop'n bass lines.) Still, warts and all, this is one fine and essential addition to any blues collection worth listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"the blues alright","review":"One of the classic Blues albums of all time. Junior Wells and Buddy Guy really captured the sound of Chicago Blues in this recording. As many have mentioned here already, this really is a gem of an album. I'm not usually one to take any credence from numerated reviews and the like, but I am comfortably assured that this album can get nothing but five as has been testified from the fellow reviews--quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOODOO VOODOO","review":"A great collection of songs by one of the great blues harmonica players, backed up by legendary musicians. If I recall the LP album back cover of this (or the other essential Junior Wells album \\"It's My Life, Baby!\\") had this story: Junior worked to save up for a harmonica at a pawn shop, at the end of the week he was 25 cents short, so at the shop he picked up the harmonica and ran out. Caught and brought before a judge Junior's defense was \\"I just had to have it.\\" The judge asked if he could play it, which Junior did causing the judge to rule in Junior's favor - case dismissed. Don't know if this is a true story but I'd have bought it for him myself. My thanks to the judge and my thanks to Junior! (ps. I no longer have the albums. If anyone does have the LPs please verify the judge story.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mind of its own","review":"My battery would die after one use, and I could not figure out why.

But a lot of the songs are just plain wrong. They don't really sound like the famous versions, and as a result they can be more frustrating than anything else. You're much better off with the Beatles Complete Scores book, which gets all the songs right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - tiny type!","review":"I already own Complete Scores and a 1987 \\"Beatles Complete\\", but I bought this so I would have something to use in performance, to cue me on lyrics and music without any page turns. Surprise: the arrangements are in such tiny print that it's virtually impossible to use this in performance as a fake book. You just can't read the words unless your face is only a few inches from the book, with perfect lighting. I would gladly have paid more if they'd laid out each song on 2 facing pages, but instead they usually cram 3 songs on those 2 facing pages. Compare this to the Real Book, which is thicker because it is typeset so you can actually use it in performance as a fake book.The Beatles music? 5 stars, of course. The arrangements here? Good enough, the ones I've bothered to hunch over and read; 4 stars.

He hasn't figured out a way to harm himself with this desk. I found the desk very easy to put together, and a nice feature was that it can be made for either a left or right handed child. I love the bright colors and the hanging bag and shelf under the chair. The cup for crayons is a nice thought, but my son could take or leave it.

Maybe that's for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly strange, but functions","review":"This belt does not really have two distinctive colors, but rather black and almost black.

I wore it a couple of times and noticed that the belt started to show signs of worn out. The belt is reversible that means there two pieces glued together, after a couple of times wearing it the glued parts started to open up. Kenneth Cole should think about a different way in making these kind of reversible belts last longer and of a good quality.

It is reversible but the brown is a very dark drown and looks black unless the lighting is very good. There was a small scratch on the front which leads me to believe they are cheap because they are scratch and dent, wasn't significant enough though to return especially since it is just a cheap belt. Would have given it 5 stars if there was no scratch, the belt is thick and the buckle is heavy, feels heavy duty and doesn't feel or look cheap at all. It's a good belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-Satisified","review":"The belt has a nice outlook appeal but what made it not satisfied after a week it un-stuck...i didn't make a fuss stuck it back and kept on using it and it didn't hold out...wasn't pleased at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No like","review":"When I Bought this belt.

The made in China belt (though supposedly leather) appears to be a man mad plastic like material. The seam between the black and brown strips started separating in several places.

After about 2 weeks of wearing it, I noticed that it had started to split apart in the middle. I haven't ever owned a belt that's done this, so it's clear to me that the belt must be at fault. Looking at the other 1 star reviews for this belt, this seems to happen a lot.Could I get it fixed? Perhaps, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a poorly constructed belt.

No ghosts, goblins, witches or goddesses. Mr. Frankowski has come up with a totally original, absolutely believable, fascinating alien race and a great monster. The Kren side of the book reads so fast that just you can't put it down.Warning: While it stands alone very well, it IS a prequel and you will spend restless nights waiting for the rest of the story. This is the probably best thing that this author has ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this- or the 3rd book- at all","review":"Where \\"The boy and his tank\\" was kinda ugly but in a fun kind of way, this book- Kren of the Mitchigai and its sequel sucked. The plot is heavy with negativity, and in the end all of humanity dies.Its a very dumb book. Dogs, cats, and mice survive and become intelligent. After 1500 years you're going to tell me theres no way to find human DNA and ressurect humanity? Especially with computers hundreds of millions of times more powerfull than the ones we have now?Lame. Disappointed. Suggest \\"do not buy\\" because it ends with the death of all humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action story by a great writer","review":"Absolutely great read. I discovered Wilbur Smith just last year. I love the historical settings and his knowledge of the military hardware of the era in which he is writing.I found the story to be quite gripping and had me sitting up late at night (when I should have been sleeping). In short it is a great read!Stories like this are timeless - war, heroism, love and lust. They make great ingredients in the hands of an author like Wilbur Smith.Just sit back, and let yourself get carry away. You will absolutely love the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Wolf","review":"Cry Wolf is one of the author's weakest novels that I have read. It lacks the fast paced,informative,descriptive style that I have come to expect from Smith. The Courtney, Ballantyne, and Egypt series are far superior to Cry Wolf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile Read","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of a disadvantaged and impovershed people fighting against insurmontable odds. My only criticism in this book is that it doesn't give you the ending to the story. All that we see is that the army survives but don't know that the Ethopians actually do triumph over the Italians in the end. I think that would have been a good footnote by the author at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great African Adventure","review":"I have no hesitation in giving this African adventure five stars! An American adventurer in Ethiopia in the late 1930s guides a caravan of armoured cars into the interior to escape the advancing Italians. Highly recommended!Also highly recommended is \\"Sands of the Kalahari,\\" by William Mulvilhill.The Sands of Kalahari"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Wolf","review":"First of all I am a big W. Smith fan and have read and enjoyed several of his novels. However this book was a huge let down to me. I think the main problem for me was the story line and the fact that I had no interest in Italy's attempt to beat [up] an inferior ethipoian army. This book dragged and was difficult to finish. Upon completion of the book you find out that if you don't know what happend between the two nations you must do a history review. This sat rather bitter with me considering that I finished the book just to find out the outcome. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have an interest in the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dated It Screams \\"1980's\\"!","review":"I recently read Cry Wolf and found the story-line, the tone and the characters' attitudes so dated I can find nothing positive to say about the book, or for that matter the 1980's."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it says","review":"I needed a concise book giving me information on the classical style by the top three composers at the time.

You feel helpless and crushed that a proud man who's been through so much is reduced to so little and you have to see it. That's how this album makes you feel about metal. If you're over the age of 13 and aren't brainwashed by the Bible, I dare you to sit through this atrocity and not weep for the future of our once proud genre.

This is the album that introduced me to the world of metalcore, I've always been a metal fan, but this opened a door I wish I knew of sooner. No computer to clean up the mistakes, all songs were recorded in one take and whatever blemishes there are you hear. The music is simple compared the the follow-up album, but the impact this album had is phenomenal. This is metalcore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You love it, or you hate it","review":"In my opinion, this is a great CD. I love the heavy sound without going overboard on the double bass or going too fast. If you like metalcore/hardcore/whatevercore, you will love it.It's the best one out there that i can think of. Now if you don't like metalcore, then you have no business dissing this band, so SHUT UP! I'm sick and tired of people saying this sucks only because they don't like metalcore, or because they are christian.

I love everything on this CD and I pitty someone who loves hardcore or metal who hasn't heard this.. your standards will go a bit higher and suddenly things you thought were the pinnacle suddenly will not seem as good.In all seriousness they have a created a great album that anyone metal head/ hardcore fan should own.

Please give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getaway","review":"I've had this album for a while, ever since it came out, oh what five years ago? Just never on disc format. This album still has alot of push in it. I just bought it for the first time, in compact disc form, the other night and I still love it to death.Norma Jean sets the benchmark for all those who have tried to follow in their footsteps. This album alone proves why they are the best, the superior definition to this genre, and what better album to show off as being the best of the bunch then Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child. Buy it now. Even all you pop punkers out there reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is revolutionary","review":"Listen people, this is not your average hardcore. Norma Jean is something new, something amazing. This album is beautifull lyricly and musically. They do stuff on this album that has never been done before. the lyrics are amazing, read them and you'll want to tatto them all over you, like me. I would recommend this album to ANYONE i mean, metalheads, hardcore kids, emo kids, gay guys, britney fans. Listen to it and eventually you will be converted.. i hope. Get this album, as well as \\"'O God\\", theyre both amazing. As a final note, Slayer... its crap. Straight up metal, it belongs in the 80's with metallica, im not saying its not pretty musically, but its lame and worn out, you'd do better to buy a collection of the greats (Mozart, Bach...ect.). However, norma jean is not the hardest band ever, for those of you wanting more hardcore, i applaud you. Go find \\"Dead End\\" by Seventh Star RIGHT NOW!! hope this helped"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight.","review":"Hardcore: starting to sound all the same? Not anymore; welcome Norma Jean: along with acts like Converge, Give Up the Ghost and the Dillinger Escape Plan can revitalize a genre full of wannabes. Surprisingly unlike most Christian bands that copy a sound of their originator (usually a band that isn't Christian or just isn't labeled \\"Christian\\") this band is awesome and geniunely real. Don't lump this up in a Focus on the Family crap magazine, because bands like this aren't ALL about being Christian. Just because they don't speak of drugs or what have you doesn't mean they focus on religion 24/7: read the lyrics to the lengthy title: \\"I Used to hate Cell Phones but Now I Hate Car Crashes\\". Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking in the hardcore scene","review":"I never heard of this band until i saw the cd cover at a local music store. I picked it up and realized that it was produced by them and Adam D., formerly of killswitch engine. I used to hate hardcore like this, and when i heard the first song i was appauled. However the more i listened to the music, and the lyrics especially, the more of a Norma Jean fan i become. I cant say what is the best song, nor could i really name the songs, but #'s 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,and 11 are all my tops favorites, and even the ones i didn't list... well see for yourself and buy a copy!! This is HARDCORE and a damn good album... hats off to Norma Jean."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"one of the most innovative hardcore/metal albums to come out in the past few years. Despite being a christian band, norma jean has succeeding in not having that typical christian sound (just aping what all the mainstream artists are doing). Their chaotic sound blends simple chords with complex rhythms, and biting, almost poetic lyrics that serve the emotion being conveyed by the music so well (\\"this becomes my pistol, this becomes my dagger\\", \\"she simply will not die\\" etc...). despite accusations of hiding behind an over-produced sound, \\"bless the martyr and kiss the child\\" was recorded \\"live\\" in a studio, using no computer enhancements.

No track on this record deserves to be described with the word metal, it's simply noisecore. I'm sorry but I have no respect for bands that use dissonance as their only weapon. The chug-a-chug breakdowns followed by noisy pick squeals are perhaps the most overused attributes of the hardcore genre, and the disc is packed full of those and not much else. Now if metalcore is actually what you're after, there is a lot of talent to be found in any Killswitch Engage, Unearth, or As I Lay Dying release."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"bore-core\\"","review":"Is this band serious? Boring generic chaoticwannabe-metalcore. Nothing more than that. And the lyrics, oh yes... \\"WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR!\\" Hahahahahaha. They attempt to overlap the fact that they have no talent with their heavy production and dissonant chords. It doesnt quite cut it. Track 5 is 15 minutes of nonstop annoying musical ingenius. But, if you like breakdowns, this is heaven for you, becayse they cant go for long without one.

This does not make you intellectuals. Anyone can tell from your lyrics that you aren't intellectuals; no amount of hair dye, studded belts, or pre-stained jeans will change that.If you want Christian hardcore, go Zao.

The two bands mentioned below are quite brutal and exceed this junk far more than I care to think about.If you want some REAL christian metal get a little gem called \\"Solace\\", by Lengsel, a Norweigan Black Metal band.

This is the WORST metal, hardcore album I have ever bought or listened to. It reminds me of the other crappy band Spitfire that came and went. For the freakin' life of me, I don't understand why so many people praise this album. It's just plain stupid and irritating; it's like listening to a bunch of monkeys scraping their nails down and chalk board and beating garbage cans with tree limbs. This group is horrible, horrible, horrible. Don't waste your money like I did ( I should send it back).And one more thing, Solid State Records has got to stop giving every smuck, wanna-be band who comes along a record deal.

THIS is the whatevercore album of the decade. Scogin has the best voice in whatevercore currently, and this album shows him at the top of his, and the rest of the band's game. Neither Norma Jean, nor anything elese Scogin is/will be associated with will top this album.On a sidenote, why am I just reviewing this album now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand why everyone has a hard-on for Norma Jean...","review":"I have NO idea why everyone loves these guys. I've seen them live and listened to their Cd and it is god awful. They are sloppy. They have riffs I thought of when I was 12. The two guitars don't even go together in most parts. And to hell with if they techinically go together on the scales, it just sounds awkward. And to top it all off, the singer's generic scream and terrible delivery make this pile of garbage complete. The bassist just sits in the background, and the drummer wishes he was playing something else. I don't know what else, but not the riffs he's supposed to be playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning French","review":"In French this is what you would call \\"pas terrible\\" or not so good.

Product is smart, easy, and of high quality. Suction on the system is good, infact so good I have to use the valve at the vac end to turn it down as it sucks up too much gravel at times. Filling is a snap and with the adapter its fits anywhere from your kitchen sink, to the garden house, to even the small inset threads of some bathroom faucets. All around product is amazing, and is the original. Bought mine when I was a kid working for Petsmart as we used them in the stores. The other products out there are cheaper, but do not have the same quality and durablity, and with the recommended weekly water changes you need something that will hold up. Makes my current 180 Gal. tank so much easier, but would recommend to anyone with a tank greater than 10 gallons, though I use it on a 5 gallon Nano tank as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough good things about this product","review":"I originally owned the 25 foot model and loved it - we moved and I needed the 50 foot model. Cleaning our 150 gallon aquarium (36\\" height) is a breeze with this thing, and nary a drop of water hits the floor. I can't imagine changing the water using any other method. When we first got our aquarium the Python system was recommended to us, and I would pass the same recommendation on to any other aquarium owner/enthusiast. Buy it. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful tool","review":"I bought this as a replacement for another No Spill Clean and Fill that I purchased in 2002. The hose had split because of a kink in the hose that resulted from storage. The negative about this product is that it is very difficult to store. After awhile, no matter how much you unravel the hose, it will kink and be extremely difficult to roll back up. Still, the hose lasted 4 years, which makes it a decent investment.In terms of water changes, it really depends on the size of your tanks. I have a 50 gallon, and it helps to use the Python for large water changes. *Frequent* water changes, which are supposed to increase as a result of using this product (according to Python themselves), aren't really that frequent because like I said above, it's a pain to unroll and roll back up. I would say that for anything less than 50 gallons, it's probably easier to bring out the bucket and siphon.Overall, this is a good product. I just wish there was an easier way to store the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!","review":"I purchased two of these one for myself and another for my brother. We both love it. It has made cleaning our tanks so much easier. I was constantly spilling water as I used a manual gravel cleaner siphon & a bucket. Not to mention that it took so much longer. Do yourself a favor and get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"it works great no more buckets. yayyyyyyyy!!!removes water, cleans the gravel, and it fills the tank back also. and it has safety latch incase a fish get in the gravel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This is a great product! Definitely cut doing partial water changes to my aquarium in half. All you have to do is hook one end to your sink and the other end will serve as the vacuum to take water and debris out of your tank. Once you're done taking water out, just twist the faucet adaptor thing and it will send water back to your aquarium. Also there is a control valve if you want to slowly put water in or out. Just add a dechlorinator and you are all set to go. Definitely a back saver!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received it","review":"Amazon never got it to my house otherwise I'm sure I would have loved it.

This, like many other episodes of the series, is a mislabeled, duplicate episode. It says it's season 4 episode 3, but it's actually season 4 episode 7.This is the fifth such mislabeled episode I've noticed in this series so far, though I'd bet any amount of money I'll soon stumble across more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong/Duplicate Episode","review":"This is not Season 4 episode 2, but rather Season 4 episode 4. It seems whatever process was responsible for making Keeping Up Appearances available on Amazon Instant Video either just blindly guessed at which episode was which, or trusted the labels on the source tapes without actually checking the episodes.This is the fourth episode of this show I've come across that's been a mislabeled duplicate of another episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure why people dislike 4th season","review":"While it's true that the producers went a little out of the normal bounds for the 4th season, expanding the characters and backgrounds and the venues for the stories, they never strayed so far that the series lost its way or humor.

However some of the jokes can be a little tiresome. For example in every episode, there are the telephone conversations with her sister Violet, Daisy, or her son. Secondly, there's the dog that barks in the front of her dad's house, which always knocks her into the bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This collection includes some of the funniest episodes that Roy Clarke filmed for Keeping Up Appearances.

With its golden cover of a blonde, antique doll, it has been a regular part of my Christmas decor since I purchased it. Each pair of pages has a charmingly set up photograph on one side, and a few paragraphs written about the doll on the other side. Some of the information is personal and some of it is about the type of doll shown, but it is all briefly written. It is a nice introduction for the beginner, but the experienced collector will find no new information. Buy this book for the wonderful photographs of a wide variety of antique dolls in well thought out displays because it is a photographic documentation, but don't buy it for the written information because there is little."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and sweet- lars review","review":"I bought this album in 86?

The backing musicians are incredible. It's music to sing out loud to when no one is looking. It's music to wallow in, you'd almost *want* a broken heart so you could be in a funk with it listening to Johnny Adams sing Doc Pomus.

The herb dressings and bean sauces are great too. Nothing to complain about - a great way to add new zest to some old favorites. Sometimes when I get home from work I just stream up some rice and vegetables and drizzle a little sauce that I may have made the day before on there - voila a great quick yummy dinner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing it was free","review":"I forced myself to finish this book in the hopes that characters would develop and something interesting would happen, but it never did. The main characters are stuck in a constant state of misunderstanding that is just at such a high level they must be blind, deaf and dumb. The supposed \\"strong\\" female lead never actually stands up for herself and the \\"considerate\\" male lead verbally berates at her several times. So painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little annoying after the first couple of chapters","review":"This book started out ok for me but the constant misunderstandings between Max and Verity were just too much. I found it a little annoying but did finish the book. The end was a little anti-climatic after all of the build up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!","review":"By the halfway point, I got tired of the repetitious misunderstandings and the completely unlikable characters (esp. Max, who is the kind of emotionally abusive psycho boyfriend that after-school specials always warned me against.)

I did thoroughly enjoy this book even after having read all the reviews first. I do agree though, some aspects of the book can get frustrating but perhaps that was the author's intent. The lack of communication between the two main characthers makes you want to scream in parts but finally it is resolved (as you'd expect)in the climax. I still found I was intrigued by the story and characters nonetheless and have to agree I did find some parts of the book a bit of a tear jearker. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a kleenex","review":"I love romance stories and this one was a tear jerker. A lot of the free books for my Kindle disappointed me, but this one was very good. It was well written and kept my interest throughout the entire story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great free Romance Read","review":"I got this book because it free but liked it so much I bought the sequel \\"A Compromised Lady\\". The heroine was strong but not bratty as they sometimes are. The hero, although he did one really stupid thing, was brooding and tender, just what you want in an alpha. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel about his twin Richard."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about a little communication people?","review":"This will be a short review because plenty of other people have written about the plot. I will first say that I am glad that this was a free story or else I would have felt ripped off. I don't mind a little misunderstanding between characters as long as they don't take very long but these misunderstandings take up at least 80% of the book. All they needed to do was sit down and actually talk to each other but they don't until the very end of the book. Instead it is one bad conversation after another, if you could even call them conversations. The main characters never really listened to each other. They jumped to rash and very foolish conclusions and would end the conversation instead of sharing their thoughts and feelings. Verity was also way too much of a martyr for my tastes as well. Give me a women with a little strength please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful poorly developed plotline","review":"For a romance novel it started off interesting. A mysterious stranger who comes to a grieving girl's rescue, powerful emotion, and interesting introduction of characters. After the first few chapters, however, there was really nothing more to recommend it.Verity, the heroine, quickly became a spineless, self-persecuted, weeping, pitiful character. It was hard to empathize with her or the plotline when I had the strong urge to tell her to stop her self-loathing and quit playing the victim.The hero, Max, was also difficult to respect. He was too busy perpetuating one misunderstanding after another, calling Verity a whore, or wallowing in self-pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many misunderstandings","review":"the story line needed help. Too many times was one of the couple misunderstood by the other. I MEAN, after 4 or more times I could see it coming. I finished it just to get to the happy ending. Needed more something. Not sure what, or could have been shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero with a mile-wide Mean Streak","review":"...and extreme mood swings pretty much signals severe personality disorder. Run, Verity, run! As other revewers have said, Max starts out well but quickly turns into a jerk for wholly imagined reasons. The lame big misunderstandings are too frequent and lack believability. Plot has a retro 80s feel - and not in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but only once","review":"I liked this book - especially since it was free. I read it and didn't want to put it down because I found it interesting, until I got to the middle then it went on and on. Then it threw out a twist, which was good, but then went back to the same on and on. I guess it was the time the story was written in which women can't communicate with their husbands. He was always thinking she didn't love him and then she was always thinking how he didn't love her....geez! How can they get so confused and then manipulate themselves so much. But it was good. I wouldn't read it again, but I am glad I read it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"I think this book is not as bad as some people claim it to be. The style of writing of the author is really a good one. The plot of the story is not very strong and at some points of the story you wonder why something is happening. The main character Verity is described as a total saint which we all know accounts to being boring at some point. But as a whole I read it with interest. It is not as bad as it sounds and it really captures your interest right away, begining as a Cinderella story in a way. For free as it is, it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"better then I expexted worth it","review":"yes there were many many misunderstandings andusually I can not stand this. However this is a free book on the kindle soI decided togive it a try. Compelling characters and still kept my interest even though it contained misunderstands.

I did however, find myself rolling my eyes with all the misunderstandings. Talk about a lack of communication.

It will put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read this year","review":"I read about a book a day, on average. This was, hands down, the worst of the year. Probably last year & the year before that too. I didn't like the characters or the plot. Even free, it costs too much. I want my time back. I know its gotta be tough to write a book, and I doubt I could do it, so I try hard to give authors a break, even if I don't really like the book. Unfortunately, I just really hated this one, which is rare for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable, Easy Read","review":"Yes, the Misunderstanding Plot is done in this book quite a bit but to the people who nay say it:Have you ever seen a couple in an unhappy marriage? Let me tell you, they -don't- talk to each other and always assume the worst.I found this easy to read, enjoyable, well written for the most part, and interesting.Historic romance isn't my preferred genre- I spend from May to October playing a historic character so I demand perfection in facts.Considering Harlequin gave me this entire book for free on their celebration website I was surprised at the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book.","review":"This was a free Kindle download for me, too. Otherwise, no way. The so-called hero is MEAN. He is a BAD MAN. These two don't just seem naive to being in love, they seem unfamiliar with being humans. He asks her to be his mistress and soon is FURIOUS that she wanted to be his mistress? He tells her becoming his mistress would take her away from all this, then wonders why she'd want to get away from all this? She has no family, money, clothes, friends, self-esteem...She's verbally, emotionally, and physically abused...He's horny and for the most part, without empathy.

The plot kept me sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen next. Many of the characters were so irritatingly dense that I just wanted to bash them over the head with the truth, but that's what made this book interesting. Overall, I loved this book. I didn't think I would, since historical romances weren't my thing, but I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Enjoyed this book and continued to read the others in the series (Lord Braybrook's Penniless Bride & A Compromised Lady). Think it's a little harsh sometimes on the treatment of the heroines -- but I also think that's what makes you feel so much more for both her and her love."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Lady Mistress","review":"Very interest story line.

And the hero treats the heroine like garbage, a really bad message for women here, because Verity blames herself for faults that really don't amount to anything in my honest opinion, and yes, if they just sit down and talked, the book would have last ended in 50 pages. For a free ebook, it's great. For a satisfying historical romance read, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a lot of problems with this book...","review":"But my main problem? The author goes out of her way to describe the female protagonist as a defiant sassy woman, but never follows up this description with action. In the majority of the story, Verity is either crying, mourning, or tearing up. She never speaks- she whispers, sobs, or whimpers.I understand that the character has been beset by hard times and suffered from a dark past, but come on; what romantic heroine hasn't? Her mewling doesn't make me want to root for her, it makes me completely unsympathetic to her plight. If I'm not sympathetic, I'm not invested. When she and Max (finally) get their happy ending, do I care? No. It's completely unearned. Verity never rises out of her depression to recapture her former willfulness. Instead, Max swoops in and saves her and resolves her of any wrongdoing she may or may not have committed. She doesn't fix her own problems and that resulted in a frustrating conclusion.tl;dr Verity is a wimp. Do not want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand the high rating","review":"I don't understand the high ratings given this book. I'm a long-time romance reader, and I'm not really too picky about what I enjoy. I was looking for a new author to try, and gave this a whirl. I was extremely disappointed. It is predictable, repetitious, contains all the genre's cliche characters, and if the heroine cried one more time, I would have thrown the book at the wall. There are moments of quite good writing, and maybe with a tough editor this author could put it all together and produce a fine book. I'm sorry to say that there are many wonderful romances, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute drivel","review":"I love historical romances. That being said, glad this one was free or I would have been really mad at myself for having to pay for it.

I really enjoyed this book.I have been reading romance novels off and on since '75 when I had started with Barbara Cartland's \\"innocent\\" books when I was almost 11. Kleypas was a new discovery to me this year because I had been busy with my life and later raising a child so I never had the time to read until this year.I am looking forward to reading the rest of Rolls' books.

Max seeing the abuse she is taking from her family makes a deal with her then forces her to marry him. His aunt has him so guilt written over his twin's leg that he doesn't treat Verity any better emotionally then her family did. However, physically he is distant. His brother at first doesn't know what to make of her then at least helps Max to take title and responsibiltiy on.

I've definitely fallen in love with the story, but I've fallen much more for the characters! They definitely play well off each other.

I am not pagan, although I have friends that are.Never Burn a Witch was an enjoyable wasting of time that I should have been doing other things. Although not quite as good as Harm None, I found it to be engaging but be warned you may be somewhat grossed out at the two burning killings. Living in the city I found it to be fun to be able to place MR Sellars scenes and name changed communities [\\"yes, I recall that snowstorm and lets see, Millchester is here, and Brairwood could be that...\\"]If I have a complaint its that MR Sellars, due to the demands of fiction, is loading up the city in his books with more a deranged criminal element that our midwest, comfortably apathetic city really is. But then if he didn't he wouldn't have a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing","review":"There may be a good story here, but the book is in desperate need of professional editing. The author drowns the story in extremely detailed descriptions of everything - which is often not necessary. I would love to see this re-written more crisply, with more character development. I do believe the author has talent, but needs to study his craft more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another nail biter!","review":"I find myself totally engrossed in Rowan's misadventures in the first couple of pages then I cannot put the book down until I have finished reading cover to cover. I find myself skimming pages with a lot of authors, but not with Murv's books. It is his honest, natural tone and manner of speaking that keeps your attention. I feel as though he is right in my living room telling me the story and because I don't have to wade through line after line of needless, redundant descriptives I am able to fully visualize the scene he sets forth.

The one week itinerary actually suggests that you try to visit the whole island in one week, which would involve you spending most of your time in the car!Most of the recomended best beaches are a bunch of flat, crowded, over-developed boring beaches next to the big cities. When actually Sicily is full of beautiful picturesque beaches set amongst interesting rocky cliffs off the beaten track.Furthermore, it seems that the writer never even visted the west side of the island. There is only 18 pages on the west side of the island, and the Egadi Islands are not even mentioned.I would not recomend this book, especially if you intend to visit the westside of the island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Not the Elder Frommer's Approach","review":"Although this book provides some useful information on sites and the location of some restaurants, stores and hotels, I was disappointed that the book did not take a more practical, dollar-wise approach to touring Sicily.

This is NOT about a mysterious sea creature. Oh, sure, it makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the book but then disappears until a VERY brief mention in the last chapter.The characters were not only mostly annoying but one-dimensional. And how much sense does it make to bring a 17 yr old down to an undersea research habitat and then onboard a research submarine? And what was with the minor storyline of the scientist trying to sell out his company? I honestly saw no point to that.And the editing...or shall I say the lack of editing...the blatant mistakes everywhere in this book were laughable.I admit I read the entire book hoping the monster lover in me would be rewarded for her perseverence. Alas, that was not to be. It was a waste of my time. I give you fair warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss being a kid","review":"I think I know the trouble with science fiction now: I firstenjoyed it -- immensely -- as a wide-eyed kid.

The guy attracts me each time, no doubt tapping into my yearning to find the Sense of Wonder. So I try him and try him, only to find that his characters are tepid stereotypes, and the plotting rather by rote.\\"Oceanspace\\" is written to pop-fiction specifications: Utterly lame characters -- the teenager is the worst kind of stereotype, an embarrassing cliche -- and the writing is just, well, documentary and plodding.I finished the book, but I must say I'm disappointed: The plot -- ie: Sense of Wonder -- ain't enough to sustain this jaded old sf kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good - but it wasn't","review":"I was hoping for great things on this one - I'd enjoyed Clarke County Space and Lunar Descent so was hoping for something just as good in a watery setting.At the start you jump right into some action with no messing about followed but some nice hard science, but after that it all goes downhill. When you get to parts of a book and just cringe (the unsucessful seduction scene) you know it's not going well.When I finished it I just wondered what happened to the the 'greatest discovery of all' mentioned on the back cover - in fact, what happened to the entire ending?My advice : read Orson Scott Card novel 'The Abyss' (based on the screenplay of the film) instead.

But after dealing with 3 of these I decided to just keep the 3rd one and deal with manually pushing out the frosting myself. Too much money and aggrivation, Wilton!

It seemed to work well. This afternoon I assembled it and loaded icing into it. The consistency of the icing was normal - not especially thick. With barely any pressure on the thumb lever, it snapped off. I continued with the job by pressing on the top button to push out the icing. About halfway through icing cupcakes, the top button split in half. I finished the icing job by pressing down with my bare thumb on the top of the threaded shaft of the device. Sore thumb but job done. The company should add to the features: \\"Breaks easily after only a few uses!\\" I think I may switch to pastry bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke during first use. Difficult to clean.","review":"I received this as a gift. I finally used it in lieu of a bag, and it broke within five minutes. It is difficult to clean.

(Unfortunately, I can not make the same positive comment about KISS.) Regardless, I wanted to get a hold of some of their music while eagerly awaiting their new \\"blues\\" album. I decided to purchase a \\"greatest hits\\" cd of their comeback music rather than purchase all their studio recordings since 1985.

Aerosmith's cover of The Beatles \\"Helter Skelter\\" is amazing, it even rivals the quality of the orignal.

It is a sequel to Godzilla:King of the Monsters(1954). Special effects wise this movie is the best in terms of a Godzilla movie with several scenes being the best in Godzilla's screen career. They do succeed in bringing Godzilla closer to the quality of the new Gamera Films. I really enjoyed this movie and having seen both the Japanese and American Versions of this film.(Not Deanzilla). The American Version of Godzilla 2000 is Superior. The Japanese Version moves along slowly in places with long peiods of silence. The American version inserted new music and sound effects into these places aw well as incorporating Godzilla's theme into the Final battle and closing credits.

To be honest with you it's hard for me to review this terrible movie because it just didn't make much sense to me. The dialog was so bad it seemed like it was written by a kid in grade school. Actually i'm giving the dialog too much credit, I don't want to insult any grade schoolers out there. Truthfully I believe a kindergartener could have written better dialog. This film was in the fantasy section in the video store, but it should have been in the comedy section because all I did throughout the whole movie was laugh.

Needless to say, the Japanese try everything to kill Godzilla again this time and nothing works...again.Why do they keep shooting at him when he is impervious to pain? I thought the Japanese were smart? In this movie two characters, father and daughter, seem to like Godzilla who destroys a heck of a lot of the city and kills thousands of humans. Somehow or other we are supposed to identify with the ugly beast.In this movie Godzilla fights a giant rock from outer space that turns into a spaceship then into a monster and then Godzilla...well I don't want to ruin the ending.One star: BUT a lot of idiotic fun!Frank Scoblete: author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla looks corny again!","review":"Even though he looks a little more realistic here than in the previous Japanese films he still is too much a man in the monster suit. And he walks upright again! It was discovered by scientists, less than 40 years ago, that dinosaurs like tyrannosaurus rex didn't walk upright In the 1998 TriStar film he moved much more realistically and looked more terrifying.

It's got a decent plot, lots of action, and interesting characters. Godzilla gets to be the good guy in this one (though that's only because he's the lesser of two evils).The stars of any kaiju film are the montsters themselves, and here we get a great matchup. Godzilla, always great, and Orga, a worthy challenger. Orga is cool because he has many forms and many different types of attacks. He really gives Godzilla a run for his money. There final fight is truly spectacular with terrific special effects and a fantastic final deathblow that is one of the best (perhaps the best) in Godzilla history.You don't need to know anything about Godzilla to enjoy this film.

The acting is good, Godzilla looks more menacing than ever (especially when he's ready to unleash his flames), and the plot is actually quite enjoyable, considering it's centered around a 400 foot lizard. Unfortunately, this DVD does not have the original Japanese dialogue, but the dubbing is well done. The dubbing is certainly much better than the Godzilla movies of the 60's and 70's. The special effects are the standout of the movie, especially when F-15 jets attack Godzilla with missiles. This DVD also has a brief, but interesting behind-the-scenes video of the making of \\"Godzilla 2000\\".

If you like Godzilla then you should definitely see this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"blowback to the original","review":"This movie is somewhat a nostalgic trip. It looks like it was filmed for the same budget as the old Godzilla movies. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, the plot is barely there. But then the plot always was Godzilla gets up and tears up Japan. The problem is that this isn't the 50s, 60s, or 70s. The nostalgia isn't enough to carry you through this film. No, the revamped Godzilla wasn't any good, nor is this throwback. Your best bet is to go and get the original movies.At least Mothra wasn't in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am biased...","review":"...against the dubbed Godzilla films.With the advent of DVD technology as well as movie-goers who can read, I was hoping that Godzilla 2000 would be released in the form in which it was first released: that is, in Japanese. And with English subtitles. After securing a few \\"G\\" films in their original language I cannot watch dubbed and \\"edited for Americans\\" versions. I found the dubbed voices, even if they \\"matched,\\" to be so annoying, so insulting, so distracting... that the experience was painful.Story-wise, it's OK, but lacks the surprising sophistication of G vs. Biolante (Japanese-language version/English subtitles). Suit-wise, I didn't like it, but since this is G-Jr. of G vs. Destroyah I understand. General-effects wise, the monster battles in this one are anemic.END"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is far worst Gozilla movie","review":"I am a Gozilla fan. I own almost all the Gozilla dvds.

This time, he faces an opponent bent on taking over the earth for his own deeds, just like Space Godzilla. But once again, the king of the monsters comes to protect humanity although they scorn him.

Basicaly, it seems that Suede is now a band influenced by Suede, trying to do a Suede sound that sounds thin. The lyrics are ridiculously a repetion of the same Suede subjects.

His life achievements are enviable to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly bland","review":"The only reason I am giving this CD 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the first three songs: \\"Strawberry Wine\\", \\"We Danced\\", and \\"Did I Shave My Legs For This?\\". The rest of the songs were completely forgettable, and they all sound the same. Deana's singing is listless and boring, and the music lives by the motto \\"less is more\\". I listened to around 5 songs after the excellent first three, then turned it off before I was bored to death.

That being said this collection is unnessesary and rather silly to have. Deana only recorded two albums on Capitol, her multi platinum debut DID I SHAVE MY LEGS FOR THIS? and her sophomore slump (undeservingly) EVERYTHINGS GONNA BE ALRIGHT. That takes up 9 tracks, and three bonus unreleased tracks. It's a shame her second album did not take off, its roots in folk and unique choices in material made it a winner, unfortunately people turned its shoulder on it. But she should bounce back, with her new album due later this year.

The set has a movable roof, so you dont have to take the roof of to see inside. My favorite bit is the gun turret (it only has one, on the top ,a minifigure fits inside. It also includes a laser gun for the snowtrooper to try to destroy the ship ,just like in the 5th movie. It would be better if it included more minifigures , like Luke and R2-D2. It has many features from the movie, making it realistic. The landing gear fall off if you are not careful. The inside off the ship is cool, and you can fit a lot of minifigures inside. It is a major improvment from the first Millenium Falcon set. I think it is quite cheap when compared to its value. I would buy this set if you are a LEGO fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lego.

So we took it all apart and built it again, but that time I ended up screaming and crying because part of the bottom wasn't strong enough and the front things began to break apart, so it cracked in half and I gave up.

I am convinced that without the use of model glue, it will never stay together long enough to snap a picture of the completed project. How a child is supposed to play with this is beyond me. It would cause far less trauma (and a lot less money) if you would go and buy your child an equivalent number of Legos and let them use their imagination.We've been loyal Lego purchasers for 12 years now.

I bought this second release of the Millennium Falcon the day it hit the stores in 2004. From the photos of the first release, I think the second release is better. It is massive in size (though not to scale, it is LEGO after all) and comes with 5 rare mini-figures, including Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, C-3PO, and an Imperial Snowtrooper.

Although Vai will manage to entertain a few die-hard guitarists with his admittedly amazing fretwork, his bizarre musical \\"stylings\\" will leave most out in the cold. One of his better efforts, \\"Liberty\\", is a rock ballad/anthem that, at best, listens like spoon fed patriotism; at worst, it sounds contrived and derivative. Fortunately, originality is one thing Mr. Vai shows in abundance in almost all his other songs; unfortunately for the listener, most of his works are also completely lacking in emotion.A student of Joe Satriani should do better.

Well it turns out that it's a load of rubbish which explains why it's in the bargain bin. The album is basically a collection of Vai trying to imitate birds, speaking, water and all sorts of crap on his guitar. Very technical and very unmusical. To top it off there's all this supposedly deep and meaningful rubbish spoken over the top of the \\"songs\\". Are you joking?

He loves looking at all of the colorful pictures. What I like is that this book is broken up into catagories like, people, clothing items, foods, toys, animals, parts of the body & more. the pictures are specific, up-close, and colorful, to attract small childrens attention. I feel that this book is perfect for children who are learning to speak, and name objects. It's also great because it's more durable than a paperback with little fingers flipping through the pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning book","review":"This is my 18 mo. old grandson's favorite book. This is always the first book he brings me to read to him. He loves pointing to the different objects and having me say the word. One day he pointed to the carton of milk and I said \\"milk\\". He looked at me like I was wrong and pointed to it again more adamantly. He was actually pointing to the cow on the carton so when I said \\"cow\\", he moved on to the next picture smiling. LOL! I love the thicker pages for little fingers that can't turn a paper page yet. Great book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great board book","review":"This is a great board book. There are quite a few words on each page which can be good to learn many different words, but gets a bit overwhelming if you are trying to read all of them.

The book has an extremely long introduction by Shaw which is quite revealing about his attitudes toward Darwin, religion, society and other things. The play has had very few performances, obviously, because of its length. It is of interest to a reader for its anti religious views, and its premise that living longer does not equate increase in intelligence or even in sensitivity to the needs of others. It is a very pessimistic and fatalistic work. \\"Che sera sera\\" no matter what humans do or do not do."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mixes","review":"Yeah, I know, it's WHITNEY, but at least her management has enlisted some decent remixers for the herculean task of giving her a little cred.

Arthur Upfield, who was to become famous for his fictional detective, Detective-Inspector Napolean Bonaparte, was discussing his latest murder plots. Snowy Rowles, who was present, later put the same plot into effect, and three men disappeared. Rowles later hung for the crimes.Terry Walker has VERY thoroughly researched his topic, and though some very small parts of the book might make for dull reading, this is so only because he has left nothing out. It must be regarded as the definitive account of the case, and for anybody who is interested it is invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you order..............","review":"Ordered 4 of these cushions and each one is different.

Budziszewski is clear, concise, and straight-to-the-point, even though he's addressing challenging worldview issues. From his experience and perspective as a professor, I appreciate his insight and response to the myths and oppositions posed in today's classroom.As a high school teacher, I work with students who come primarily from Christian backgrounds. This book offers wisdom from a biblical foundation and challenges students to evaluate what they really believe before they ever step foot on campus. I've enjoyed this book so much that I've made it mandatory reading in my college-bound classes. I also recommend it in my own book, JumpStart Your Future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire Christian Staff","review":"I think the key to keeping a campus Christian is to hire Christian staff. This book did not address this. In fact, it is illegal to hire only Christian staff, to ask if an applicant is Christian, etc. Another problem is that 'College' is a mechanism to allow students to grow and learn. This is stifled at a Chrisitan College. I find more judgement, more close-mindedness, less acceptance of others on a Christian campus than on secular campuses. Christian campuses tend to address the sins that they feel are BIG (premarital sex, homosexuality), while commonplace sins are overlooked (overeating, judgementalness, etc.). The book did not touch on such judgement at all. It needs more chapters and a more global approach..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful","review":"Have not heard from my youngest son if the book was helpful.

The author formats the information in a way that is easy to understand and to remember. If you want to be able to give answers to those who challenge your faith and want to be ready for the spiritual and intellectual battle in college, this is the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed every chapter. It was very encouraging to know that there is no reason that I can't stand up for my faith and be successful at it as well. The author gives great tips on how to respond to many different and common arguments against the Christianity. It was very difficult for me to put this book down after I began to read it. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ Like For Sure","review":"I am a college student as of know. I do believe this book to be a must read for the christian graduating from high school who wants to stay on the right path. I am one that was given this book for a graduation gift, but did not read because I was fed up with books and school. I have grown to know better and wish I had read this book sooner as it would have been a good help in walking a better christian life. I took two years off between school and decided to go back to college to get my smarts on verses breaking my back and not getting anywhere. My life has not been easy by any means but I do believe this book refers to me in so many ways and wish that students will take schooling and the walk towards christian life more seriously.Thank You Budziszewski,MTG"},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Just No.","review":"Before I read this book, I was a Christian with doubts who was about to go off to college. After I read this book, I was an atheist.Here's the gist of the advice given in the book:First, remember that your religion won't be taken seriously in college, and don't be disheartened by that fact. Second, never consider the possibility that there's a reason you won't be taken seriously. Third, do not engage in any sinful activities (shouldn't this be a given for Christians anyway?). Fourth, don't take criticism of Christianity seriously because that could endanger your eternal soul. So basically, you need to close your eyes, put your fingers in your ears, and say \\"lalalalala can't hear you; lalalalala can't hear you\\" whenever anyone questions your faith.My verdict is that if you want to stay a Christian in college, and you have doubts about your faith, don't read this book because it will make your doubts even stronger. There is no good advice and no real philosophical content in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Graduation Gift","review":"Professor Budziszewski does a great job at describing various world views, explaining the nature of truth & morality, sexuality, naturalism, the basics of theology, and more.This book would make a good Bible study or Sunday School lesson book for High School students as well. The chapters are short and thought provoking. The book not only challenges a person's thinking, but equips them to defend aspects of the Christian faith to relativists, naturalists, and post-moderns.The book has online resources available for further reading.I also recommend this book to any Christian teacher of high school or college students, and to any youth or college leaders at church. It will encourage many Christian students to stand strong on campus when their beliefs are being challenged by the professors or by friends in the dorm."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"Being a student who is preparing to go to college soon, I found this book quite insightful. J. Budziszewski covered lots of areas that a Christian might face in college. I like the part where he explained different world views, and then raised interesting questions regarding these views. They really fun to think about. Another reason I consisder this book worths reading is because this book deals with issues other than just staying Christian in college. Budziszewski also pointed out some important principles in Christianity; for example, the Trinity, heaven and hell, and the existence of evil was not created by God,etc. This book contains a large amount of information. There is a info box in almost every page. It has useful footnotes regarding a certain topic. I personally got a lot out of this book. Although some chapters are more exciting than others, the overall work is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as zep but still awsome","review":"This CD is very heavy on the drums but the vocals are lacking much, because he dosn't compare to Robert Plant.

It is equal bits caper film, slapstick, and filmmaking satire. It also allows Peter Sellers' fertile comic mind to run free as a master criminal masquerading as an Italian neo-realist filmmaker. Good supporting turns are given here by Victor Mature as a vain American movie star and Martin Balsam as Mature's exasperated agent. Britt Ekland, Sellers' wife at the time, is good as Sellers' incorrigible sister. Director Vittorio De Sica makes good use of the Italian locales and peoples the film with authentic locals. I was surprised that this film was scripted by Neil Simon because alot of his work is topheavy with verbal gags but this film is equally weighted with the visual and verbal jokes. A wonderful entry in the Peter Sellers canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Family's Cult Classic","review":"If you haven't been to Italy you won't 'get' this film. If you have, you'll agree this is the best of Sellers and Simon. Stellar contributions by Mature, Balsam and Eckland. Gags are a weird combo of obvious and intellectual. For 20 years our whole family's favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun","review":"I bought this film cheaply from a local store. It is very noisy film. People are running a lot and Sellers is making faces and jumping. That is not funny at all. It is also supposed to be a parody of film-making, but it is a very old hat. When one impovises and does not focus ones film that makes it a new wave film, the writers and Vittorio de Sica seem to be thinking. Shame on you, Vittorio! I give one star to Victor Mature who is great as old, egomanic film star. There is a car chase in the end, but it is among smoke clouds and one cannot see anything. That is funny, of course. Thus this is one-star film with a star added to Mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining riot of a movie!","review":"I'm not much into the real old movies unless it's some of the older Disney movies or the first 3 James Bonds. So one night before I was going to watch Blood And Wine, I checked this movie out. I was pleasantly surprised. Peter Sellers is a riot as Vanucci, a career thief, who poses as a movie director to steal a shipment of gold. The humor in every scenario is priceless. Especially the \\"movie\\" Vanucci makes with the \\"filming crew\\" when he has his sister (Britt Eklund) and a famous American actor (Victor Mature) running on the beach and sitting at a table talking about absolutely nothing. Mature as the gullible American actor is a scene stealer. Him and Sellers are my 2 favorite characters in this movie. After The Fox is a little campy, but it certainly makes up for that with the laugh out loud moments. This is an older movie you truly don't want to miss out on. It's pure comedy gold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A HILAROUS MOVIE","review":"You all have GOT TO SEE THIS.It is the most funniest movie I have ever seen.Peter Sellers , playing a thief is really funny.Peter Sellers:(You are never to mention acting again and you are to put down that flowerpot.)Britt Ekland:(When I walk down the street people will say thats her,thats Gina Romantica.)Mamma Vancciu(I dont want pots, I want GRANDCHILDREN!!!!!!!!!)Victor mature( Why dont you just put me in a wheelchair and have me roll into the old acting home.)

I contacted Sony via website \\"chat\\" and after wasting about 30 minutes troubleshooting the unit with the \\"analyst\\", she told me the unit required repair. She sent me to the repair website and I discovered the $79 exchange program. Like someone else here said, you can buy a new one cheaper than that and who knows how long the process would take.

The song conveys so much emotion amd power. Other songs that stand out are \\"One Big Rush\\", \\"Big Bad Moon\\", and the title track.

The title track is one of Joe's best songs he's ever done. Joe's guitar playing is bone chilling and beautiful. He even sings on a few songs such as I BELIEVE; which is a very good song. Joe plays all the instruments, except the drums. Nobody plays instrumental hard rock like Joe does. There isn't a bad song on this CD. Joe's guitar playing is worth the price of this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Underrated Album","review":"First of all, I just need to say that Joe Satriani is one of, if not the best rock guitarist out there. Nobody else can play guitar phrases like he can, and nobody writes intrumentals like he does. The album has so many great songs, including one which everyone overlooks. The last masterpiece at the tail end of the cd called Into The Light is my favorite song on the cd. The first time I heard it, the song gave me chills. There is an element of power and awe that is screaming from the mood of the song, and its too bad that its only a little over 2 minutes long. I listen to this song at least three times before I take it out of my cd player.Joe Satriani is probably one of the most talented musicians in rock music, and with only the likes of Eddie Van Halen and Eric Johnson rivaling him, I firmly believe he is the best. Nobody else can write an instrumental with a much power and outward feeling as Satch can. Buy this album, and own a masterpiece.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once in a lifetime...","review":"... there comes a guitar player who truly drops jaws and burns ears with his music.

The main melody of that song is something I'll never tire of.The rest? Some very good, some OK, some forgettable ('Strange' and 'I Believe' come to mind).Also, Joe's guitar tone on this CD is very produced and \\"Squawky\\" sounding. I much prefer the more organic tone he has now.As with many late 80's rock records, the bass guitar is pretty buried in the mix, very little bottom end \\"oomph\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"One of my favorite albums - and I just bought it for a friend who's a Satriani fan, too.

They make you want to desert and join the enemy.Besides that, this game is nothing but aim and shoot. That's it. In Star Fox you had to learn trick flying so you could fly between buildings and under bridges, maneuver around obstacles and outfox your attackers. You were looping and dodging the whole time while you shot at bogies, like an old-fashioned fighter plane dogfight.In Jedi Starfighter you don't even get the feeling your ship is in motion. It's like you're almost stationary, turning around in circles looking for stuff to shoot at, which to me gets really boring in a short amount of time.

Whittaker paid the price and would today be proud that much of his suffering was not in vain. Never underestimate what the Lord God can do with one suffering servant who is willing to face the truth and call him Lord. This book was a great blessing, but also a serious warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"After almost 60 years!","review":"I just read \\"Witness\\" after almost 60 years. Terrific!

Communism is a crisis of faith according to Mr. Chambers. Mr. Chambers' conversion to Christianity plays a major role in his change of heart and mind.The writing is good and the story is interesting. At times, however, I did feel that he would linger on a topic a little too long or go into greater detail than what was necessary. Small potatoes compared to the light he sheds on some heavy issues.Overall an interesting and enlightening read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whittaker Chambers, 20th cetury hero","review":"This book is more than an account of a trial or a political movement--it is an account of a \\"suffering servant\\". Chambers was truly an American hero as well as a prophet. He not only unmasks Soviet Communism, he also paints a dark picture of the materialistic nihilism that animates the West. If he had lived to see the universal homogeneous society that our world has become he would not have been surprised. He considered himself in the tradition of the Russian radicals of the 19th century--those radicals who destroyed themselves to fight injustice--and his life was consistent with this. Today he is castigated as a \\"conservative\\" by the fashionable left . He abhorred being called a conservative-preferring \\"man of the right\\". He was much more than any ideological label can convey. Instead he was closer to the Old Testament figures who dared to call the people back to Truth. Like many of them he was destroyed for it. Experience this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read !","review":"Whittaker Chamber's Witness is one of those books that must be read. Chambers details how hebecame a communist, what caused him to break with the organization, and the impact of the Hiss trial.Nowadays most people do not really know anything about the Hiss trial, nor do most people understandhow pervasive the communist threat to our government had become. Chambers decribes in detail howthe communists operated, how they infiltrated the U.S government and their reaction to Chambersmutiny. Witness is a tale of redemption that inspires faith while detaling the failures of Statism.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Chambers is not a conservative. He is a collectivist who switched from an atheist collectivist philosophy to a mystical Christian collectivist philosophy.

Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joe McCarthy, & retired Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who betrayed his most trusted aide, Gen. Marshall, in his quest for the 1952 Republican Presidential nomination.

They sound nice, although sometimes I get the feeling I'm listening to two systems at the same time--one with limited bass, the other a subwoofer--while at other times, on different music, it sounds okay. Hard to imagine that the little drivers extend downward to where the subwoofers roll off.The small satellite speakers look nice, but there's no rearward extension of the foot, so I've knocked mine over many times. Also, with a slightly different design, they could have accommodated 1.5\\" microdrivers, with 2.25 times as much piston area, and within the same footprint. I doubt manufacturing cost would have changed much, but midbass performance would have been greatly enhanced. Makes one wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I paid full price for these and have only kept them because of the small satellite speakers and the shape of the subwoofer; these just happened to fit the spaces I had.There is little midrange. For as large a subwoofer as this is, the actually output is quite muddy and getting the right balance can be difficult. There is no left right balance or general tone control...the bass level is on the back of the subwoofer (very bad idea).For my setup, having the main level and power on a remote control was perfect, since the speakers are not in arms reach, which is where most systems have the controls.I would look at other systems unless the specific design features are essential, as they were for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound, and quite eye-catching!","review":"I bought these speakers for a friend of mine this Christmas. What a buy! As soon as we plugged them in, I knew had made a good purchase. I compared them to a similarly priced set from Monsoon and it won hands down in both clarity and sheer strength of bass. I recommend these speakers to anyone with a small budget but large expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look cool. Sound great.","review":"I can't understand why reviewers here haven't consistently rated these speakers at 5 stars. I have these speakers in my office and they sound truly incredible. Maybe it has something to do with room acoustics?I also have Monsoon MH500s at home. These sound much worse, both in terms of imaging and the level of distortion at higher volume levels.Given that they both cost about the same, I would go with the Altec Lansing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low for A.L.","review":"Its not so much that these are low quality speakers--the sats have survived many drop tests. And they're actually pretty loud. The problem lies in the use of multiple small drivers in the sats rather than a 2-way high/mid configuration. Also, the subwoofer, while powerful, has horrible clarity. The result is lacking midrange and muddy bass--acceptable for games, but certainly not for music.Also, the 1/8\\" inputs kept giving me trouble. They'd come loose at random. I suspect they were defective. In any case, I replaced them with 1/4\\" jacks. Problem solved.If you're a gamer, don't plan to listen to music, and you can find a really good deal on these, they might be an okay choice. I got mine free, and given that, I'm happy enough with them. But, they're certainly not worth the retail price. Do yourself a favor and buy some quality speakers from Klipsch or Telex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look great, sound marginal.","review":"I put these side by side with the Altec ATP3s, and there was no comparison. The 2100s cost twice as much and sounded half as good.At the volume level I use in my office, the highs on the 2100s were very flat and the sub was muffled.I'm still looking for the best solution, but the 2100s were not it.(although they look great!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"I bought these speakers, and although the sub sounds good, the satellites give off a very tiny sound. It may be OK for games, but if you like to listen to music on your PC these are NOT the speakers to get.Secondly, they output very loud static whether they are plugged to the sound card or not. Altec Lansing tech support is of no help. One rep told me to exchange them because they were probably defective (which I did, and it made no difference), and another rep told me it was normal. I think all 2100 will exhibit this phenomenon, and if you work in a silent environment it is VERY annoying.I got instead the Altec Lansing 621 for 30$ more.

Problems include freezing up for no apparent reason, scrolling in Chinese, and the most irritating is when the \\"system files are missing\\" and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload ALL of your music (does this alot). The company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email. I have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back, and then one of them crashed again as soon as I got all the music redownloaded and I had to return it and wait another 3 weeks. I have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iRiver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online.

I was able to deal with the the machine freezing (by keeping a paper clip handy and pressing the reset button). I also had a lot of patience when entire cd's were mysteriously disappearing and I had to upload the cd's again. Now, the scroll pad/volume bar is not working at all rendering this player practically useless. (If I select \\"All\\" I can hear each song on every CD in alphabetical order but that's about it.)I'm trying to figure out if I can send this in for repair or just consider it useless and go for the Toshiba Gigabeat (30 GB) which seems to be pretty reliable.I received the Iriver as a gift but wouldn't dare buy any of their products and would strongly advise anyone else against throwing their money away on Iriver."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bout sending me one that works!!!","review":"I received one from Amazon and it was defective out of the box.

Song organization, music playback, and menu interface are all superb. A very neat feature is the player's ability to record from the radio. I have found this very handy. And of course, the text compatability is great and easy to navigate.However, there are some annoyances here and there. Navigating menus isn't smooth, especially when compared to the iPod photo. There are occasional load times and the scroll speed could be a bit faster. Also, loading playlists onto the player can be tricky. The learning curve on this player is definitely steeper than the iPod.Overall, the player is worth its cost. I would only recommend this player if you are buying it for the extra features, such as FM radio, text compatability, and voice recording. Otherwise, you should go for the iPod photo's smoother menus, elegant design, and ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS PLAYER!","review":"This is a great first time mp3 player.

The resest button clears it up with no loss to memory. Plus my experince with their customer service was really pleasant. I called them with a problem and had an answer and my problem fixed in under 5 minutes.

Even when you are generous to Churchland's arguments, they often turn out to not be arguments at all. Granted, issues like materialism, mentalism, and dualism are difficult to find solid ground on. What I object to is that he portrays as crystal clear arguments which aren't even logical, even if you grant his premises are true (which they often aren't). Obviously I can't give an in-depth criticism here, but I have a short paper on the topic. Anyways, you may want to find a more complete and more careful text.

His life is shaped by his Texas heroes, river rafting like Huck Finn, selling newspapers on a Houston street corner, listening to war news on the radio and being confined for months to bed by rheumatic fever.I'm surprised that Rather didn't apply his wordsmithing to this, but worked with a co-writer. The result is not of the quality of Angela's Ashes; lacking compelling detail and life or death feelings. Still, it helps define the character building influences of a figure familiar to Americans from their daily TV news.

Fiction writing-wise,this novel is badly written. The characters' actions and words are artificial, the narration is sloppy, he uses passive word description in scenes describing action, and overall the book is not believable. The claim that Larson wrote this to explain away certain events in his \\"ministry\\" IMO has some validity.

Its taste is almost identical, though the color is a bit lighter than brewed thai tea. still, this is GOOD STUFF!!!Highly recommended! Skip the powder and get this stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Good","review":"For some reason, the review I posted on this CD on 8/14/02 has been deleted.This CD is one of the most awesome, God-inspired, soul-stirring CD's I have ever heard in my life. The style varies from song to song, which only enhances the CD as far as I'm concerned. Some of the songs have a country and western feel, some have a contemporary feel, some sound southern gospel, and then there is one that even sounds like something from the Big Band era.I love this CD and wouldn't take anything for it. I would personally like to thank the GVB for recording such a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!","review":"I have to say that I agree with one of my fellow reviewers when I say that this album seems to be a step in the wrong direction for the Gaither Vocal Band. EVERY song on the album sound the same...very long and very laborious. I was so very disappointed with this recording.I certainly hope that they don't feel the need to perform only these songs during live Homecoming events. The material here is poor quality compared to the last several releases from the quartet.Here's hoping for better projects in the very near future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Let Down","review":"Bill Gaither is the most talented Christian music writer in our history. However, I wonder what he was thinking with this album. I agree that Russ Taff has way too many solos on this album. With this \\"very country\\" CD and the addition of Russ Taff, it is appearant that Mr. Gaither wants to appeal more to the older audience. The people who were with me at the David Phelps solo concert that loved \\"I Do Believe\\" will not like this album, along with myself. The good points: Alpha and Omega and I Pledge My Allegiance. I love David Phelps, but even It Is Finished is over the top with that little solo accapella part. There is a better version of It Is Finished on the Irish Homecoming. I understand that with new talent, you can rehash some old stuff and make it \\"like new\\" but if it is not broken, don't fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!!","review":"I must say, that unfortunately, I agree with those who voice their disappointment in this latest GVB project -- what happened? Well, Mark Lowry left, for one thing - and I have to say I wasn't thrilled with the addition of Russ Taff. I have to say that I think \\"The Really Good News\\" is one of the corniest songs I have ever heard, and should never have been included on this album. Like another reviewer, I was disappointed with the arrangement of \\"It is Finished\\" - just not what I was hoping for. The album features Russ Taff in solos way to much for my tastes, and sticks David Phelps up on the shelf. I am a loyal GVB fan, and I was really looking forward to this CD's release, but all I could think was, \\"what a bunch of junk.\\" Except for \\"Alpha and Omega\\", this is not the GVB I have grown to love over the years - give me more like \\"God is Good\\" and \\"I Do Believe\\" !! If you are considering this as a first GVB purchase, STOP! and buy one of the others instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUBPAR","review":"Coming off three of the best GVB albums ever, this falls short of the mark. The album has none of the magic that has been present in past projects. The songs all seem to be the same and the vocals do not showcase the talent of the group. Russ Taff sings way too many solos. I don't know what went wrong but I hope they fix it before the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Everything Good\\" not so good.","review":"I found this album disappointing. Both the song selections and the vocals are lackluster. Mark Lowry left the band this year and David Phelps's magnificent tenor has been kept in the background on this new CD. Too bad.

The quality of print is great and I take this opportunity to thank Amazon for doing this great service.Regards,Anirban Biswas."},{"rating":"1","title":"distinctively scattered","review":"This book, although the plot could be interesting, it jumps without any clues from present to past, life to death. I was too busy thinking about what part of the story I was in to really appreciate the story line. After I read several pages, I got to actually think about what was going on. The book can be enjoyed, because I think the story line could be interesting just too much detail is involved. I don't reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must read but only in Spanish","review":"Pedro Páramo is a beautifully written novel, in Spanish. In Spanish, the narration of Juan Preciado is lyrical, stark, simple and engaging. This translation makes the narrative sound like a female voice, and American, and there are mistakes in it that are unforgiveable. It lacks the hypnotic lyricism of the original. One leaves this translation with the thought that the translator neither understood Spanish well enough to do justice to the original, which is a masterpiece, nor could she write well enough in English to have attempted it. Translation is an art, but the translator should be like the lighting director in a theatre, someone you don't see but whose work makes magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book echoes ... Rulfo shows, not tells.","review":"I got lost with Pedro Paramo in this hauntingly surrealistic trek. This book echoes, it trickles down through time and you can hear the rain and the voices Pedro Paramo hears. The scattered, translucent images he creates come together at the end, upon reflection. A journey into a whole past that creates, shapes, and even destroys is often confusing and disjointed. Rulfo SHOWS that, not tells. Likewise, he invites us to look at our own lives and our own past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostly, glancing and wonderous","review":"Rulfo's narrative technique is incredibly delicate. He moves between numerous lives (and afterlives) in a small village. Everyone in this book seems haunted, both literally and implicitly by the actions, angers and jealousy's and lusts of those around them. The constant time shifts are brilliantly executed, and Rulfo is able to bring out these incredibly small moments of tenderness and pathos in a small amount of space. A glancing, evocative work. Almost like listening to an old Spanish guitar recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"The book is very good and very well written. The book is about a man named Juan, who is off to Comala, becuase of a promise he made his mother on her death bed. The promise was to go back to Comala in search for his father. He arrives to the town not knowing what the town is all about. As he goes in search for his father, the mystry continues and the plot thickens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Says more with silence than with words.","review":"Rulfo worked on this novel his whole life, and it's only 115 pages. This indicates his mastery of saying much with few words. Not for the casual reader or the pulp-fiction reader, this novel evokes a feeling of distant place. Lends insight into a feudal, rural Mexico that transformed itself, leaving ghost towns scattered around the countryside. Bleeding the residents of the town are a church that offers no redemption, a constant band of guerillas, and of course Pedro Paramo, the self-indulgent \\"owner\\" of the town, whose travails trickle down to affect everyone. Worth every moment - this book is meant to haunt you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Perhaps I am just not \\"surreal\\" enough to comprehend this kind of work but, regardless, I was completely lost while reading this book. From what I have read, disorienting his reader was one of Rudalfo's intentions, but it didn't work for me. It was one of those book that I continually had to re-read sections of to try to orient myself in the story and I was never able to."},{"rating":"1","title":"way to confusing!!!","review":"this book is way to confusing when you read it. You must keep detailed notes of everything just to get some points."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the depth of a cheerleading squad","review":"This book is trash! It has the same amount of depth and enjoyment as a Carrot Top movie. Some critics consider this a masterpiece, but it's not. The plot is unintelligable. It's my personal opinion that Juan Rulfo wrote this story after taking a few too many hits of acid. The narration constantly switches between random, unknown characters, and often, the reader is left clueless as to who is narrating the novel. The story isn't haunting, exciting, or memorable, rather it's like rape, it's something that you hope you can just repress and try and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing, yet one have to appreciate its narrative style","review":"I read the original version of it in Spanish, from what I have found so far from research, most translations of this book are pretty bad. There are lots of allegories and historical backgrounds in there, one cannot disregard all the content just because it seems confusing.And to get any award for something, a book has to go through lots of consideration. If the book was really such a horrible book do you think the judges of the award would risk their reputation supporting a \\"bad\\" book?I guess if you are fluent in Spanish I strongly suggest reading it in Spanish, or if you are a Latin American History major or Mexican history. This is a breath of fresh air, the book breaks all conventional narratives. I personally love \\"Continuidad de los parques\\" of Julio Cortazar. So if you like him you will definitely find this book a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but nothing compares to the original book in Spanish","review":"I am pleased to find the translation of Pedro Páramo, as I have been recommending this book to friends for a long time. I read it originally in Spanish and made a huge impact on me. I also read the English version, and thought it was a fair translation but nothing, nothing, compares to the original book in its original language.If any of you is learning Spanish, make it a goal to read this book in its original language, as Juan Rulfo heard it in his head while writing it. It is a magic, dreamy, spooky book. Its unique and difficult to describe but very worth the time spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide for novel scientist","review":"About this book the author write: \\"...It is intended to be an essential nonanalytical introduction to high vacuum technology for engineers and technicians who would like to have a general orientation before proceeding to a more technical and scientifically rigorous text...\\". But I want to add: there are many parts that stimulate to attention even a scientist, not only engineers and technicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and Effective","review":"This is a great DVD and it does make you sweat. I am an intermediate/low advanced exerciser. You can combine segments for a 1 hr even a 1-1/2 hr workout and I am sure you will definitely sweat! Most of the cardio workouts are high impact so it's impossible not to be challenged unless you are a very advanced exerciser. The moves are basic and athletic so anyone can easily follow her. This DVD is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Go-To-Workout when I need to get moving","review":"This is my go-to-workout. I started out using the Self and Shape DVDs, plus bellydance. As I've gotten stronger, though, I've started doing this video more. And when I'm short on time (who isn't?!), this gets me moving and breaking a sweat - FAST!!Meghan White's Ultimate Body Workout is my 'kick-my-butt-in-gear-and-get-it-moving' choice. This has it all - four different types of cardio, all sorts of strength routines - upper, lower and three different ABS routines.Be warned though - it is not for beginners. I worked up to doing this over a period of three months. I figure in another four to six weeks I'll be ready to do one of the 'full' 45 minute workouts. It is high impact and if you have knee or back problems, this might not be for you - Meghan likes lots of jumping jacks, running in place and ski jumps. Check with your doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, annoying instructor","review":"This was filmed in a very dark studio with people who don't know the routines. Very basic moves with little direction. The instructor seems to be getting cues from behind the camera and then remembers to change the routine. She seems a little surprised to find herself leading a workout video and will suddenly scream out. I only keep it around for abs when my workout doesn't include my core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Nice video. The instruction was pretty simple and could be a bit tighter, but I was more concerned with workout intensity and whether or not it got my heart racing. The video not only did that but offered several different optional workouts to chose from which targeted various bodyparts which in my case was hips and thighs and/or offered several different timed workouts thatwere great for days when I do not have a great deal of time to exercise and none the less want to think too much about devising a program shorter than my normal routine.The instructor looked great and offered up some helpful fitness and diet tips on the video. Id say I was pretty happy with the video and recommend for those looking for something different but produces results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Solution for Quick Fat Loss","review":"After having my second baby, I wanted a workout video that would allow me to get in a quick challenging workout at home and shed those baby pounds. This DVD is incredible, offering tons of options, which is what Im most thrilled about. I am able to get in my standard 90 minute morning workout by incorporating the strength training and ab routines along with the cardio. The instructor is very lively without being cheesy or too perky. Nonetheless Ive recommended the dvd to all my girlfriends. I've shed 10 pouunds in just a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of workout...","review":"The workouts in this dvd are decent, but I couldn't get past the off-beat cues and the instructor's unpleasant voice. I felt like I was working out backwards half the time because the instructor signaled right/left movements according to her right/left and not the viewers. The music was good on some of the workouts and awful on the others. I didn't like it and think there are way better workout dvds to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick workouts!","review":"I enjoy this DVD because it lets me pick the workout routine I want. I use this DVD to supplement my existing cardio workout with the quick strength training sections. The upper and lower body strength training sections are easy to follow, but challenging enough to give me a good workout.I have not tried the Boot Camp portions of the DVD, but enjoyed the Kickboxing workout.I wouldn't use this as my primary workout, but for the price and variety, it is worth the low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money! I wish I would have!!!!","review":"I purchased this DVD based on some of the reviews. I am an avid exerciser and love to find new DVD's that are challenging. Boy was I sorry I spent the twenty dollars plus shipping and handling on this one. It is terrible. The set is horrible, the instructor has a mousy voice that is barely audible and the man who works out behind her looks like he is tired and just wants to lay down and take a nap! The instructor looks awkward when throwing punches, all the moves are so boring, and the music is even worse. Save your money, if you want a really great aerobic workout with kickboxing moves go for the Tae-Bo tapes, or Kathy Smith's kickboxing video, they have motivating instructors, great music, and visually appealing workout sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!!!","review":"I have enjoyed all of the segments of this video. The bootcamp and kickboxing parts are a great cardio workout and really get your heart rate up. The weights segment is a quick (30 min) but effective workout. There is also an option to do a 25 minute abs segment as well. I'm pretty picky when it comes to workout videos but this one is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical genius","review":"Joe Satriani is a musical genius.

This book is excellent; it is one of the top three books of the series. The book is well-written and is loaded with action from the first chapter to the last. There is an interesting collection of memorable criminals and the Hardys frequently come into contact with them. Both editions are excellent, but I recommend reading the original, only because it prolongs your enjoyment. This is a great book that all Hardy Boys fans should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is for kids","review":"Not to be too critical, but the poems in this book are very simple, unemotional and very predictable.

Kate Brady is a 20-ish farm lass just come to big city Dublin, eager for life and a first taste of love. Gawky as a colt, her greatest wish is to experience grand passion, hopefully in a \\"sophisticated\\" love affair. Enter Eugene, nearly twice her age, who finds Kate charming but hopelessly naive. Winsome, shy Kate finds ways of beguiling her way into his affections, and although Eugene makes no secret of intending nothing permanent, to Kate, this budding relationship means everything.Rita Tushingham as Kate is natural and charming, and a very young Lynn Redgrave, in her first role, provides much needed splashes of humor in her roommate role. The scenes in which Kate's father bulls his way into a resuce attempt are priceless. Peter Finch as Eugene is convincingly worldy and jaded.Though set in the swinging sixties, the themes of this film are timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"it gave me a headache","review":"I did not like this movie because it was very dull.

I especially enjoyed learning about early American history that is hard to find elsewhere. This book was not only informative but a fun read as well. My only criticism would be when, on occasion, Mr. Coulombe makes reference to contemporary politcs - it not only deviates from the story but is unnecessary. For example, when he cautions about purchasing Cuban rum because \\"..profits prop up the oppressive Castro regime\\" but then fails to realize that the average Haitian (which has effectively been under US control for the last 100 years) would trade their lives with the average Cuban in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great and are stronger than expected!","review":"I have to say, I was pretty pleased with these.

The adhesive does not close, has to be taped shut, and two of them have to be used or they will split apart in mailing. Very disappointing.

Do note, though, that not all of these are \\"healthy\\"--many of them require good amounts of sesame oil and or margarine. But I don't care--what a great book. I've gotten it for family and friends, and my dad (yes, my dad!) even had second helpings of the country ham tofu. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and buy this book.","review":"This book is what all cookbooks should be like. Witty, informative, full of personality, and sopping with delicious recipes. I love the balance of recipes that you can whip up in a jiffy with common pantry items alongside recipes that use less common ingredients. Many fine vegan and vegetarian cooking books are relegated to the bottom shelf because they require three hours and 27 ingredients only available at natural foods stores. It also gives a nice variety of healthier items (greens, greens, greens!) and trashier snack foods that you know you secretly love, but don't want to admit (bacon and egg candy). Plenty of vegan and vegetarian options abound. The author clearly loves her southern roots and shows it through her sweet-and-sassy writing style and classic (yet vegetarian) southern recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillbilly cooking","review":"This book is cute and witty but not at all what I expected, or wanted, in recipes. Makes Southern people look/sound like fools with their titles. I will be returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegan Southern Style","review":"Don't let anybody tell you anymore that being vegan means giving up all your old-time favorite flavors! What a great book for home cooking! I made the \\"Fried Chicken Tofu\\" and my carnivore friend who practically eats ONLY meat ate it all (before learning what it really was), and the Bar-Be-Que Beans are addictive, just as the author says. If you like spoonbread and creamed corn and greens & all that but wondered how to fix it vegan, this is your cookbook. Some recipes are high-fat, but you can be sensible and have them as once-in-a-while treats."},{"rating":"2","title":"best driving game i've played on the playstation","review":"In my opinion TIJ( The Italian Job) is by far the best driving game on playstation 1. It sorta reminded me of rockstar's GTA series except u can't go shooting ppl. I think that the time limit on the missions helps make the game go by faster.Some of the missions in the game althought seeming pointless r funny none the less. If i had a choice between this game and all the other ps1 driving games i'd definitely choose this.

I dunno...","review":"Well, concert performances are fabulous I admit, but I felt like, Joe didn't try as hard as he does usually, in studio works... Like, he recorded these stuff in one boring studio day... Perhaps greatest disappointment since the song called \\"snake\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the really unfit","review":"This book looks like a great plan to follow to get fit - if you're young, or fairly fit to begin with. On day 1, for example, you're supposed to run to 10 minutes. Well, if I could run for 10 minutes, I wouldn't need a book to get me in shape! If I could run for 10 minutes, that would probably mean running for more than a mile, since I can walk a mile in under 15 minutes.The author, in the preface, explains that he came upon the running-keeps-you-fit realization while in graduate school, after having gained 7 pounds (horrors!) over the course of a semester. So, if that's the kind of weight problem you have, this book is probably great. But if you're middle aged, have been inactive for years, and have a weight problem that's a little more like that of mosy Americans looking fro diet books, this book won't work until you get a lot fitter first."},{"rating":"1","title":"ETO a real disappointment... Stick with an Etch a Sketch","review":"I was real excited since I grew up with an etch a sketch and wanted my 4 year old (Eto for ages 4 and Up) to get the new state of the art ETO ( Electronic Etch a Sketch).I took it out of the package and looked at the manual (not very detailed). I plugged it into the TV and figured I would try it first so I could teach my little one.Summary1. Interface is very hard to use. They needed a much easier menu system. If I'm an adult having a hard time using it, imagine a little one. I have never had a problem using any time of computer/video game system,etc until this unit (ETO)2. Joystick like control is very tough to move around for an adult let alone a child3. Graphics are not very clear on any TV set I tried it on. Text is quite blurry as wellConclusionStick with the old etch a sketch with the knobs and aluminum powder... It's tried and True and has worked since the 50's and hope that the next version of ETO is much easier to use......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable excuse for a child's toy...","review":"This toy was entirely too difficult for my 6 yr. old to figure out. She begged for it because the commercials looked fun but once \\"Santa\\" brought it, she hates it (and is mad at Santa for not knowing!). My husband and my teenagers all tried to figure it out and when they finally did, the graphics were terrible and it is not fun to play with.

I bought this for my alomost 5 year old daughter on Christmas. She was so excited and we plugged it in right away. That was the only thing that I could figure out how to do. I am not a dummie when it comes to gadgets like this but for the life of me, I could not figure this thing out. I read the instructions over and over and just gave up. We took it back 2 days later. Extremely disappointed! Don't do it to yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this thing all about?","review":"I bought this for my seven year-old this christmas. It's the only real dissapointment this year. My kids (7 and 11) tried first, without reading the instructions of course, and couldn't figure it out. They decided it must need 'cartridges' or something to work, based upon the available port on the front.I tried it myself with the instructions. It is of course completely self-contained and needs nothing more to access the 3 games that are internal to the unit.The icons are so pixelly on screen and the instructions printed so small that I really struggled to try and work it out.It shouldn't be like this. This is the kind of toy that a seven year-old should be able to pick up and use intuitively. Sure it can have advanced features and require some learning, I'm not saying it should be too shallow, BUT unless it's fun the first time it's picked up, it's not going to get picked up a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I bought this toy for my 5 and 7 year old daughters. I plugged it in and found the graphics to be very pixel like. The pictures and the words were very hard to concentrate on. They seemed to move continuously. The price was good and the ease of use was great. My daughters caught on to the game very quickly, but I ended up returning it due to the fact that I was getting a headache watching it and so was my oldest. Great idea, just better the graphics please."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book, but.....","review":"I have the utmost respect for Ann Wigmore because she was the one who started it all when it comes to a raw food diet. I wish I had known about her years ago. I have this book as well as others by Ann Wigmore, I also have videos of hers but I never use any of them.Raw food recipes have come a long way since the Ann Wigmore days. Although many of them have gotten away from being as healthy as Ann's were, the recipes are much more palatable.It is very difficult to jump into a lifestyle of raw and living foods with the recipes in this book.I wouldn't take anything for my copy but don't really recommend to newbies because you may get discouraged if you try these. In just starting out I would recommend Annie Phyio or Matthew Kenney. Alissa Cohen is good if you like a lot of nuts and don't want to lose weight. Rhonda Malkmus is good if you just want to go 80% raw and the other being a healthy cooked 20%."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this author!","review":"I love this author so anything by her is fantastic!

While I had been to Disneyland several times before as a single and parent I wanted to get a better feel for the larger Disneyworld. This book is packed with info and would be especially helpful for someone or a family that had NEVER been to either one of the Disney parks. The information is accurate and well presented. We were able to gleam a few helpful tips and it helped with our planning of what parks to visit on what days although we did not follow the suggested touring plans verbatim.

For under $15 this book will help make sure you get the most for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"As a first time visitor to Disney World I was looking for something that would help me to maximize the trip for my family.

Very informative and when used with index you will find what you need fairly quick. Nice grouping of subjects...(what appeals to toddlers or senior, etc.) I would have give 5 stars but book was too bulky to carry in the park, for that I used EZ Fun Guide to WDW.

We found it in this book. Rating everything from rides to restaurants, with background information you won't find in official publications, and a healthy dollop of humor, \\"The Unofficial Guide\\" is an excellent (and huge) source of information. I just got the 2007 version of the book before we go on another trip, and I'm ripping through it to find changes that had happened to the park since our last trip.

We knew where and when to go, we skipped attractions that the kids would not have liked and really enjoyed the day (and I mean, it was almost 100F, no joke).

This book must go to press long before its competitors, because for the past few years those books contained information that this one did not (i.e. Everest ride at Animal Kingdon was missing from the 2006 edition of this book, but was detailed in the Passporter book).Yes, this is a detailed volume full of statistical analysis. Only the most obsessive-compulsive control freak needs this much info, believe me! That said, if you want to spend your vacation racing around theme parks so that you can brag that you saw the entire park before lunch, this is the book for you. If you want to have a good idea of what to expect before you get to Disney World, but don't want every moment of your stay to be planned down to the last second, then grab one of the other fine books on the subject.Either way, have FUN.

I'm sure the info is factual, but for some reason, there's so much of it to wade through, and much of the details were extraneous to me. The Birnbaum book cuts to the chase - easier reading and more practical advice. Buy the Birnbaum book, not this one, unless you are obsessed with details.

It also did not give clear instructions for those of us who were \\"park hoppers.\\" No good instructions on touring one park in the morning and another one later.

If you don't use it as your only source when deciding your views of Castro and U.S. policies toward Cuba, you will enjoy it in the same way you might enjoy some of the Chinese propaganda films during Chairman Mao's reign.

Go back to singing about banana boats, Harry, that's where your talents lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Propaganda.","review":"This movie was somewhat astounding to me as, from the very beginning, it makes a point of depicting Fidel Castro in the kindest of lights. We see him as a man and a man alone which, frankly, is not an honest way to portray him. Certainly, humanizing him is appropriate as a human being is exactly what this mass murderer is, but to treat him as an underdog is to miss the real point of his reign--regardless of what Harry Belafonte might think. The increased poverty and suffering of the Cuban population that he produced is what should be remembered first and foremost. I refer viewers to Ron Radosh's memoirs if they'd like to know what its like in Cuba in the eyes of a disinterested third party or the other excellent works written about him like Against All Hope or Inside the Pirate's Den. In Cuba today, the arrests continue as does Castro's repulsive totalitarian regime. I do not wish death upon Mr. Castro, but hope Revolucion! ends as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIDEL: The Untold Story","review":"This is very good and quite comprehensive as a look at Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution. While clearly pro-Castro, this documentary does not cross the line from objectivity to total hagiography. The charismatic quality of Fidel Castro is evident in this film and explains why he remains such a popular figure in the Southern Hemisphere and in the World at large. Really good film footage of archival newsreels of Castro's speeches and color film through the 1990's. A good personal look at Castro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!","review":"We have used several different types and brands of these in the past.

I have only had them for a few weeks and they look like I've had them for years.Never will I buy this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Sheets!","review":"These sheets are beautiful and very vibrant.

Unfortunately, after several washings (over the course of about 2 months) they began to pull and get those annoying little balls of fabric. Those are not exactly soft and luxurious feeling. No matter what I do, I cannot get those darn things off. No amount of running them in the dryer, etc will de-fuzz them. Overall I am disappointed with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Sound Direction But Few Thrills","review":"Intruder is made up of some of the members from New Jersey band Shotgun Symphony and George Karak who co-wrote Runnaway, Bon Jovi's debut hit. The album as a whole is very enjoyable and great try for 1998 when producing 80's stadium rock style album itself was a feat. Heart On A Loose is an excellent rendition of Survivor's Jackie Don't Go. But that's it. Songs are predictable at best and have few thrills. They should have searched for not 80's copycats but the sound of their own. I would be more interested in Shotgun Symphony works and their second album \\"Believe\\" which should have more \\"their\\" sounds. Recommended for Escape music fans and some of Survivor and Two Fires fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this book","review":"This was a great historical romance ... highly recommend it! What an amazing woman who lived an incredible life in an interesting time in our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This story made for a really interesting read. I enjoyed the story, but a warning that the book is pretty sad. However, I like the way the story went and ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Historical Romance","review":"I loved this book. Ms. Ware drops one into the eighteenth century with the first paragraph. The characters were engaging and the romance was heartfelt. I immediately searched out background on Jane Maxwell after finishing - I didn't want the story to end.My only issue was the Kindle formatting. I had paid $7.99, not $2.99, and for the price I expected a more professional presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNFORGETABLE LOVE STORY","review":"I picked up this book never expecting it to be such an entriging love story. However, when I got into it, I could not put it down. I have never been interested in the British perspective on the American Revoltution, but the story of Jane Maxwell, Thomas Fraser and the Duke of Gordon was gripping. My fasination with this story is sorting out what was real and what was fiction. I have tried, rather successfully to research Alexander, the 4th Duke of Gordon. I was able to pinpoint several facts in history, but haven't been too successful with the characters. Does anyone know? The author details in the back of the book her exhaustive search for her Scottish linage to Jane Maxwell, but I was just curious how much was true. Great book, I loved it and will probably reread it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Duchess Deserves Better","review":"Historically interesting, but lackluster in literary qualities. The largely romantic life of the Duchess of Gordon, unhappily married to the Duke, a misogynist, and in love with Thomas Fraser, a Highland soldier. What the Duchess sees in this man, I'll never understand. He's certainly not her match on any level.What keeps one reading is that the book is peppered with historical figures who are fun to look up, and the reader keeps rooting for the Duchess to win her battle against the restrictions of her class and societal norms. Sadly, she doesn't, remaining chattel to the end of her days. Ware does not disappoint in creating a fiction based on fact of a woman who became a potent force in British politics and in private life. But she does so with little nuance in characterization, relying on the \\"and then\\" to propel readers along. Surely there was more to this woman than her love life and marital woes? I won't be reading any more books by Ciji Ware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I did not finish this book, which is rare for me. The characters lacked depth, the dialogue was superficial and the book was one big soap opera in my opinion. I bought this book based on reviews that compared it favorably to the Outlander series, which I love. There is no comparison whatsoever. Ware is definitely no Diana Gabaldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTRAORDINARY","review":"I read tons and tons of books a year and i must say this was probably the best romance book I've ever read. Is there a sequel?

Does anyone know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another \\"bodice ripper!\\"","review":"I was very disappointed in this book because I had difficulty with the leading character, Jane Maxwell. I feel that in her demands for independence for her sex, she is much too progressive in her thinking,which is out of character for the times.I developed little empathy or sympathy for this character, although I was able to like some of the male figures in this tale.Same ol' romance novel plot; just the names & plot have been slightly changed, but not enough to make this an original read.My advice to prospective buyer, don't buy for a historical book because it is not, but do buy if you are into \\"the bodice ripper\\", shallow type of love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One book that will definitely grab the reader.","review":"I read this book years ago and have always loved it. The book has enough historical detail to entertain anyone who loves history and romance. The characters are strong and mostly likable,their lives seem to be like everyone else's. The only thing I did not like was there was no closure. The reader is left with feeling that they have to find out what happened to Jane and Thomas.Ciji Ware certainly left this one open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Porn meets Eighth Grade History","review":"This is not historical fiction but soft porn.

Not.","review":"A professor of mine had a bed that looked similar to this, and my dog loved it! So I thought it would be time to buy her a bed with the faux sheepskin that she could nestle around in.This is not faux sheepskin. The interior doesnt seem to be orthopedic either. The picture is not what you'll receive. The top layer is a thin, pseudo-fuzzy material that collects tons of static electricity.The interior stuffing went flat within a few weeks of use. I had to restuff it myself so that it wasn't completely flat. Now, my dog isn't that big, so I was amazed to see it flattened so fast. I got the larger bed for her, and she is only 35 pounds. So I would attribute the flatness to the cheap materials, and not just my dog.Its not worth the money to buy this one. There is far better that are actually as described. It only deserves one star since the dog occasionally sleeps on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switching to TurboTax next year","review":"I've used TaxCut for years with no problems, but this year's version is full of bugs.

TaxCut is anything but. I came up short on my state taxes this year, and had to figure out if I owed a penalty manually, and tell this sorry excuse of a program yes or no, since it could not figure it out itself. I am very irritated, and I certainly will not be buying this product next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE...","review":"This product does not work on Windows XP - it will crash when you reach the review phase. Their technical support is of little use - all I got was the advice to re-enter the data (which did not solve the problem) and a suggestion that XP is at faulet here (if so, why do they advertise that it runs on XP?).In addition to inferior programming, you also face the risk of filing an inaccurate return, as the program does not fix the errors automatically - you have to do it manually (which defeats the purpose of using a computer program in the first place).What is more, the program is an HR Block ad delivery system - you are bombarded with their ads at every step. This is the only thing this inferior piece of software does well.I returned this useless product. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"Use another program. Updates to the software were very difficult to download. Submitting questions to H&R Block didn't work. You can (in theory) submit your return for a Professional Review, for [a fee]. Once submitted, the only way you can view the review is through a link from the program. THE LINK WILL NOT WORK. Their tech support doesn't have an answer why it does not work. I called their refund department. The agent told me that they have been so swamped with calls of a similar nature, that they cant even enter them into their system. Bad enough I need to fight the IRS for my refund, looks like I need to fight H&R Block for that refund as well,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Buy!","review":"This program was so hard to manuever through! It doesn't have the easy drop down to find topics as Turbotax. Each item, even though checked, has to be rechecked in order for it to electronically file. In order to fix an error, you had to go back and actually find the error yourself. Turbotax asked you if you want to fix the error and then takes you right there! It took me four tries to file one return!I'll never buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy TurboTax instead","review":"This program had so many problems with it I don't even know where to begin.

It loaded fine, and never crashed.My problems were actual mistakes made by the software.I imported 1099 information automatically, from Fidelity. It turned short term items into long term, and vice versa. It gives you the option to delete some elements that you import, but then it doesn't actually delete them.I had 2 jobs during the year and accidentally over-contributed to a 401(k). It detected this, and fixed it. But I received a 1099-R from Fidelity, and reported that. So I ended up double-reporting the overage, and TaxCut didn't notice.I can also report agreeing with the comments about the user interface. I don't mind the tie-ins to H&R Block. But it's really very confusing and inconvenient to go back and find a topic, and enter into the Interview for it.Next year, I'll try TurboTax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to Turbo Tax","review":"This is the first year I have used this software and I am completely unsatisfied with the entire program. Throughout the tax preparation the program would abruptly shutdown or perform an 'illegal operation'. Next to try to correct a mistake or update something on the return is not user friendly at all. I did update a few things such as the address to my daycare, but the program would not save the changes, so I was forced to print out the return and white out the section and write in the update. Also, when it came time to printing even more problems, the program would lock up my printer ad I was forced to shut down the system several times.I highly do not recommend this product. I have used Turbo Tax in the past, but I decided to go with this sketchy program. Yes it is cheaper than Turbo Tax, but never again I will fork out the doe and get a program that actually works and is user friendly. If I could give negative stars for the rating I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"TaxCut is Tops","review":"I've been using TaxCut since 1996 and have always found it to be a superior product. 2001 Filing Edition has been as good as always.

Taxcut has never let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have Windows 2000 or XP don't bother with Taxcut","review":"This software is horrible. It will not, I repeat, will NOT work on Windows XP or 2000. It works at first ok, then once you upgrade it with their online updates, it will not work anymore.

This year the software was buggy, the UI was misaligned and difficult, and the printouts (supporting docs, not the Actual forms) were terrible. (On a Win2k system) Add to that the fact that with the deluxe version you still have to shell out another $(...) to get your state program and Efile (...) and then try and get $(...) back from 2 seperate rebates and it's just NOT WORTH IT. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to edit and fix problems","review":"When using this product, I had added the same dependent twice (same ssn). I had a hard time removing the duplicate. Plus if you finish one section, the software will not allow you to go back using the back button. The software stores '&' as '_'. I have a benefit account plan where day care expense is removed before taxes. The system keeps stating that my employer provides the daycare, even though, I have told it differently. The system will not allow me to override this and use efile. This product needs to be better tested. The advantages to this product are the price and it has some good tax tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy Program","review":"Yes, PC magazine rated this program better than Turbo-Tax. Some of the early reviews on Amazon rate it highly. People who used the later updated version mostly had lots of problems. Evidently the on-line update adds bugs to it. I used Tax Cut for 1999 and 2000 but won't use it again. I could accept the little bugs and the advertisements to go to H&R Block and buy more software but the last straw was when it wouldn't let me e-file.

It or I had problems with 401k and Roth IRA distributions. After 3 hours of work, I have to start over and went to bed at 11:30 so I was late for work.

That's when the fun began. Got a notice from the IRS today that the filing of the claim was accepted but that could not access my financial institute for payment. Called Taxcut and they threw there hands up, \\"We sent them your claim and they (the IRS) accepted it, we're done.\\" Taxcut was able to process their $14.95 processing fee, the IRS could not. Contacted my credit card company, \\"no problem on this end\\".Have yet to get a hold of the IRS for there end of the story.

Well at the end it calculated a very nice refund....But, I went out and purchased TURBO TAX 2003 and re done the whole thing. The 1099-MISC Box 7 had no error issues, and when I completed the filing, TURBO TAX 2003 came up with a lot less refund. The two 1099-MISC's I omitted in TaxCut 2003 totaled $1600.

Never have I been more wrong! I should have read the reviews here first before wasting my money. Plus, I should have known better than to go with something I've never used before. The program would not save my updated tax forms so when I checked for errors the same errors always came up. Yes, I could have called H&R Block for assistance, but it would have cost me even more money and I felt I had spent enough already. At least I get 5 bucks back. I wouldn't even attempt to GIVE this program to anybody.The ONLY reason I gave it one star was because I was able to fill in the forms on my computer and print them off to send to the IRS.

Luckily I have Windows 2000 and it intercepts the crash of the software and it even provides you with a log file with the exact reason the software crashed. After emails with their customer support and phone calls (pretty good support), they acknowledged they had a problem and that they don't have a solution. I was told to ask for a refund.

But should you manage to secure a decent pair--which really isn't difficult--they are a fine option for those seeking inexpensive, fine-sounding phones.

When I heard about the new Controller S, I wasn't too hyped, but was anxious to see how it felt, and was astonished at how much improvement was made. The button placement is a bit difficult, especially with games like Halo where there is about the equal amount of face-button, trigger, and joystick usage, and the angle of the handles to the face buttons, right joystick, and the awkward start, back, white and black buttons are incredibly annoying at first, but you quickly get accustomed to it. genius...i think. microsoft needs to make one more, though, to get the perfect controller, and listen to every ounce of feedback they are given. and get rid of that unsightly logo in the middle...put the tiny buttons there, so we don't get so frustrated with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out okay but went downhill fast","review":"My old controller was constantly having a problem with the wires and the game would tell me it had been disconnected so I decided it was time to purchase a new controller. The new one worked okay for the first month or two, despite a problem with the black button trying to stick quite a bit, however it started having the same problem and now if I move the controller the slightest bit, the games tell me the controller was disconnected and I need to reconnect it. This happens every few seconds and it makes game play extremely difficult. I don't know if it's possible to find an good controller anymore for the old Xbox or not but it sure would be great if I could find one!To add a note to the problem... the wire is all straight and not twisted and I have no idea why it keeps giving me the error.

About the only good thing that thet S controller has is rearranged A, B, X and Y buttons, but the other repositioning is very, very bad.

However, regardless of how fake - or real - the story is, its major flaw is that it's not as good to read as the fictional \\"Sleepers\\". \\"Safe Place\\" just isn't as involving and it lost my interest rather quickly.

This book is definitely non-fiction and reads that way, more facts and actual memories as relating to the title, about his father and his first wife, who he murdered, and how it affected Carcaterra's life. It has no funny stories, this book is all serious. But it does show his father, mother, and himself as real people, and not as fictionalized characters, and does so realistically.

When choosing a drum map close to what I have, it won't go out my sound card. Only midi and Roland soft synths, forcing you to use their synths and hours of editing. When recording via midi, the songs play very slowly forcing you to reload the program. When recording midi, some tracks notes take on a mind of their own needing time consuming editing. TT-1 has some nice sounds and notation features but I wish it had where I can choose a series on notes and change the length and velocity of just one section in a track instead of the whole track. When altering notes in an existing drum map to match my keyboard, no sound came out. Sometimes when playing back a song, the volume and instruments will default to a certain setting causing you to record a new track and reload.

Pictorial definitions are fine for this age, however older students should have surpassed the dumbed down comic book approach. The pictorial representations fail to take into account the shades of meanings of words. The definitions offered will not stand up in most situations because of this narrow view of a word definition. This is where the product fails to deliver. Again, if you want to enhance your vocabulary, use a text based definition that takes into account the nuances of word meanings otherwise you are simply taking your chances with a quick cram job that is too surfacy.

It appears to have a random action generator as I find the number and types of opponents varies, along with the damage you incur during the game, so if you don't succeed, try again as many times as it takes, eventually you get the hang of it. I think a game guide would be a very useful accessory for this game but I have been unable to locate one, at least so far. A game guide would be particularly good for the higher level on the last couple of missions. Frequent saves are a must with this game. Overall a great game that will keep you involved for hours. Probably not one you want to give the younger members of the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good Game","review":"This Game is a good game for adults. It is rated M for mature because of animated blood and violence. The graphics are pretty good for a handheld, but could be improved. It takes paitence to beat this game because it has a whole lot of levels. It is good for long trips. However, it does get boring if you are stuck on one level. That is why they have cheat codes!:) It also gets kind of boring because all you do is walk around and shoot. There are no missions or anything like that. All you have to do is find keys and exit through elevators. (allthough finding the elevators and keys is the hardest part of the game) You are also forced to battle bosses like creations of Hitler, killer dogs, and Hitler himself.

Bringing this title back from the dead probably wasn't such a good idea with games like Ecks Vs. Sever competeing with it. Doom and Duke Nukem were old games coming back to life on the GBA but those turned out so darn good. Those games featured beautiful graphics. Wolfenstein 3D's are just plain outdated and ugly, however not as ugly as Medal of Honor: Underground's. The game features the original 60 levels and 4 weapons. Only 4? Yes, I know, there were only 4 in the original but that is to little. This game is even outdated on the Game Boy. The game is still fun but there are a lot of better choices in the FPS genre for GBA.

The full version cost at least $50, so this is a dream come true for fans who couldn't afford the real deal ten or fifteen years ago. For $15 you can get all the episodes, that's a LOT of gameplay time.However, for the three episodes I had, I remember really great music. Without the music, It seems as though the game is more tedious, more of a chore. It almost makes all the levels feel the same at times, which is dissapointing.Other than this, the frame rate can make things difficult at times, slowing the fast action down to matrix-slow speeds [which isn't half bad, but when the action calms down it suddenly moves lightning fast and then you wonder how you lost half of your health].If you really like classic games and you haven't played wolfenstein before, I would highly reccomend it; but if you played the original, and are familiar with it, it might not meet your expectations"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best guitar instrumental album of ALL TIMES","review":"Yes, it is.

It reminds me of the synthesizer-like background music used on 70's sci-fi shows - perhaps due to heavy doses of effects such as flangers and/or phasers(?). The album keeps the alien theme going throughout, which I find gets tedious. Things that are growing on me: the wooshing silver surfer effect on the title track, and ice 9 (it sounds like the guitar is talking -- saying \\"surfing with the alien\\") -- perhaps a Digitech Whammy-wah effect? Joe is reputedly a technically awesome guitarist and guitar teacher (Steve Vai and Kirk Hammet were pupils of his!) but this did not \\"float my boat\\".

I found none of that in either one of these albums. If you're new to guitar and have heard about the magic sounds of this mad genius than my advice is for you to, rather run out and search for Andres Segovia or Jimi Hendrix as both drip with emotion and incredible guitar skill, (not to mention ingenuity which is the defense of most Satch fans).This album is sadly lacking.

The entire album is strong but my personal favorites include \\"Ice 9\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"Lords of Karma\\", and \\"Echo\\". Joe never made another album again that sounds like this one.

The player uniforms are all accurate, and some of the player models look like accurate representations of the actual player. The frame rate remains brisk throughout most of the game\\"I would recomend any soccar fan buy this game. It is the only game that you can actually play for the world cup. How good would a football game be if you couldn't play in the Super Bowl? The bottom line is that this game is the best soccar game out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Money","review":"They should just call this game what it is - an advirtisement for the 2002 World Cup. The gameplay options are very limited, there are no statistics kept on goals, bookings, etc. at least that i can see, and why the hell does the game go into slow motion so often? Also Amazons description of this title is misleading. There are no club teams and only 40 internationals plus whatever teams you unlock. I shouldve just bought FIFA 2002. Really apart from some beautifully detailed stadiums this just is not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fun if you follow soccer","review":"I'm usually not into sports games, but I found this one to be pretty fun. It's not too difficult to learn how to play, and eventually you can master the moves and really whoop up on the other teams. The graphics are pretty good, although they're far from pushing the PS2's graphical capabilities.There is another EA soccer game for the PS2 that probably would be a better bet, but it is difficult to find and this game is still fun nonetheless. If you like soccer and own a PS2, get this. If you don't follow the sport much, then you can skip this or just rent it somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"2002 FIFA World Cup.","review":"This game is the worst soccer game out there. There is only two modes, friendly and world cup. There is only 32 international teams or so. There is no HOLLAND, ROMANIA just to mention a few. There is how ever Iceland, Scotland. Two joke teams that did not qualify. No creation center, player-team editor!!!!.This title is a total waste of time and money avoid at all costs!!!!!. Stick to FIFA 2002. Also gameplay is horrid, major slow down....it just feels lame.

I think this book is especially enjoyable for someone who has visited the places featured in the book. The Jim Thompson House is still there, and it is just as described in the book. The book does not have a tidy and neat plot, but I think that gives it some originality. Like another reviewer, I wish I could be part of a book club to discuss many of the \\"mysteries\\" contained within the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, disjointed, and dishonest","review":"As someone who has read a lot about Thailand of the 1960s, I found this novel difficult to bear. Worse still, it struck me as dull and disjointed. It inexpertly tries to weave together the mystery of \\"Silk King\\" Jim Thompson's disappearance with the unhappy marriage of a strangely spaced-out American housewife enduring life in the midst of \\"exotic\\" Bangkok. Throw in a murder and the muddle is complete. The fiction seems oddly amateur, the history uninformed, and the descriptions of Thailand and Thai customs come straight out of a second-rate guidebook. The decision to include \\"Siam\\" in the title seems crass and dishonest as the novel has nothing to do with Siam. Tuck appears guilty of breaking the cardinal rule of beginning writers: write about what you know. Tuck demonstrates that she knows very little about the setting or circumstances of this novel. I rarely dislike any book about Thailand. I guess for that reason, this novel is special."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Have Read in Years","review":"I found this book's plot to be boring and pointless. The only reason I finished the book was due to its short length. There was no rhyme or reason for the book, there was no focus, and there was no life in the characters. Save your time and don't even bother reading this book. You probably have better things to do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational, but not creative","review":"I read this book and and found it to be a tedious endeavor. The main character(she was so empty headed and dull, I can't even remember her name), well, she wanted to know what happened to this wealthy man that ran a silk company. He had been abducted, this bothers the character very badly, and what makes the book kind of a downer, you'd think the main character would find out what happened to the guy, but in the end... oh well, you can figure out what I'm trying to say. Well, the prose was very noncreative and flat, but she did have an eye for observation and wrote the settings and atmosphere of the novel convincingly. She made you feel as if you were in Thailand. Another thing, if you like traveling, this might be the book for you, Ms Lily Tuck did a good job of explaining Thailand. But if you are expecting poetic imagery, or a explosive plot, you might not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIAM-or The Woman Who Shot a Man","review":"Boring. Simple. No real plot that I could latch on to. The only items of interest were some of the nice descriptions of the environs and hints and tips on the Thai language. This book was mildly diverting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and lacking a plot","review":"While reading this book, I felt that the story was going nowhere. A lot of the descriptions, conversations, etc. were repetitive and perhaps that was an attempt at \\"art\\" through words or to provide us with a sense of how monotonous this woman's life was, but it seemed overdone. The plot was not developed very well, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siam: The Woman Who Shot a Man","review":"Upon reading this book, I was totally amazed that it received such glowing editorial reviews. It was one of the most ridiculous novels I have ever read. The author, in my opinion, used the format of the novel to expound upon her knowledge of Thailand, however, not in an interesting manner.The book had very little plot and, I felt, very little characterization. If one would enjoy reading about the main character's Thai language lessons, excerpts from her readings of Thai history and architecture, and her endless ruminations about the disappearance of a man that she met once - then you would immensely enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"have 3X of these cables; they've worked well. just ordered another size, too.","review":"Had a 25' Belkin and replace a white covered generic with it; All my televisions cleared dramatically after subbing the generic into the line.

The cable was easy to install and required only finger pressure to adequately tighten the cable connection on the cable box and to the AR signal splitter. While I read that as much as 50 percent of the signal power can be lost through splitting the signal, my regular cable TV signal is running quite nicely with no noticeable difference that I can determine. I'm just a computer geek and haven't done much with TV signals in quite a few years, but I'm pleased with the cost and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and well shielded","review":"I bought this to replace a cheap cable that was used when my satellite was installed. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a coax cable, since I'm hoping to upgrade some components and use superior connections soon.Conversely, I didn't want to buy something too cheap and make anything worse.I chose this one because it appeared to be a good cable at a decent price, and it is.The cable feels well made and the connectors feel sturdy and tight. It's a good cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great facelift for old equipment!","review":"I have a really old tube tv that still works great, the picture quality when watching cable is fine. When paired with an older DVD though, the picture was terrible! Running lines through the picture going in 2 different directions. I attempted to replace the DVD only to find that you need an adapter to hook it up to an old TV, and I didn't want to put more money into it. I decided to give this cable a shot since I was using one of those cheap clamp-type cables with crooked pins. It has made SUCH a difference to the DVD picture, no more running lines! Great value for $9. I will probably be ordering another for my cable box-to-DVD connection.

Technically, I purchased the HP-700 model which does not fold, but I assume they are similar.Right on the packaging, it says \\"Gold plated mini-plug\\" yet the plug is NOT gold-plated at all, it is in fact a standard nickel-plated mini plug. The sound is incredibly tinny and even with the volume control is lower volume than my Sony headphones without the volume control. In addition, the plug does not create a tight fit with the player, so that as you move on a cardio machine, it slides around and causes static and lack of sound in the headphones.This is the second pair of Maxell headphones I have had trouble with in the past 6 months.

Luckily I can use my Genesis controller for easier use. But once you learn the directions you will get further. I got a score of 40K (thousand) and got the level that only toggles on and off. The whole point of the game is to get the pyramids one color. At first each block turns to one color and stays that color. Then you have to step on each block twice (you can tell which color it needs to be by what color font your score and lives are). The toggle level is every time you step on a square it changes to 1 of 2 colors making it into a puzzle game. I love it.

BUT, the paperback suffers enormously from the absence of maps....and it becomes virtually impossible to fathom who is where and how far apart different actions are. The book is written very much from the Russian point of view and there is little analysis of German methods or mentality. There are too few signposts in the text to aid the reader; eg at times the text jumps from one front or time to another with few clues that a flashback is occurring or that the action is now hundreds of miles different from previous paragraphs.

I know, unlikely bed-fellows, who end up working together to help free the whales from the ice.I was surprised by how good this story was. It grabbed me, got my heart even, and wouldn't let go. And I adored the unique and different characters. Variety in characters is so important.

This book boasts an impressive 30'000 terms, but it seems to have left out some very obvious plants. Daylily and Nandina are a couple of examples. Still, with 30'000 entries, a few omissions can be accepted. Understanding that, because Common Names change a bit from region to region, it can be a little frustrating trying to learn the botanical nomanclature.

It is the story of lost innocence, breaking away from the comforts of home and country to experience life on one's own. Melville captures poetically, Redburn's journey, observations, feelings, and dark reality of life in pre-civil war America and England. If you have never read Melville before, this is a page turning introduction to a very much admired author. His style of writing is poetic, and clever and his narrative captures the feelings and thoughts of the time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary HORROR","review":"Let's get real here folks. This book is a literary disaster. Does the reviewer above want to argue that with me? Well, than he or she can talk to Melville himself. Melville wrote this book for money. It doesn't have the literary charm that comes with Melville's books. Moby Dick was a literary masterpiece. Redburn is garbage. It is simply a journal of his travels to Liverpool and back. If journals interest you, than by all means this is an excellent book.

It may just be the fact that the movie starts out with an incredibly addictive song (You Spin me Right Round... i listen to the smashing pumpkins, but come on, who cant like that song??), or perhaps its such a relief to see Sandler not playing a completely incompetent jerk, but either way this is an enjoyable film to watch. The Wedding Singer is predictable to a fault and not outlandishly funny, but if you want to see something easy on the mind that creates a few chuckles, this movie more than satisfies that need."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","review":"I didn't mind this movie when I saw it, but afterwards I thought \\"That was really lame!\\"Adam Sandler's character was a complete wimp (what happened to Happy Gilmore?) and Drew Barrymore was a drip.This was a big hit with a lot of young people, which is a bit hard to understand because a lot of them wouldn't remember 1985."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay movie","review":"This was more of a love movie between Sandler and Drew Berrymorethis and Ok movie to have from Adam Sandler this is good I guessStory 6 Acting 7 Directing 8 Action 7 Entertainment 7Overall=35/50 wich because of the old lady who sings rappers Delight I will reward it 4 stars and plus its Sandler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst","review":"It's one of the better Sandler movies, but that's not saying much. After Billy Madison & Happy Gilmore, Sandler lost any kind of edge that he had. He wants us viewers to love him too much, abandoning the wackiness. I miss the old Sandler. The Wedding Singer had potential, and the 80's is a ripe target for a comedy. Unfortunately, instead of being a parody of 80's romantic comedies, The Wedding Singer reilies on same lame plot devices. Go see Billy Madison for the hundreth time instead of this wasted oportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This COULD HAVE been such a great movie!!!","review":"The general story of this movie is great...but there are just enough vulgar parts to turn me off.

(He was like that in Happy Gilmore, too) The movie is cast well and the retro music is great.

The on-screen chemistry he has with Barrymore comes forth as honest and truthful. It's a change of pace from his films such as Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. He plays a more loveable character. The setting of the 1980's makes it a wonderful time period for cliches and inside jokes for those of us who grew up in the decade. The soundtrack is great too, capped off with a song that will make the heart of any woman melt.

Robbie is devastated when his fiancée, Linda, leaves him at the alter on their wedding day. His loneliness tranforms him into a careless guy who only ruins people's weddings. When Robbie meets Julia, a waitress at the banquet hall, he begins to believe in love again, and falls helplessly in love with Juila. Only one catch: Julia's getting married-and she doesn't know her fiancé is cheating on her. It's up to Robbie to stop Julia's wedding before he looses her for good! \\"The Wedding Singer\\" is a hilarious romantic comedy, with a great screenplay, great performances by the cast, and a rockin' soundtrack! This is a movie you cannot miss! The message it brings is so charming: if you love someone, go for them!

Drew Barrymore play a waitress that is about to marry a \\"Miami Vice\\" wannabe. As you may have guessed the two realize they were meant for each other and the rest is pure good entertainment. It was fun to reminisce about those 80s. I'm a wedding photographer and I must say the kind of gigs the wedding singer did and the people he encountered, were so typical and realistic--especially table 9!

Adam Sandler once again delivers humorous one liners and shows great acting. And Drew Berrymore makes her role very convinceing. It's an old love tale with a new twist. We have Robbie a wanna-be-rock star that settled with being a wedding singer to pay the bills and it turns into a full-time carrer. His life takes an unespected pitfall when his fiancee leaves him at the alter. And then we have Julia, the new girl who's almost shy but posesses shineing personality.

Add to that a truly sweet love story and you see why this movie becomes an instant favorite. WARNING: Intellectuals, leave your brain on that neon lava lamp, because if you think too hard, you miss the fun! Adam Sandler shows a more serious side, and finally we see that this resident funny guy is not so one-dimensional after all. To see Drew Barrymore as a little dorky is fun, and that Boy George look- a-like is wild. Let me not ruin it for you, but this is definitely worthwhile...

But its on the lower half of the list. First, because Drew Barrymore's acting bothering the crap out of me, which I guess is sort of the fault of the character. But also, Sandler was kind of indirectly pompous, which he does not do well. He should either be totally full of himself, or completely humble. I don't know if this was the character, or the way he played the character, or the script, but it bothered me. They were both way too sweet, which I guess was the point, but it the kind of sweet where it makes you want to punch them with a hammer.But over all, its definately funny and cute and I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"since we let our first class passengers do, pretty much whatever they want..\\"","review":"Billy Idol made that quote in the movie when he was using the PA of a flight he was on with Robbie (Sandler) and Julia (Barrymore) to Las Vegas.The movie was funny, cool, and made you feel good.Hearing the '80's music and expecially seeing Billy Idol with his role (minor, but good) makes the cake for me with this surprisingly good movie.Got to admit I shed a tear or two hearing some of the songs.. the '870's was great time and the music reflected that.The music could have a Rock Beat or a pop beat but everyone found a reason and way to dance to it!

There are some very funny lines throughout, a great soundtrack, anyone who remembers the 80's will feel like they're on a trip down memory lane.

Everyone is great in this film-my favorite characters in this movie would be the limo driver, the old man, and his brother in law. I highly recommend this film. Though I will add a note, if you are curious about buying this newer version because of the added material-there is only one scene added and it is rather short, though mildly humorous-basically the only reason to buy it would be for the better case.

I especially liked the understated humor and 80's nostalgia. This movie raises no controversial issues nor does it galvanize some universal truth at a moment in time. But it's still a great movie, a 5-star movie, a movie that I've watched several times.For those of you looking for movie *revolutions* and *masterpieces*, check out the DVD itself. In addition to the 'almost standard' DVD features (multiple languages and subtitles, wide screen and full screen), it includes Karoake songs (with and without the singer's voice), an 80's music trivia game, biographies, filmographies, and even a 'photo album' with select pictures from the movie.

Adam Sandler does not keep all the gags to himself in this production as he did in the overblown but still entertaining \\"Billy Madison\\". He allows his friends in the smaller roles(Jon Lovitz and Steve Buscimi) to steal the show. I own \\"The Wedding Singer\\" and only watch it when I am already gitty.

Must be the same people who put Janeane Garofalo in those warm 'n' fuzzy romantic comedies.) Bad writing(quote one line of the movie that was NOT in the commercials. I haven't met one person who can.)

Adam Sandler plays a band lead singer in the sort of band you see at weddings. The story takes place in 1985. The photography is full of bright cartoonish primary colors and the transfer is well done, noiseless and sharply focused without aliasing, but the story quickly degenerates from what should have been a sensitive comedy story of how the wedding singer and the Drew Barrymore character interact into yet another teen targeted exploitaion film with bad language, unbelievable situations, and overly sappy romantic resolutions. Could have been a lot better if the second half were rewritten.

The jokes in this movie are always comparing the eighties to the nineties-- for example: one guy starts to wear one white glove and another guy stops him saying it looks wierd-- ha ha).

Sandler was hysterical without being dysfunctional like he is in all of his other movies.

Books on popular musicians that are published by a UNIVERSITY PRESS are a good example. Maybe you can't judge a book by its cover, but you can judge a book by its publisher. This is from Oxford University Press. By itself, that tells you it's probably worth more than two stars.So I hate to see this book criticized by three reviewers for being what it is, an academic study. For crying out loud, it's a book with lots of footnotes! The author is a college professor. So of course it's not going to be full of gossip about their manager punching someone out.It is full of fascinating musicological and sociological insight. But to appreciate the book, those are the things you have to want to get out of it.For the kind of book it is, it is one of the most READABLE books on a rock band that has ever been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuddup 'n' play yer guitar!","review":"First, to any stray Zep fans, this book is nothing like the books you're used to reading about the band. The book is written by an associate professor of music, in hideous modern academic jargon. You know, the blocky, obfuscating style the professors deploy to make their subjects or themselves seem more profound than they really are. Examining a Jimmy Page solo note-by-note is of extremely limited interest to anyone but graduate musicology students-and has high music culture declined so much that they now have to fill their syllabi with Zeppelin's catalog? Sure, I'd rather listen to \\"Gallows Pole\\" than some atonal serialist composer, but this book is laying it on way too thick. Tedious and unrewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the point","review":"This is an unfortunate example of an academic trying very hard to understand with her mind what she obviously does not with her heart.

The romance scenes didn't create enough steam to cook a pea! There was no detail, it was bing-bang-boom. It left me thinging: \\"What? oh, they just made love...I think?\\"I also thought that Valin, the leading male role, lost his tough exterior too easily.I would love to have this book rewritten by one of my favorite authors, sorry Suzanne.

That recording is some 20 minutes longer and encompasses a variety of musical forms, both darker and more subdued classical instrumentas and joyous popular songs, and the musicianship is very fine. In this CD, Zohreh Jooya's voice is remarkably smooth and lovely, and Hamid Golestani's excellent baritone is a nice contrast in the series of tracks. The overall recording of songs, including ghazals and qawwalis, is light and spirited and more uniform in tone. It is happy and sometimes danceable. There is perhaps too much harmonium, but the rubab and various drums support the ensemble well.

In particular the duets with Hamid Golestani are a wonderful match of two so diverse voices. Mrs Jooya has many fans among Afghan who live outside and inside Afghanistan. We appreciate the art of Mrs. Zohreh Jooya very much and are very proud to have such a renowned representative of Afghan culture living in Austria.

When Danny mysteriously goes missing from his daycare centre one day, this sets the plot into motion. But it's no ordinary \\"missing child\\" case. As the author hints at things to come by building up the tension admirably, there are too many unbelievable reactions by the various characters to make this a better novel. The eco-disaster motif is refreshing, especially the underlying message included in the story...but it doesn't really seem to play out in a way that holds ones interest until the end.

I've owned the regular DVD and the laserdisc version of this movie- and this one is SOOO much better. Crystal clear picture with remarkable detail. The space sequences are breathtaking in beauty. The launch sequence is a great demo- though not as aggressive on the subwoofer as I'd expected or hoped for. Well worth the bargain price now that the format war is over.

There is a shower scene that is filmed at the end of an encounter so a little imagination is required but most 7th graders have seen worse on network tv in commercials! And this is such a minor part of the movie in comparison to the AWESOME lessons on bravery, patriotism, ingenuity and perseverance.

Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version. There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, \\"I want to go back there\\". When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.

Even though the actual outcome is well known, the movie provides dramatic tension as the Apollo 13 crew and the people at mission control work their way through a most remarkable life threatening situation. The cast is outstanding, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise all giving wonderful performances. For me Ed Harris as Mission Control director Gene Kranz just about steals the movie. He is just incredibly good in this role , possibly his finest hour on screen.It is easy to take the technical aspects of this film for granted because they are so realistic and presented in almost documentary form but the effects and the atmosphere aboard the space capsule and lunar landing craft are extraordinary.This is definitely a film worth owning and one I pull off the shelf now and then and always enjoy viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stellar Performance","review":"Very entertaining and fact filled movie..The bonus material was educational and instilled pride in the American Space Program for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie in there some where","review":"Don't bother with this version.

And after reading \\"Five-To-One Moon\\", an autobiography by Buzz Aldrin, I was hooked.Although I'm not too much into space or drama movies anymore, I was pleased to see this movie. Moreover, it touches upon the astronaut's personal lives. It includes a good plot, action, drama, mystery, and suspense that a good motion picture should have.

I love the movie, but I am not going to support Universal bastardizing the BluRay format and using it to push down aggresive marketing. It's not pirates who hurt sales, it's badly made releases that insult the paying customer. If I pay for the movie, I want to be able to watch it without having to go through too much hussle and I certainly don't want social networking and other bul****. I buy movies to watch them.

Okay, by now, the screen's been dark for 6 minutes. Dear Amazon: don't YOU have a role to play here? My blu-ray player is only 1 year old and there is not indication of a compatibiilty issue.

The video quality on the Blu-Ray was a major disappointment. There is a lot of noise or grain throughout, and is a big distraction. After watching the Sapphire edition of Braveheart, which was also released in 1995 and looks stunning on Blu-Ray, Apollo 13 desperately needs to be remastered. This would still be a decent buy if you don't already have it in your DVD collection, but it does not live up to Blu-Ray quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Expert Mix of Sentimentality and Tension","review":"Ron Howard is right in his comfort zone in this dramatic retelling of an early NASA near-disaster, with a bevvy of strong characters to play with, volatile situations to work through and nostalgic heartstrings to tug at. Backed by an all-star cast and an excellent script, it's a lesson in efficient, powerful big-event storytelling. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are especially convincing as commander of the crippled spacecraft and the flight director in charge of his safe return, respectively. Like you might expect from a Hanks / Howard collaboration, it has more than its share of soft-hearted emotions, but a good sense of humor and convincing special effects help to compensate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apollo 13 the unseen film for me!","review":"I don\\"t see the film yet, because it doesn\\"t arrived to me!

Anyway, I got one in widescreen of the Anniversary Edition for myself and then a 2nd one for a friend. Since my friend does not care for widescreen, I did not want to get the same DVD for gift. I read the description, and while it said \\"HD\\", it appeared that simply meant that it would work well with HD TV's.

It seems that they just took the Fullscreen version and Cropped it again to make it widescreen instead of adding more of the movie to the sides.Well, I'm afraid that Apollo 13 is the same way.

Shame on you, Universal Pictures.The least they could do, if they wanted to show some respect here, would be to withdraw it from the market, make a recall, solve this awfull issue, and make a refund of something like that.As I live in Brazil, I simply cannot consider sending it back and ask for a refund, because the shipping cost would be greater than the price itself.

I have a Panasonic player with the latest firmware updates and was totally annoyed with the amount of time it took to load. Even after I had selected PLAY MOVIE, I was subjected to even more delays. I'm glad my player is not connected to the internet like many others with complaints about all the extranious junk heaped upon them.

I have always been a space enthusiast and remember reading books about astronauts and the Saturn V rocket as a kid. This film is probably the most technically accurate spaceflight film out there. I love how all the zero G scenes are real (filmed in KC-135 aircraft) and all of the switches,lights etc. in the Command module are 100% realistic. The Saturn V liftoff was incredible.

I loved the special effects, loved the acting, loved the suspense and was inspired by the music score much as I inspired by those original events I still vividly recall as a nine year old Australian school boy. My favourite scene: the Apollo 13 launch from the nervous moments in the Astronauts' fit-out rooms to insertion in earth orbit. Somehow Howard created a crescendo of drama that wasn't eased until we see scenes of Astronauts' gloves floating in zero gravity. Another feature is the excellent recreation of Mission Control in Houston. The supporting cast were fantastic. Each were quirky individuals in their own right, not clone-like extras there to make up the numbers. I liked Happy Days, Ron, but I loved Apollo 13 even more. Movie making at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Blu-Ray","review":"I can't believe nobody at Universal realized that this Blu-Ray has so many problems. First, it takes forever to load, at which point it tries to download a \\"fresh preview\\" (e.g., trailer) from the Internet. Once you get around that, it takes several minutes for it to load the main menu, simply presenting a Universal logo spinner. After that, you get a main menu that simply will not operate. Sadly, the behavior is the same on both of my Blu-Ray players: LG and Panasonic. The only Blu-Ray player that I've seen this work correctly on is a Playstation 3. Did Universal even bother to test this on anything else? What a RIP OFF this disc is...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant","review":"Few movies have the ability to captivate me and take me into the story. This is one of them. From the heartwrenching first scene of the fire of Apollo 1 to the final 4 minutes, I was held by the surperb acting of all the actors and the storyline. What made the movie even better was the fact that it was true and stayed fairly accurate to the actual storyline.

Not only does the film seem utterly real in its recreation of NASA and space exploration; it also gives us breathless, second-by-second suspense and real characters to care about, played by some of the best actors Hollywood has to offer. Ron Howard should have won the Best Director Oscar for this film; that he wasn't even nominated will remain one of the greatest black marks against the Academy in its entire history.

A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Satriani","review":"If you were expecting a blasting array of bi-dextral tapping, pinched harmonics and wild whammy bar hysteria, this is not the album you want to get. Satriani unleashes himself from his usual jaw dropping virtuosity and he lets the feeling of the music take over. The album is dominated by a bluesy feel, but strays occasionally into beautiful melodic tracks such as \\"Home\\" and the Eastern influenced \\"Morroccan sunset\\". Satriani's tone is once again top notch, and his inventive use of the wah wah pedal in his melodies adds flavour to the album. Perhaps this is not a Satriani album for all fans, but if you love good old blues, go and buy it. A wonderful recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing it safe","review":"2 1/2Try as he might to escape generic entrapments present within stale blues-rock guitar virtuoso songwriting, even most bright runs feel dampened by the somewhat stilted pulse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve a title.","review":"Rarely do I want to eject a CD and chuck it out my car window, but this one nearly made me do that. It starts with Cool #9, which has kind of a nice groove; it's been a part of Joe's live set for awhile now. The rest is just so completely unremarkable, it's hard to remember. Part of my dislike of this album comes from the mix; the guitar is moved so far back that it lacks punch, and the drums end up dominating the album's sound. And speaking of which, Satch's drummer on this one is great, but he's absolutely IN LOVE with his assortment of cymbals and china boys. A little of that goes a very long way to me, especially when you're trying to hear the guitar. Who knew Joe Satriani would release such a good drummer's album? Those who have tired of Joe's more progressive stuff and want to hear something sleepy and conventional might enjoy this, but for me, this is his worst album by far. I'll take the much-hated but futuristic 'Engines of Creation' over this any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleepy","review":"Before I picked this up I only owned the first few albums: Earth, Surfing, Flying and the live one, Time Machine. Love 'em all. Got inspired to start rounding out the collection after re-watching my Satch Tapes video. I picked up this one and The Extremist. Extremist rocks hard. Oozes energy and vibe. This one is just sleepy. Sounds uninspired to me.I guess Joe was going for a subdued, bluesy album. He got it. I just found it hard to finish listening to the whole disc. Played it again. No better. I guess I'm just a shallow, knuckle-dragging rocker but I need more flash to keep my attention in an instrumental guitar album, but hey, if you want to hear one of the best guitar players on the planet play with subtlety and restraint this just might be the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your everyday Satch...","review":"This CD may be harsh to someone trying to discover Satriani's music for the first time. I would recommend that one does not begin with this CD, but let this be one of your last of his works. His sound is quite a bit different, sometimes very smooth and subdued, which is not his usual virtuoso style. Don't get me wrong -- Satch shreds on this album like usual, but it's a more bluesy style, which he most likely knew would be sort of \\"experimental\\" and may have upset some of his listeners. At first, I didn't like this album, but over time, I gave it second and third chances, and now it's one of my favorites (\\"Extremist\\" and \\"Crystal Planet\\" are my favorites). I would suggest picking this up to listen to Satch doing new things, but be forewarned that it is not his usual style."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Holes Here!","review":"According to Blues great Albert King, \\"If you don't dig the Blues, you got a hole in your soul!\\" Joe proves beyond any doubt on his self-titled release, that there are no holes here! It's apparent that he has a love and understanding of the Blues genre, and he displays his understanding well. From the opener, \\"Cool #9\\" thru the rest of the album, Satch sets you to really crave that next Bluesy lick coming from his wailing guitar! Just put on the headphones, sit back and let Satch take you on a journey thru the Blues. It's a great ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Joe Go","review":"Joe Satriani cd is excellent. Still checking it out for long term listening (Got with Chicken Foot 4.5 stars--Joe is with great company, different but great, only negative is recording is distorted, especially the bass, I have 1970 analog cd's that sound better! Still CF rocks!). The Joe Satriani cd displays Joe's tallent to just make beautiful sound, rythums and six string jam. The recording quality is great. I have all of Satriani's CD's and this one is one of the better ones. The drummer displays some of the best drums I have ever heard, very tallented.

I definitely got the feeling that this was a 45 minute show fluffed into a feature film format. The film is also Homer-centric. Bart's character is less than true to form as he goes soft as the story progresses... as a result we get few gags out of him. There is little to no interaction with the townspeople who make the show so dynamic. All in all, the story is less compelling than some of the 23 minute ones and the execution does little to help it out.Apparently, the writers realized that Simpsons fans such as myself have been waiting so long for a movie that just about anything thrown up on the screen would have sold.By the way... on a fullscreen, some gags will make no sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as fun to watch again in your own home","review":"Today is Tuesday Dec. 18th and the first thing I did after I got out of bed was drive down to Target and pick up this DVD for both the kids and myself.

You could even go into this not having seen the show period. The plot is fairly straightforward, doesn't jump around much, and there aren't any sub-plots. As for the anticipated humor and satire, both are directed at children and adults - there is something for everyone. The Simpsons family are front and center, and the usual secondary characters have a handful of memorable lines.One might expect a movie based on a television show might flop, but this doesn't disappoint.

I have been watching the Simpsons for years and just felt like it should have been more. I felt watching film, suck my life out of me. It was a major rip off to the world. The movie was too long, it could have been better watching a regular 30 minute episode on TV. Homer Simpson even jokes about this in the begining credit saying watching this movie we are all suckers and could have watch it for free on TV. Things I do like are The Simpsons world. They don't have to explain about orgins or anything because you know the characters. There is an element of crudeness that you will notice in the movie that is not on TV, example Homer gives the bird. Ok in all, rent it before buyin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy. worst mockery of The simpsons","review":"I've been a lifelong Simpson fan and must say that the past 6 seasons were terrible and the movie was worse. This film was not funny at all and was filled with humor that people with IQ's of 45 would only find funny. This movie was supposedly 8 years or so in the making and it was a complete let down. The older episodes had witty humor, and hilarious side jokes; this had nothing but childish jokes that were far from funny. Honestly, Fox should just let the show RIP because these new writers cannot do their job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I grew up watching The Simpsons on the television, so when Fox decided to come out with a Simpsons movie, well, figured I'd like to watch it. Unfortunately, what might have been a great movie decided to be less of a piece of entertainment and more of a political piece of crap. I bought this movie expecting to be entertained, expecting to find something to laugh at. However, I found less humor and more of the creator's/producer's political ideology and social commentary. I found less laughs and more mocking of a person or persons' way of life simply because the producers/creators didn't agree with them. I subsequently gave the movie away. If I wanted politics and outright social commentary, I'd search for it myself. I don't want to be force-fed someone else's point-of-view and be mocked for disagreeing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful awful","review":"Many reviews I read when this movie came out said that the movie contained some of the biting political satire of early episodes. While those episodes contained some general social commentary (ex. the episode in which Apu is an illegal immigrant), the show always did it with a smile on its face. This film was pretty much liberal propaganda. I'm not saying I disagree with the ideas the writers have put forward; I'm saying that that is not what I watch the Simpsons for! I watch the Simpsons to be entertained. Additionally, it seems that the writers are trying to incorporate \\"Family Guy\\" humor into both the show and this movie. I love Family Guy's brand of edgy, sometimes offensive humor, but that's why I watch it. I don't watch the Simpsons to see that type of humor!

There were a few honest to goodness funny segments and they were all in the previews. The writing is extremely hacked and predictable. They turn Homer into a character you simply can't connect or sympathize with at all. It was a really bad, bad showing. Do yourself a favor and skip this and go watch any episode from say seasons 3-9 and be a much happier person for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaded and barely watchable","review":"It's all been said. Homer isn't a lovable dope; he is a callous, unfeeling, completely selfish ingrate. No substance to the film. The \\"messages\\" of environmentalism and the EPA run rampant are unserious and ultimately trivial. It's one thing to apply absurdities and bizarre exaggerations in a plot, but this film is disconnected from anything real or meaningful, including issues, characters, narratives, or anything else that can sustain interest; The Simpsons is nothing more than a timid Family Guy. Good for cheap laughs. Period. It's a totally jaded film. And the funniest joke in the movie involves Homer gluing his hands to his groin. Hilarious.A few clever slapstick jokes keep the film from being a total waste of time; but it's much closer to one star than 3 stars. It's a shame that nearly 200 people thought this dreck amounted to a 5-star classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let them die before everyone hates them","review":"Don't get me wrong, i love the Simpsons... at least, i used to. If you watched the show you know your favorite episode, your favorite quote, the time you sprayed milk, beer, nyquil, outta your nose over some line or scene. And you know that hasn't happened in YEARS. The movie should remind of us those olden days, and would be good but for the fact that it's not funny, crappily written, and dependent on thinking of Homer and the brood as even dumber than The Family Guy. And i held out hope thinking that they'd try to recapture the magic for their last magical go-round. Wrong. WRONG! SpiderPig is the only clever thing in it. And who the hell is Arnold Whatever... isn't his real name Ranier Wolfcastle? Anyway, see it at the dollar theater and boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the South Park movie for a comparison","review":"I couldn't finish this movie. I didn't bother to see it in the theaters and even had trepidation about renting it as I have felt the Simpsons TV show has been unwatchable for years. My fears were justified--the movie is as uninspired as the last 8-10 years of the show.Consider \\"South Park-Bigger,Longer, Uncut\\". That movie came out when South Park had only been on TV a couple of years--and it is brilliant (IMHO)! They were in their prime and the writing and the music (it's a musical!) were inspired.To bad the Simpsons team waited until they had an empty shell of the original inspired series (which should be laid to rest) before cashing in (and cashing in is all it is) on a big screen release.Very sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aimed squarely at fans of the TV show.","review":"The Simpsons Movie is basically a quadruple-length episode of the TV series, with a storyline that incorporates elements you've seen dozens of times. Production quality is a bit better than the TV episodes, notably in the background illustrations. If you are already a Simpsons fan, familiar with all the good (and not-so-good) people of Springfield, it's pretty funny. The highlight of the movie, for me, was the \\"Itchy & Scratchy\\" cartoon at the beginning. Definitely worth seeing if you like the TV show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good episode","review":"With so much debate over older seasons vs. newer seasons, I have to say that I have enjoyed every season much more than I enjoyed this movie. This was not made for die-hard fans, and lacks most of what makes the Simpsons so entertaining.I won't belabor what others have said, but I will repeat it: Short shrift for the supporting cast, angry Homer not funny Homer, tedious \\"message\\" movie, deficit of jokes. Just so very, very disappointing. But it did make money and some people liked it...ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Film is great, DVD is.. ehh","review":"Most of what I could have said about the film has been said.

The movie has the usual Simpson's violence in it and some cartoon nudity as well. Not suitable for all ages (hence the rating). But my thirteen year old loved it. He continually sings the pig on and now my three year old runs around singing it as well.\\"Spiderpig, Spiderpig,Does whatever a spiderpig does.Can he swing from a web?No he can't, he's a pig.Look out!

However, we had a bit of a snafu when we went to play it. For some reason at Scene 18, it stopped working and wouldn't continue. I believe we received a defective DVD. However, we got in contact with Overstocks_Deals who responded VERY promptly and issued us a refund since they didn't have another copy in stock.

Only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because it didn't work, otherwise, great retailer with great customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patchwork.","review":"This movie has the same problem that the series did, it has too many individual pieces that are edited together. For instance, their was an episode where a mailman was found frozen with hundreds of undelivered peices of mail. That in and of itself would have made a great episode but the mailman was only mentioned as an afterthought. The same goes for this movie as well, it is several good, independant ideas for a tv show or movie all thrown together with tidbits of environmental jargon thrown in to make it appear as if it is one complete movie. It is not, and this method has only fooled a couple of people. Perhaps there are too many writers all contributing nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simpsons, just stop already.","review":"The Simpsons used to be great. Season's 4-8 were brilliant. Now, sadly, the show has become the Saturday Night Live of animation. I suspect it's still on because Fox can't think of anything to replace it with and it hasn't been funny for years. This film should be the final nail in the coffin. Please don't waste your time.

I dont recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Simpsons; Hate the Movie","review":"I like the Simpsons TV show. I think it is very funny. But this movie is bad.One reason it is not funny is because so much of the movie takes place outside Springfield, the supporting characters that usually make the Simpsons have bit roles at best.It is bad because it's portrayal of the family and specifically the relationship between Homer and Bart is bleak, and lacking in love and hope in a way that goes way beyond the normal tension in the series. I felt discouraged and depressed after watching the movie because I know there are real people in the world who really have relationships with their family like that, and it is not funny at all.All that, and the story was dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"MATT GROENING PLEASE \\"STOP\\" MAKING THE SIMPSONS!!!","review":"THE SIMPSONS SEASONS 2 THRU 6 ARE THE \\"ONLY\\" GOOD SIMPSONS THERE ARE.WATCHING BEYOND SEASON SIX MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!MATT GROENING SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR HIS CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY AND FOR HIS CRIME AGAINST THE ORIGINAL SIMPSONS SHOWS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"I've always loved the Simpsons and have watched the show since it first came on, so I was very excited about this movie.

Basically, it's a 90-minute Simpsons episode. And it's done exactly the way a movie of a TV show should be done: take everything that's good about the show and make it more. There's no attempt to change it into something it's not, and no additions to try to grab a new audience. It stays true to its TV roots and audience.The Simpsons Movie is just plain fun.

Just what I expected from Mr. Groening. Even though it is such as long episode, it has the necessary material to provide good time for most of the viewers. It's not necessary to be a fan or even had see any episode before to enjoy it.My favorite character is Homer!

I definitely got the feeling that this was a 45 minute show fluffed into a feature film format. The film is also Homer-centric. Bart's character is less than true to form as he goes soft as the story progresses... as a result we get few gags out of him. There is little to no interaction with the townspeople who make the show so dynamic. All in all, the story is less compelling than some of the 23 minute ones and the execution does little to help it out.Apparently, the writers realized that Simpsons fans such as myself have been waiting so long for a movie that just about anything thrown up on the screen would have sold.PS: Parking was ample."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, just not a place for little kids!!!","review":"This movie is perfect for fans of the TV series, and does not stray too far from it's blend of comedy and irony. They push the jokes a bit futher than they do on tv, and that is why it's PG-13. There were several parts that I found myself chuckling too, and the storyline is always pretty original, but the really young kids around me made the initial experience unpleasent. Kids under about 10 have no real business being at this movie. Leave your young ones at home and come have some fun at this big screen debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simpsons movie","review":"What can I say! It's the Simpsons.

The improvements of Flash 4 over Flash 3 are numerous, and aside from a brief description of MP3 compression I found few references to them. Additonally, the FS Command and Tell Target features (which are central to Flash 4's increased interactivity) are ignored, and the advanced tutorials on the Generator toolbar and scriptibility functions are missing entirely.

If you are experienced with other Macromedia drawing programs you will pick it up quickly. It then moves on to more complicated animations and even has a section on how to configure Flash on a webserver. The chapter that covers optimization is very helpful as well.

A Stranger's Kiss is one of her darker efforts and has a unique set-up for a romance. The hero is an incubus. This is a sexual demon, who sets out to ensnare a heroine who is in a race to save her father from a deadly possession. The hero is hardly your usual hero type, but completely mesmerizing and sexy. Kimberly Raye manages to pull this off with a complicated plot and the paranormal elements she handles so well. This is a must-read for her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This book had great promise when I read the back cover but it didn't live up to it at all.

The trouble is, it is overly so. There are a number of instances where the images and their captions fail to cover little more than half a page - leaving a lot of white paper doing nothing. Elsewhere, some small ancient wood-carvings appear to have been enlarged to occupy a full half page and, in so doing, the effect is lost.Page after page of picture after picture coupled with a large text in \\"bold\\" gives the impression these authors had little to say about Columbus and opted to pad out the book with pictures.

You insert the stripped wire into a tiny chamber. Then you tighten a tiny phillips head screw to push a lid down to capture the wire.

The \\"clamping\\" action is not very secure and I have spent about 1/2 hour trying to get the wires clamped down without allowing the previously inserted wires to slip out--and I still haven't been successful!

The film tells the story of three Vietnam vets who have been quietly carrying the secret burden of the brutality of war for decades. The story is told simply, but creatively, unfolding in an engaging narrative that rarely stumbles. The acting, the cinematography, and the editing are all first-rate. This is no amateur production.

They analyze themselves, they analyze the meaning of life, they analyze one another. But really, not much happens.

I suspect that the master tapes no longer exist. These transfers are obviously taken from VHS tapes, replete with dropouts. The image is VERY soft...which is sort of ironic, given that Hoagland uses extensive graphics in these talks.I think UFOTV needs to reconsider their pricing scheme. I actually feel very offended and ripped off that they are charging over $70 for material of this quality.

And the whole \\"technology is magic\\" thing is just a cop out way of saying, \\"it doesn't make sense because it's beyond our comprehension.\\" Give me a break.The only thing I was able to take away from this movie is the overall feeling of dread it creates. Just a simple thing like having it set in the 70's, and the horrible wallpaper makes you feel uncomfortable.

I kept waiting for it to get better but that moment never came. The movie ended abruptly because the movie never had a plot to begin with and it must ended sometimes; it is one of those endings that you say to yourself. What the heck was that? The concept and story is so bad and I can't believe that they actually spent money on it to make such a film. Bad acting and directing did not help.Please do NOT see this movie. You will loose 2.5 hours of your life that you will never get back. Cameron Diaz career is over after this movie.

I did wish it would be different, though! I found it rubbish from the beginning till the end. And the end made it even worse and even more unrealistic (as far as that was even possible). Ofcourse I can't tell the plot, but if you've seen it and think about it... this didn't help either, did it?I saw the movie for free on tv and I wouldn't spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie.....SAVE YOUR $$$$$","review":"This move was udderly stupid and waste of time.Do yourself a favor and go try to get a traffic ticket, that would be more worthwhile than watching this.This ranks with MARS ATTACKS movie which until now I thought was the worst movie ever made.Cameron Diaz also needed to fire her makeup artist.The 70's decor alone almost had me puking.The movie plot was based in VA. but what was up with the accents they made the actors use, Virginan's don't talk like hicks.

It's a mess of conspiracy theory, psychological thriller, aliens/paranormal movie, Biblical fable, mind control, politics. Who's the villain? The government? Extraterrestrials? People with paranormal abilities? A corporation? Who knows? The pace plods along with lots of little scenes strung-together that go nowhere. The movie raises tons of story questions (why this couple, why 1976, how does the box work, why are there 2 portals to eternal damnation, who are the employers, and on and on and on) but by the end, answers NONE of them. \\"The Ring\\" was as bad, but at least it was visually interesting. This movie doesn't even have that going for it. As for the cast, Diaz looks tired, Marsden looks lost, and Langella looks bored. So was I. But at least *he* got a paycheck out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Like Day the Earth Stood Still-Except this was crap","review":"Somehow Aliens are judging as as too wether o not we will push a button and get million dollars while somebody somwhere dies which makes us look bad and may for Frank Langellas Aliens to put an end to us.

I finally caught it recently and have to say I really enjoyed it. The story begins simple enough but as the film progresses it becomes more involving and mysterious. A unique Twilight Zone-esque tale with fine performances and creepy moments. It's not on the level of Donnie Darko but it's still a fine film. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal...worst adaptation EVER of a Richard Matheson work","review":"Based on an excellent short story, this one gets the Raspberry Award for worst adaptation. Matheson has been incredibly lucky over the years in that he has inspired some amazing adaptations . . . which, in my opinion, points to the strength of the source material. I went in with high hopes with \\"The Box\\" given the strong cast, but this one is a Class-A stinker, something way less than the sum of its parts. It's unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Movie!!!","review":"I recently bought this not knowing what to expect because I never seen Cameron Diaz in a thriller but what caught my attention is of course, the superb acting of FRANK LANGELLA.Im going going to give away the plot, but is great.

The box contains a box with a button on it, if they push it someone they do not know dies and they recieve a million dollars cash. A series of finical problems make them push the button, which is set up nicely. They see the box is nothing more then a wooden prop, no wires to say if they pushed it or not. They press the button and weird stuff starts to happen to them. The movie was going alright, nothing too great, but still enjoyable. However, the movie takes a weird turn and the movie just starts to sucks.

The story, theme, acting , photography, producing and directing must have been by a group of over zealous christian evangelists. Bits and pieces were borrowed from other sci-fi movies.

This is absurd. What are we living in the 80s? Warner Brothers are idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should of Thought \\"Outside This Box\\"","review":"This movie started off promising and quickly went down hill. The plot was all over the place. Add in the horrible acting, or should I say overacting by Cameron Diaz and it becomes unbearable. It's a shame, because the premise seemed interesting. Press the button and someone you don't know dies, a million dollars would then be yours. After sitting through this, I couldn't help but think this would of made a better Twilight Zone episode. I know Rod Serling would of done it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Sci-Fi movies ever","review":"I rarely write movie reviews, but having just finished watching this one I felt compelled to do so. The central theme was basically stolen from a Star Trek Next Generation episode that featured a super advanced being named \\"Q\\", who decided to test the crew. Based on the test results, Q was to decide if the entire human species was to survive. Well, the idea is the same here, but the execution is simply horrible. The whole plot makes little sense, and the only part of the movie that gets the viewer's attention is the first 10 minutes. Afterwards the plot degenerates into a series of completely implausible, boring, and repetitive events. I hope that if one day we are to be \\"evaluated\\" by some whimsical supreme being, that he does not get a hold of a copy of \\"The Box\\". If he does, it will surely result in the annihilation of our species!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously bad!","review":"This was a pointless movie, unless the sole intent was to piss me off, waste my time, and ruin a halfway decent premise.Throughout the viewing, I felt like The Box could have righted itself and turned this pile of cinematic excrement around in order to salvage part of the story... but no. Aside from a couple eerie moments and some fine acting, I can't think of any redeeming features.If you love weird, off-beat thrillers with a psychological and/or philosophical punch, then watch something else.

His terrific beats will make you want to dance and burst out singing even if you don't know one word of Turkish (which I don't). It doesn't matter whether or not you know the language, the music on this CD is worth every penny you spend on it. With his famous singles \\"Simarik\\", \\"Olurum Sana\\" and \\"Bu Gece (Kir Zincirlerini)\\", plus some rarely heard beauties like \\"Gecenin Urkek Kanatlarinda\\" (my absolute favorite) and \\"Ikimizin Yerine\\", this is a must-buy. The only thing it's missing is \\"Sikidim\\".

This was a few months before the opening track Simarik became a big hit throughout Europe. Tarkan proves with this CD that Turkish doesn't have to be a problem to make excellent music.

It scores 5 stars in many different categories. Mnica uses an approach that reminds me of the South American Folkloric style. Wispy, monotone, and very serious. Combined with the masterful talents of Brazilian percussionist Naná Vasconcelos, you have music full of surprises and full of real stories. Stories that tell of lives and adventures unfamiliar to the average American. This is a true treasure. As an added benefit, there are a few songs that have a very traditional American Jazz style as well. The untraditional instruments and musical mixture take one to new destinations in sound.. All I can say is, \\"WOW!\\" The music on this disque will enchant and entertain for years to come.... Purchase this cd without fear, it will not disappoint! Obrigado Mnica!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful and dreamy Brazilian folk","review":"This is the first solo album of Mnica Salmaso, where she explores Brazilian musical tradition from a modern point of view. Mnica has a beautiful, languid mezzosoprano voice and a perfect vocal technique and the percussion arrangements of Naná Vasconcelos, which are reminiscent of New age music, are also outstanding. Moreover, it is very interesting to listen to the lyrics, since the songs talk about Brazilian history, legends, folklore and religion. Some of the tracks, as \\"Tajapanema - Foi Bto Sinhá\\" are true masterpieces. The only defect I find is that all songs sound a little bit the same but still it is a compelling CD. Soothing and intoxicating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classics Selena","review":"Im so glad to buy this album. Many of these songs I found near impossible to find before.

Carmen Lomas Garza has compiled a series of papel picado/cut-paper art projects with excellent instructions on folds and cuts, the elements of design, and the tools and materials needed to make successful papel picado banderitas/banners. Strong on helpful hints and technique, this book allows you to learn as you go through so that you can add real variety to any cut-paper project whether it be the simpliest or the most complex. My sister and I got together a small group - 3 adults & 2 youngsters - and totally enjoyed creating several papel picado projects. Hands down, The Fan, was the overwhelming favorite of our little group of novice banderita makers.

Otherwise, this book was a waste of time and money (we are sending it in for a refund)...if you are a Christian, I suggest NOT buying this book and instead purchasing \\"Intended for Pleasure\\" by Dr. Ed Wheat, who writes from a CHRISTIAN view. There are a lot of un-christian views in this book...but \\"Intended for Pleasure\\" is completely moral and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genealogy of BONE family includes BOHON","review":"I really want to purchase this book. I reviewed it some years ago from a copy in a Genealogical Library in Canton Lewis Co MO. The various spellings for the Bone Family include BOHON. My own Bohon line begins with my father\`s mother and goes back to Walter, son of Benjamin Andrew Bohon in KY. I wish to glean from my own copy of this book and make connections to the de Bohun of England. Bohun came with William the Conqueror and fought at the Battle of Hastings, in 1066. The region in Normandy from whence he originated was called Bohon.

There are good books on this worthy subject but this one is very bad. It's poorly written, pompous in tone, yet full of lame assumptions any college student could see beyond. The few good ideas are not the author's own, though he rarely gives credit where credit is due. It's as if it was written in one sitting, by a not very intelligent person who had done little reading on the subject and didn't have much respect for ideas. I don't usually bother writing bad reviews but politically I'm on the same side as Sale on many of these issues and he makes an embarrassing, sophomoric mess of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"This movie is a must see.

But it was poorly down, like in scenes where Cuba feels up a young girl. It should be a very serious and disturbing look at what his character does but it just looked like a joke done very stupidly.Cuba Gooding Jr is a truly brilliant actor, why would he play this character. I mean if their was good dialogue, and he didn't play the role so over the top street but more serious, evil, bad and not stupid he could have been a great character. The movie it self had a lot of downs near the end I thought maybe something but it just got worse.We can only cross are fingers and hope Cuba career and choice in movies stop declining, For example he is a much better actor than Vin Diesel but who's movies are bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUBY GETS DIRTY","review":"The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY. Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY. Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones? Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust. All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him. There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its called training day...","review":"Who does Cuba think he's fooling?

The price will usually be better, considering S&H;, and you won't be stuck with 6x of something you end up hating. Also there are a lot of other varieties of pocky than what's being sold here. There's even \\"giant\\" pocky, \\"custard\\" pocky, \\"green tea\\" etc... Always more new ones coming out.But, if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price, than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker. Beware though, even I didn't like the sesame. And FYI, Men's pocky is just \\"bitter\\" instead of \\"milk\\" chocolate.

Of all the episodes I have been exposed to over the years this is the absolute funniest!!! The movie is soooo bad...the first time you see it you really don't have any clue what is going on....but the bots make it so funny that it doesn't really matter what is really going on...all you know is that you are enjoying yourself. And that is the ultimate point of entertainment...Is it not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want you to stop this nonsense about a dog . . .","review":"I've always found \\"Monster A-Go-Go\\" to be a worse movie than \\"Manos\\" (this one has a plot -- the barest sliver of a plot, but its existence can be discerned after repeated viewings), but this is still a silver-rimmed stinker. Three voices dubbing all the actors, endlessly repeated cinematography, and the bizarre fusion jazz/fourth-grade flute soundtrack make up one horrible experience for our boys.But they come out with flying colors. \\"Hired, Part II\\" is also one of the funniest shorts ever -- even if the commentary on the movie was slack, the short would be worth the purchase. Bad movies always bring out the best in our fearless riffers.Fun (um, sort of) facts: The actor playing Torgo committed suicide a year after this movie was made; the fertilizer salesman who made the film expected it to be huge, and later apologized when he realized it wouldn't be.

Take a small family (husband, wife, daughter), a poodle named Fifi, and a bellhop--er, servant--named Torgo (complete with two gimpy knees), and you have the makings for some inanely bad wackiness. Unlike most MST3Ks, you'll find the best riffs during the first half of the episode (the energy peters out slightly toward the end). The host segments are surprisingly strong (a parody of the 'driving' sequence; a talk on monstrous physical deformities; and Michael J. Nelson's priceless appearance at the end as Torgo the pizza delivery boy). Even though I wouldn't rank this episode up there with \\"Mitchell\\" and \\"Hobgoblins,\\" it certainly does the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best worst movie your not watching","review":"this the worst movie ever made, not including eight heads in a dufflebag.

In fact, the movie nut here was a middle-aged fertilizer salesman from El Paso, Texas, and the rest of cast looks as if their high-school days had passed as well, but they bring the same sort of clunky enthusiasm to the project. The non-plot concerns some lost travellers, a stumbling satyr named Torgo, a lot of women in sheer nighties, and The Master, a terribly-intense fellow clad in what looks like one of Shelly Winter's castoff muu-muu's. Along the way, an annoying poodle gets offed, Torgo makes an arthritic pass at the heroine, who screams a lot, and the nightie brigade spend a lot of time rolling around in the dirt and slapping each other.
