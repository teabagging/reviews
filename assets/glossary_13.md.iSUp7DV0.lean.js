This Mingus ensemble at times sounds like a whole orchestra - maybe it is just the intensity - especially on 'Hatian Fight Song' - where Mingus really propels the music by his own passion for the theme - which is almost primal. I think this is also some of the best work of Jimmy Knieper I have ever heard.

However, I was looking for a medium capacity trunk bag that was smaller than the typical bags available, and this looked perfect. Once it arrived I unfortunately discovered that the foam insulated walls take up a lot of space, leaving an interior barely larger than a large seat post bag. In addition, the bag is heavier than typical because of the thick plastic connector on the bottom that locks it to the rack. The combo weight of the bag plus rack is almost 3 pounds more than a comparable seat post bag.I returned the bag and rack, and bought a \\"Detours - Hightail ULP\\" bag. It weighs 1 pound less than the Topeak bag/rack combo, and has the medium capacity I was looking for. I love it. I bought it at eBags for less than the Amazon price, but it was supposedly on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too small.","review":"I originally ordered this bag because we had purchased the MTX DXP bag and loved it. Because we don't need such a large bag all the time, we thought that this nice, small, road bag would work for other times, carrying more than the seat wedge, but still a nice small size. We were wrong; it carries about the same amount as the Trek 120 seat wedge and takes up more room. We decided to go for the larger Topeak RX Trunk Bag with Side Pannier -- it's great (and add to that, we found it here on Amazon for half the price!) If you are thinking about ordering this bag -- order the Topeak RX with Pannier instead! You'll be much happier with your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"compact and nice","review":"I like this setup because I am able to ride my bicycle 6miles to work and not have to worry about the effects of a long ride to work.

The blues is incredible. The cajun and zydeco numbers are unbeatable. Same is true of bluegrass, texmex, gospel. Where did rock get its start?

It is (and always will be) a cherished memory.Now, all these years later, to have discovered a music CD which puts those wonderful poems to music, has been a joyful surprise. The melodies are cheerful, sometimes quiet and reflective, and always entertaining.The producer, Ted Jacobs, has a warm and honest voice, which seems to have an Irish accent. very charming! The other vocalists are equally talented, and there are even children's voices in certain songs. It makes for a very positive listening experience indeed. My children all love this CD, and the one who is grown and has a child of her own, has purchased a copy as well.I couldn't recommend this CD enough. Your children will enjoy it whileplaying, while driving, or in their own quiet times.This is the first time I've given a review, I hope it helps someone !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I was initially really excited when I found this cd. It's such a wonderful idea to put great poetry to music, esp. for children, as I think they find it more accessible. I previewed the songs online and wasn't very impressed, but figured with so many positive reviews I might give it another try. I brought it home from the library and listened to it with my nearly 3-year-old daughter. No go. This is just not our thing. My daughter stood up and walked out of the room (very abnormal reaction). And I, for one, simply can't stand the sound of it. I'm no music analyst, but it just seems a little too precious... and flat. Just thought I'd voice a differing opinion. Give it a listen. This cd may not be for you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Moon\\" fan","review":"I personally watched this CD grow from an idea to a CD. I must say that it is the most sweetest music I have ever heard. I constantly have this CD playing in my office and never grow tired of it.

Plus, after I started feeding this to my guinea pig, he got sick. I'm not sure if this was the cause, but when I stopped and started feeding him something else he recovered very quickly.

After reading the New York Times Tuesday Science Section for years, I wished that those writers would gather the stories in the \\"Scientists\\" series and put them in a book. In CURIOUS MINDS the personal reiminiscences include surprises such as a woman who loved Nancy Drew and her sleuthing. Richard Dawkins, often in the news now,loved the Dr. Doolittle books. A good number of women scientists are included. Some of the scientists are from \\"scientific\\" families, others from good ole blue collar roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Atypical Child Becomes An Academic","review":"Anyone buying this book as a gift or for insight on how a typical child becomes a scientist will be very disappointed. Do scientists work in industry? Not in this book. Is your child a female? She would be a distinct minority if she becomes a scientist, to judge by this book. Will your child have a Ph.D. by age 21? No? How disappointing. The scientist profiled in the first chapter, Nicholas Humphrey, descendent of famous scientists who grew up an acquaintance of, among others, young Stephen Hawking, captures why this book misses the mark in its selection of role models for aspiring scientists. He \\"wonders if having been born to be a scientist has not undercut my right to call myself a scientist at all.\\" That is too harsh. It's not his fault that such a good idea for a book and a promising title were wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do it for your children.","review":"If you are concerned about the education of your children, you must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayo Clinic on Healthy Aging","review":"Mayo Clinic on Healthy Aging is about taking better care of yourself physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually and financially.

She finds the uncle to be a charismatic but imposing figure, even though he is confined to a wheelchair, he is a powerful man. Things start to become unusual when \\"accidents\\" occur that could have killed Phillipe. To make matters more interesting, the uncle's's son, Raoul comes to the chateau and is a younger, dashing version of his father. Linda begins to suspect that someone is trying to kill Phillipe and she must find a way to save him, even if it means giving up the man she loves. This was a well paced romance/thriller and I found it to be engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking good read!","review":"Wow! This is the sort of book that comes along all too rarely. It is a fast-paced, suspenseful story with intricate plot twists and characters who seem so real-to-life that you feel sure you'd recognize them on the street. Mary Stewart is a master of this hybrid genre (mystery/suspense/romance/psychological thriller)and, for my money, Nine Coaches Waiting is her best effort among an impressive and prolific array of novels. A caveat should be issued to the reader, however -- this book may well cause serious sleep deprivation. It's that compelling. You're in for a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so mysterious","review":"There was something so amazing about this book even when I first started reading it. I couldn't put it down. The book takes place in France. Linda goes to become the governess for the young Comte de Valmy. Someone is trying to dispose of him. Phillipe, the little boy was just so endearing that the book took be on an emotional journey because I love the boy. Also I was caught up in who could be trusted. I really wanted to trust the charming Raoul, but I didn't know what to think. I loved the relationship between Linda and Raoul, it was kind of humorous to me in a strange way. I really enjoyed this book. It was a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands up to the test of time.","review":"This book was my introduction to Mary Stewart. I found it in a box of books in the attic when I was about twelve or thirteen. I read it and most if not all of her other novels throughout my teenage and young adult years. I reread this recently (30 years later) and find it is still enjoyable. It seems all the romances on the market these days are nothing but bodice rippers and they get boring real fast. I much prefer books with a plot and character development. I highly recommend Mary Stewart's novels to every one.Has any one else noticed that her characters smoke so many cigarettes in her novels? Maybe I do because I'm an ex smoker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layers of mystery -- Very Exciting Read!","review":"If you find the average mystery/thriller novel too grim with grisly murders and lots of gore, and prefer more \\"depth\\"-- you'll most likely enjoy Mary Stewart's style. She adds a romantic twist, and makes the girl Linda Martin very relateable. Most noteworthy is how \\"real\\" the characters seem--I felt as though I had actually met them, and I admit, developed a slight crush on one of the characters...As far as suspense goes, I usually pride myself in being able to guess what happens next, but I was often caught off guard. It really picks up speed in the second half--and is more exhilerating than watching a action movie (at least in my opinion). I finished at 3AM in the morning, feeling that Stewart is very talented and fluid with language; sometimes I stopped just to re-read how beautiful her phrasings were. All in all, you will be guessing until the very last paragraph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's one for Masterpiece Theater!!!","review":"This would be a wonderful three part-er for Masterpiece Theater, eh?

How lucky you are if you have not yet read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Book. Period.","review":"I am an English teacher and avid reader. I love Mary Stewart's romantic novels and this is the best one. Moody French setting, charm of a big country house and money, the rakish dark handsome man that the heroine falls helplessly in love with and then he has to convince her that yes, it is her that he loves. The love story is paramount over the mystery, which is what I prefer. When I embark on a re-read of this book, I cannot. put. it. down. I love 'Nine Coaches Waiting.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Page-turner","review":"Mary Stewart's most famous novel, Nine Coaches Waiting is sure to please lovers of classic romance and suspenseful adventure. It is classy in that it employs neither racy or super-scary elements. It's a great read to keep you up all night wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a great read","review":"I am not one to read \\"girly\\" books so was surprised when I really enjoyed reading this at my step mom's suggestion. It reminded me a little of Heidie and Rebecca rolled together - calling up fond memories of youthful reading. It is predictable yet suspenseful; corny yet engaging; implausible yet believeable. I loved Mary Stewart's Merlin books so gave it a shot and am glad I did. This is not a deep thinking book, but if you want to get away for a while into a pleasant place, this book will take you there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good dark mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I highly, highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best by Mary Stewart","review":"I have read quite a few of Mary Stewart's books and for anyone who is interested \\"This Rough Magic\\" ties with \\"Nine Coaches\\". \\"The Moon-Spinners\\" is very good, so is \\"My Brother Michael\\" and \\"Airs Above the Ground\\". These are more along the romance line as opposed to fantasy as in \\"The Crystal Cave\\" which was very good but a different style of story.I first found Mary Stewart when I was rather young The Wonderful World of Disney did \\"The Moon-Spinners\\" with Haley Mills.

I put one in my garage and found the one that I had to be most unsatisfactory. The arms are spaced too far apart, hence there is no braking tension on the roll and the roll would occasionally fall out when I tried to tear off a towel (of necessity using two hands to keep the roll from spinning). The little spring-loaded \\"ears\\" that retract into the arms for loading the roll are spring loaded by a sort of plastic bar spring, one of which broke after a very short period of time, rendering the thing useless. I was almost glad when it broke since I then had no guilt when I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This paper towel holder is nicer looking than shows in the pictures.

It is the perfect size for any size roll of paper towels (even the fat double rolls!) and the design of the holders that go inside the ends of the roll, keep the roll secure, and easy to replace. I dont understand the reviews that say it is not good because you have to pull the paper towel to the side, and if you pull it straight out, the whole roll comes off... well... hello?... that is just common sense!!! Silly people! I love the holder. It does exactly what it is supposed to do efficiently, and looks good doing it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great product - works exactly as it looks and should.

No more ruined rolls because they fell in a sink full of water, no more wasted sheets because it rolled across a dirty garage floor! We bought six additional holders for ourselves after the first one worked out so well and plan to buy more to give our children and friends next holiday season. By the way, it hangs perfectly on the under side of a cupboard or shelf...you just have turn it around so the flat side of the spring-loaded hook faces the opposite way you will pull.

We purchase their music BECAUSE of their old style. Charlie Rich really screwed the pooch on this one with his updated style. New and Improved ought to be left to those who actually NEED improvement. Rich does not qualify for that group. It sounds like he is singing in a cheap French cabaret, and that he is bored out of his mind to boot. And his rendition of America The Beautiful and Amazing Grace is, well, DISGRACEFUL!! The reason I gave two stars is for the obviously old recording of a few of his \\"old\\" songs.

Although it is adequately thorough, the book's explanations are poorly organized and consistently cluttered with unnecessary & outdated commentary. For example, the book goes so far as to chide electronic instruments as \\"gloomy\\" and \\"hollow,\\" insisting they have nothing to offer a serious musician. ABC of Music was published in 1963 and repeatedly shows its age.

Along with Ralph Vaughn Williams, the most famous and highly regarded British composers of the twentieth century, that's who.

It is an extremly well illustrated book spanning almost the entire history of Omega from early pocket watches to recent Speedmasters from 2005. On every page there is a full-page detailed photograph of an Omega model with some minimum written text on Model name, Caliber and sometimes year of production. Though the text is minimal the photos are all in colour and in large format enabling details of each watch/model to be easily picked out. Not only many variations of the better known models but also less well known time-pieces, clocks, stop-watches and so on give a well rounded presentation of the brand. As such it is invaluable for collectors or anyone interested in Omega watches. For the quality of its photos and spectrum of models covered it gets 5/5. The minimal text brings that down to 4/5. Nevertheless I thoroughly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate. Simple. Powerful.","review":"The love stories were intricately told, with a mystical overtone.

Coming 16 years after the band's last release, original members William Tsamis and Mark Zonder (Fates Warning) teamed up with none other than Hammerfall vocalist Joacim Cans to release an album of (mostly) new Warlord material.Rising Out of the Ashes featured a reworked version of the song \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\", as well as 8 new songs. The album is a worthy addition to the Warlord catalog, and sounds like it could have been released during the band's Metal Blade days. It's epic in an old-school way, without the symphonic touches of modern power metal. The lyrics, like all good 80's power metal, focus on science-fiction, fantasy, mythology, and the occult. This is classic power metal from start to finish, and should appeal to fans of classic bands like Fifth Angel, Crimson Glory, Warrior, and much of the NWOBHM movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story!","review":"This book is a wonderful story that shows children how everyone is different.

But Laurel and Hardy used the same gag concept in \\"The Chimp\\" (1932), I think a lot of fuss is being made over a very minor (sorry!) issue.The only reason to consider the last page to be adult humor is that the subject isn't going to be familiar to the kids, since it refers to an individual whose heyday was in the late '60s and early '70s. A quick explanation would make it clear to almost any child, who would then be able to get it.

I consider impossible why unlike other pianists that study at least 8 hours a day, Gieseking didn't pass more than 3 at 4 hours in the piano.

I called ProCom and they said they had some trouble with these and that I should bent the bracket with the sensor down toward the flame. That didn't help. One time the fan ran for about a minute then turned back off so I know the wires are connected. It seems that the sensor, which is mounted on the end of a sheetmetal L bracket, is not close enough to the metal divider between the flame and the cavity where the blower is. I returned the blower to Menards and exchanged it for a new one. Same results. I may make a new bracket that is a little longer so the sensor is tight against the metal divider to get a better heat transfer to the sensor. 2 stars because the blower only works good on \\"ON\\" mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"In the last couple of years, I have purchased four of these units.

Anyone who has plugged in their Shures or other high-quality canalphones to an airline seat knows that it cannot be set at a low enough level for comfortable listening, nor can it be finely tuned between volume steps... the Shure Level Attenuator has a thumbwheel volume control, is inexpensive, and should be with you every time you fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job for computers and portable devices","review":"Even though the instructions say that the level attenuator is only for airline use, I use it with low-resistance headphones on my Mac and Nintendo DS.

He did what he needed to do to become a pilot and then serve his country bravely.The points that come out in the book for all to see are that many deaths in war are hardly war related. He was around a fair number of deaths that seemed to be preventable or worse from negligence resulting in a pilot's own death or someone innocent on the ground.I will say the Mr Curtis did some dumb things, I would go so far as to say I was getting a bit frustrated that he didn't seem to learn as he matured into a full fledged fighter pilot.

At the very least he contributed to the strength of our numbers at a time of World War, but he reveals precious little more about the times except to say that he was there, and lived to tell the tale.

Adolescent pranks instigate revenge and so on when they become adults. The opening sequence involving the initiation rites for nasty Whitey Dobbs is tense, chilling and quite well done.Once the boys grow up, though, it becomes a Twilight Zonish nightmare, with Whitey obviously out for some nasty revenge. Dobbs' character is effectively nasty, and the heroics of Piper Blackmoore and Dean Truman are appropriately chivalrous. However, by the time we realize what's happening, Brown falls into the trap of trying to explain time travel, and gets lost in his own revelations. But taken as a sci-fi creepfest, it works and Brown does well with developing his characters and the frightening scenarios.

The characters are so obvious, with such gratuitous identities, that they appear plastic and one dimensional. This was overcome in 24/7 by a fast moving, intelligent plot, but no such luck here.

At that time, I did not begin, but read the book, which gave many useful tips. Within the past 2 years, I have started running and I am currently training for a marathon. This book has proved to be a valuable tool to reference regarding many aspects of running, including footwear and clothing, nutrition, weather, health, nutrition, etc., etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Book for Women Runners!","review":"I am so glad I bought this book! Claire's advice is comprehensive and she covers virtually every subject that is of interest to women runners. She talks about training for different races, nutrition, special concerns for women, running safely, stretching, weight training, and more. I recommend this training guide for any woman who is interested in beginning a running program or is looking to improve her running. This is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is EVERYTHING a women needs to hear--motivation and all!","review":"This book makes every woman feel as though they can achieve anything by giving the motivation to do everything. It not only gives the facts, but it gives reasons to run, how to run, where to run, everything you need to know about running, especially for a woman. It first gives you the health reasons to run and then gives you REAL reasons--to make yourself proud of your self. The book not only gives motivation, it gives you ways to keep up the motivation, and not get sick of the running, because we all know we can keep up with a schedule for a week and it is all over. But, this book makes it so its all over when YOU WANT it to be over--never! The book hits every point that a normal running book would, but it also hits every point a woman needs to hear. It is a great book. So, if you need motivation, reason, facts, and ways to achieve your goal, well, Get This Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful information","review":"I learned a lot after reading this book.

I ran only a one short race when I recieved this book as a gift, and as I read it I became SO inspired that I decided to do a marathon! Through all my training, I think I referenced back to this book at least every other day, and the answer I was looking for was always there. Never in my life did I think I would EVER run 26 miles, but now thanks to this book and becoming so inspired, I can proudly say for the rest of my life \\"Once when I was 24 years old, I ran a marathon . . . \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Book of Womens Running is a MUST READ!!","review":"This book will inspire ANYONE interested in the glorious and refreshing sport of running...the techniques and fine-tuning explained were just what I was looking for!!

The pen included three color pens (black, blue & red) and a 0.5 pencil. I had to purchase the stylus separately for $2 and change and then replace the red ink with the stylus. It's no big deal, but make sure that the stylus is included if you want the pen for that purpose.2) For mine, the black ink leaks a little bit causing smearing. I am about to return to the store and complain. I think that the leaking stops with continuous use, but I was disappointed since the pen is so expensive.3) It is a bit heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the odd releases from Japan","review":"Copyright must have run out on everything the Ventures ever recorded in the Land of the Rising Sun.

The thought of Jesus coming in my lifetime is gas in my engine, In this book, Dr. Eby tells of how he also went to hell and likewise gives an account of his paradise experience when he died temporarily. Amazing book. Another book by Dr.Eby: Didn't you read my book - also tells of the same accounts in even more detail.

Many hardcore Eby-followers claim that he was the modern-day Methuselah, and after his death the rapture would occur. Well, two years have passed and no rapture. Is the rapture coming soon? I think so, but dont believe some date-setting false prophet for an exact time as it is not for us to know the times or seasons.Go to this website if you want to see how hard core Eby followers are calling dr Eby \\"Methuselah\\" out of their own mouths because they love not the truth.http://www.geocities.com/bramlett2000/dreby.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and well written!!","review":"Randolph Clare, owner of a cotten manufacturer finds trouble with his competition when they decide enough is enough!

Its a surprisingly touching holiday movie, with great performances from Howard Hessman, and Jennifer Love Hewitt(Here billed as Love Hewitt).With the exception of \\"Part Of Five,\\" I was never a huge Hewitt fan. Home For Christmas was a great example of how good she can be when Hollywood isn't giving her bad scripts. Her chemistry with Hessman was terrific, and that smile could light up the night.

Zack actually sings on a few tracks!!! he's actually pretty good at it. its funny to hear this, being so used to just rappin' n screamin. i think rage is a better band because theyre more original and innovative, but I definately recomend Inside Out to anyone who wants to get into punk/hardcore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool for RATM collectors, not that great otherwise","review":"It is cool to have an early CD featuring Zac Del La Rocha of Rage Against The Machine, but the songs on here are just ok.

As a travel book, it is very disappointing since Pickering is too involved in himself to describe parts of Australia. One can only find glimpses of information about Australia scattered among the daily concerns of Pickering family. Where you expect to find descriptions of Australian people, you find how much Samuel Pickering paid for his breakfast ($13.50), how much gas costs (76.5 cents) and other trivialities of daily life. Samuel Pickering is too absorbed with himself to describe Australia. Although Pickering's writing style is fluid and witty, the lack of observation of his surroundings makes this book a boring travel book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect - just like the one from Apple","review":"The item was received earlier than expected and works the same as the Apple lightning cable received with the product.

It's been waiting for an American production to challenge it, but Mauceri's new set isn't it. For one thing, the conductor is woefully flat and foursquare in his rhythms--it's embarrassing to hear the jazz drained out of every number.The two principals, Alvy Powell and Marquita Lister, are decent, but both have wobbly voices under pressure and a tendency to tip-toe through their most famous numbers, as if passion is too vulgar ('Bess, you is my woman now' is especially lifeless). The performers in general seem uncertain about how to play the dated Catfish Row denizens, so we hear every kind of accent from Sportin' Life's blackface caricature to Bess's hoity-toity opera vowels. The selling point that this is \\"how Gershwin himself would have done it\\" might carry more weight if the performance itself wasn't so lackluster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Momemts in Basketball History","review":"One of the longest and greatest university basketball tradition.

It's got a great interface and is very user friendly.

Every CD I tried to burn had a coaster or failed withought a warning on my computer. I have used other bad products before, so I bought this one hoping it would be better than the others.. but I was heavily dissapointed. Never judge a book by it's cover.. or in this case, never judge a BURNER by it's name. I have done the burning process many times before this, and I was shocked at how easy it was at first, but then during the copying of my files and other complications of CD's, I was shocked by how my computers responded to the product. I think that you should spend your money on something worth the dough... and not something that could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Avoid CD Coasters with This Product","review":"I have found my Click 'n Burn Pro easier to use than either Easy CD Creator or Nero 6. I also had the failed-burn CD-coaster problem at first, but I found that the product has additional choices for the burn process, which allow the caching of files. Ever since I've cached the files, whether audio or data, I've never had a failed burn. The main opening screen needs to be accessed, and one of the icons allows \\"options,\\" which will allow the caching.My only reservation -- which I hope will be addressed by the newest version -- is that the product doesn't seem to handle CD-RW disks, allowing the copying of individual files using Windows Explorer. In this area, Easy CD Creator and Nero 6 seem superior -- especially the latter, since ECDC has never listed my external Sony CD-R(W) drive as supported, in contrast to Nero 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerson iTone iP500 Portable Audio System for iPods (Silver)","review":"This is a great way to utilize your iPod.

Sound quality was terrible, which surprised me, because other reviewers had had nice things to say about it. The straw that broke the camel's back was the adapter that was supposed to fit the iPod Nano. It simply did not work. The only way we could connect the Nano was without any adapter, and that didn't look or feel right, too fragile. I spent a little more on the Altec Lansing iM600, which sounds fantastic, although that product's clock/alarm clock, supposedly integrated to the iPod's, is bad engineering. for one, you set the alarm and you have to leave the unit on and there's a hum you have to listemn to all night.

Just finished this \\"novel\\" and after 375 pages of setting the scene, I almost threw the book across the room. Yes, it is beautifully, achingly rendered. Every aspect is richly detailed and serves to draw you in and keep the pages turning. However, it feels like only half a story; like the author couldn't imagine a resolution that would satisfy, so he just gave up. The reader gets nothing. I understand that in real life people go missing and aren't ever found, but this was clearly a staged disappearance on Jennifer's part, and we never have an inkling of how or why. I know this is meant to be an examination of a downward spiralling psyche, and so it is. But without the rest of the story, it's just a lot of pretty phrases. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"How can the desparate search for a lost wife not be compelling?Meanwhile his prose has those tiny brushstrokes that snap your head back.Fine .. but does it 'say' anything?I really think it does...and other reviewers have opened my eyes to that.

When the dazed daughter shows up without his wife, he starts a frantic, disorganized and eventually drunken search for her all over Europe. We watch the rapid descent of the hero into a state in which his 7 year old provides the only direction and stability of his life. He is only barely believable as a character and his daughter is even less credible. The writing is rich and often elegant but contains too much material that I would have considered daring as a teenage in the 60's but now seems trite. The story does not really develop, it just ends. Perhaps some would consider this book avant-garde but I just thought it bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"life can wait - you wont be able to put this book down","review":"This was a read of a lifetime.

The DVD invents charges and baseless claims that are so unbelievable it's amazing any thinking person would find them credible.Despite the \\"all Monica all the time\\" scandal, America too quickly forgot that Clinton's eight years in office was the greatest economic growth period in our history. He left office with a $5 trillion budget surplus -- only to have Bush/Cheney turn it into a $10 trillion deficit. In time, history will praise Clinton and finally relegate Bush to the most incompetent and misguided administration in this nation's history. Sadly, this DVD will not contribute to that legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!!!!!

In the end she made friends with her again. I still don't like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read for Sellers or Future Home Sellers","review":"I liked this book a lot. It is easy to read and moves well. They have a lot of ideas, concepts, tips, hints and other useful and current information for home sellers. They don't go into a lot of facts and figures on specific values of each improvement or change - but since that is market specific, I'm not sure how they could. The only negative I have is that the Before and After pictures are rather small and often show the room from different views so it's hard to see the entire before/after effect. They have step by step instructions for several of the most common and most valuable projects that are very useful for the novice. The ideas range from complex and dramatic changes to very simple low/no budget fixes. It is very much like the show, but they address all issues and situations and rooms in the book which they cannot do in each episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a beginner","review":"Not enough detail info or \\"example\\" pictures to please me.

Also, when Nancy invites her elderly mailman in for a drink of cocoa, his mailbag is stolen from Nancy's porch. Nancy sets out to find the other Nancy Drew and to locate the person who took the mailbag so that she can restore the tarnished reputation of her mailman. Personally, I found this book to be very boring. The mystery is not exciting and there is very little action in the book. Nancy solves the mystery in the end, but it is not through brilliant detective work, it is because she attends a football game at Emerson University.

At first, I thought he was just being funny, and imitating an \\"old African-American\\" sound and style of singing; like a parody.

Bob Brozman is the J.C. Whitney of slide guitar - (each song includes every unnecessary option and accessory). In a massive, tedious, overkill, the first DVD is mostly devoted to how to hold and move the slide just like the instructor. If you really want to play slide guitar just listen to a lot of whoever you like, tune to open, and have at it.

To me, Monk did not integrate with Blakey's band. They are playing in a quite straight up style, and he is in a very broken motifs mood. His style is very percussive here (short abrupt chords, with little continuity) and keeps running against the music the others weave around him. It sounded to me like a kid sabotaging the music. He is silent on the head out of 'evidence', or on the drums solo: those are the best parts.(and don't get me wrong: I love Monk, he's a genius and one of the greatest composers, it just did not fit here)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not last long","review":"I charged it and the battery went dead within 8 hours. the batt only had 2stars rating.

Included are the negotiations (or lack thereof) between the AEUG and Axis, the attack of Kilamanjaro, some Psycho Gundam action and the firing of the colony laser. The bad news is that the English language dub is sub-par. In a few instances, either the translation was sloppy or it was just badly written originally, but either way a few conversations sound completely unrealistic. Minor things like not using conjunctions in the heat of battle, but still. Also, there is the lack of swearing. It's a war. There should be some profanity. This makes it feel kiddy. I mean holy crap, even the word \\"kill\\" is deemed inappropriate, and replaced with \\"take his life\\" or some other euphemism. Lame.So if you don't mind reading your TV shows, this gets a five.

The bracket attaches to the handle bars, but there is no third point of attachment, so it forms a pivot or hinge. Even if you screw it down tight it will still sag until it hits your front wheel or fender. I am going to put something between the stem and the back of the basket to keep this from happening, but you would think they could have figured this out themselves.The basket itself is nice and the quick release is well engineered. But given the choice, I would not have bought it after watching it slowing sag away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design made it an expensive laundry basket","review":"This product failed the first time I used it. It threw all my groceries out of the basket, and if I hadn't used a bungie cord, they would have gone into the street. The connection device is poorly engineered, and now it holds my bicycle laundry, gloves, hats, and helmet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking basket, but structurally deficient","review":"I have owned this basket for two years. It is very stylish and has a powered epoxy finish to prevent corrosion. It attaches to the handlebars but I needed to provide additional support underneath to carry groceries without the basket wobbling precariously. Even with this additional support, the bracket containing the handlebar grips eventually separated from the basket. The metal mesh literally ripped apart from the mounting bracket. I do not use this basket for decoration or carrying light loads as I use my bike for much of my shopping. Anyone wanting a front basket for such utilitarian use should consider a basket that has, besides handlebar grips, strut supports attaching to the front wheel axle, such as some of the Wald models. Such baskets do not lift off, a feature not required in any case if you use a shopping bag, but they are much less likely to break when carrying a couple quarts of milk and a five pound bag of flour over the bumps and ruts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, support system breaks","review":"I have other Topeak products that are of high quality, but this went into the trash after numerous attempts to properly mount it. Followed all instructions but the flimsy little cable that is supposed to hold the basket from sliding down doesn't work. First, it slips a lot. When you tighten it, it easily frays from the holding screw. Finally, just when you think you got it positioned and tightened properly, the stub on the other end goes through the weak plastic hole in the bracket that is supposed to hold it (metal being held by a plastic retainer = bad idea).So we called Topeak and got a new wire sent to us. Same problem within 10 minutes. I suppose the basket works great if you keep it empty. We gave up and threw this piece of garbage out."},{"rating":"1","title":"great basket with brain dead mounting system","review":"I wish I'ld seen the reviews before I bought it. Mine doesn't sag but only because I noticed the incipient problems and put washers behind all the screws before they tore through. Even with that, its unbelievably bouncy. It really needs a second mount point. Engineering one now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool basket","review":"This is a great looking basket. I was a bit worried that it may not hold much, as far as weight is concerned. But, that is not a problem with my bike, as my front reflector seems to keep it stabled just fine.If you do purchase this basket, don't forget to put the one inch strips of foam inside of the handlebar attachment, to keep it from slipping. I had to take apart to put them in, because I had forgotten to do that, (or rather, didn't know where they went until I had it all together)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost got me killed","review":"This basket actually worked very well for me for two years, UNTIL the wire mesh of the basket wore through where it is attached and the whole basket fell off while I was riding, almost causing a nasty spill. The basket always did have a lot of movement and tipping to it, but was still functional until this happened! I dont' think I'd buy another basket from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy! Bad mounting design.","review":"I bought this basket after having it recommended at a local bike shop...\\"can it transport a gallon of milk?\\" I asked....\\"Sure.\\" Not at all....the plastic mount is not sufficient to hold the basket without drooping. This basket is not useful for groceries or any other items with any weight at all. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy enough for regular use","review":"I agree with previous reviewer about difficulty of getting the basket firmly mounted to the handlebars so that it is secure and doesn't move. With a lot of effort, though, I was able to do that. The problem I had, and the reason why I now need to buy a new basket, is that the basket cannot handle much weight. After a year's use where I have put books and other objects that are not super heavy but not light either, the basket has become unwelded to the bracket and thus completely unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for anything heavy","review":"the good: generally seems well made. it will probably serve you well if you want to carry small, light loads. the quick-release works well.the bad: if you carry anything substantial or dense, the handlebar mount is not up to the task and will tend to let the basket \\"droop\\" down. if you tighten it up as hard as you can, you might get it to stay if you are lucky. so books or groceries are out of the question for this basket.on mine after using it for a year or so, the the basket eventually gave way (metal mesh actually tore away) around the mount, probably due to metal fatigue, so once again i would NOT recommend this for serious hauling duty. for that i suspect you would be much better served by a basket that has struts going down to the front forks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my brand new bike!","review":"My cousin gave this to me three years ago, but before installing it my bike was stolen. Fast forward three years and I eagerly install this basket on my brand new Bianchi Cortina. With nothing other than my six pound purse inside, the basket sagged disappointingly. When I arrived at my destination (a 3-mile ride to the dentist) I noticed that the sagging basket had ground a groove into the frame of my brand new bike. I am disgusted with this product, especially given the high price and Topeak's stellar reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"rovner ligatue","review":"ok so i am stuck on rovner ligatiure the only kind i will use they fit well hold the reed well and just are all around so much easier and better fit than a metal ligature the sound is very mellow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!","review":"This ligature is well worth the price I paid for it.

This tome is collection of writings from various advocates of the idea of smaller, more localized government.Topics ranged from the founding fathers ideas of secession to the discussion of modern day examples of secession found in the balkans and the baltic states as well as the proposed separation of Quebec from Canada. As this was written in the mid 1990s, some of the material is dated. Hans-Hermann Hoppe's prediction that the EU would not be sucessful in creating a unified currency has been proven wrong.Some of the material, especially the last essay \\"How to Secede in Business Without Really Leaving: Evidence of the Substitution of Arbitration for Litigation.\\" was dry and hard to understand.

The book is very up-to-date on the science, and explains many of the crucial aspects of Earth that climate scientists don't yet understand well.The book is also scary, because most of these things that we don't understand well mean we're underestimating the amount of change that global warming will reap."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Alright","review":"I thought this was going to be larger than it is, however, it's cute.

A remarkable accomplishment by Renee Fleming, who is ravashing and captivating in the role, perhaps like no other since Sills. Alvarez is a solid partner, with supporting roles all more than adequately handled. The Paris Opera orchestra is superb under Lopez-Cobos. The magnificent period costumes are all lovely, and wonderfully accented by a rather minimalistic, but effective, stage setting. Special kudos to both the stage and video director for bringing a special focus and clarity to key scenes. Technical aspects are all superb. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive Manon!","review":"Superbly sung and beautifully produced stage version of \\"Manon\\". Renee Fleming is in divine voice and looks ravishing in the various costumes. Her impeccable French phrasing is a joy to behold. Marcelo Alvarez is a wonderful singer.

The audience is clearly appreciative of what they witnessed that evening. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to impress musically and dramatically.","review":"I bought this DVD because my favorite recording of Manon (Angela Gheorghiu & Roberto Alagna) is available on CD only and I wanted to see the opera. All in all, I can't say I want to watch this production again - I should have rented instead of buying. I like Fleming in Mozart and Strauss, but her vocal portrayal of Manon was artificial, mannered, over-worked. It fell flat. It felt like she was trying to demonstrate to a student how to sing Manon instead of actually inhabit the character. It felt like \\"Oh look at me and see how great I am\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing singing in beautiful production","review":"This Manon looks beautiful and I enjoyed watching the great costumes and scenery, but I was very disappointed with the singers. Marcelo Alvarez has good high notes but this does not seem to be a good role for him. Renee Fleming sings beautifully in places, but her vocal mannerisms are very apparent, there are slurps, swooning, and very fussy delivery. Also, she does not look convincing as a young girl in the first act, and looks very frumpy in the Adieu aria. Her acting is servicable, she seems to be relying on her glamour instead, but I admit I was more impressed by her gowns than her performance. Hopefully there will be a new DVD of Manon, possibly with Vargas and one of the French sopranos like Dessay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation","review":"I was very dissappointed to hear this CD.

In the keeping of a \\"spy story\\", Ms. Marsh's Alleyn does not appear as himself. He appears in the story in a very clever disguise, and the reader will have the fun of figuring out who he is. It took me a little while. What Alleyn has come to the spa to investigate is the death of one of the people who had an interest in the spa. We meet some very unique characters in this book.

Highly recommendable in this age of educational crisis, where all efforts are being made to measure knowledge in the most possible exact away, and no effort at all to liberate knowledge from the criteria of measurement, which is in the first place the reason why students are coming out of schools less and less knowledgable.And it has to be read in German, not only because it is impossible to translate a term such as \\"Weltbild\\", for example, but also because the very English language is today, more than any other language, irremediably compromised by technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are leather","review":"The shoe might be a very good shoe, but if you are looking for something non-leather, this shoe is not that.

Mr. Crumey likes to take part in conversations with the reader and interject the story with parenthises stating previous events or his own opinion.

But when I was growing up we did not have Lord of the Rings, the Redwall series, Narnia (well, it was there, I just hadn't discovered it), or the many other well-developed fantasy worlds both in print and the visual media of today. So a worldly pre-teen might now find Steel Magic to be a little simple in comparison to the plethora of other fantasy stories now available.That is not to detract from Norton's fine storytelling ability.

Contrary to another reviewer's experience, I found the Four Paws brand frustratingly under-absorbent; they also had too many defects, with the padding unevenly distributed and occasionally absent in some areas. For a while I thought I'd found a solution with the Advance pads - more expensive but more absorbent - and then the manufacturer \\"improved\\" them and my floors were soaked. Forget about any of the cheapo brands; they're like using cut-rate paper towels instead of Bounty. Gridlocks are by far the best product out there - much more absorbent than even Advance at its best.

There's a lot of 1997 songs on here on a l999 album and some 98 stuff. I like Torn by Natalie Imbruglia--they played that like crazy in 98 and its popular with the guys.

Also they have opera (?) music with Andrea Bocelli. I think that it is great that he a nomination, same with the Dixie Chicks. But country and opera aren't the kind of music that deserve a place on a compact disc that ages 10-15 are the majority of people that buy it. I'd say pop, rock, alternative, and rap are the main choices in music that pre-teens choose. If you like Opera, country, pop, and soft rock, this is the album for you.

Well her voice is there but the music is not. Fairy Tales is probably my favorite song (runs abut 9 mins) and its all the (Top-Notch live) instrumentals put with her beautiful voice.

On many of the tracks, she seems a bit trapped in a time warp, not daring to do anything differently.The album gets off to a great start with the title cut but seems to stall with tracks 2-4, only catching fire with \\"How Does It Feel\\" (cut five). If all of the songs were of the level of \\"Like You Used To,\\" her duet with Babyface, \\"Close Your Eyes\\", and \\"I Can't Sleep,\\" then this would truly be five-star release.Unfortunately, it warrants four stars, solely because it's Anita and she deserves no less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated material","review":"What a let down this album is. It took 10 years for another great singer to release a new album. An album filled with painfully dated material. Anita does what she does best with her heavy but sultry singing. But the problem here is that she has been stuck in a time capsule since 1994. It's as almost as if nothing has inspired her over the past decade to try something different or experimental for the 21st century. Not that she's required to do so. But sometimes, the best quality of an artist is his or her ability to grow and change into different aspects of thier sound and style. Here, Anita just doesn't do this.Honestly, if you want to hear this new album from Anita, your better off saving your money and just rotate what you already have in your Anita collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much love!!!","review":"I am so sorry for those who said this is outdated.

I must admit I was a little bummed when I saw it was only nine songs (and one reprise), but whatever, she can sing rings around any of today's R&B princesses. However...the album gets a little...dare I say...boring at times. Anita should jazz it up a little more, or perhaps try more standards, because this album, although a fine album, is definately stuck in the \\"middle of the road.\\" But then again, maybe it's what her fans want.

I think I managed about 75-100 pages before tossing this book in with the rest of the books I was marking to sell at a yard sale. One word surmises \\"Voices Of Hope\\", and that is: Incomprehensible. Most of the story is written in Trannie speak (Transient), which is a cross of jive, street talk, and harsh ebonics. Aside from reading paragraph after paragraph over and over again to figure out what a characters were saying, I could gather little from the plot for the exception that the book delved into the world of Nicholas Seafort, and his dealings with his runaway 12 yr old son.

The motivation behind the basic premise of the main character was unbelieveable - and this made most of the subsequent actions silly.Unfortunately, it was also boring, as something like three quarters of the book was an introduction to the last quarter, which amounted to little more than a city riot.I also find books which hope for authenticity by imbuing their characters with EXTREMELY badly accented speeches very hard to read.Sorry, but the other books in this series must be better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feintuch's Voices ...","review":"The book is written in the first person with a number different narrators. All these storytellers are supposed to be children (or young teens) but none of their voices is even remotely convincing. Feintuch spends much of this narrative outlining (sometimes using what I see as racist patois) how whiny, unreasonable, and downright stupid the characters are. Example: \\"My voice what Changman call sullen .... My voice come in squeak. I bring it low, Redface.\\" (p. 22) The story, compelling as some elements of it may be, cannot overcome Feintuch's sophomoric writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of the Seafort books","review":"Voices of Hope is quite different from the other books in the Seafort series. It is told from several points of view, including that of Nick's son Philip, Adam Tenere's son Jared, and two members of the transpop culture represented in earlier books by Eddie and Annie. While the differing narratives are occasionally interesting, I found none of them as compelling as Nicholas Seafort's narratives in the other novels. Furthermore, the transpop chapters are written in a dialect I found almost unreadable. There is more violence in this book than in the others, and the transpop setting of most of the novel is bleak and disturbing. This story is gloomy even for a Seafort novel! I don't recommend it. You can skip it and go on to the next book without confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in the Seafort series","review":"Voices takes a very different sort of look at Nick Seafort's world and is a much more real and powerful book than the rest of the saga. Warning though, this book is not a big gaudy space opera, like the others. Nothing against space opera, but serious speculative fiction has its place too, and this is definately serious speculative fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A taste of reality mixed in with science fiction.","review":"A commentary on the current view of politics by the common man mixed into a science fiction storyline.

I felt that a \\"High Performance\\" programming book might be able to help me out, so I opted for this book. While some of the suggestions are helpful, I don't find most of them to be all that special. The basic concept of the book is, \\"use Explain Plan\\" (ie tune your code) and \\"Use indexes when you can\\" - Oooh ! That's insightful!Much of the book is wasted space with the author showing the various permutations of his explain plan output. Four sentences of programming suggestions, followed by two pages of output, doesn't make for particularly interesting reading in my world.Granted, the book gives you more, and in better layout than most Oracle texts out there, but I guess I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick if you like the D.E","review":"This is a 2 disk album.

First of all, they get dirty very quickly, just from being handled (and from your ear canal, no matter now clean it is). I had read somewhere that you can wash them, so I did, but that washed off the coating which gives them shape memory (allows them to stay squeezed when you're inserting them in your ear and expand afterwards). After the washing they'd just expand right after being squeezed, like regular foam does, and hence it was impossible to insert them into my ears anymore. Even if you don't wash them and put up with the dirty look, that coating wears off after a couple of weeks just from handling, which pretty much kills the ear bud.Avoid the frustration and get triple flange sleeves instead. Nothing of the sort can happen to those, plus, you can wash them as much as you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% puertorriqueno papa","review":"Oh oh vico is back con un ritmo sabroso 100% carribeno nene.

She promises him land in the human world if he will get her back to where she belongs.This is a great book with elements of time travel, faerie magic, and sensual romance. I highly enjoyed the journey with the two main characters, and the growing romance between them.

Many times my reaction to the decisions the hero and heroine made was, \\"No one could be that stupid.\\" I love a well-written romance with characters that don't manufacture their own angst from vapor. Unfortunately, by the time I made it through these 300 pages, I was bored. Turning my boredom into pseudo-horror was the final battle, purportedly between good and evil. It struck me that the author had no idea how to visualize, write about (and possibly believe in) a battle sequence. Barney was there in spirit if not his big purple self.

I was working on a master's degree in English in Detroit and had just met the man that I would marry. Sigh! How I wish that I had listened more carefully to Atwood. I would have run from that! The Edible Woman is broadly humorous -- the heroine works for Seymour Surveys -- and very much a girls night out. Funny, perhaps slightly dated, it is a warning to listen to your inner voice. I seldom read more than one or two books by an author. The next book from Atwood's pen that I read, Surfacing, turned me off to her for many years. However, during that time, her reputation as a writer grew. When I finally picked her up again, I was glad I did. Atwood has grown into one of the major voices in 20th century literature and will, most likely, continue to be heard into the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"A published Ally McBeal episode.","review":"I normally love Margaret Atwood's writing, but this novel really lacked something. Maybe I need to be hit over the head with a message, because I breezed through The Edible Woman without getting any of the deep meaning that I hear about from other readers.

Atwood should have collaborated on this one with Judith Butler for a harder edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I've enjoyed most of Margaret Atwood's books but I must say that this book was awful.

It is very focused on gender and I wonder if I wouldn't have enjoyed it more were I a woman. Though frankly, none of the woman I know are this husband obsessed or shallow. At the end of the book I was reading the talking points for students and was shocked to find that aspects of the book are considered a dark comedy. Not once did I ever think, \\"How clever\\" or \\"How morbidly funny\\". The metaphors were very heavy-handed and obvious. You never wonder what is going on, it's there in print in front of you. The only thing that isn't clear are the main character's motivation for making herself miserable. We all know (herself included) that there are very few external forces working upon her. Her misery is entirely of her own volition, yet she seems helpless to change her circumstances.I liken the book to a dull version of The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

This sorry excuse for a Greatest Hits 2 is the very reason companies such as Napster came into existence, so that listeners could download songs and make their own Greatest Hits CDs because the greedy artists wouldn't do it themselves.

And I'm babbling, but that's OK, because I purchased \\"Bob's Best Vol. I\\" for all those songs that had, indeed, ignited the fire down below.

I think natural humidity has something to do with this. Honeywell engineers have put no thought into how to provide for wiping clean these surfaces clean without trying to pry the main covering open, which they seem to have deliberately made impossible, without breaking it of course. Even blowing air through it with air pressure tool or air canister cannot get rid of the buildup after just a year of use. So this air purifier comes with it's own demise built in; too many uncleanable surfaces that make this a dust collector as opposed to an air purifier.

When it is time to clean the filter, a light comes on that reminds me to clean it and I simply wash the filter in the kitchen sink with some dishwashing detergent. When I see how dirty the water is from cleaning the filter, it makes me glad that the dirt was captured in the filter and not still circulating in the air in my house.

They were to be a remembrance of a pair of salt and paper shakers that their late mother had. We were horrified to open the box and find salt and pepper shakers that I wouldn't even purchase at a dollar store. For a dollar. The glaze was slopped onto the pieces, and there was a chip on one of the pieces. I would be humiliated to place these on our Christmas table. Horror has turned to heartbreak.

Her mother has wanted for her to be a model her whole life. Deenie would have gotten a lot of jobs if it weren't for her horrible posture. Then Deenie finds out that she has scoliosis.

Judy Blume seems to be able to write and give advise at the same time without being over-bearing or sounding like a parent or a teacher. Go out and buy this book!!! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit off from the real feelings, but well written","review":"I have a brace...and yes, it is damn hard SOMETIMES, and even thought I dont have much difficulty with it, it helps to know you can turn to a book like this to read about someone who is going through similar problems.

I had a couple of friends with scoliosis. Until recently, back braces were with metal strips and collars.

I have to admit that I was a little shocked at the inclusion of the topic of masturbation. I personally feel that it could have been left out of this story.This book could be used to help other girls that have been diagnosed with scoliosis. It is explained in a way that brought it to reality. The person diagnosed as well as their friends could understand all aspects of what was happening or going to happen. The expression of feelings was real and vivid. Young teenage girls have to face so many changes in their life at that stage, that adding to it with scoliosis only makes it worse.

My best friend just developed it this year and she has to wear a brace. I used to always tell her how bad I felt for her, and stuff like that. This book showed me that even though it may be hard, you can still be yourself and have fun with you life. This book is about a girl named Deenie who has developed scoliosis. She is beautiful, and her mother is shocked at the news. Her mother wants her to become a model. Deenie, on top of this, has to deal with siblings, school, and the fights of her parents.

In 6th grade, I found out I had scoliosis, and it was so bad that I needed surgery to fix it. When I went to my orthopaedic doctor for the first time before my surgery, he recommended this book to me. I told him I'd already read it. Back braces have improved since then, but that's not the point. This book is about a girl in 7th grade who finds out she has scoliosis and has to wear a back brace.

When she went to see the doctor, he told her that she had scoliosis, and her mother didn't want to accept that her daughter had that problem. She did it worse to Dennie. What I liked about this book it's that eventhou Dennie had to wear a brace, she didn't lose what she wanted, her boyfriend.

But not at the right timeing of course, right when Bud and her where becoming more than friends.I found this a awesome book,but it should not be read by anyone under 12yrs.old.It's good for girls 12 to 14 because some of the desions and actions between the boys and the girls are a little intence. I did not agree with everything in this book because it was not always realistic and if it is it should not be incouraged.

At first, I was very upset about it, and among other things my mom gave me the book Deenie. After reading it, I was even more upset. Scoliosis wasn't a big part of my life at all. All of my friends knew, and didn't care. My brace was completely covered and undetected under my clothes. But after reading this book, for the first time I felt different. For the first time, I felt like I was different and had a handicap, and I didn't want other people to veiw me that way. I still play sports, go to parties and hang out with my friends. Now I only have to wear the brace at night, but even when I first got my brace my parents allowed many acceptions when I didn't have to wear it. I found this book unrealistic and offensive, and it generally made me feel bad about myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little old fashioned...","review":"...so if you thought that what's written in the book is what that scoliosis girls have to go throught now- luckily, you're wrong.This book is nice, but I didn't really like it. First, Deenie is overreacting to her Brace (To cut off all your hair? pliz...). Second, none of the characters looks realistic- I found them mostly annoying.

Ms. Blume should have done her research and gotten the facts correct befor wrining this. Consulting with a *real* doctor would have been a good idea.Also, too much about sex.

Goddard is, for me, one of the premier Shakespeare critics -- up there with Johnson, Coleridge, Bradley, and Frye. I much prefer his work to that of the two popularist contemporary critics, Bloom and Garber. Goddard lacks, thankfully, the self-aggrandizement of Bloom and Garber; his criticism is insightful and brilliant while remaining extremely accessible and enjoyable to read.The two volumes of The Meaning of Shakespeare should be on the reading table (don't let them linger on the shelves) of every reader who respects and wants to enjoy Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally enjoyable criticism","review":"Wow, thought I was the only adult fan of Shakespeare who watches the plays and then runs home to read what insights Goddard has into 'em -- guess not, from these reviews.Each chapter -- essay -- is like an evening by the fireside with a scholarly, opinionated friend interested in exploring ideas rather than summarizing a plot or proving his erudition.Special applause to Goddard's essay (Vol.1) on Henry V: his quite negative take on Henry's character -- for which, as he points out, all the evidence is right there in the text -- made the play much more subtle and so more interesting for me.Volume one (brown cover) has many of the histories and tragedies; Volume two (blue cover) has everything else. I recommend them both, but if you're looking just for Goddard's essay on one particular play, choose the \\"look inside the book\\" option for viewing the cover -- it lists the plays covered inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"No return","review":"I though I was purchasing 6061 Aluminum tubing with a finish for a bimini top.

The Rovner is a revelation. It can be set two different ways. The bright tone is very usable, while the dark tone is quite haunting. My horn was transformed from marginal to compelling.

And Bohm conducts heavily and mechanically. The tenor is out of step during most of the Sextet, which is accordingly ruined.I am still searching for an adequate videotaped FIGARO.

I agree that the singing from the men was somewhat lackluster, however the music generally makes up for this. The choreography in this piece ruined it for me. The dance had virtually nothing to do with either the music or the story, at several points the dancers mimed masturbation (those French are just so sophisticated! sarcasm off.) The documentary that accompanies the piece is somewhat good, however after talking alot about good v. evil in the opera they fail to come to any meaningful conclusions about the work. Add the obligatory swipe at the Americans, and you get a typical French exercise in arrogance and ignorance. I would not recommend this to anyone who is not a hardcore baroque opera fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info regarding vitamins and many physical ailments","review":"This book really covers each vitamin & mineral in detail.

It is easy to read and makes a great reference book along with other books. This book is well researched and can be shared with your health care professional.I use this in conjunction with 8 Weeks to Optimal Health, Dr Whitaker's Guide to Natural Healing (see my review), Healing Herbs (see my Review) Earl Mandrell's Vitamin Bible for maintaining good health.This has been a real help in understanding Vitamins and minerals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor's Guide to Vitamins","review":"I first bought this book for my Mom who found it to be an excellent, easy to read, easy to find source for information on various vitamins & minerals.

Reading his materials has also made me realize that my grandmother really did know the truth of food (We thought she was just too fanatical all these years....but I guess I should have listened more to the woman in my life who was healed from cancer through the application of eating healthy).

I have a Giro helmet that I wear when I bike ride and I find this brand to be very durable and comfortable. I feel confident that my son's head (and mine) is protected in this helmet.

Flood hazard due to o-rings","review":"I bought a single-handle valve and ended up using two $8 American Valve quarter-turn valves. Why?The Watts Duo-Clozure and similar \\"single handle\\" valves seems like a good idea but are very risky. Why? O-rings. The Watts installation requires 4 O-rings. The repair kit has seven (7) o-rings and 4 Teflon disks. All of these o-rings are cheap neoprene, not even silicone.So basically you have something like 11 o-rings between high pressure water and your house. How long until one blows out? It is scary to think about. Other brands may have less o-rings, but all single-handle valves have some.Quarter-turn valves, even though made in China of course, are a well-proven and simple technology. They have very heavy bushings that are not going to just blow out suddenly and flood your house.It only takes about 3 seconds more to turn off two valves. So consider buying a less than $30 Oatey or similar kit rather than the single handle valves."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small sink","review":"very small no dimensions available when ordering. felt decieved, was not what i expected in regards to size would not purchase again"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Bloody Months","review":"(This reviewer was with the Marines in Korea from September 1952 till August 1953) The two volumes by Lee Ballenger are absolute fact.Lee Ballenger has written a follow up book (Volume II 1953) to his wonderful historical account of the the US Marines in Korea (Volume I 1952).

There is no real know how or instructions on how to get things done but just some general verbage on what should be done. Not that it's bad but I think if you have had one or two relationships already then this book is not the one for you. There are several other books on becoming a good lover and partner that far outshine this one.

These guys are Radiohead with cojones. Nothing against Radiohead (I love them), but THIS album is so chock-full of power chords, killer riffs and bone-crunching crescendoes that it's almost unfair. The first four songs are about as good as rock n' roll gets.How these guys continue on in their relative cult status is the biggest mystery in popular music. If you're looking for the best band on the planet, look no further....it's Built To Spill. An essential for your collection. Go up to that \\"Buy\\" button on your screen and click on it.

Yeah, it's the thinking man's Nirvana... yes it's the Radiohead knock-off that will actually get you laid... but more than that (if there is more than that ever)... it's just good music and you find yourself veering off the road saying \\"Damn, this is a good disc!\\".

This really is a fantastic album, I don't know about the REM references either (maybe vocally...) - seems closer to OK Computer for guitar sonically (off the cuff and frantic), sans samples and other weirdness - I guess I pay attention to guitar... but overall, a beautifully produced and masterfully artistic effort. ...and guess what...

This is an album that you should just crank up on the CD player and go for a drive. After I bought this CD I drove around for almost 2 hours listening to it. Its that good.

Again, the album ranks right up their with their best material, and it's importance cannot be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This CD reminds me a lot of Radiohead CDs--at first, you catch a couple of good songs on the CD, but the more and more you listen to the CD, the more you realize that every single song is a work of art.

It's not better or worse than Perfect... but different in a good way. I think people who see it as an experiment on what a power trio can do are right.

Doug Martsch is the John Lennon of the 90's, this album is a must-have. All hail the kings of modern day rock!!!Style seems to combine the upbeat pop sounds of \\"There's Nothing Wrong with Love\\" with the dreamy soaring trance inducing sounds of PFNO. Songs seem to get to the point faster than on PFNO (i.e. no 3 minute intros, etc..) and get out in less than 5 minutes, leaving the listener with jawbone agape.I cannot get these riffs out of my head.

At first it disappointed me. It is not \\"Perfect From Now On,\\" and my disappointment grew from that. I expected a band to follow one work of absolute genius and beatuy with another. If you know Built to Spill I would say this album is comparable to \\"There's Nothing Wrong With Love.\\" The band has demanded less from itself. Many of the songs are catchy, but not in a way that they haven't been before, such as in previous songs like \\"Big Dipper.\\" This is far from a sell-out album, but it is more clever than ingenious. That being said, it is very very clever, and it is only because this is a Built To Spill Album that it merits any criticism. If any other band hand put this out I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"This book offers wonderful stories that can relate to everyday things. Each story includes a verse from the Bible and a short poem or enchanting quote. If you're looking for daily inspiration--try it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting companion book.","review":"I loved a lot of things about this book. For instance, I really loved that the author took the time to both sides of the issues with compelling arguments from people in the know. It was fantastic to learn things about Mary Magdalene - especially that she really most likely wasn't the prostitute the Vatican wanted us to believe for so long.I gave it four stars because of my one complaint: Burstein spent a lot of time and energy on Mary Magdalene and the sacred feminine but not enough, in my opinion, on the Gnostic Gospels. I would have like more information about that.But it is still worth buying and reading. THere is a lot of great information supporting and otherwise on these controversial topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions answered, questions asked","review":"I loved the Da Vinci Code, but I've been very skeptical of the books that have come out since, mainly because I thought most were trying to capitalize on the success of the novel. I got Secrets of the Code through BzzAgent.com and started it over the weekend, just planning to browse through sections that intrigued me, but since I started it, I can't stop thinking about it. Just like the Da Vinci Code, Secrets of the Code has me thinking about it when I'm not reading it. It delves deeper into a lot of the theories proposed by Dan Brown, but it also poses other questions and theories. Some it can make your head spin at times but if you were intrigued by the Da Vinci Code I think you'll enjoy Secrets of the Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Companion to a Great Book!","review":"I found this to be a wonderful companion book to The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. It was fascinating to have it nearby as I reread Brown's book & used it as a cross-reference. The writing was clear, concise & to the point. I think that my only complaint would be that the reference material in the book can be a little dry for some. All in all a good read. 4 out of 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow read","review":"It became very hard to read this book the further I got into it. Jumping from one argument to another; different writer to writer...Very disruptive to the flow of the book. It may be a good reference book but not a book to read cover to cover easily. I dont like not finishing books, so I kept reading anyway. The whole idea of nit-picking everything in the DaVinci code is dumb anyway. It is Fiction!! The end of the book was a discussion about every comment in the book where the character Sophie or Langdon couldnt have traveled the direction they did because the city isnt laid out in that way. Who cares???? I did give up at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent if you have an interested open mind","review":"As others have said, this book is not for anyone encumbered with religious blinkers. Neither will it answer the big question of exactly how much of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is truth and how much is fiction - though you will be able to classify quite a lot of it.What it will do is clarify what is known, what is speculative and what is unknown. And it will give you a head start into a lot of history which is fascinating and was never taught in any religious classes I attended. Had it been, I would likely have been and remained a lot more interested.So if you know it all and just want your knowledge confirmed, avoid this book. It will just upset you and maybe even confuse you with doubt.But if you want to hear informed and sometimes conflicting views and arguments and learn a lot of most interesting facts about the foundations of western culture and thought, this is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME ON!","review":"The Da Vinci Code is a NOVEL, a work of FICTION! What's the point of pointing out \\"mistakes\\".... There are no mistakes since the author wrote a book of fiction! It's a bit ridiculous, really, how people are offended by a work of fiction. If you don;t like it, don't read it! The Da Vinci Code was entertaining. I loved it but I didn't recheck all my personal beliefs after reading it! This is a bit like the Blair Witch Project.

Perfect for bedtime, good luck only reading one story though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in some ways","review":"Although we have a history of liking Boynton books, this was not very interesting for my child, age 2.5. This book has seven bedtime stories set up on two pages each. Each page spread is one story, somewhere between 16 and 20 lines of text. That's it, not much of a story. The rhymes are cute, but in two of the stories the rhyme seems very forced. The pictures, as always, are great. But the \\"stories\\" are more like nursery rhymes, an alternative to Mother Goose.What do we like about it? The tab system that lets my child count as we go through the book. She also recognized a couple of characters from the Going to Bed Book, which I think is a better bedtime Boynton book, in the pajamas page.I think if you've been reading more substantial story books, like Seuss or Sendak, or other classics, this is probably too elementary, unless you are still doing short books at night. Based on the reviews, I thought this was a sure hit; but I didn't realize what the actual content would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snoozers is a winner","review":"This is the perfect go to bed quick with a story book I have found.

The \\"Snoozers\\" and \\"Silly Lullaby\\" are both in the book/CD \\"Philadelphia Chickens,\\" which is the only reason I give this a 4 -- while it's fun to know the tunes that go to those stories, it would have been better to give those two songs more illustrations in their own books.

This book is a little too long to read to your \\"lively little kid\\" in one sitting, but you can ask your child which color he/she wants to choose and then just read the story that corresponds to the color chosen. For the last story, \\"Silly Lullaby,\\" you need to be able to read music, have a keyboard handy, or have a lively imagination. In my humble opinion, the very best story of the lot is \\"Pajamas.\\" Your child will have it memorized in no time. The last line is: \\"You've GOT to have buttons if you're a moose.\\" Think about it.

Since Urge Overkill left the scene (and until the next Foo Fighters is released) rock records that aren't strapped in by genre defining labels (heavy metal, speed metal, alternative, etc.) are hard to find.

I only upgraded to Studio because the product was compatible with windows Vista, however, Microsoft's movie maker software is even better - how pathetic.Don't waste your money, now I have to spend another $80 to upgrade to the plus version of this software to get any usability out of it.

Some of the examples are general enough to lead me to the correct man page, but not enough.The book's organization and style of writing is surprisingly horrible. Just about every \\"tip\\" has the phrase \\"as you learned\\" and refers to another tip. Removing all the yous, yours, \\"as you have learned\\"s, and \\"In tip #, you learned that\\"s would probably cut the book length by a quarter. Reorganization of the tips into a more coherent order would help, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to jog the memory","review":"This book is not designed to teach you the language and I think the examples (errors and all) are more to give you a visual of the text then to be used and compiled.

I think that the author tried to cover too much info in 1 book, squeezing C , C++ and C++ for Windows, making it about 15 lbs, 2 inches wider and taller then your average book. It also seemed very un-organized, and would make a awful book for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference material in style and depth.","review":"By splitting the book up into short catagorized sections instead of chapters, and by using those section numbers instead of page numbers in the index, this book is very easy to use as a quick reference.

Half the examples I tried both from the book and the CD would not compile. It is worthless as a tutorial, and almost so as a reference. I thought it was a rather cruel joke to put a compilor onto the CD which would not compile independant executables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely useful for DOS compilers","review":"The book is really useful if you have not a really deep knowledge of the C/C++ programming language, and only if you are programming under DOS. The index is exhaustive, so that you can find the correct answer to almost any easy programming question, as well as the name of the function you were looking for. Unfortunately, some of the arguments have not been considered, and the Windows section is obsolete respect to the current compilers available today. The reference language is Borland 3.x for DOS (you can find a simplified version of it in the CD), but any information about Borland graphic instructions has not been considered. Why do the author use such a demanding title for such a book (a \\"Bible\\")? If he was not so pretentious, I should rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized with poor examples","review":"This book has got to be the worst book I've EVER read.

The film \\"Beast Master\\" is very obviously based on these books, though migrated to a fantasy setting. I never saw them credited anywhere though. The film is an enjoyable romp, nice humorous touches without going over the top. The hero looks very good though he is awful with a sword. Worst moment: practicing sword on mountain.

Unfortunately, the hero ends up in an enclave of post-plague survivors and then the thing becomes a not terribly interesting game of cat and mouse as he learns about who killed his father and finds out about the city's strange political games. People keep telling him to assassinate anyone. He's either in danger or he's not.By the end, there's not much sense at all in the book and the characters aren't nearly interesting enough to make the journey with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Surprise!","review":"I bought \\"Music for the Morning After\\" on a whim today. I'd never heard of Pete Yorn, but liking his look, his name and the fact that there was only one copy shoved in the back of the \\"Y\\" section, I decided to dive in. With great difficulty, I tore off the shrinkwrap in the car. Hands trembling and sweat beading up on my forehead, I shrunk back in my seat, hoping I wouldn't regret my decision. Sweet surprise! I knew immediately I'd found a gem. This is an \\"every cut is good\\" CD. Pure and unpretentious, this music is mellow with jagged edges. It's soft but begs to be played loud. And often. It's clever, but not burdensome. I want to jump into my vintage drop top and drive into the sunset with Pete Yorn playing and the wind blowing through my hair. And I don't even have a drop top! Calling all intelligent and discerning listeners! Add this to your collection. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious gem","review":"I really hesitate to not give this album five stars as the way that I came upon it is evidence of its highly addictive qualities. \\"EZ\\" was on a trailer tape of music where I worked, and I just couldn't get the song out of my head (maybe it was the 9 hr shifts, who knows), and quickly bought this album, expecting the same pensive Nick Drakesque qualities I had heard in this first song. Not so. After purchasing the album I was suprised by the diversity of it, especially for a debut. But it definately works in Pete Yorns favor. Ie: \\"Life on a Chain\\" has everything a classic rock song should-good road trip listening, while \\"Just another girl\\" is more laid back and haunting-you really will want to lie wide awake in a garden. There are a few disappointing tracks towards the end of the album, but still well worth your ten bucks. I dare say this album will be the only occupent of your CD player for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i thought it was reall mellow and could listen and chill to this cd all night long.

Pete Yorn is that type of artist. He's soulful, raw, and real. His voice is hauntingly passionate and timeless. The melodies and lyrics are touching, yet simple. I'm extremely eager to see what the Pete Yorn has in store for us in years to come, for I predict he is here to stay for quite some time. This album is classic and I will be listening to it for years to come, I'm sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"counterintuitive","review":"You go to the record store. You see a fancy display case. On it, big-label CDs from a guy whose brother is some Hollywood big-shot agent. It's almost like Tori Spelling put out a disc. It just screams \\"useless album\\". Right?Wrong. If you have any inclination to like Britpop, or singer-songwriters, or indie -- man, this guy has the goods. Introspective, dark, personal, painful, EXTREMELY catchy songs. I was so shocked that I had to check the sleeve to see if I had put in the wrong disc. Pete Yorn has upset my musical belief system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and gritty , full of Character.","review":"I picked up this CD on my way home from work after hearing Pete Yorn on Organic X in Atlanta. His music is sort of dreamy but not ice-cream sweet. His lyrics range from catchy, poppy to quirky and full of character. Overall once you get \\"life on a chain\\" out of your head the rest of the album is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best debuts around","review":"I was surprised by this debut cd by Pete Yorn. The words are vivd and real along side some beautiful music. It's a must have in your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"how dare you?","review":"actually, i'm a little hesitant to write the following review. pete yorn's \\"musicforthemorningafter\\" is like my little secret. none of my friends know about him, and i hope to keep it that way. if pete ever does reach john (mayer)'s height of fame as of now, then kick [butt]. but i'm kind of hoping that he doesn't. pete's the underground secret! anyways yeah, the review. it's a phenomenal album debut that's raw and real and artistic and beautiful and painfully goregous. 'lose you' and 'murray' are personal favorites, but you decide. sorry, it's hard to think when your 14 year-old sister is blasting britney spears out of her room. let's put it this way: don't buy britney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"I enjoyed this CD very much. It was amazing to me ho e used is lyrics to build the music rather than using the music to build up the lyrics. I have been following Pete Yorn for a while due to the fact that I mysel am a music/songwriter and find his style to be very original. While listening to his music you feel what eer he is singing about and this CD is one of the few CD's you can actually listen to starting with track one all the way through. This CD is a definite buy and I can't wait for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the Morning After","review":"In terms of artistic sensibility, Pete Yorn's position on the map of contemporary rock can be triangulated somewhere between Jeff Buckley, the Wallflowers, and Paul Westerberg at his most Alex Chilton-esque. In terms of production technique, MFTMA, Yorn's first disc, owes at least as much to Liz Phair's EXILE IN GUYVILLE, on which Yorn's co-producer Brad Wood perfected along with Phair a decidedly lo-fi rock ambiance coupled with the almost poetic lyrical literacy of classic singer/songwriters. The first half of this album (tracks 1-6) is outstanding, especially LIFE IS A CHAIN, STRANGE CONDITION, and JUST ANOTHER. The second half is a little less rock and a little more pop, and not quite as focused and energized, but still more worthy of some rotation than most of what I've come across this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum Pop!","review":"Pete Yorn, I think I love you. (Where did THAT come from?!) This is a great effort from a young artist. I saw Pete live in LA earlier this year and he put on a great show. And could he be any cuter?! I think as he evolves and develops as an artist, we will see great things from him. This album is definitely worth adding to your collection - it is melodious and light, but also deep, intense and quirky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in the begining, and just as good all the way through.","review":"I first heard Pete live as an opening act and even as he had to fix his amp himself because he couldn't afford roadies I knew it was magic. Every song on this album tells a diffrent story in a beautiful voice and catches me in a diffrent way- there isn't a single one I don't like. \\"Caus it already is (For Nancy)\\" however has always been my favorite.If you like good rock and can appreciate something that plays on the softer side at times definately pick this and his other works up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yorn's New Americana","review":"Out of no where comes Mr. Yorn's roots pop. Bob Dylan, the Counting Crows, John Mellancamp, and the Eagles are heard in full effect. He takes accordions, acoustic and electric guitars, and a moody voice (that reminds me of the lead singer from Coldplay) and brews up a wonderful American musical concoction. There's solid riffs in \\"For Nancy\\" along with a sprinkling of a drum machine. \\"Murray\\" echoes classic Eagles with a great chorus. Yorn makes serious pop music that makes you feel what he felt in making it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music For The Radio Friendly","review":"I bought this album a few months ago. I liked the song on the radio. The 3 songs that will be released as singles are great, but the album is full of filler material. While I'll say that this record is a lot better than most of the stuff on the radio these days, there are a lot of Artists out there that are doing what Pete Yorn is doing, and they're doing it better.That aside, if you like this album try Duncan Sheik's \\"Humming,\\" and especially Joseph Arthur's \\"Come TO Where I'm From.\\" Mr. Arthur is in a different league than most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't stopped listening to it for a week!","review":"I was given this CD for my birthday last week and haven't gone a day without listening to it ever since. Every time I hear it I gain a new appreciation for Pete's music. Musicforthemorningafter will definitely be a permanent addition to my CD cartridge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good...","review":"This guy came out with a first round KO on his first try. Rarely have my expectations been more than exceeded by such a hyped album. I bought this CD three weeks ago and have listened to this CD at least twice a day in my car since then. This album is the type that becomes more addictive after repeated listenings. Kudos to Yorn's hooks, drum lines, and better than average lyrics. Each componenent is melded into a coherent enjoyable whole.Yorn may not be the the transcendentally brilliant artist that Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen are, but he's the best out there right now and pretty damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super...4.5 stars!!!!!!!","review":"Simply put just a great debut. One that IMHO Pete Yorn hasn't topped yet. Yorn is a very versatile singer/songwriter. He gets compared to Springsteen alot, although aside from the fact he's from Jersey and a great songwriter like the Boss, I don't really see any similarity. His voice at times sounds a little like Eddie Vedder. He can do the upbeat stuff like \\"Life on A Chain\\" and \\"Closet\\". Great slower tunes like \\"Just Another\\", \\"Lose You\\". And he can do flat out rockers like \\"For Nancy\\", and \\"Black\\" (my personal favorite). Not often that one artist can cover so many styles and not sound cheesy or out of place. Great stuff!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music For The Morning After","review":"Though I barely listen to this album anymore & havent since last summer, it's still pretty catchy & decent a disc. Could Yorn be the next Springsteen? Not with that Dylan voice at his age. He has great melodies but his lack of enunication (especially live) and the voice rides on me so I of course have to sing over him. It'll be interesting to see where his sophomore set takes him. He's definitely ballooned to be quite popular and it seems the fame may have gone to his head. And I'm a little bitter about having the disc for about 8 months for Columbia to only re-release the album with a bonus disc of extra live covers & videos. I mean, the songs are hella' catchy after about the 3rd listen. Most of the songs could be easy singles with the right label promotion. Fave tracks: \\"Murray,\\" \\"Just Another,\\" \\"Sleep Better.\\" (originally written May 2002)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic....","review":"I had walked past this CD a thousand times. I had read countless reviews saying how special it was, but for some reason I held back. One day on an impulse I bought it.Quite simply, this album is a gem. It is not one song which will make the world take notice - it is a collection of songs that when played together can capture a mood like very few albums can.Pete Yorn displays the adaptability to rock with tracks like \\"For Nancy\\" and then to reflect on tracks like \\"Just Another\\". But although these songs are known, the brilliant \\"EZ\\", \\"Strange Condition\\" and \\"On Your Side\\" are typical of the songs that gel this album together.Overall the album has a mellow tone, with Pete Yorn playing most the instruments himself on the album. Buy this album so you can play it on your next morning after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to mend a Broken Heart.","review":"I am a lover of all alternative music and I also love to take a chance on random artist. After seeing an ad in Rolling Stone magazine for Pete Yorn, I decided to pick it up and give it a listen. Never before have I been impact by an album so quickly than Pete Yorn's musicforthemorningafter. The opening track LIFE ON A CHAIN got me automatically hooked on this album, but I found that LIFE ON A CHAIN wasn't nearly close to the best song on the album. For all those guys who have loved a woman and have had to let her go, this album is for you. Songs like JUST ANOTHER, LOSE YOU, and EZ deal with love's lost and the pain that the male and female go through. At the same time, upbeat songs like MURRAY and CLOSET give off a deep unsettling feeling that there is more to these songs than one would think on first listen. musicforthemorningafter is an album that everyone can enjoy, because there is at least one song on this album that touches everyone on a personal level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Fresh Mainstream Alt. Country Sound","review":"I originally heard about Pete Yorn on KCRW's Morning Become Ecletic in Los Angeles, and I bought his CD the day it came out, and I'm glad I did. It is excelent all the way through. This is barely alt. country, as it has a very mainstream rock sound that comes along with it, but don't disregard it just because it might be \\"mainstream\\" sounding. His craft as singer/songwriter is superb; his music is interesting, fresh, and entertaining; in no way a xerox. If you like Old 97's, Wilco, or even David Gray, you'll likely get into his music. Check out the previews for the first two tracks especially. This album is solid all the way through, mellow rock in many parts, and a fresh reminder that people can always create anew with the guitar. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete Yorn Rocks!","review":"I bought the new Pete Yorn cd yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. I feel he will certainly take off and become a huge hit especially around here in Seattle. I love this cd and would definately give him the highest rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 out of 5 stars!!!","review":"Never heard of Pete until seeing him open for Semisonic at the Bowery Ballroom back in april 2001. Ever since that night - I've been \\"hooked\\"... his music is incredibly REAL - His CD - BRILLIANT!! I think his music is so incredible that I have been purchasing his CD's and have been handing them out to friends from all over.. as far as Bolivia and Africa. TO top it off, Pete is incredibly Down to earth! He had an instore appearance in New York City - I took an EXTRA long lunch and got a chance to meet him and have my CD signed... GREAT GUY!If you ever get a chance to see him perform, DO IT!!!!! He's even better live!!!YOu won't regret buying his CD!!!Vince"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the hype police","review":"God, what a mediocre album. I can't believe I fell for all the hype and actually shelled out money for this thing. There are a few catchy hooks scattered here and there about the album but that's it. But hey, I guess if my brother was a big man at AMG, I'd have a record contract too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"I can't believe all of the reviews! This album really bored the crap out of me. I think that there were 3 songs that sounded different from all the others. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the stuff isn't too bad. Pete Yorn just needs to difersefy the styles of songs a little. Don't buy this album, it's like paying 15 dollars for 3 songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pete Yaaawwwwnnnn....... Zzzzzzzzzz....","review":"Oh look how clever. He spelled the title of his album as if it were one word. And he has a powerful sibling in the music industry. Oh yeah... he's a pretty boy too. He's got everything needed, sans talent, to make the mainstream that much more lackluster. I really find it hard to believe this guy is getting so much acclaim. I showed some interest at first but was quickly turned off by the fact the he wrote a song for.. of all shows... \\"Dawson's Creek\\"?!? What's next? \\"Friends\\"? To compare this guy to Alex Chilton or Elliot Smith is laughable. This collection of songs is over-rated and over-produced and well... very less than average. Go buy a Big Star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"I have to write this, because I am literally shocked by the number or people supposedly taken in by this thoroughly mediocre singer/songwriter. The saccharine tones of the reviews so far lead me to believe that the people with discriminating taste in music have either not bothered to chime in, or hopefully, not heard the disc at all. First off, the people Yorn's been compared to above -- Elliot Smith, Alex Chilton, even Bruce Springsteen -- are leagues ahead of him. There is no passion whatsoever in the overly slick production of these atonal guitar ditties. Yet, if it weren't for the big money production, you'd have a tough time distinguishing this collection from untold thousands of one-dimensional open-mike sets from your average broken hearted kid at Coffeehouse USA. Thankfully, I didn't pay for this, but if you're into lame, lowest-common-denominator, corporate approved culture, you're welcome to buy my free promo copy for cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"In comparison...","review":"I just read - that Yorn has to learn from Dave Matthews or sweet little John Mayer? Even Jack Johnson? Please! Rather set him next to Neil Young, Ben Folds, Ryan Adams, Rhett Miller, Elliot Smith, Jacob Dylan, etc. This is probably one of the best albums I've ever heard; the whole of it is simple sometimes and harsh when it needs to be. One that never leaves the player and never feels the \\"skip song\\" button.Like it? Want to experiment with something different but the same? Try Mason Jennings and Erin McKeown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highlight From 2001","review":"'musicforthemorningafter'; the terrific debut by young singer-songwriter Pete Yorn shows that Bon Jovi adn Bruce Springsteen aren't the only good musciians to come out of New Jersey. This album would be my pick of the year behind Ryan Adams 'Gold' and Gillan Welch's 'Time (The Revelator)'.my favorite songs off of this release are: 'For Nancy ('cos it already is)'; 'Murray'; 'Life On A Chain'; and 'Black'. the record expresses a young singer/songwriter in his prime which is better than some songwriters that have been around awhile. than you misx that with infectious hooks and melodies; and it makes for a great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has classic potential","review":"This is a great CD.I picked it up without hearing a song, just based on the buzz about him.Then I realized I knew Life on a Chain.For some reason people are infatuated w/ the alt/country label.When I listen to this I hear Dinosaur Jr., Pavement, Sebadoh, The Beat Happening...Only one problem that gets to me.The drums.It sounds like he ripped the drum track off A-ha \\"Take on Me\\".Too much programming!!!I would love to hear what these songs could sound like with a real drummer or just without any drums at all.I think it will bog down the timelessness of this CD.Hopefully he'll be able to get live drums next record."},{"rating":"1","title":"His brother, people...","review":"I don't care much for this guy. This is overproduced, bland pop that sounded old in 1994. If you want the Lemonheads' sound, just go buy a Lemonheads CD - it's that simple. Don't waste your time with this thing.Basically I just want to add to what an earlier negative review had to say: The reason Pete Yorn is getting pushed so hard is because he's connected. His brother is one of the most powerful agents in Hollywood. Now there's nothing wrong with that. You can't fault either of them for being related! But I really feel like his show-biz connection is the only reason Yorn is getting such hype. It kills me to think that talented, original artists are being passed over due to plain old radio-friendly nepotism. This is a wholly unremarkable CD. Check out Jeff Buckley instead - real talent and real music recorded without the assistance of a PR juggernaut."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring","review":"After all the hype I heard about Pete Yorn, I thought this was definitely an album I needed to check out. It turns out that's all it was - hype. Life on a Chain and For Nancy are great, but the rest of the album is just more of the same and it becomes quite dull after about 4 songs. I expected so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"PETE YORN WOW!","review":"THE LYRICS PETE YORN ARE DEEP. THE BEATS ARE ARE AMAZING. THE WHOLE CD IS SO GOOD I DONT SKIP THREW IT BUT I LISTEN TO THE WHOLE CD. WOW PETE YORN IS A TALENTED ARTIST! BUY IT! THIS IS MONEY WELL SPENT! YES I COULD OF DOWNLOADED ALL HIS SONGS FOR FREE BUT I SOPPORT ARTIST LIKE PETE YORN, WHO MAKE SONGS WORTH LISTENING TOO, AND SPECAILY A CD WITH ALL THE SONGS I ENJOY LISTENING TOO OVER AND OVER AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop playing this record!","review":"I picked up this CD just based on the buzz, and didn't expect much... boy was I wrong. I can't stop listening to it. I've listened to it about 20 times now, and I'm not even close to getting bored. The music combines a wonderful lyricism, ala Dylan, with beautiful simple homespun melodies... and it's so beautifully recorded. It's like a bowl of chicken soup turned into music -- it tastes good, it's good for you and it makes you feel good all over. From beginning to end, this is a great CD... all tracks are great. Buy it. Run, don't walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than just for the morning after...","review":"What a great CD! Almost every song is absolutely fantastic, and Pete Yorn's major label debut is sure to become a classic in time. From the catchy \\"Life on a Chain\\" and \\"Strange Condition\\" at the start of the disc, to the closer, \\"Simonize\\", Pete Yorn's \\"musicforthemorningafter\\" takes simple music, adds great songwriting and fitting vocals to create the perfect musical concoction. Stand out tracks are \\"Life on a Chain\\", \\"Strange Condition\\", \\"Black\\", \\"For Nancy\\", \\"Murray\\", \\"Sense\\", \\"Closet\\", and \\"On Your Side\\", which makes up a significant chunk of the disc. That doesn't mean the rest of the album is made up of filler. It is anything but that. All of the songs are really fantastic. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Around CD","review":"I thought that this product has a lot of variety and that just a couple of the songs were very high quality. The songs with Phyllis Hyamn were a surprise! When did this Artist team up with Phyllis Hyman? I am taken away by the vocals with Phyllis Hyman. All in all, its a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Awesomly Refreshing\\"","review":"When it all finally came together I thought to myself, this is simply awesome. Its a cut above whats been playing on the radio for some time now. Its refreshing even. It has a little something for everyone. It has your love ballads, your hard hitting groove tunes, soothing instrumentals and sultry duets. I look forward to future projects from this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! ...and Yes, Looks Great in Widescreen Enhanced","review":"More of the same to chime in with the other reviews: I was really happy to see \\"Parents\\" in this release after seeing the original DVD had been discontinued, and then happier yet when I saw that others had reported that it's widescreen. Don't get nervous when you see the \\"full screen, 1.33\\" spec mistake, it's definitely widescreen enhanced and fills an HD set quite nicely.\\"Fear\\" is worth watching and good to have as a bonus, but \\"Parents\\" is a must-see / must-have movie. The surreal 1950's suburbia, the meals, the suspense, the great ending ---it's simply wonderful, and will leave you feeling good inside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad and didhonest seller in Amazon","review":"DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER.

Outside the U. S. we all do admire Dos Passos and do know his biggest novels, U. S. A., Manhattan Transfer, Three Soldiers and even the One man's initiation you seem to hate so much.

He is very good; there are at least two nice cuts on this one. Like the title says this album is relaxing with its eclectic sounds. There is a sound reminiscent of Brian Culberson on the Saturday Night cut. The It's all good cut is Cantaloupe like; this is not to say he isn't original; quite the contrary, Mr. Simpson has it together, I thoroughly enjoy this album. It is the kind of CD you can put on after a hard day and let yourself sail away musically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel-good music","review":"One reviewer wrote \\"makes me smile\\". Pretty corny comment but I have to agree! This is truly \\"feel-good music\\".

There are a couple songs I think she did well (Stay and Makin Woopie), but overall I don't think most of these songs were a good match with her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Cindy Lauper has a great voice, full of emotion. However, the production of the CD leaves a lot to be desired. It's ok if she wanted to go for a live sound with few instruments but the thing is that on some songs you can hardly hear any instruments at all -almost a capella. And some of her belting, long notes can get to be a bit much.... I love her but she could have used a better producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs for the somnolent or suicidal","review":"I came across this album while searching for other renditions of Stevie Wonder's \\"Until You Come Back to Me.\\" That song is one of the highlights of this album, and it's a joy to hear Stevie on harmonica.Otherwise, I found the album pretty disappointing. I love standards and have always had a mild regard for Lauper, coming of age as I did in her \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" heyday. She has chops, but she's no Aretha Franklin or Dinah Washington. And did the orchestra just not show up for the recording session on some of these tracks? Too many are under-orchestrated and downbeat or cutesy without being passionate. Unless you're a hardcore fan or really depressed and looking for some mood music, this may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment","review":"I love Cyndi, and have enjoyed all that she's done. But this disc is simply dull. She does get to show off her voice, and when in tune she sounds wonderful. But this is candlelight and wine music for people on downers. This might be the long sought after cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, amateurish, embarrasing","review":"I wanted to like it. Really I did. From the opening track it is apparent that the wrong person was making the decisions about the arrangements on this CD. Everything is wrong. Instead of showcasing her strengths, this effort highlights Cindy's weaknesses. Her voice sounds strained, forced, weak and insincere. It is at times, laughable. I am a fan of Cindy's, of music, of jazz, of standards, and this CD is a truly disappointing and poor representation of all. For comparison, try Boz Scagg's 'But Beautiful'. He puts this dog to shame. Bad bad bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"mannered","review":"I love Cyndi but don't like this CD at all. It's very mannered. The first two songs seem arranged to demonstrate how long Cyndi can hold a note, as if she's a contestant on American Idol (at least she does not overuse vibratto), at the expense of the music. The salsa version of \\"Stay\\" is arranged in a stop-and-start manner that lacks swing or drive, never cuts loose. I don't get a sense from this album for Cyndi as a maturing artist with an original voice. It's ... it's pretentious and boring... so unlike Cyndi. I don't think I can even finish the whole CD. Yes, I did listen to La Vie en Rose (Ordinaire) and Unchained (Sustained Note) Melody... Do I have to hear more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last/Cyndi Lauper used CD","review":"Item was shipped immediately and received in excellent condition.

I bet if the three of them were in a room together singing, they would shatter a lot of glass.I love this CD because it breaks all the rules about remaking a great song. Just because it's a remakes CD doesn't necessarily mean that you have to copy the original.She has such an amazing instrument, I could listen to her sing names out of the phone book, and it would be interesting.Buy this CD, if you want to hear a great and unique voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"tears will flow","review":"Cyndi Lauper sings these songs so beautifully you will not believe how touching she turned those songs into. The whole cd deserves a standing ovation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pop Diva Shines in This CD!!!!","review":"I just ordered 4 copies of that Master Piece (One for me and 3 for gifts). I don't know the cover songs very well, but Cyndi are introducing them to me with a Bossa Nova STYLE. She reminds me the best Bossa Nova singers back in Brazil. So bad she is not doing one Brazilian Bossa Nova. I love to see Cyndi singing Girl From Ipanema or Waters of March. Cyndi when you will sing one Brazilian song? As you know you have a great amount of fans back in Brazil. Could be nice to see you doing a duet with Zizzi Possi the Brazilian Musa(Diva). What about a duet with Basia? I do love your club songs and I hope you new club song will come up soon. Keep SHINING my favorite lady. I do like you since I was a TEEN in the early 80's. Guys buy this CD because Cyndi shines in this work. Cyndi thanks for your oppenly support for Gay rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Beautiful voice","review":"I never much got into 50's and 60's music. But this is a fantastic set of classics. Ms. Lauper sounds outstanding, and she has turned me from a casual fan into a real admirer of her talent and very original sound. She has a very beautiful voice, especially on the songs Hymn to love, If You Go Away, and the title track. Anyone who loves music from the 50's and 60's will find this CD to be very well done and eminently listenable. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still That Pintsize Powerhouse......","review":"This is a singer whose voice only gets stronger and stronger with every new record. She still has the energy level of a woman half her age. This record has such a powerful vibe to it. It really lets us hear what Cyndi Lauper is capable of, and the tremendous talent she has. There are some wonderful cover versions on here...supercharged readings on everything from a very tearful Unchained Melody to a very gut wrenching version of French singer Jacques Brel's song, If You Go Away. On At Last, She sings her heart out on so many songs, that you feel a little drained of emotion at the end of the record. And the melodies seem to linger in your head long after. She has that one of a kind voice that seem to make so many others pale in comparison. And she connects to her listening audience on so many levels...After 20 years, she's still So Unusually Good:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"shining voice!!!!!","review":"Ms. Lauper is **Magnifique** At Last I'm happy to say, she will get a high recognition from fans of the world that love her for it's songs of beauty.

Cyndi's voice Shines!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Surprise","review":"It took a few spins to get used to this new take on famous standards- the Latin 'Stay,' and Reggae version of 'Sunny Side of the Street,' but I admire Cyndi's determination not to mirror the original. She restructures them. It was a gutsy move, but it works, due to her great interpretation and incredible vocals. I bought 2 copies- for my home and car. I couldn't picture Cyndi Lauper as a singer of standards before, as she has always been known as a singer of rock and pop songs. This record has put those ideas to rest. She is an accomplished musician. Will look forward to her future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Tribute' To An Era Gone By","review":"Great Cd from one of the best female vocalists in the last 50 years. I rank Cyndi L. right up there with Billie Holiday.*Buy This Record, if only for the Grammy nominated \\"Unchained Melody\\" alone. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than the Average (Standard's) CD","review":"I've heard all the standards this last year. Cyndi does her own thing and comes up with a much more interesting and original sounding remake of every song your parents or their parents had among their 45's. She does them justice. I'm certain Etta James' has heard Cyndi's version of her famous song- the title track. And I imagine she's given it a resounding thumbs up. Cyndi has what it takes- a powerful voice- to handle all the key changes in the music and just the right amount of emotion, to give it that needed 'edge.' An excellent record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"Cyndi has such a nice voice. She has power and she has finesse. I got to see her last week in DC, she gives a very engaging performance. The songs on this CD are worth close listening as she has a lot of feeling and does a lot of things with her voice. There are quiet songs and lively ones, it's a nice mix.joey"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Cyndi Lauper","review":"I was very surprised by Cyndi's singing. For a second I was taken aback by it - in such a low register(voice). Then I remembered her sultry vocals on her classic I Drove All Night. When she sings the title song it reminds me of Billie Holiday. Other songs she tackles are reminiscent of Patsy Cline. This is an entirely different side of Cyndi Lauper that most people are not used to experiencing. I hope she continues this trend on future CD's. It's a very nice change from the predictable pop on the radio these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt about it: This girl can sing!","review":"This album contains two outstanding renditions of popular standards: \\"La vie en rose\\" and Brel's \\"If You Go Away.\\" Lauper also provides a fine, Latin-flavored performance of \\"Stay\\" and the old Animals song, \\"Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\\" I occasionally pop my headphones on and give a listen to Lauper's raggae version of \\"Girl's Just Want to Have Fun\\" and a few other cuts from that album. I enjoy her voice and I enjoy her phrasing. This album is a very pleasant surprise and I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unusual Girl Continues to Evolve","review":"Every album Cyndi has done has amazed me, and At Last is no exception. Her career has now spanned over twenty years, and she continuously reinvents her sound.

No one will ever come close to her uniqueness. She's so unusually good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fabulous","review":"When I first listen to the CD I wasn't sure I was going to like it; Cyndi does have a unusual way of putting it together. But I listened and slowly I felt it. The way she has put this together and her own spin on the songs is so moving that I now catch myself singing them. She has come a long way for a girl who just wanted to have fun. She has grown up, just like the rest of us. If you have a love for jazz then i think you can find a place for this in your colection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Doing what she should.","review":"This woman can sing. Any Musician/Singer that listens to this album will tell you that. Any wanna-be rock critic who thinks differently needs to get a life and figure out a better way to get their fifteen minutes of fame (Really, Amazon's review page? Get a grip!).Those of you who were lucky enough to see her on one of the first Letterman specials performing with a Paul Schafer superstar bandhad the joy of seeing her blow everyone else off the stage with a Motown cover tune. One can only hope some smart producer will talk her into doing more. Cyndi Lauper is a Musician!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea!","review":"Listening to the car radio one day, \\"At Last\\" came on unannounced. My first thought was \\"Why would anybody cover a timeless classic?\\". A few seconds later I understood why- it was better than the Etta James original! I was astonished when it was back-announced as Cyndi Lauper. I had known her only from her first 2 albums back in the 80s, and thought she had disappeared. Her early pop work, while catchy and fun, didn't show her vocal range, or her ability to re-interpret songs so well. There is a wide variety of material on this album, and all of it is outstanding. If only I'd known about it earlier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Was Not 20 Years Out of the Music Businness!","review":"Who wrote that Cyndi is out of business for 20 years doesn't know about her carreer or is not reading articles and looking for real music. First her last sucessful CD was around 1990 and second the DIVA have been doing a lot club music after that. She has done a lot things in the 90s. Before At Last she did SHINE and DISCO INFERNO and YOU DON'T KNOW and CLEO AND JOE (Sisters of Avalon). This guy from Canada must be a fan of Celine Dion. Celine Dion should be send back to the 70s where she belongs too. Cyndi does very well when she sings IF YOU GO ALWAY, UNCHAINED MELODY and DON'T LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD. This CD is GREAT and I hope Cyndi will come out with her NEW STUFF SOON."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Hands Down--the BEST work she has done in her whole career. Truly Breathtaking.

Rosemary and Billie would be PROUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been so disappointed","review":"I was so excited to pick up this CD, having been a huge Cyndi Lauper fan from way back. I listened to it last night for the first time. I have heard garage band demos with a better mix. The vocals are completely overpowering, and you can barely hear the orchestration, for what it is. Cyndi's voice is shrill and off-pitch, and the arrangements were so ridiculously contrived I ended up laughing through almost every track. Re-categorize this as a comedy CD and I might understand it. I am amazed at the glowing reviews of this shoddy, painful CD. I wish I had my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising","review":"I have to admit, as an unbiased listener who is indeed musically-savvy, this CD is an embarrassment to every touching, wonderfully-rendered composition Ms. Lauper chose to include.Her voice is totally and wholly unsuited to this classic/standard genre. Some of the selections are downright painful to hear such as her pedestrian and souless interpretation of \\"La Vie en Rose.\\" Anyone familiar with the Piaf version will cringe!I was shocked by the rave reviews this CD received...even fans of Lauper must agree that she is not at her best with this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars--No way--get the orginal artists versions","review":"I cannot beleive that so many people rate this album at 5 stars. She is no Eva Cassidy, and I do not think she improved on the originals at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICK TO ROCK!","review":"WHAT A HORRIBLE ALBUM. I AM A LAUPER FAN FROM THE OLD DAYS. SHE'S ALWAYS HAD A WEAK VOICE WHEN SHE GOES AFTER THE HIGH NOTES OR HEAVY POWER SINGING. BUT, OVERALL, HER VOICE WAS GREAT FOR HER ROCK HITS. I HAVE PURCHASED ALL HER OLD STUFF OVER THE YEARS. BUT, LIKE MANY OLD ROCKERS WHO TRY TO MAKE IT IN BIG BAND MUSIC, SHE DOESN'T. HER VOICE IS TOO WEAK AND I COULDN'T LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE ALBUM, IT WAS TOO EMBARRASSING. STICK TO ROCK, CYNDI, LEAVE THE BIG BAND STUFF TO FRANK SINATRA (THAT GOES FOR ROD STEWART AS WELL)!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could she?","review":"Honestly, I cannot understand these rave reviews. Half way through it the first time, I pronounced this CD \\"unlistenable\\" and turned it off. My husband wanted to hear it so I just endured the first few songs again. I was never a big Lauper fan, but I enjoyed her music and her uniqueness. I can't sing at all, but even I would be embarassed to release this CD. A major miscue, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total waste","review":"this is the worst cd i've ever bought. i wish i could get a full refund for it. something bad must have happened in cyndi's life for her to release this album. it's embarrasing. how anyone can give it a good review is beyond me. i'll think twice before i ever buy another album of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"My son asked me what I wanted for Christmas..I told him the new Cyndi Lauper CD. Well..I've listened to it twice and it was worse the second time. I have been a Lauper fan for 20 years and was so looking forward to this CD. Her voice seems too thin and reedy for some of the material.I will take this CD to the resale store this week; hopefully can get something better in its place."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why people download free music!","review":"I hesitated to buy this album but the song list was eclectic and intriguing and I like Ms. Lauper.There is not a single vocal rendition on this album that couldn't be reproduced better by your average diva high school senior singer!This cd is definitely a \\"regift\\" candidate. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"Cyndi Lauper usually has such a phenomenal voice. Not on this album. It sounds like those awful, cringe-inducing, embarassingly bad American Idol auditions they broadcast on TV. Either she's completely lost her voice in her old age, or this was the absolute wrong selection of songs for her to try to sing for her vocal style. How could she let it be released? Terrible! Wish I could get my money back. Save yours..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I say no!","review":"There is so much that Cyndi could have done with this album. The song selections are good, but all of the tracks seem \\"under produced\\". What happened to LUSH standards? This sound like a basement recording to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and borrow this from another sucker","review":"Very disappointing. I too am a Lauper fan of old but was disappointed with this album. After the fourth song began, I felt as if it would never end. I had to turn it off to regain my sanity. There are a few songs that a done well, \\"At Last\\" and \\"Walk on Buy\\" are great. I also enjoyed \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\" but felt like I was tied to a chair and had important information that I was willing to share when \\"La Vie En Rose\\" came on. Cyndi, this song is not your style and should have been left as just a nice childhood memory for you.Take some advise from someone who spent the $12.99, save your 13 dollars and buy something worthwhile. Nothing on this cd makes the $12.99 money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Cheap","review":"This album sounds like it was recorded in a back alley. The songs are good, and Cyndi has a super voice! I just wish the album had a more \\"rich\\" sound to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Awful","review":"Awful, I wish I had my money back. I really like Cyndi Lauper's earler work too. But this is just awful. This is the last standards/remakes/redo cd's I am going to buy. Someone on Amazon should do a \\"Standards\\" to avoid list. I would put this on that list right underneath Joni Mitchell's standards album, and I worship at the the altar of Joni, but her's was worse than Cyndi's. Scary because what is coming out these days is not even close to either Joni or Cyndi. What is the music industry coming to???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Either my CD is defective or . . .","review":"She's off key to the point of embarrassment. My wife bought this with high expectations - she listened to it in the car a couple of times and then had me listen to make sure it wasn't just her. I made it through 3 songs before begging her to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD INTENTIONS","review":"Girls just want to have fun and be famous again. Cyndi, the darling \\"little girl voice\\" from the eighties has joined the growing list of mature artists (they are NOT has-beens!) such as Rod Stewart, Michael Bolton, Boz Scaggs, Leon Russell, Aaron Neville, Bette Midler et al. in reinterpreting chestnuts and songs we've loved for decades.Unfortunately, despite the sparkling production of Lauper and Russ Titelman, the sad thing, for me anyway, is Cyndi doesn't have the pipes to pull these songs off. Most of her vocals seem strained and that little girl voice still makes it hard to hear \\"Unchained Melody\\" or \\"Until You Come Back to Me Again,\\" and not wish for Aretha or the Righteous ones.I am glad others have found this a worthwhile effort, as it may help continue this outburst of really hearing great old songs. But I don't think Cyndi's is going to be around that long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Album","review":"Cyndi hits every note perfectly. Her amazing four-octave range is showcased here like never before. So far, only her recording of \\"The World is Stone\\" showed her vocal power and control like this. In this album, it's all over.She injects real emotion into these songs. I can guarantee you that in most cases you'll prefer her version over the original. She \\"gets\\" these songs so well that you would think she wrote them.She said at one of her shows that she had to \\"strip herself naked\\" for \\"If You Go Away\\" and it's so true. If that performance doesn't move you nothing will.\\"Stay\\" is redone as a cha-cha/salsa tune, it's great.She redid the arrangement for \\"Hymn to Love\\" by combining it with another song which makes for a really engaging accompaniment.The high notes on the title track are mind-boggling.The samples here are not great. They have better samples at cyndilaupermusic.com. But even those don't do real justice to these great renditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Newer Cyndi Lauper Fan","review":"Didn't realize what a great vocalist she was til I got this cd.She can sing really good and even though i wasn't familiar with a lot of these songs(I'm only 19) it was like hearing them for the first time.I just started to become of fan of Cyndi's after seeing her in concert 2 years ago, and wanted to get all her music after that. She really is a great artist. She can do a lot with her voice.Her song Hymn To Love really moves me(almost to tears). It's so beautiful. I happen to love her singing voice.She's Very Talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Singing and Music - A 10","review":"An excellent CD- by the criminally underrated singer Cyndi Lauper. She expresses more feeling in just one sentence of a song, than some singers can express in an entire album. The orchestration is outstanding, with music representing the era of the 50's-early 70's. Cyndi obviously did her homework. It's just about flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great 'Alternative' Standards Compilation","review":"I never give five star ratings to an artist's record. No record is one hundred percent perfect, but this comes darn close. As far as I'm concerned, Ms. Lauper does just about everything right, with the exception of Makin' Whoopee w/Tony Bennett. Her song choices are very good, as well as the understated music production. Lauper co-produced this with Russ Titleman--known for producing music for Eric Clapton. The result is a great compilation of music from every genre, and Lauper knows how to sing and structure a song, which serves the material well. I would recommend this record to anyone who enjoys the classics, but wants a nice alternative from the tired standards fare that seems to be coming out at an alarming rate, from Stewart(please go back to the rock classics), and others alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Day Classic","review":"It boggles my mind how so many people say they never knew how well she could sing before this CD. They must not have been paying attention. Cyndi is an amazing talent and it is fun to hear her on such wonderful classics with her own style. At Last is worth the price of admission alone. Her voice simply sends chills down my spine. Luckily the rest of the album is very entertaining as well. I love the different arrangements of songs we are all familiar with. It is nice to see such a talent regaining popularity. There were several absolutely great CD's that she put out over the last decade that were unfortunately overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Gasp\\"...That Voice!!","review":"A seriously sophisticated, moving recording that boils with style and maturity. The perfect record for for someone who finds the current trends in music lacking; no Britney, no drama, no frills. One listen to the unreal \\"Unchained Melody\\" and powerful \\"Hymn To Love\\" and you'll realize the understated greatness that is Cyndi Lauper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi's voice is amazing!","review":"I suspect a few singers may be looking over their shoulder, because Cyndi has some serious pipes!! I'm only 25 yrs. old and am still a fairly new fan of Cyndi's. I saw her live show a few months ago in N.Y. City, and have been a diehard fan ever since. You would think someone of my age would not be into buying a cd full of songs that were popular long before I was born, but I'm inspired by Cyndi's voice, and really wanted to get some new material from her, whatever the songs. Since I'm familiar with only a handful of the songs in their original format, most of them are like brand new to me. I think Cyndi did an awesome job re-working them. She kicks some serious A** on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic","review":"Cyndi explores musical styles that run the gamut here from blues to reggae, to jazz, pop, rock and salsa. What could have been a disaster in the hands of a less competent artist, works like magic for Cyndi. She displays incredible range, and shows great care in her intrepretive capabilities. She shifts emotional gears from fragile, to calm to lively to bold, as if it were effortless. Her voice has great quality and expression. It's like a magnetic field to the listeners ear. Go check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is absolutely brilliant","review":"I am so shocked and suprised by this album. To be honest I hate some of the songs Cyndi has chosen. Walk on By and Unchained melody are the sappiest and most oversung songs in history. Cyndi made them beautiful. Cyndi seems to have stripped them right back to the basics and her voice here is more like and instrument than it has been in the past. Her \\"Please don't let me be misunderstood\\" is undeniably the greatest cover version ever recorded. I still can't believe it's this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Still So Unusual!","review":"What an amazing talent! Did anyone realize twenty-odd years ago what a remarkable MUSICIAN this woman is? She puts her own stamp on these thirteen classic songs in such a way that you almost forget the originals. \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\" wrings unexpected depths from this song. I was less crazy about her \\"La Vie en Rose\\" but it's not her fault I can't stand to hear this song sung in English. The \\"Hymne a l'amour\\" (oh, excuse me, \\"Hymn to Love\\"), though, works beautifully, as does her \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" (oops, I mean \\"If You Go Away\\"). She can still belt with the best of them, but my favorites on this album are the ones where she scales down her voice and sings with such directness and poignancy that it takes your breath away. This is an album for grown-ups, but just when you think it's getting a little too melancholy, she tosses in her take on \\"Stay\\" or, even more fun, \\"The Sunny Side of the Street.\\" This is one that's gonna get better on repeated listenings. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi In a League All Her Own","review":"I grew up with Cyndi's music back in the 1980's and I've followed her right up to her At Last release. I need to get a dose of her music at least once a day, and this CD is no exception. I especially love Unchained Melody, Hymn to Love and Walk on By. They're very emotional and Cyndi does a monumental job with them as the rest of the songs on this CD. She has that unique and incredible voice that you just don't hear too often. Can't wait for her new album later this year:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gutsy Diva","review":"I didnt care much for this Cd at first (though I thought it was a gutsy move on her part), but its grown on me. (funny how that works sometimes). I didnt like the lack of orchestration on many of the songs and the slow paced arrangements along with the overly dramatic singing. There are still a few cuts I dont care for (If You Go Away for one) but overall I've totally come around to the pro-Cyndi camp on this one. It may take a little getting used to, but it gets better with repeated listenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hoping to hear a fresh interpretation of these standards, rather than just hearing Ms. Lauper sing them in her own few-words-to-the-phrase style. It felt as if not much thought had been given to the songs- more like, \\"Lets just record them and get the CD out the door.\\" Her voice sounds thin on most cuts, and the arrangements are underwhelming in idea and execution. What was done to \\"Makin' Whoopee\\" is a sin. Dr. John & Rickee Lee Jones' version has faults, but their version is a Gold Standard by comparison. If Ray Charles was dead, he'd be rolling over in his grave. Sorry, I am getting carried away... I suppose a hard-core Cyndi Lauper fan would like this album, but fans of the standards should steer clear for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyndi is still great, but this album was very disappointing.","review":"My husband and I are big Cyndi Lauper fans so we purchased this album with high expectations. Alas, we must agree with Jason's view . . . somehow, someone coerced Cyndi into producing this album. The songs are indeed old but we thought if anyone could do them justice, it would be Cyndi Lauper. However, she sings them almost as if she's being forced to do so -- without any true feeling. There's no spark . . . she just trudges through the songs. This album was so bad that we ended up selling it at a garage sale and, trust me, it takes a lot for us to get rid of an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"George","review":"I bought this cd after seeing the video for \\"At Last\\" - thinking this would be a good purchase, boy was I wrong. This is dreadful, she seems to be cashing in on the current trend for remaking classic songs. She should stick to her old style, since this music doesn't fit her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to hearing this album -- I love Cyndi Lauper, and thought it would be great to hear her take on some old standards. However, the cd starts off bad, with an extremely off-key At Last, and gets worse. With one or two exceptions, the album is just an endless parade of flat, ponderous dirges completely bereft of any joy or life. The main exception is Stay, which starts out fun but eventually decends into the bizarre as Cyndi starts barking (yes, barking). Even Makin' Whoopee, a normally fun song, sounds as if it is sung through a haze of depression. This is one CD that I will probably never play again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pac Man Fever","review":"This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. Pac Man Fever is worse, but, then again, the arcade sounds were at least worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"With a promising ep of new material in 2002, I was expecting a great full-length cd of NEW MATERIAL from her, but we wound up with this. I like a few songs, mostly AT LAST and STAY, but overall am very disappointed. Seems to be jumping on the 'standards' bandwagon hoping to get the sales that Rod Stewart has fro his last 2 cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"I really can't believe so many people like this CD - it is truly horrible. Cyndi has a beautiful voice and I thought that these standards would sound fantastic, but instead she is doing what seems to be popular now with female vocalists - warbling up and down and stretching out songs so that you just ache for it to be over with. I'm going to throw the CD away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyndi Lauper is Over","review":"I will make this short, as I do not want to offend any fans of Ms. Lauper. Bluntly, Cyndi Lauper has a horrible rat-like, annoying voice that was once interesting and polished in 1982/3. She has no sense of style, and to prove this all one has to do is look at the sleeve of her 1983 debut. She is not an ICON, like the Great Madonna, she has not had a charting hit since 1986, and has only had two number ones! And it is very obvious to the casual onlooker that Ms. Lauper desperately tries to build on the foundation of 1983's \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\". She could never rival Madonna and will never be remembered as an ICON, like Madonna. Throw in the Towel Cyndi. Sony dropped you once, maybe next time it should be for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"This album was a complete let down. I was really hoping this album would be a new beginning for Cyndi. Instead, we got an album that seems \\"thrown together\\" and lacks any real substance. She chose some good songs, but they are arranged terribly. Her voice sounds very pushed and contrived. After listening to this CD I had a headache. The only reason this CD earned two stars, instead of one, is because I really like Cyndi and she has a great voice! I really think she just needed a different producer for this album. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent and Sad","review":"Please Cyndi . . . move forward!! This cover of a bunch of oldies is not what I expected. I am a fan (especially of her first couple of efforts) and I am cheering for her to return to some danceable or melodic pop (I loved stuff like \\"Time After Time\\"). This collection has few high spots and, regrettably, some places where it sounds like Cyndi's voice is failing (especially in the early part of \\"Makin' Whoopie\\" for example). If you want some of these tunes, try a Julie London record for much greater rewards. Cyndi should go back to her roots, not someone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"CYNDI LAUPER \\"At Last\\"","review":"I have been a huge fan of Ms. Lauper for many years, however, her recent release has to be one of the greatest disappointments in years ... The quality of her voice and range do not stand up to her past ventures ... Avoid this CD, you will be greatly disappointed... Cyndi, a word of advice ... stick to what you know best ... this CD is a poor attempt to rehash some old standards ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant song selection, but..","review":"Ms Lauper does not have the vocal range. Her interpretation of these classic songs is clearly handicapped by her rasping voice. She doesn't approach Carly Simon in an earlier album called \\"Torch Songs.\\" Consider Joni Mitchel's wonderful recent album of standards with great orchestrations. Even Rod Stewart's album is more rewarding. I'm a bit surprised that Tony Bennet agreed to accompany Ms Lauper."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Waited all this time for \\"AT LAST\\"???????!","review":"After waiting such a long time for new music from Cyndi, all we get is a bunch of lethargic standards?!I feel really cheated.I was so hoping for a full album of more music like Shine!Cyndi did a disservice to her patient and faithful fans on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?!","review":"I loved some of Cyndi's older things, especially \\"Time After Time\\", but on this cd, her voice sounds thin and strained and she really sounds like she has a speech impediment. I'll pass on this one and hope she comes out with something soon that doesn't sound like she is stretching so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"It's about time for Cyndi to get the attention she deserves. So much talent needed to be aknowledged! This lady can sing and doesn't have to promote sex in order to sell her work. \\"At Last\\" should have been number one the day it was released. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll rip your heart out....","review":"It's an uneven CD -- even I, the consummate Lauper fan from way back when she still had Van Gogh's \\"Starry Night\\" on the bottom of her shoes, can admit that -- but her rendition of Unchained Melody will shred you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST HOLDS A FEW GEMS NOT TO BE MISSED","review":"This CD is long overdue. WHAT A TALENT! Some songs will appeal to hardcore fans and some won't. For this fan, the rework of \\"IF YOU GO AWAY\\" is worth the cost of the CD alone. It haunts you even after the song is over. Cindi will ALWAYS be that little girl with the larger than life voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great From Beginning To End","review":"Cyndi Lauper's super-charged version of \\"At Last\\"(the title track), is right up there with that of Etta James' version.She sings it with amazing range and intensity.Cyndi gives us her interpretation of 12 other tracks that were popular standards from the past, and nails them perfectly.I commend her on doing an outstanding justice to the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but not for Everyone","review":"If you are only interested in the girl who \\"just wants to have fun\\", buy She's So Unusual or 12 Deadly Cyns. You probably won't like this CD if you are expecting that kind of music. If, on the other hand, you recognize that there is depth behind Cyndi's persona and can listen to this CD with an open mind, you may really, really like this CD. I think it's just stunning -especially after seeing Cyndi perform the music from this CD live. It's mostly a quiet CD. Most of the songs have sparse arrangements, sometimes just a piano and cyndi. The CD is supposed to showcase Cyndi's vocal abilities and I believe it does. Cyndi is never one to imitate, so although these songs are covers, many of them sound nothing like the original. Her cover of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" gives me chills. Before this, I wouldn't believe that anyone could improve a Nina Simone song. It takes an open mind to really enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi remains true to her artistic vision","review":"This is not your average standards CD. It is very unique in vocal intrepretation and production. Cyndi deserves kudos for continuing to show incredible musical versatility. Her voice is stronger than ever. She is still doing things her way, and refuses to give in to trends. This is not an artist obsessed with having to be number 1 all the time. But \\"At Last\\" continues to sell well, and I predict it will continue to be successful for some time to come. Not many musicans come around in our lifetime like Cyndi lauper. I thank her 1000 times over for never changing her artistic vision, and remaining true to herself and those inspired by her. Cyndi--I'll see you in Australia when you tour here next yr!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Shines in this WORK! Don't Let Her Be Misunderstood!","review":"I do love this CD and I love listen Cyndi's music in my car. Believe me this is one of the best CD of the season. If you like real live music you will love this CD. Good thing Cyndi Lauper can sing and can do it well. Madonna and others should take some advice with the Punk Diva. Cyndi beside to be a POP DIVA she is also a Club DIVA. To let you kow guys her new DANCE SINGLE is out already. Contact SONY MUSIC and you will love it. Don't let Cyndi be MISUNDERSTOOD and buy this CD because you will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making it her own!","review":"What an amazing album. I was hoping for something a little more lively, but the emotion displayed in this album hooked me. Cyndi just blows my mind. From \\"Girl's\\" all the way to one of the most recent tracks on At Last, \\"Stay.\\" I can't get over the diversity of this amazing performer. She made all of these songs in true Cyndi fashion. None are true \\"cover\\" songs. She may have covered the lyrics, but the music and performance is truly her's. Another artistic win in my opinion. She might not be topping the charts, but those that are looking for artistic value in an album.......this is the one! Great job once again Cyndi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet !!!","review":"I just love this CD. I think At Last is the Best recording Cyndi has ever done. She's a very gifted singer and song stylist, with an amazing range....She's still awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! WOW! WOW!!","review":"I ordered 5 cd's at the same time. But I can't put Cyndi down long enough to listen to the others. I saw her over a year ago in concert with Cher and remembered why I loved her way back when. But THIS..THIS cd is incredible!!! And wait 'til you hear the mix with Tony Bennett. I say STRONG nomination for \\"Best Collaboration\\". I have eclectic taste in music. This is the most wonderful gift I could have given myself. KEEP KICKIN' CYNDI..and keep standin' up for all you believe in. You will be forever young and beautiful!!! 13 Songs - 13 different ways to send chills up and down your body. WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Time Goes By","review":"some artists mature and become more expressive over time even if they record cover tunes or branch out into other/new musical areas. If you like albums like Bryan Ferry's \\"As Time Goes By\\" or Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach's \\"Painted from Memory\\", or even Norah Jones, you'll probably like this one as I did. I'm not previously a fan of Cindy Lauper, but this CD really shines. Awesome minimalist recording quality - with subtle details that can really make a \\"high-end\\" sound system shine. And oh... her voice. Expressive, powerful at times, dainty and delecate at others. Unlike another reviewer here, I REALLY like that Cindy adds her own quite different interpretation/rendition to these old classics. I think it would be boring otherwise. Her renditions make them sound new again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing: She doesn't have the voice for these tunes","review":"I waited anxiously for this album, but am very disappointed. I think the world of Cyndi Lauper, but have to say she sings best when SHE writes. Far better albums are \\"Unhook the Stars\\" and \\"Sisters of Avalon.\\" She's done wonderful singles such as \\"You Don't Know\\" and \\"Shine\\" - and on everything she writes her voice is tremendous. This latest album of standards misses the boat big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Last, Cyndi Lauper","review":"This was not at all what I expected. I liked most of her blues album but every song on \\"At Last\\" was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little flat","review":"The sound byte of Etta James' classic, \\"At Last\\" as sung by Cyndi Lauper sounds decent on the commercials but the rest of the song, and album, falls flat...literally. I like Cyndi Lauper, but this CD is disappointing. Her reinterpretation of classic songs is at times comical (e.g. Makin' Whoopee w/Tony Bennett), and her voice, unfortunately, is not quite good enough to compensate for the differences from the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Lauper Remains A True Talent","review":"Giving this CD a 4 star rating in my book is exceptional. I don't believe any CD is 100% flawless. This is darn near close though. Cyndi is still one of the brightest and greatest singers in the business. And even though 22 years have passed since her break-though hit, she remains a great talent. While still maintaining that youthful child-like quality in her voice, on songs like La Vie En Rose and Hymn to love, she also shows amazing maturity and shockingly strong vocals in the title song(At Last). She sings the hell out of this song, accompanied by only a piano. But Cyndi doesn't need electronic equipment to enhance her voice. Her voice is an instrument. An amazing one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Original--Just Like Cyndi","review":"I've been a big fan of Cyndi Lauper's since she debuted in the early 80's. I don't feel that she gets enough credit for being one of the more influential and defintely one of the most talented performers of the last two decades. I saw her last year on tour with Cher (and am seeing her again in a few months on a solo tour)--she just lights up the stage and the crowd goes wild!!Her latest CD, At Last, is incredible. Although these are old songs that I've heard many times, I've never heard them interpreted like this before. I love the couple of upbeat tunes, but most of the album consists of slow ballads (although some of these songs were not in this tempo in their original versions). Cyndi manages to make each song sound new, and her range on some of the songs is very impressive. A must for your collection if you're a Cyndi Lauper fan, or a fan of great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Really Shows Her Talent in This Work!","review":"The diva really shows her talent in this work and the POP MUSIC world should be proud of singers like Cyndi Lauper. The muse maturity is incredible. I hope in the future Cyndi will include some songs from the countries she is still very popular in her CDS (For example: Japan, Brazil, Germany, France and more...). Could be great to hear Cyndi singing a Bossa Nova or a German song. Keep shinning Cyndi. Well done job!!!!! This CD is great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time For Cyndi To Go Back To Her Own Songs","review":"Cyndi Lauper is a great singer...I liked the way she took \\"Unchained Melody,\\" and changed it into a whole new song. I liked the understated production she used. Her voice is incredible. However, Cyndi needs to sing her own songs. She's far too good of a vocalist and writer to be singing someone elses songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standards should not have to suffer this indignity!","review":"Cyndi should have stayed with over-produced pop which hides all the imperfections of her voice. La vie en rose is the most telling piece of this set. She has no control when singing softly, she is off-pitch frequently, phrasing is terrible, occasionally sounds like she's had too many whiskeys (I like a husky sounding voice, but this is not natural; it sounds harsh and forced) and last but certainly not least, if she's going to sing Piaf then at the very least she could have pronounced the title correctly!! If you want to hear a wonderful, recent artist (sadly deceased) who can hold her own with her guitar and gives wonderful interpretations of standards and many other genres then check out the phenomenal Eva Cassidy. Eva does a soulful, powerful and incredible rendition of At Last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Torn!","review":"I have always loved Cyndi Lauper's work. She is an original and creative performer - but not on this CD. My husband put it in my Christmas stocking and I was so excited to see a new Cyndi CD we put it on right away - then sat in stunned disbelief! Her voice is strained, off-key, inharmonious. I really wanted to like this - I WANT Cyndi to come back - but this is just not the way to do it.The only reason I'm happy my husband bought the CD for me is that, perhaps, if it sells enough, they may let her loose to perform some of her own creative, orginal music again.I'm afraid, though, that if it sells TOO well, that they may force her to perform (badly) someone else's work again. I would rather see her quit recording than go through this again.Cyndi - please come back to us as yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Recording!!!!","review":"Cyndi Lauper is the #1 female pop diva of all time- no one sounds like her, or can sing Jazz, Pop, R&B, Reggae and Salsa all on the same album with perfection like she has here. Cyndi aces it time after time. Not only is she beautiful inside and outside, but she has the voice to match. She has so much passion and soul when she sings. I absolutely love what she has done with Unchained Melody, Stay and Until You Come Back To Me. Tony Bennett and Stevie Wonder must be tremendous fans of Cyndi's- since they are guest artists on two songs - Stevie plays his harmonica on his self-penned UYCBTM, and Tony duets with her on Makin' Whoopee. This whole album is a classic, like the artist herself. I'd give it 10 Stars If I Could! You should hear Cyndi's version of Silent Night from her Chrismas Album MCHANL. It's on the radio throughout the country. She sings like an angel on it. It's Gorgeous.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put It Down","review":"I will give this no less than 5 stars, because Cyndi Lauper is the greatest artist ever. Her voice never falters anywhere. She has the idea voice for these very traditional songs. It's the amazing way in which she uses her voice and, her great intuitiveness in recreating a song that made me fall in love with At Last from the first time I listened. I have had a difficult time putting this cd down. I always discover something new in this singer's very unique voice. I was too young to appreciate these songs back in the 1940's and 50's, since I was many years away from being born, but now I can, thanks to Cyndi. It's fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl knows how to ROCK!!","review":"You ROCK Cyndi and so does this CD. You have to Check out this GREAT record, highly recommended to any fan of jazz or pop rock music. \\"At Last has it ALL. Cyndi covers the whole spectrum of music. She knocks me out with her voice everytime. Cyndi... Please come back to Canada, SOOON! We MISS YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy and Satisfying","review":"I read somewhere that Cyndi took voice lessons for years from renowned vocal coach, Katie Agresta, and it's paid off in spades for her. A singer needs to have the necessary vocal chops to carry this off, and Cyndi makes it work, on more than just a few levels. This is as good as it gets, in terms of an expertly produced album(Cyndi and Russ Titleman), matched with some stunning vocals. I bought this album on Amazon, last month-2 copies, one for the car and home, and it has rarely left my cd player since. Many music critics and radio DJ's have been putting At Last in their top albums for 2003 and 2004. Go check this one out..It's one of the best albums and best investments in music, you'll be making this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected...BETTER","review":"I have been an on again/ off again fan of Cyndi Lauper. I was intrigued by this new album. I think it is fabulous. She does better than I could have imagined on all the songs. She makes each one her own. Anyone can remake a former hit, not many can put their own stamp on it and make it work for them. My husband even said he'll have to get his own copy because I'm definitely not sharing mine. A MUST HAVE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite 10!","review":"All I can say is Cyndi Lauper's voice is amazing...The sheer brilliance in which she is able to use her voice in so many different registers on At Last is a true wonder. I've been a huge fan of hers since the early 80's, and I have become more and more impressed with how she has evolved from an 80's icon into a highly respectable musician, among music critics and her peers. She has definitely fine tuned her career into something she can be very proud of. Cyndi is one of the headliners at VH1 Divas this year. No one deserves it more! I'll see you in July on your Australian tour..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Individual Performer Ever","review":"\\"At Last\\" is truly a wonderful album. I loved every second of it. Cyndi's voice has always been one of beauty & radiance, but it is at its most powerful and impressive here. She did a very beautiful rendition of her song \\"Time After Time\\" at the Nobel Peace Price Ceremony/Concert that was televised here in Trinidad Saturday Evening. She moved me to tears with her performance. I will always love her for her individuality, & her unique way of presenting a song. She's very inspirational to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Emotion!","review":"OMG! This is SO GREAT! Don't believe anything else you read! You must hear it to believe it! The music is downplayed to showcase that amazing voice! The ballads are actually very soulful and sad, brings the listener to some serious emotional reflection. You won't regret this purchase!

If not a fan, do not buy this recording as you will not like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nostalgia","review":"Cyndi demonstrates the full range of her talent in this nostalgic release of old and good songs. I found myself laughing and reflecting on each new song. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi's Come A Long Way Since Her \\"Fun\\" Days","review":"I had some reservations when I heard Cyndi Lauper was doing an all covers CD. I wasn't too into the idea of a great vocalist and songwriter like Cyndi singing famous songs of other's and especially from 40 years ago. I have to say I completely misjudged her. She performs nothing short of a miracle with Stay, At Last, Unchained Melody and a incredibly moving song called Hymn To Love. Cyndi sings with all her heart and soul on these songs. The emotion on Unchained Melody was almost too much to handle. I immediately began to cry when she hit that amazing high note in the second to last verse. Very few singers can send chills thru you. Cyndi Lauper's voice can do that. She still looks 30 years old, sounds better now she she ever has, and has come far, since the days of the Girls Just Want To Have Fun era. She's an amazing talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something????","review":"Looking at the cd cover and reading the list of songs Cyndi selected to sing, I was anxious to hear her cd. She appeared to have matured into a classy lady with a list of \\"oldies\\" to prove it. Looks being deceiving, I found Cyndi to be totally outside her \\"comfort zone\\". It was a mistake on my part to purchase this cd; I was very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull CD. Must have been a budget recording...","review":"Don't buy this CD it's a waste of money. First off sound mixing is real bad. I have to keep turning it up to hear at the start of a song then Cindy starts getting too loud and you have to turn it down. Did someone mix this in a garage?Also her voice and the music are very boring. Sounds like a 3-man band playing and Cindy giving a very lack-luster performance. I kept switching through the tracks looking for one good song. All of them are dull and boring..I wish I could get my money back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"What happened to the Cyndi that just wanted to have fun? At Last has a more \\"sohpisticated\\" sound too it, no longer is she just having fun. When I, for the first time, heard the first few seconds of the first song, it sounded like songs one would hear on the Lady Sings the Blues album, at some moments, Norah Jones popped in my mind (maybe it's just me). I gave the album a two star rating, instead of a one star rating, due to the depth of the songs and the powerful voice singing them. Other than that, this CD is not \\"fun\\", it's just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I read the reviews and listened to the previews, but unfortuantly I was disappointed. I don't think it was her voice I think it was the production that was a disappointment. She was not consistent with the sound and tone of voice. So 2 or 3 songs are good to great the rest is almost painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant Cash Grab","review":"Sorry, I just don't buy it. You can't disappear from the music scene for 20 years and then show up just to record an album of other people's music. It just reeks of trading on your past fame...can't imagine it's about much other than infusing some extra cash into her bank account.As for the music...BORING. Although she sings several of the songs competently, that's the best that can be said about them...she doesn't bring anything unique or interesting to the pieces at all. The whole point of a standard is in the interpretation, and she really doesn't have one in most cases.A definite disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"why didn't Shine get this promotion?","review":"Last year, Cyndi Lauper released the Shine EP, consisting of tracks meant to come out in 2001 but her label folded. She toured alongside Cher and picked up a lot of interest in the project. Yet she was on an indie and got zilch promotion. And the album was one of her best ever.Then she goes the Streisand (yawn) route and does a standards cd and gets more promotion than she's gotten since 1989? Why is this? I just hope that Cyndi doesn't stay in the genre the way Rod Stewart has. The majority of Cyndi's fanbase are into her pop-rock style that she's perfected in the past decade. I hate standards and Cyndi cannot convert me to liking them. I'm still debating if I hate standards more, or if I hate it when pop stars go hip hop (think Jennifer Lopez or Mariah Carey)Shame on you Cyndi"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money","review":"i agree with another reviewer. this cd was awful if you like dark bar room type music then you just might like this one. i will never buy another one of her cds again until i can hear it online or at a local store what a waste of money. the record companys wonder why people are not buying cds. its because of this one people expect rock and roll thats not what you get here at all.i forced my self to listen to the hole cd hopeing it would get better it did not get better.so to any body who is wanting to buy this cd listen to it first before you buy it and waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unstructured book by a likely acid casualty","review":"Destiny Matrix isn't so much a book as a compilation of random one or two page ramblings about Jack Sarfatti's life that are thrown together in no discernible order. The jumps between the sections are very jarring. Different things coexist with no real connection.....equations about quantum mechanics are put near sections on girls that Sarfatti liked and pages and pages of his work for Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program are put in the middle of ramblings. Did I mention that he has a unique political perspective? Although known from \\"Cosmic Trigger\\" there's a reason why he willingly contributed to Reagan's Star Wars program.I hate to say it but this book represents the weakness of print on demand self publishing in that any sort of editor would have demanded that some overarching structure be imposed on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't \\"0\\" stars possible?","review":"This book showcases the author as a mind numbing, pedantic, egoistical, blowhard with a Christ complex (he really thinks he is related to Jesus and Mussolini).The book is nothing more than selected fodder from endless email exchanges with willing and unwilling members of the legitimate and fringe physics communities. Many of these email exchanges, while including some tremendous physics and thought into physical reality, quickly degenerate into childish mudslinging where everyone but Jack is wrong.The book comes complete with hyperlinks to horribly animated cartoons based on the supposed phone call from aliens in the future.Please save your money and purchase The Dancing Wu Li Masters instead.

I bought this book not knowing anything about Goingback or his books and I could not put it down until I had finished reading it. I do not know much about Indians or their rituals, but this book has made me very interested in their culture. I like to read at night before I go to sleep and I am a big fan of Dean Koontz, but Dean has never given me the eerie feeling that Goingback did with this book. I found myself looking over the top of the book, just to make sure nothing was hiding in the shadows. Read this book if you want to know what I am talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I bought this book because the photo of the author, an American Indian, made me think I'd get a different kind of novel from the usual WASP horror cliches.

The Native American elements were interesting--but not interesting enough to carry this pedestrian story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duller Than Dull","review":"What a letdown!This is the type of book with sentences like this:\\"There was something in the shadows.

Nobody writes a suspenseful passage quite the same way as he does. He really does have a style all his own. He is very light on gore, but he makes up for it with fear. That is right, good old fear. Remember, horror is meant to scare you, not disgust you. This is a great book with great characters. It moves a bit slow, but you still care to find out what happens, and when it does happen, it is great stuff!

I thought the book would have been better if more time had been spent on the EVIL rather than on characters who were annoyingly pompous, selfish and prejudiced.

I think not. Still, in most colleges, _chaos_ is a subtopic you briefly go through (most of the time just \`skipped' through) while studying differential equations, mathematical physics or classical physics. To be competely honest, my impression is that those \`\`subtopics'' usually don't make a good intro to chaotic dynamics, either. I have read some textbooks targeted at undergraduates and Gulick's was not too bad to skim through what we have in chaotic dynamics. However, Gulick pays too much attention on the basics (analysis and differential equations) and this may seem such a waste of space given the limited number of pages (some two hundreds). Naturally, his explanations are not detailed and gives the impression that things are done rather hastily. But, I must say, this book is superier to some other books that spends time neither on the basics nor the analytic aspects of chaotic dynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Owen Archer tale","review":"This series is a wonderful one with vividly drawn and sympathetic characters, interesting plots, and plenty of intrigue.

The story is that of an unfortuate man who goes to a puppet show one year and falls in love . One year later, she goes to the theater alone, not to come back. Our main character leaves to the theater, and the horror begins. It is a good story, which is a trademark of most of the King's material.There is a good variety of music here. There are female vocals used in many parts in this album, and they're all very well done. There are powerful songs, there are heavy songs, there are songs that will remind you of Abigail, and there is a ballad-type song. The guitar playing is very well done, much more interesting than it has ever been before.This album is a great one, let us hope the forthcoming release continues the steps taken on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KING DELIVERS EVERYTHING HE PREPARED US TO ANTICIPATE!!!","review":"I've been waiting on this album for over six months now, ever since I read interviews with King himself hyping the album to be his best and darkest to date. Now that it is finally upon us, I must say it is even more than all I anticipated it would be. I think King knew he had to redeem himself a bit after Abigail II, it was a mediocore King Diamond album but it fell short of the melodic structure and shape that was captured on House Of God and previous efforts. This album is more than a comeback from Abigail II, it is the best album of his career and I am absolutely pleased and astonished with it. Get it today!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King tells a great story with words and notes","review":"Having been a King/MF fan for some time, I was disappointed with some of King's albums in the 90s. Abigail 2 was an improvement, almost back to the quality of early King/MF. Puppet Master is the best King album to date, almost as good as early MF. It is heavy, produced and mixed well, with thick guitar and drum throughout. King uses his full vocal range, but keeps the high pitched screeches somewhat in check. If you like King/MF, I think you will find this album to be excellent. Give it a try, King has really put his all into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A milestone...","review":"This really is King's best work to date! The music is heavy and the most mealodic ever.

I end up listening to it 5 times in a row because its so great. Plus unlike King Diamonds other albums his voice remains alittle less supersonic for the duration of the time. Not that theres anything wrong witht the supersonic voice. I got Fatal Portrait and Abigail and they kick ass. Andy La Rocque (don't kill me if I spelled that wrong) can do some great riffs.

I'm trying to figure out why everyone seems to think that this album is horridly scary? King doesn't use any of his trademark \\"voices\\" on this album,there's no kackling laughter,and most of all there's no ambiance of terror, only sappy \\"I miss my baby cakes,oh,woh,woh\\" sentiment. I've been jammin the king since the \\"Mellisa\\" days and I'm sorry to say that this is not one of King's greatest accomplishments, nor is it one of Andy La'Rocque's finer soloing moments. I think King needs to get making people afraid again and not making them want to shed a tear in thier beer. Anyhow, I just thought I'd voice an old-school opinion.

C'mon King, what's with the stupid female vocals?? Do they have to be on every other track!? And the over-use of the keyboards?? The stuff almost sounds like Journey....it was so bad I had to fast forward. The King has strayed too much from what he does best, and that's pure raw metal.

As some people have noted, the neoprene is quite stretchable, but for people who bring lunches that may not fit in one of those sandwich-sized tupperware containers (such as multiple-component lunches, or soup), it's not really a flexible enough design. Even if you do use the sandwiched-sized tupperware containers, there's not much room left for other things after that (you could increase space by using a plastic sandwich baggie, but would sacrifice eco-friendliness). The asymmetry of the lunchbag can also make it somewhat awkward to carry/hold when it's full, as the drink side is usually a bit heavier than the sandwich side (it also does not easily stand up on its own).I do like the clean design, and quality of the material and construction, though, so I am thinking about getting one of the bigger, one-compartment Built lunchbags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not big enough for lunch","review":"I bought this for my husband and he tried it but did not like it.

Avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very close to being almost funny","review":"Yes there are some laughs.. but the majority are only silly slapstick type jokes that we have come to expect already.. It does not have enough intelligence for sustained laughter but it is too entertaining not to watch.. What makes the movie particularly annoying, however, is the acting..and the lack of clever dialogue.. I guess you should expect that from the trailers and title - god why did i watch this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at ALL COSTS!","review":"This movie could be worse than \\"White Chicks\\" (another ridiculousy foolish movies starring these two hacks (The Wayans Brothers).Don't waste your time with this garbage!Really not much to tell.

They all SUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Original Wayans!","review":"Are the two of you so hard up for idea's that stealing from a Bugs Bunny Cartoons? (Remember Baby Finster?)I predict utter failure(worse than white chicks, If that's possible)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE JOKE DO NOT MAKE A MOVIE","review":"This is an excruciatingly unfunny Wayans adventure, sad when you consider that the SCARY MOVIEs and WHITE CHICKS were funny if not great filmmaking. Courtesy of digital enhancing, we get Damon Wayans head on a real midget's body, enabling him to play a small crook who passes himself off as a baby in order to retrieve the diamond he hid in his future mommy's purse. Flatulence jokes, kicks and knocks in the groin provide the basis for most of the comic attempts and it's hard to believe anyone couldn't see that Marlon is no means a baby. Audiences however were expected to accept it for the fun of it. But truth is it isn't much fun. Brother Shawn plays the wannabe daddy with a simpering Kerry Washington as his workaholic fiancee. The funniest sequence involves a cameo by Molly Shannon as the soccer mom from hell, and that's too short to make an impact.For fans of Wayans or low brow humor only."},{"rating":"2","title":"You go, little man","review":"What makes this film fun is the character Calvin, the little man. The special effect is very well done and Marlon Wayans is very effective at being tough and vulnerable in the role. What makes this so much fun is that Calvin is an underdog; he is a tough guy in a small body who learns love by pretending to be a child. He also learns that he can even the playing field for others who need a little help in life. Not quite as creative as \\"White Chicks\\", but there are genuine laughs and the end is surprisingly satisfying. The Wayans brothers are so creative. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzz please wake me was it funny","review":"this movie sucked ! it sucked it sucked it sucked it sucked the wayan family you suck at acting give it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"stop that baby, I mean...","review":"Little Man is a really funny movie. The midget was hysterical all the way, and there was never a dull moment whenever he appeared on screen. I know many people don't care for this style of comedy, but come on- it's just innocent fun. Not every comedy film that gets released has to feature some groundbreaking new style. It was almost scary how believable it was seeing the midget dress up and act like a baby. I think it's perfectly alright to watch this film and there's nothing wrong with laughing at the storyline. It's cheesy, yes. But it's not awful, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil Man","review":"The Wayans can't do no wrong in my eyes. At least they take risks.

Poo-poo. Doo-doo. I have more respect for pornogrophers and drug dealers than these Wayans Brothers at this point. You can imagine them as part of a top secret organization whose soul purpose and ultimate goal is to make mankind dumber. Everytime you laugh while watching one of their movies, assuming you laugh while watching one of these things, a small part of your mind dies forever. Doo-doo."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never miss seeing a Wayans Bros. film","review":"What I do not think that a lot of people are understanding is that it's not a real boy actor with real good makeup on. It's a Wayans brother and trick photography they use to make him look little.I didn't get that at first so I was sorta creeped out, because I had a cousin who had a baby and the baby had an old man face and even when the baby grew up it still looked like one of them old-fashioned men you see sometimes in photos from the Civil War.I have a cousin name a Rimmy Jo Buckles and she lives in Fayetteville and one time she was watching a Wayans Bros. movie and she said she laughed so hard that Diet Mountain dew came out her nose. What was funny is that she was drinking a lemon lime powerade at the time and while the colors are similar I can assure you the taste is not.Anyway, you should see this film if you like funny stories and then you'll have something to compare and contrast against this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's In Living Color reunited and Brittany Daniels feels so good.","review":"This comedy was fair in my opinion. It had an original idea which I enjoyed and contained relatively humorous scenes of physical comedy. The exceptional points which could convince you to buy the movie on Blu-ray are. The picture is 50% better than normal DVDs. The sound is 100% better than normal DVDs. This Blu-ray Disc has a lot of extra features including a striptease excercise class led by, of course, Brittany Daniels. Look for the In Living Color cast members dotted through out the movie also a couple from Friday."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's supposed to be stupid-funny!","review":"This is more in the realm of Dumb and Dumber-type comedy, but I enjoyed it and actually laughed a lot. I caught this on cable and wasn't enthused after seeing White Chicks, but gave it a chance. I immediately saw the parallels to the old cartoon, but I wasn't offended by it. I watched it with my wife and her Stepfather and we were all laughing our heads off. I see that a lot of people are panning it, but I think it has value. I'm glad silly comedy is still being made like this - otherwise we just have romantic comedy - not that there's anything wrong with that! ha ha... I would say it's more of a guy-movie, so word of warning there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This movie really stinks! I would not recommend it to anyone. Really stupid and short on plot.

Judging by this one no.This movie was dull with obvious cheap Humor.Little Man was a Big Disappiontment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooooooozearoni!","review":"This movie was a real snoozefest! Super boring, and super non-funny. I would recommend renting the DVD, and then not watching it. It's that bad. The time you don't waste watching it, would be worth more than the amount you paid for the rental, so you would come out ahead.Trust me! It stinks!MC White said: Suck it up, cuz it sucked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie won't win any Oscars...","review":"... but that doesn't mean it isn't a funny film. It's not as well-written or cutting-edge as Clerks II, but it still provides the viewer with a lot of laughs, especially if you enjoyed the Wayans Brothers' work on the first two Scary Movies and their woefully short-lived sitcom a few years back.This is the type of comedy film you go to just for an escape. It isn't grounded in reality nor does it present humor that makes you think. It's something you watch, knowing full well it's only there for you to laugh at.Personally, I'd take this raucous yet little-promoted movie over overhyped \\"star-studded\\" comedies like The Break-Up and You, Me and Dupree any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 3.5mm ports!!!!!","review":"unfortunately I could not give a 0 star rating.After waiting forever for this thing to finally be delivered I soldered it on screwed it back up and went to finally plug it in the port to find that it only goes about 3/4 of the way making it useless for the entire purpose intended.I thought this one may have been faulty but I ordered 2 so i tried to plug the second one in and sure enough it was the same thing.If you plan on buying this to replace a faulty headphone jack or any other similar component using 3.5mm stereo connector save your self the trouble and chose another brand!All an all i'm a very unsatisfied customer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not 3.5mm","review":"not sure what size this headphone jack is but it is slightly larger than 3.5mm as it does not fit in my computer or iPod jack. i confirm the previous reviewers review just wish i had seen it before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip broke after 4 plug ins","review":"The Connector worked fine and soldered nicely but 1 plug the tip stayed inside my pc and its hard to get out and the connector broken.

Googled it and in two seconds saw they were first made in sixty-seven.That was the end of the book for me. To me it puts into question any and all facts I expect the author to have checked. Besides again, it just was a bit far fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"It's rare that I find a book so terrible that I write a review about it, but this book just sucks. Maddie is annoying and her brothers are ridiculous. And clearly the writer or the publisher didn't bother with a copy editor -- mistake after mistake after mistake. I'm very, very glad I didn't pay for this. If I had, I would have demanded my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe bother if you can get it for free...","review":"The book had potential as a good poolside read on a lazy Sunday, and it started off fairly decent. By about 1/3 through, however, it failed miserably. I downloaded it when it was free, which is why I rated it 2-stars, otherwise I would have only given it a 1-star rating.For the most part, I can suspend disbelief in my readings...that is why we read after all, is to get away from our lives for a few hours. However, every character was completely unrealistic, as was every situation. At the end of the day, I felt like I was reading a 16 year-old's diary of what it would be like to lose her virginity and what she would consider porn.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard porn under the cover of literature","review":"This could have been good literature, the possibilities were there. The younger sister, her protective older brothers and their friend since childhood. The hidden love between the girl and the friend. But writing a good story was not enough for this author. The book is littered with explicit porn written in 10th grade language.

Wish to read more of Chase and Maddie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun read!","review":"I love the way Rita Herron tells a story. Whether she's writing darker books or lighthearted ones like Marry Me Maddie, I always turn the last page feeling happy.

(The first year of the Camaro was 1967.) The story was already dragging, but when something that blatantly wrong pops up in a book, then I don't see the point in wasting my time to read further. I got about 30% through this book before I gave up.. I tried! Another reviewer had a similar opinion, I saw.I have purchased other ebooks by Rita Herron (when they were free), and I do plan on trying to read those. Maybe they're better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"neutral in this corner","review":"What can I say? This is a story of a hero in angst and a tender hearted virgin. The brothers were distracting in their overzealous protection of their sister. It has a very small and under developed plot. For me it was formulatic, if I can coin a word, and predictable.Also, in my opinion, the Savannah setting could have been more utilized. Having said that, I confess to a love of fiction where the setting almost becomes a supporting character. The references to bayous and voodoo were a bit confusing for me . But I am not very well traveled so what do I know from low country or bayou?It was free. I consider that to be a generous offer. It appears that many people are enjoying this book. Try it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Finish It","review":"Really surprised by the positive reviews for this book. I usually enjoy books that have sibling dynamics but the 3 brothers in this book went way over the line from the normal over protective. They question a 23 year old women when she goes out on a Friday night and completely dismiss her having a career. Honestly I had to check the publishing date because I thought it was 20 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"What a fun read!

Can't wait to read more from this author, and the rest of this series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"What's up with all the great reviews? I couldn't even finish this book. The brothers were just too over the top. I hated them all. Stupid, aggressive, narrow-minded men. When I stopped reading, the hero wasn't much better. A trouble maker who seemed to only have good looks going for him. The attempts at humor were lame. Even Maddie wasn't much, although in her way she was likable. But why such a smart woman would cow-tow to her dumb brothers and adore a less than brilliant man is a mystery to me. I'm sure glad I got this for free. Sorry Maddie, but you'd have been better off telling all those men to kiss off and pursuing a career somewhere far away. Hopefully you'd have met someone with half a brain to fall on who was sexy to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"These don't work","review":"I purchased these as replacements for the foam covers that came with my Shure E2c. First of all, there is no way to tell which size you need, since there is nothing to tell you whether the original set was small, medium or large.Still, I thought if I compress the foam enough, any size will probably work.Guess again. The core of these foams, which fits over the plastic rod on the earbud, is too big. Regardless of how the foams fit in your ears, they will not stay attached to your earbud.The item isn't expensive enough to bother returning, and I suppose I'll have to take a chance on the medium-sized replacement foams now. Very frustrating and very poor customer service on Shure's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Many Follow This One...","review":"This is the first of Bob James' contemporary jazz efforts. The title is somewhat misleading, given the fact that Bob had recorded two trio albums under his own name in the early '60's. During his tenure at CTI, he worked as arranger and sideman to many of that label's top artists. With ONE, he was thrust into the spotlight. \\"Valley Of The Shadows\\" has a macabre feel to it (its ending using \\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\"). \\"In The Garden\\" is an elegant, \\"down home\\" version of the Pachelbel Canon. \\"Soulero\\" features fellow CTI labelmate Grover Washington, Jr., and an organlike Rhodes solo reminiscent of Johnny Hammond. \\"A Night On Bald Mountain\\" is pure hard-driven funk. The big hit is his rendition of \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\", which uses the same rhythm section as Roberta Flack's version. ONE closes with the floaty yet earthbound \\"Nautilus\\". Kudos to ONE and the many excellent albums to follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No flats yet!","review":"It's a bike tire, not too much to get excited over.

Ambleside Online provides links to download the book for free, and an internet search would surely provide the same. The ONLY reason to purchase this book rather than just downloading it would be to have a linked TOC, proper formatting, and the pictures.Basically, Amazon took two minutes worth of time to download the free online text, then decided to sell it for a ridiculous price (considering what it lacks). Save your money and just download the text for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impresively Comprehensive","review":"While I do not agree with everything the author asserts about teaching methodology, I doubt there is any other book on the market that is as comprehensive as this one. What other textbook can be used with equal effectiveness in both kindergarten and high school? Lessons are short and easy to follow. It covers almost everything including agriculture, wildlife, geology, astronomy, etc. Marine life and oceanography are not included. Some minor flaws. For example, the author confuses selective breeding with evolution theory.

His style has changed a little. He is some what more laid back now, but he was always true to the rap game. Check out the early years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the real Jay Z","review":"This is his best work- the beats are tight and his rap with Biggie is just dope- his new stuff can't hold a candle to this CD- get it- it is more like the old school rap of the late 80's.

It has some of the best episodes. As for Kramer, don't listen to the media hype. What happened was wrong, but it's not a big deal. He's not a racist. It was just some dialogue that went wrong, AT A COMEDY CLUB...like that never happens? Everyone is guilty of offending someone in their life...probably on multiple occasions. I am so sick of these \\"perfect\\" people in the news business that never have a slip of the tongue. And what about all the black comedians that trash whites in their jokes? If you are sick of this hypocrisy as I am, then buy this DVD. I may buy 2 copies to show my support for Kramer and the show.This is also Larry Davids last season (check Curb Your Enthusiasm). The show was better with him behind the wheel. The two seasons after this one are well worth owning, but you can tell that Larry is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon ships damaged product","review":"I gave the DVD five stars, as the show is great, there is perhaps nothing I can add to the previous reviews. However, take note that Amazon has been sending me \\"new\\" DVDs that appear clearly used, with the packaging completely damaged. I recommend the whole series to everyone, just do yourself a favor and buy it elsewhere, or pay half price to get a used item sold as used.The first time (another Seinfeld DVD) the packaging looked only slightly damaged. Perhaps someone dropped it once before packaging, I thought. This time, however, the box that contains the four discs was torn along one of the edges, and all corners of it were damaged. It looks like someone played soccer with it for a while.It is a shame that Amazon sells discs in such condition.Note that once you take the DVDs out of their plastic wrap (I had to before I could see the box is torn), you can get back at most fifty percent of the original price, making it worthless to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best Comedy of all time.","review":"I own all the Seinfeld DVD's - Every Season - My only regret is there's not more.If you liked the show (and I loved it), you may have missed an episode here and there so now you can see them all and go back to the good old days of real funny TV. A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word.

It still warms up slowly, still toasts WILDLY unevenly, still takes up too much space, still has slots that can't accommodate thick bread or wide bread, and now even the ticking of the timer has begun to get on my nerves. Probably because I know that after three minutes of listening to it, 1/2 of my slice will be toasted, 1/4 of my slice will be burnt black, and 1/4 of my slice will be untouched by heat.

And it makes any kitchen look cool, just siting there. I also know it's expensive, but I've known people buy several new, lesser toasters in the time I've had my Dualit, so who's saving? If something does go wrong, I can get new bits so I won't have to throw it away, ever perhaps.By the way, it makes good toast too. The best thing is that the toast doesn't pop up, and toast is much crisper if you leave it down (keeping warm) inside the toaster for a minute or two. You can't usually do this with regular toasters.If you are resistant of the price, think again, it's well worth the investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POS - put your money in a pile and watch it burn","review":"Here is why I found this toaster to be a POS:Uneven heat - different slots will brown or burn toast before other slots even warm up.Unmarked controls - who can tell what the control switches do as they are unmarked.Wont fit larger bread - bagels, challah, or large slices wont fit.Entire unit gets too hot - will melt nearby plastics.Bad customer service - try contacting Dualit and see what happens.They wont be there for you as they are laughing all the way to the bank.If you are considering spending $300.00 on a toaster this one isn't it.The Dualit toaster has very poor engineering, poor build quality, bad design, and lacking customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 years and my 2nd Dualit just died","review":"I bought my first Dualit in the 90s.

Because I love the design I bought another. Both were four slice. The first one just stopped working. This one has been sneakier. It has stopped toasting one side on 2 of the slots and stopped entirely on the other 2. Now I'm standing close by and flipping the toast over manually. I don't know if I'm going to buy a third yet.

My wife and son made fun of me every time I used this thing and it mis-toasted....saying, \\"Top of the Line\\". This morning I placed two slices of thin Jewish Rye in the slots, and they jammed along side of the manual flipper. I tried to get them out with a knife, but in doing so, I apparently damaged the wires, and the circuit protector on my outlet blew. Thank God. Now I can buy a new one. Will not repurchase Dualit.

Also, the slots are not wide enough for rye and country breads and sliced bagels. Harry Potter couldn't get a sandwich into the optional sandwich basket that is designed to slide into a slot on this toaster. THE OUTTER SHELL HEATS UP INTENSLEY AT THE SLOTS!!!

The way it is set up, the bread sits with its longest side perpendicular to the counter, so the part of the bread near the bottom of the toaster gets darker than the part that's closest to the top of the toaster.Also, it does NOT have the feature that allows you to toast just one side of the bread or bagel, as some of the more sensibly priced toasters on the market do. In fact there are no bells and whistles at all.Yes, it doesn't get hot on the outside, but neither do many of the others at the lower price points.I cannot recommend this toaster unless you just want to throw your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt Toast From the Get-Go","review":"Thought I would invest in a high quality toaster to replace my $20 Sunbeam.

Nicola Ferris is a secretary at the British Embassy in Athens and she takes off for some R & R on Crete, little knowing that her vacation will bring adventure and danger and of course romance. My only quibble with this book, as well as with other Mary Stewart romance/mysteries is that the heroine tends to depend on her male friend a little too often and also gets rather weepy on occasion.

The Sheherazade piece has the usual annoying anti-climactic feel to it, but also moments of brilliant and intriguing music. Other interesting pieces of music are interpolated between parts of the Sheherazade. The program overall seems a bit random, but all the music is well interpreted. The most intellectual piece is the opening Mozart Barber of Seriglio overture, after which the classical music equivalents of ear-candy and fluffy marshmellow music take over, but overall the music is intelligent and well-interpreted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dremen got hosed","review":"Financial crises finally got Dremen.

I agree with contrarian investing, so this book is an essential read if you're a novice, in school, or maybe just starting to risk capital, but not recommended for experienced professionals. A plus is that the book offers practical advice and real life examples, but it is somewhat dated since it was written pre-Internet crash.

Aka buy value index funds, which I don't don't disagree with, but I did not have to read 400 page book to figure that out. And where is all the Psychological stuff, he as no solid info on behavior investing.

With this latest endeavor, it seems that his simplisitc opinions on investing still abound. I found the book condescending and trivial at points where the author seemed to prefer trashing his competitors rather than proving an investment point. The chapter that encourages people to steer away from all NASDAQ companies was actually a bit frightening. Where would we be without Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco, just to name a few stellar companies that call the NASDAQ home? It can also be argued that many of the studies shown in his book are either not statistically significant or are ambivalant. The old saying, \\"With statistics you can prove any point\\" is quite true with this book. While Dreman may have been a succesful investor, I found myself fighting to complete this book before his self-praise became too overwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad marketing ploy to revitalize washed out career.","review":"If you have read the author's old books, you may find yourself thoroughly disappointed in an amendment to some very old work.

Instead he repeatedly shows tables and charts that seem to have come from a random number generator."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Read","review":"I pretty well agree with the other reviews. One thing I found somewhat contradictory was that Dreman gives Graham and Dodd (and fundamentalists) bit of serve in the methods that don't work section.

The book picks up where it left off from the previous one, but this book seems to have no central plot other than to set it up for the next book. For instance, in the previous book, at least they were chasing Harker (the killer), and the sub-plots and other character development merged well with the central plot; in this book, it just merely describes/continues with the sub-plots and character development, but nothing else. I just felt that it left me wondering what I didn't already know before reading this book. Koontz could have easily merged this with the first book, or the next one, which I hope is more interesting.

I was completely enthralled by book 1, but found book2 to be disinteresting and contrived. Many of the compelling elements of book 1 didn't carry over to the second installment. I may try reading again to see if I missed something, but for me, the Frankenstein series ended after the Prodigal Son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, disappointing reviewers","review":"Really, how does he classify as a racist? Can people read a book? It is a tremendous reworking/continuation of a literary classic. It breathes new life into the old tale and gives it a 21st century spin. It's the same Koontz style that HIS readers have come to enjoy, and that is not a bad thing at all. There are only a two novelists whose works I will continue to read, Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz. As a law student, my time is scarce and Koontz makes reading more than worth my time. However, reading a trilogy in the works is difficult. If you haven't started the series yet, wait until book 3 comes out and read them in quick succession. I can't wait for the final installment. Do not listen to the negative reviewers, they sound jilted for some personal reason and are not being fair critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't Read","review":"I rarely ever read because I get frustrated with how long it takes me to read something because I read at a very slow pace, and I will find myself reading the same sentence over and over again, but I finished this book in under a week. Once I started reading I was completely hooked into it and I only put it down when my vision began to get too blurry to read anymore. This series does a good job of bringing the Frankenstein story into our time and combining it with todays fears about how far is too far when it comes to cloning. I will reccomend this book to anyone who will let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Mr. Koontz!","review":"I came to Dean Koontz's Frankenstein by a long and twisty (and needless to say, dark) road. We could go so far as to call it an Odd road.What I can tell you is this--that while Koontz's Frankenstein is unspeakably more bloody and peculiar than his difficult but touching Odd Thomas books, it is every bit as satisfying a piece of writing. It is a compulsive read, and it tells the truth within the lie of fiction.It is not for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to think about the existence of evil, and if you are willing to believe that there are still people who give up everything to combat it--if you hope that if need be, you might be one of those people--this frightening series set so perfectly in New-Orleans-That-Was is for you.Deucalion--and Cheez-Its!--forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book Two","review":"This book was even better then first.

Like a lot of authors he has gotten so commercialized that his books are becoming predictable and, in this case, an outright rip-off. First we are told this is a second volume that was preceded by a book written by someone else (and certainly not Mary Shelley). Then, to complete the theme we are left to await the final (maybe) resolution in another separate writing. I have experienced this phenomenon twice before; first with Robert Ludlum and then with Steven King. I now know to put down any new offerings from Koontz.

I've never been disappointed...until now. Is this a joke I thought. I had read book one with such fervent enthusiasm as I have all his books. I couldn't wait to get my hands on book two. I thought the first two chapters were simply a refresher but so was chapter 5, and 8 and 24 and 47 and so on and so on.... I skipped paragraphs, then pages, then whole chapters. I've never read a book so fast. If you've read book one, don't waste your time folks. Unless you like sitting through the same picture show twice. I will look for book 3 though but you can bet I'll go find a corner of the store to sit in and peruse a chapter or two or three first before I take it home.

I'm glad I finally gave in, but glad I waited for him to finish the series. I think I read all three books in just as many days, even with working over 40 hours a week. As always, Koontz drew me in with the first page and kept me rolling along through the entire series. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not quite perfect.","review":"This second book in the Frankenstein series is very good, but it gets a little repetitive in some parts, which I found myself scanning through instead of reading every line.

And could not wait for book two, however book two did not have that impact that was expected. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the story and felt that it was written with just one purpose-to build the anticpation of book three, that is why I called it a \\"binder\\". It was written not quite like the first, but provided readers with other characters and how \\"all hell is going to break loose\\". Even after finishing the book, I could not even imagine what the ending will be like in book three. I don't think that you can read book one then read book three, you need to go through book two to fully understand the final conclusion-I think.

This sets up the big plot and conflict that Victor is going to face, and we get to know the characters better in this book. It seems to be taking a very interesting turn and has held my attention very well. I wish there was a better ending to this because it just dropped off.

I understand that this is part of a series, but even so, it should be able to stand on its own as a book. This is especially true since book 3 is not available for 9 months. Disappointing.

However, from the plot, characters, and stytle of this one, it is obvious that he did not write it.The story line (what little there is) is shallow, the characters very predictable, and the little side jokes very juvenile.With no pun intended, Dean, you really need to get yourself a better ghost writer than the character who did this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only bought this to get up to the free shipping costs.","review":"I usually acquire my books from the VA library at the hospital. They have a nice policy of read one, leave one. I would never actually purchase a koontz book anymore unless, like in this case, I needed to pad my purchase amount to qualify for the free shipping. Hence, this book only cost me around $2.00 and so far, through chapter five, it sucks. Don't buy it. Check it out at a library or find it at a yard sale or used book store.

Lumidee's Never Leave You is pretty cool, I wish it had Busta Rimes and Nas's rap remix in it.

I was worried about doing the siding by myself with no one to help me, this product was a real life saver and nearly took the place of another person. It worked really well once i got the hang of it. The Directions should state state however to put the half moon side up and rest the siding on the ark not the flat side! once you make this mistake and nail the siding up you have to take the siding down in order to get the soloSider out for the next piece of siding. (After figuring this out it worked like a charm.

I like using the adjustable feature of this tool. These work well on longer sections of siding but on shorter sections of 4 feet or less they are difficult to remove. One needs to be a little careful during use to avoid damage to the lower edge during tool removal. Do this by rotating the cam away from the lower edge, not into the edge. I use the Solo Sider in conjunction with a set of PAC Tool SA902 siding gauges. The PAC Tool gauges are a lot easier to remove and work well when the reveal is consistent from bottom to top. The Solo Sider works extremely well when the reveal has to be adjusted or when the reveal is inconsistent, together they have proven worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"SoloSider","review":"Excellent tool if you are installing clapboard (hardiplank) by yourself.

I'm doing the work myself and these things have saved me umpteen hours. The best feature is the adjustability. Since I'm replacing the siding I'm simply mimicking the original spacing between courses, and of course that is never exactly 4\\". So, I bring over a 16' span, place them in the hooks and then simply dial the things up or down until the spacing matches the marks from the original clapboards that I transfered to the new corner boards. Nail one corner and then slip the things along as I nail behind them. Presto. Great product, and very nicely made. Solid and expertly crafted. Worth twice the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job!","review":"I bought these to patch some hardboard siding after installing some new windows in my house. Wanted it hard to tell there was any patching at all so tore back the old siding all the way to any joints. This left me with some long pieces, 16 feet, I couldn't hold by myself. After looking around, decided these were my cheapest/best option. They did everything I needed. My overlaps varied quite a bit some times so being able to adjust board to get exactly line up was really helpful. I have 12 inch wide hardboard planks with anywhere from a 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch overlap, some of my pieces were 16 feet long and I had to wedge them under another row of already installed siding.

I found it very useful for the information I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' same 'ol","review":"I got this book out of the library and discovered it is just like every other book on Wicca out there only the author expects that the reader does not belong to a coven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference","review":"A litttle more detailed that Scott Cunningham's version but good all the same.For a beginner I would suggest Cunningham but this one is perfect for a practitioner's library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless wise craft","review":"The book is well presented and informative. Buckland's work is timeless and has stood the test of time. His work is not fluffy and has strong ethics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy & cute","review":"I've gotten lots of compliments on these shoes. They look great with jeans and are very comfortable while still stylish. I wore them for 12 hours while Christmas shopping with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"powa battery charger","review":"I had to send this battery charger back. When I plugged it in, to charge the batteries that came with it, the unit got very hot, too hot to touch. There was also an odor. The batteries did not charge and when I plugged it in again the unit did not turn on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall for the subject","review":"I was impressed by the depth and breadth of the authors knowledge and presentation. It is quite readable and I will use it as a reference for years to come. Some of the advise was related to locale though. I took to heart his \\"stump shooting\\" concept as a fine idea and now that I am scouting and setting up my fall hunts I took my bow and some fields points. A hint from and eastern bow hunter... You'll have a hard time getting those arrows out of a hardwood stump! GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Theological Problems","review":"The major problem with this book, aside from being \\"mindless dribble\\", is that it's not biblically sound theology. In the bible God tells us to look to his word for guidance, not ourselves, not our friends, just his word. She says that there are other ways to Christ apart from the word. Just read the Bible, it will show you God's plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"More drivel","review":"This book is chalked full of nothing but nonsense and false assumptions. I would recommend reading \\"Losing Faith in Faith\\" by Dan Barker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to assist you in your search for God and his purpose for you.","review":"This book helped me out a lot. I have only had this book for a week and a half and I am on my last chapter. I would say that this book really shined some light on areas in my life that needed improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Hear From God","review":"This is a GREAT book, as are most of Joyce Meyers' writings.

A useful and 'real' tool for furthering our Christian walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"someone recently mentioned Joyce Meyer, to my wife. she purchased battlefield of the mind part 1 and 2. she loves it and is talking buying her entire collection, very easy to read as well as inspiring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Joyce Meyer is one of the best by far! She has a way of writing so everyone can understand what she is saying. The Lord really works though this woman for our benefit! Read it, study it and most of all believe it because she backs up everything she says with the Word of God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Joyce Meyer Book","review":"I purchased this book trying to figure out what Meyer would say. As I started to read it I realized that there are a lot of things in my life that I put before God. Hence why I would not be listening. I think this book explains how to listen to God. Joyce Meyer writes her books in such a way that you know you are being taught God's Word in a simple easy to understand way. I would reccomend any of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This book is SO great! I often have heard about people hearing from God, and I never understood what they were talking about. This easy to read, direct and \\"to the point\\", and highly informative book taught me everything I needed to know to trust myself in knowing when I am hearing from God. And that knowledge has greatly enhanced my relationship w/Him. I am so grateful to Joyce Meyer for teaching me how to have a friend in God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and helpful","review":"This book is insightful and very helpful in my spiritual walk. A must read if you are sincere about your spiritual growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This was one of the most powerful books I have ever read. Many of us refer to that \\"little voice\\" inside but even when we hear it, it can be confusing to recognize - Was that really God? Or is that me? How do I know? Joyce walks you through a myriad of ways that God speaks to his people. And she duly backs up each area with scripture. This is an eye opening and extremely powerful workbook for new and seasoned believers alike. I highly recommend it for anyone desiring to walk closer with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone wanting to grow towards God.","review":"I am a baby Christian. I recently was at a Promise Keepers event, and asking a small group from my brother's church how they know when they found God, and how do they know when he speaks? They could'nt really describe it, exept that is is awesome, and that I will know. They reminded me of the verse, \\"Seek and you will find.\\" I later prayed for the passion to seek God and for him to come into my heart. Well 2 weeks later I found this book starring at me in WalMart. I have grown so much in so little time, before and after this book...I think more than some many probably do in a lifetime. I think that between this book and The Purpose Driven Life, and of coarse The Bible...you will grow to spiritual maturaty assuming you have the will."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Joyce Meyer Fans","review":"Divided into two sections: Learning to Listen and Learning to Obey, with discussions questions at the end of each of the fourteen chapters, makes this book a good source for an individual devotional or for a group Bible study. The author uses tons of scripture and real life situations to make her points. This is a good one for any fan of Joyce Meyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great!","review":"I bought this book on the recommendations of others. I found the writing to be childish and not very good. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dessert","review":"We love Warm Delights, They are individual desserts but we usually split one between us. It makes just enough to eat and since none is left over, no over indulging. Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety lets you have a different dessert each day too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite","review":"My daughter while pregnaunt wanted this book for her daughters first books.

If you love to read and love to use clever voices, this ones for you!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic","review":"When I was little this was my favorite book. We would read it over and over, and I would pretend I was struggling to turn the pages that Grover had tied, nailed, and bricked over.So when we had a daughter, this was one of the first books I bought for her. At 2 years old the book sat on the shelves for a while, but she is 3 now, and I recently took it down again to read for her at bedtime. It is now a favorite, we read it every night. I read the pages, then she turns them to give poor old Grover a hard time.One recommendation...this review is for the standard Little Golden Books version, which is great, but we also found a board book version in stores, so the hard pages are great when you have toddlers turning the pages for you every night. They can really 'struggle' against Grover's efforts without hurting the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"grover is ageless","review":"I read this story, \\"The Monster at the end of this book\\" to my daughter 25 yrs. ago, and she loved it.

The book has thick pages and a glossy finish, better than 25 yrs. ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be read over and over and over!","review":"I teach 3 year olds at a Day Care Center and read this book a few times a week. It is a sure way to get them all to sit still. No matter how many times they hear it and by now know the conclusion they sit enthralled. They even know the words and say them with me. I always ask... \\"Should I turn the page\\" and they all yell \\"YES\\". They laugh and giggle and act scared... It's pure joy reading it to them and watching them react! They have special books that we read over and over and over and this certainly is one of them. My book is getting rather thread bare and I'm buying a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Monster at the End of this Book","review":"The Monster at the End of This Book May 21, 2000Reviewer: jkteacher (see more about me) from Yakima, WA Don't order this book! No, don't buy it! ... You already ORDERED it? Oh NO! Now, you're going to have to listen to your toddler giggle every time you turn the page after Grover tells you NOT to turn the page. This is a classic! I read this book to my son, Mark, when he was a toddler. He's 23 years old now and I know he'd remember the story as if it were yesterday. He loved interacting with the character, Grover, as though Grover were right there inside the book talking to him.

It was my son's favorite book in 1978-1930. But, when it arrived (at a premium price) it was only the small Golden Book size. Unfortunately this is a book that needs the large rectangular format. The words and graphics are large. So despite the one I received being an original for that time frame, it was NOT as pictured and it was not the large format. It was too much trouble to send it back, so I stuck it on a back shelf. (I later found a reprint in the original large size with a DVD and for only $10.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoilers!","review":"So it turns out that the \\"monster\\" is actually the protagonist which, while having shades of postmodern antihero angst that wil reverberate strongly with fans of, say, Kafka or Burroughs, really threw me for a loop as a kid.My two year old, on the other hand, has no problem with this conceit, and wants me to read it to him regularly.He'll understand how cruel this all is when he get a bit older.Oh yes.In the meantime, I'll read it for him over and over and over and over, and never get tired of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the book, not interactive","review":"I was disappointed that this appears to only be the book (with words and pictures) rather than an interactive application like my grandchildren enjoy on their parents' Apple iPhone.I loved reading the book to my children when they were little, and think the book itself is wonderful, but after watching the grandchildren engage with the interactive version on the iPhone, it was a letdown to only have a book, and to pay what seemed like full price for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"children","review":"This book is not good.

I bought it for my nephew and now for my 2 month old son. If you're a parent with a sence of humor, and have a child who is developing one, this book is a must have.

This is not one of his favorites nor is it frequently read my house but still this is an excellent book. I think that my son might be a little too young for this book at the moment but I keep bringing it out and reading it to him hoping that he will finally be into this book. The Sesame Street books were favorites when I was a kid so I know they will be for my son too. I recommend that this book be for a child over the age of 2 because at 18 mos this book still has little interest for my son. For young ones try Sandra Boyton books, mouse paint and Winnie the Pooh Sweet Dreams books."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the book, hate the size!","review":"first, I should make it clear that I love this book, it was one of my favorites growing up.

How scary...!) All the other positive reviews are correct: this is a brilliant children's book, every bit as fresh and inventive as the Sesame Street program itself.What's best about this version, as opposed to the board-book or pop-up editions, is the part on the title page, where Grover glances at the indices and mutters, \\"this is a very dull page...\\" and rushes us to the beginning. Also included is the great gag where he makes us go back t the outside cover to confirm that it says there is a (yikes!) monster to the end of the book, each bit setting the tone for this wildly creative, comedic gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"My childhood favorite - great gift!","review":"I purchased this book along with a 14\\" grover doll for my nephew/godson for his first birthday gift.

However, once at 6 months, he started to show more interest & would look at the pages as I turned them - within a few weeks, he was clearly listening to me telling the story, looking at the pictures & turning the pages himself.

Wish I had done that to begin with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So cozy","review":"Love this item! It's so cozy, soft and WARM. Great for long walks in the stroller. My daughter seems to love it. Though apparently the brown causes everyone to think she's a boy - she's got pretty long hair and very petite, so that doesn't happen unless she's in this bundle me...very weird if you ask me! But it's a nice color and, like I said, warm and soft. Just what it should be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I love this bundleme; its soft, warm and fits perfect. no more need for a million blankets or heavy coats or snowsuits. And my son has tons of room to grow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This has worked out well for us","review":"Our 18 mo old hates wearing winter coats. We weren't sure she would tolerate the Bundleme, but she seems to have connected the fact that it keeps her warm and when she is warm she is more comfortable. We live in the city so we walk a lot and since she is more comfortable in the stroller, the walks are much nicer (she would get cranky when she was cold probably not even realizing that was the problem - she won't wear hats or mittens either!). So the Bundleme has been great for us.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Option for Cold Weather","review":"I love this product just as much as I did the infant bundleme. It is perfect for walks in the cold weather!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"Don't be fooled! This carseat cover is no where near weather proof. That's not to say it isn't a nice product. I do like it much better than any other cover I've found. It does keep my 3-month-old nice and warm, however, the flap that goes over her head is not secured by anything. The wind easily catches it and blows it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snuggle Me Does Just That!","review":"The Snuggle Me does just that! It snuggles up your little one and is perfect for those long, cold walks!! It is doing the job of keeping my precious granddaughter all \\"snuggled up.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"So warm and cute!","review":"I wish I would've had one of these with my first baby! We live in New England where it is COLD in the winter and this keeps the baby so toasty! I can put him in his seat with just regular clothes on and he is as warm as can be. I've also had a ton of compliments on how stylish it is. I love that it's not babyish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"I bought the JJ Cole Infant Bundle Me for my 3 month old daughter. I was tired of trying to bundle her with blankets only to have her kick them off. Coats aren't recommended due to the harness restraint so I searched for car seat covers. I really like this product since it fits in the carset with a soft fleece and covers your baby. I like that the flap allows you to see your baby and cover him/her whenever you need it. The only thing I'm not too thrilled about is that it doesn't seem to fit the inside of the carseat as it shows in the picture. We have the Chicco Keyfit infant seat-which seems to be deeper and a little bigger than other infant seats. Overall, it's a great purchase and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler Bundle Me","review":"This has been a FABULOUS product to have. We use it on our stroller in place of blankets since my son liked to kick them off. It's snuggly, warm, and extremely well-made. I'll try it this winter on his carseat to see how we like it...might save having to use snowpants? Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since sliced bread!","review":"This has been a godsend. Our son was born in Sept. 2009 and we have had this on his carseat since October. We don't have to worry about trying to put him in a coat and hoping to god the straps fit over him. I walk with him daily (even when it's 20 degrees) in his stroller and when we get home he still toasty warm. This is a great product and I plan to buy the toddler version as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Really good item. Baby is snug as a bug and material is really soft. I would definitely rate this item with top marks. It is not water proof -- probably shower proof at most. It does act as an effective wind proof shell."},{"rating":"2","title":"JJ Cole BundleMe","review":"I planned on ordering his but a family member surprised me by purchasing off our registry after my delivery. We are so glad we have it. We live in upstate NY and it gets very cold here. Blanket's are not only a pain but also risky if they move around near her face. The JJ Cole makes it easy for her to stay bundled and warm. She is only 3 weeks old and is still small for it but she will quickly grow into it. I have read other reviews that it doesn't work with the BOB stroller but we won't be putting her in the main area of the BOB until she is much bigger so she would outgrow the infant size by that time. Love the pink, it's so cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits the BOB stroller","review":"This works great in my BOB stroller. I live in Seattle so it's pretty rainy and you can't let that stop you, but I wanted to keep my daughter warm on days when I went to Stroller Strides in nastier weather. It's easy to thread in the straps. The biggest problem is my daughter won't stick her hands underneath it and won't wear gloves, but that's not JJ Cole's fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's perfect","review":"It matches exactly to the color on her bugaboo cameleon..and it keeps her warm and it cleans easily if anything is spilt on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is my 3 rd bundleme. I love these they are stylish, warm and cozy. I love this.color because it matches my stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect cozy travel accessory","review":"This kept my little one perfectly cozy on our trip to NYC in December- much better than piling on coats and blankets. It was easy to use and fit easily into her car seat/stroller. My one issue would be that the folded over bit of the top piece doesn't fasten down in some way. During some gusty winds it kept flying back over my baby's head so I was constantly checking to make sure it was down and out of the way. If we were using it more constantly I'm sure we could find a way to fix this, but otherwise a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy little fleece sack!!","review":"I LOVE this - this has to be one of the best baby products for winter. I live in Texas, so wouldn't think I'd need this, but we've had a cold spell, and this thing is a dream. I bought for our upcoming winter trip to New York, but I'm so glad it arrived early. It's really cozy and I can go for a run or out on errands and my baby stays warm and toasty without overheating. It's super soft and snuggly. My baby is 7.5 months, but long for her age, so I went ahead and got the toddler size. It's a little long, but I look forward to using it for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made -- seams fall apart","review":"JJ Cole in general has poorly made products. The first bundleme I received had seams that were not fully sewn shut. There is no way it could have survived through the first washing. So I returned it and recieved another. Now this second one is doing the same thing after only a couple washes. I don't not have a harsh washing machine. Incidentally, I have their diaper caddy too and the section that holds the wipes collapsed. Poorly made products."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifesaver","review":"This was so good to use in the winter. I could just cover her up and go. On the cold days (20 degrees and below) I did put her in a thin fleece snow suit and I also used this. To prevent cool air from coming through the opening I would just put a blanket over the cover. When we got to daycare all I did was unzip it, while other parents struggled with snowsuits. It fix perfectly over my Graco car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"Great for winter use! Works better in carseat than it does in our strollers (Kolcraft-due to straps in strollers), but it did keep our daughter super warm during Christmas in Park outing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bundle Me Brilliant!","review":"Although expensive, the JJ Cole Bundle Me is a great investment. I receive a lot of compliments on the one I use for our daughter. No more worrying about scraping baby blankets along dirty cars as you maneuver in the garage with the car seat. Our daughter appreciates having less bulk in her seat as well! The Bundle Me is the best quality of car seat covers you'll find. Buying the cheap brands only costs more in the end when you buy the authentic Bundle Me.My only warning: NEVER buy from Target- their return policy is meant to trick the consumer. Even with receipt and tags, their merchandise will not be accepted after 90 days. Buy your Bundle Me from Amazon or the JJ Cole website. Trust me, I've registered for my wedding and baby with Target. We've lost over $500.00 due to their ridiculous return policy. Learn from my mistakes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps baby warm without all the blankets","review":"The Bundle Me is a nice accessory to have during the cold winter months. It attaches very easily to the carseat, and I can leave all the extra blankets at home (except for a light one). This particular model is wind and rain resistant, which is nice for keeping my little one dry. It's a great concept; kudos to whomever invented it!I do have 2 complaints though. First, it's not as effective for younger babies. My daughter is just 7 weeks old, and I don't zip up all the way. This keeps the fabric out of her face. I will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the Bundle Me is a bit more snug around her. Secondly, the zippers aren't as smooth as I'd like them to be. They occasionally catch the fabric on the inside, so zipping up is sometimes more work, and always when I'm in a hurry!But overall, I'm glad I bought this. It's nice having a barrier against the wind, rain and cold with just one item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Washing issues!","review":"I love how it keeps the baby nice and warm!But when I washed it the the Velcro shreds and makes a mess and unable to be used.I have followed the instructions.I returned it thinking it was a defect come to find out the 2nd one did it too! Besides that I did not even dry it! Very upset about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"We purchased the infant cover after constantly dropping blankets or having them blow off the carseat when outside. The JJ Cole has been a good choice. Its very easy to install. Its very cozy. It unzips all the way off if a day turns warmer than when it started, or vice verse. The only downside to this was when I washed it, some of the quilt stitching came undone. It was not major, and I do expect this to last the entire winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE","review":"This product goes under the baby and affects the harness fit. Instead, buy a shower-cap style cover that ONLY goes over the carseat. Don't risk unsafe products when it comes to your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money!","review":"I bought this after reading all the positive reviews so I was a little perturbed that this was a sub standard product. My 13 pound daughter hated it...as soon as I would try to zip it up she would start kicking (and its a little small for her). The zipper makes me think her clothes or skin will get zipped up with the fabric and as u can see by the pictures her little shoulders are bare (it doesn't zip up far enough) wow, disappointed. I would send it back but I threw out the receipt so I swear I will try to use it considering I spent 59.99 on this. I would suggest trying out a friend's or just keep your receipt. It was a good concept but it's a NO GO. buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for car seats","review":"This is great for stroller use but is not safe for car seats at all. It creates way too much space between baby and harness, which can result in baby being ejected in a crash. You can tell it's impossible to get the harness tight enough w/ this in the car seat because if you remove the bundle me and put baby back in there's tons of wiggle room. I wish they would just market this thing for stroller use because it's awesome for that-marketing it for car seat use just seems irresponsible :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Me Bundle Lover","review":"It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on. I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat. I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle. I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out. We just put on her hat and go. The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort. It helps too that it is rain resistant. I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Maclarens","review":"I ordered this for my Maclaren Techno and was very disappointed. It was too big and dragged in the front wheels. I guess it is better, as advertised, for the bugaboo. I was also a little disappointed with the warmth quality. It was not as plush as my infant jj cole bundler. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt fit car seat","review":"Received this as a baby shower gift after I had registered for it. I love it except it doesnt fit. We have a Lamaze 1470 carseat... The elastic strap on the bundle me that is supposed to fit around the back of the car seat comes no where close to long enough to allow the cover to lay flat inside the seat. We then decided to go to BabiesRUs to see if the original bundle would fit. Again it didnt and we had the same issues. Since I had time I then tried it on the Chicco infant seat as well in the store, and it fit the same way on that model. If its used with these careseats it would make the carseat very unsafe. I recommend the JJ Cole car seat cover, which is sold here on Amazon instead..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a warm fuzzy sleeping bag","review":"i love this! easy to fit into britax b-safe car seat, looks warm & comfortable, easy to take the top off if too warm, machine washable. best part is that baby had a poop explosion the other day and most was caught in the bundle me, rather than flowing into the car seat grooves - yuck, but not as bad to clean up as it could have been... my baby is 9 pounds now and fits in it very well - it will fit her for a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not long enough/ does not work with chicco keyfit!","review":"Such a great idea, and very soft and warm, however, does not work for our long little girl in her chicco keyfit 30. This is just more trouble than it is worth, fits awkwardly, and I am constantly having to fish the straps out from underneath, so frustrating! I was hoping to use this all winter, but our 7 month olds feet are jammed into the bottom and she looks uncomfortable. So far the biggest waste of money on a baby product, wish i had purchased something else to serve the same purpose, there are many other options out there. Don't claim that this product is universal- it's not!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but too small","review":"This bundle me is really nice in terms of style and warmth, but it's so small! My son is 6 months old and can't even straighten his legs. (he's tall, but this should fit up to a 1 year old according to the description). We had to return it. They make a toddler version, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voids Carseat Warranty","review":"I bought this for my new Chicco Keyfit 30 seat and all the cold weather we have in the north. Then someone told me that this style of cover (as opposed to the style that fits like a showercap over the top)will void the safety warranty on my carseat. So I called Chicco and they told me not to use this cover with my seat. They gave me a list of other covers they have tested and approved.Too bad they don't make this in an elastic over the top shower cap style, because that material is really nice. It is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit well on the chicco keyfit, but it does keep her warm","review":"I don't know if it fits better on another brand of car seat, but the fit on the chicco keyfit, is all wonky, it doesn't cover all of the top, and it runs quite short. We were up in Conn. during a snowstorm over Halloween weekend recently, and being from VA, i wanted to make sure she stayed warm, so i got some tight and this to supplement what clothes i had with me to keep her warm. It did keep her warm, but it doesn't even go to the end of the car seat on either end, and my husband hates to try and buckle her in with it as he has a hard time find where straps have gone, its a good thing i don't think we will be using it long as shes over 6 months now. I posted pictures because i wanted to see how they fit before buying one initially, and nowhere did i find pictures of them on different brand seats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps baby snug and warm","review":"I purchase this item to use with my jogging stroller. Today was the first day I used it and it actually kept my child warm. The top part does not fit around my stroller but it still works.

Because I had this, I didn't need a coat or snow suit to keep my babe protected from the Minnesota cold. I'd just pop him in here with his regular outfit on and he'd be snug as bug wherever we went. It's also great because it protects your car seat from getting gross if/when the baby spits up etc. The regular bundle me is fine too, i just liked this better because it has a zip pocket on the front which was handy to keep his pacifier in for easy access."},{"rating":"2","title":"JJCole Bundle me JOY","review":"Cool product.

I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well. The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child. And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version. I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made. I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time. The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry. The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"This is a great carrier liner.

Its so much easier than strapping in a baby with a coat or bodysuit. Keeps baby very warm and dry and makes my life easier too. No more adjusting car seat straps depending on what outfit baby is wearing, just throw on a hat and let the bundle me keep him warm. One of the best purchases we have made for our son. When he grows out of the infant size, we will purchase the larger size for next years Michigan winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must have!!!","review":"I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get!

He's now 11 months old and the infant version is too small, so we bought the toddler one for this winter. It's a different material than the infant sack, more velvety than woolly. It fits perfectly in my Uppababy Vista stroller and keeps him nice and warm up to his neck, unless he sticks his arms out. It's a bit of work to put this on the stroller and take it off every time you go out, so I just leave it on always and flip down the top part when we're indoors. The downside, though, is that since the material is really warm he gets heated just by sitting on the bottom half when we're indoors for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Works great when using the brown paper to wrap packages for shipping.

The author explains many of the important things regarding a low-carb lifestyle, but not that well and in a rather bland way. Also the glycemic load table in the book was pretty limited and riddled with product plugs for some obscure brand.If you're looking to learn about low-carb diets I would highly recommend, \\"Living Low Carb\\" by Jonny Bowden.

This famous violin has exceptionally lush sound which cuts through the accompanying orchestra. It has a melodramatic history, having been stolen and recovered, then cleaned very carefully because the man who stole it -- and then played it in nightclubs -- disguised it. The varnish was not disturbed in the cleaning process and the violin emerged with its famously seductive tone intact.

Turns out the book is just a watered down version of Godin's same couple of ideas that he's put in about 10 other books. None of the writing or stories (which were cheesy) were attributed to any of the 33 other \\"authors\\" individually. It's hard to believe all 33 of these well accomplished and opinionated people agreed on these ideas or collaborated in coming up with these light tidbits that have been articulated by Godin in the past. I get the sense that Godin just wrote this book in about two hours, asked a bunch of his friends if he could stick their names on the cover, and sent it to the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the author's book \\"Purple Cow\\" instead","review":"The author's book \\"Purple Cow\\" is a far superior (and recommended) book. There is no unity or theme that prevails among the myriad of chapters in \\"The Big Moo.\\" Reading this book feels as if you're being rushed from room to room for unrelated, brief (and largely poor quality) lectures.

Wentworth and I must say that I was hooked from the beginning. The concept seemed fresh to be, man meets alien conquerors and fails to defeat them. This does not conform to the normal style of military sci-fi that I read. There isn't a whole lot of action, there is some and it is well written. The real catch of the book though is the characters. The Jao are an extremely well thought out race of aliens. They are different enough to not be human but similar enough that they are can be reasoned with to a degree. The aliens have their own culture/society that dosn't always mesh well with human culture/society. Aille, the storys main character, grows and learns from his time on Earth and the people that he associates with. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan and I can't wait till the sequel is released.One more thing, the space battle in the sun's photosphere is super cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many sci-fi books like this one","review":"One of the 10 best I've read - and I've read many. It looks like other reviewers agree. This story seems so much like something that really happened - or could happen - that you feel you are on Earth in an alternate universe.The aliens have invaded, and we lost. But, like humans, they have good guys and bad guys, and they have conflict amongst themselves. The humans have to dig deep to find their courage and ingenuity - and isn't that always so? That we only rise to the occasion when things seem the worst?To learn about the real extraterrestrial intervention check out the Allies of Humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and elevating.","review":"This book is quite an experience. I reread the book several times, it is that well written and that good. It is the best book I have read in years. It is both exciting and elevating.

Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted, extremely detailed","review":"An impressive creation of an alien specie that attacks earth for its own agenda. Both alien and human characters well individualized. Military scenes became extremely tedious for me, but were the main focus of the story. I also tired of the minutiae of the alien social structure. There was so much emphasis on the physical posturing it came across more as superfluous and ridiculous, slowing down plot flow instead of adding anything. Would have been more effective if more secretive instead of a constant presence.

If we can't play any of his DVDs because even if the DVD is completely free of even the tiniest scratch, and we were able to have a completely smooth car ride, and even then, if it can't then be heard, what's the use of it?

Nice control layout. Good information package.Negatives: Poor audio control. The volume is nowhere near enough to use in a traveling vehicle (car, bus, train, airplane, etc.)even with headphones or ear buds. However, the biggest problem is the unexpected power shutdown that can occur anytime in any condition. I found the longest I could play a movie continuously with the a/c adapter attached was 70 minutes and average was about 30. With the battery alone powering the unit it would go 50 minutes max and average 20 and with the car adapter it would go 45 max and 15 average. Leaving it on a table undisturbed or holding it made no difference.

I agree with the other review titled \\"Portable unless you move it\\" -- essentially that's the truth. By the time I went back to Fry's it was outside of the exchange period; I called Samsung, but neglected to ship it back before the warranty expired.

I know alot of people liked this story but it is totally out there. I disliked it terribly.The main protangist turns into a woman under a full moon, once a month that's 12 times a year. But the story only focuses when the chararcter is female, what about the rest of the time and year? Then they get married. The male and female couple. He will be a male 95% of the time yet this is almost ignored.This is not for any Yaoi Fan. Its silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened","review":"Ok i was really disapointed with this one i mean im a fan and i read all of fake wich i LOVED it was a great series. it had everything and very juicy (everyone should check it out) but with until the full moon it did nothing for me i mean the relationship is more about him and the girl wich i dont mind but his relation with marlo was barely their. i mean it was bad the actuall drawings were great and all but i was just disapointed i was expecting much more"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS NOT YAOI, PEOPLE !!!","review":"I'm surprised that people are comparing this to Fake...it IS by the same author but it is NOT yaoi!!!!I would say it's just a story (it doesn't fit into yaoi or shoujo)...It is about Vincent, a vampire and a lady's man, and Marlo, who turns into a woman on a full moon! The story is about how Vincent loves Marlo either way and doesn't care about what other people say. When their parents find out, they decide to let Vincent and Marlo get married -- and that's where all the humor and drama starts :)The story is very cute and the artwork is super...as usual! But it's WORLDS away from Fake -- so don't compare them, please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, not this one :(","review":"Just a warning: If you liked Fake, don't buy this book.This book is often listed under yaoi, because it's about a gender switching, half/werewolf/vampire who is being pursued by a male vampire, so occasionally there is some M/M action, mostly groping. Rare, though. And second volume, don't even think about it. The romance is all between the man and the female version, and that is not something dedicated yaoi fans should have to see, much less waste their money on. Don't listen to anyone who says you'll like this if you like Fake. Sanami Matoh is a goddess for creating Fake... but she is equally dedicated to het stories, so just because it's by her, don't assume it has the same good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genealogical treasure trove!","review":"I kept running into Florence Hepp Peterson's name in my Fisher genealogy research, and thought I'd take a chance and buy her book.

I wholeheartedly agree with much that he has to say and find his enthusiasm refreshing. I was, however, distressed to find several grammatical errors throughout the text (I work as a writer and editor and they just seem to jump out at me!). I'm not sure if these are to be attributed to Kelly or to his editor, but I hope that if the book goes into a second edition that they will be corrected. The errors' presence in the book serves as a distraction from Kelly's message, and sadly, in my opinion, harms his credibility.

Not only is the reasoning childish and undocumented, Kelly also indulges himself in egotistical rants about his pet hatreds or political opinions, including some junk science fat bashing among many others. If you want to know what Catholicism's about, read the Catechism, or check out the \\"One True Faith\\" video series, or Peter Kreeft, or C. S. Lewis (OK, not Catholic, but we've adopted him.)

It is hard to put into words the power of his message, or I should say, Christ's message. I recommend this book to everyone who is Christian or interested in Christianity. And certainly, Catholics should read it if they are at all unclear about their church. Still, it is possible that the title could also be Rediscovering Christianity, because the focus of the book is becoming Holy and finding the only kind of happiness that endures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book All Catholics Should Read","review":"I am a convert to Catholicism and then drifted away and became a lukewarm Catholic. Kelly's book showed me what I was missing, why I should not take the Mass for granted, and why being Catholic is definitely the right choice for me!!

I put off purchasing a standard set of ergonomically designed hex wrenches for way too long. The design makes a lot of sense. For instance, it is sometimes hard to get to tight places on bikes but the heads of these wrenches have a cut a few millimeters from the tip that allows the wrench to articulate so that you can reach into tight places on the bike at an angle. The handle design makes it easy to spin the handle too for quick removal of screws while the opposite end has a long lever arm that allows you to put a lot of torque on a stubborn part. You won't regret buying these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read.","review":"McCullough's Truman is a landmark in American historical biography. Truman, who entered the White House in one of the most critical eras of our nation's history, rose to the occasion and truly executed the office of President of the United States to the best of his ability. Superbly written and researched, McCullough examines the many different aspects of Truman's personality which led him from the battlefields of France in the First World War, businessman and local politician in Missouri, to the White House. Particularly interesting and insightful is McCullough's examination of Truman's early years. Throughout the book Truman's inner world, consisting of his romance with Bess Wallace, is highlighted. An able and astute politician, the life of Harry Truman is a true 'american success story.' Scholarly and insightful, McCullough's Truman is an excellent source for both the professional historian and student."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Biographical Masterpiece","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars. Although a large volume, I couldn't put this book down. McCullough's style flowed well, and the subject was engaging. I never thought I could have much praise for a Democrat, but I have to admit that by the end of the book, Truman had become a man that I now greatly respect. McCullough's treatment of his life is superb, and I found it a remarkable irony that a man of such integrity was supported by such a corrupt political machine. And with the transition from WWII to the Cold War, it became apparent how much Truman seemed to be just the right man for the job at that particular time. The book is remarkable. Well worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History Lesson!","review":"Wow, what a book! Much information about historical events. Truman was a rare man, full of honesty and goodness. Glad he became president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb book!","review":"Having read this book, I clearly understand why it won a Pulitzer: is writing is exceptional. The author does more to help the reader understand President Truman than any other biographer to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman is a True Man","review":"Harry Truman was perhaps the last of those who serve in the public interest not so much as to get their name in the history books as to accomplish something worthwhile. Now we have president's who in their second term are already thinking of their presidential library. This book reads like a novel and tells the story of a common man, a man who failed at so many things yet rose above that failure to accomplish much. It's a great primer (or refresher) on the early days of the Cold War and a fresh look at an American President who once was thought of as below average in intelligence and ability. But, beneath the surface was a man of substance. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced Biography","review":"David McCullough writes well but tends to leave out the negative aspects of his subject's personality traits. Truman was impetuous and suffered from feeling that the Presidency was too big for him. He permitted himself to be dominated at times by small town friends with their petty influence peddling. Truman never took complete control of the office to demand personal integrity of subordinates nor did he demand high quality performance from them. The fact that he got it from some people reflects the awe that the Office of the President imposes on those selected to serve. Truman's sense of his own \\"smallness\\" resulted in smearing his time in office with charges of corruption laid against his associates. McCullough avoided discussion of this aspect of Truman's personality and the important influence on his ability to govern.McCullough did the same with his John Adams' biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Valentine to Truman","review":"Well researched and very readable, McCullough has produced the best biography of Truman yet published. McCullough's narrative is rarely critical of Truman's actions, but he's such a great story teller that you hardly notice. For readable biographies, this book is second only to Robert K. Massie's \\"Peter the Great.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"This is the third biography of Truman and the second biography by this author that I've read. I considered that he did a notable work with \\"John Adams\\". This is hardly a biography; it's a worshipful piece. If one has interest in a more objective view of the former president, by all means find another biographer. This book is far too long, going into minute details about trinkets Truman had around him in his office, an almost endless travelog of his !948 whistlestop campaign, repetitive adoration about Truman's concern about his appearance, his odd relationship with the four women closest to him, his firm decision making, to name a few. Truman apparently left a profuse \\"paper trail\\", and the author was content to select that which exhalted this president. Negative comments and events are briefly mentioned, if not dismissed. Unless one loves Truman at the outset, this biography is a monumental waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and misled","review":"I wanted to see McCullough's writing style, and his books are very expensive for Kindle. So I chose Truman for 1.99. It's not the whole book. It says nothing about being just a chapter(oh it does say that at the top of the page). I feel like I've been ripped off. I've definitely been misled. Things that are excerpts should be clearly noted. The illustration is for the book, so I assumed I was buying the whole biography. Other formats such as CDs show if they are abridged on the order lines; Amazon should also clarify that for Kindle editions-also on the order lines so it is obvious what you will be receiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased","review":"I commented on the \\"Adams\\" book, by McCullough as being too biased to be good history and should be taken with a grain of salt. I am becoming bitterly disappointed in McCullough, as a historian. I am now reading \\"Truman\\", by Mc, and find the same thing! McCullough, a liberal, falls in love with his liberal subjects. This makes for very, very bad history. I have a recurrent mental image of Adams and Truman walking hand-in-hand, McCullough in the lead, over the waters into a golden sunset. I am only to page 300, I will try to add another entry upon completion I think this book is BIASED,BIASED,BIASED.Very bad history."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ALL THE CDs WERE INCLUDED","review":"I HAVE WRITTEN AMAZON BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLY.

Why should this version be more expensive than the paperback version? Do megabytes cost that much more than paper? Maybe I'll just take the book out of the library so that no one makes money on my reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed the book - it's very long but very interesting","review":"It's reeally interesting to read about how things are still the same as they were in the 40's - we're still tackling the same issues and the same bitter partisan divide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man and a country grow into roles on the world stage.","review":"\\"Truman\\" is a fantastic biography and story. McCullough's choice of Truman as his subject was inspired. In writing a chronical of the man's life, he masterfully traces the United States' often reluctant emergence onto the world stage as a superpower. Harry S. Truman and the United States both begin this tale with no idea of the prominence that is in store for them. Both struggle with their acceptance of what their new roles require of them. Finally, both rise to the occasion and surpass expectations in their given role.The book features McCullough's trademark, history written in prose that makes it as engaging as fiction. Anyone interested in biography or in the history of the United States should invest the time in this one. At 1,100 pages, it will take time, but it never feels long or tedious. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman/McCullough, now That's a Winning Ticket!","review":"David McCullough is one of the best writers IN American history and OF American history. Harry Truman was certainly an excellent President. Together, they make an unbeatable team! At 992 pages, this book seemed initially daunting. However, upon conclusion, I found myself yearning for even more. This writer, this President, this book, has my vote for all-time favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Memories","review":"I enjoyed the book because I remembered many of the famous names and events of the time. As with all of David's books it was well researched and graphically detailed. I felt that the details were a bit overdone leading to its unbelieveable length of nearly a 1000 pages. But it was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman Brings Back Political Optimism","review":"Today I completed \\"Truman\\" and I have got to say that it is the most fantastic biography I have read! Harry S. Truman is presented, warts and all, and the author gracefully allows us to judge for ourselves. The book reads like a novel, yet as a devoted reader, I wanted to read slow--sipping it like a fine bourbon. Unlike some of our more recent presidents, Harry S. Truman is someone who stands by his decisions no matter which way the Gallop wind is blowing and allows history to judge him. That is the true measure of presidential character and Truman stands with Washington, Jackson, Lincoln, and Teddy as a statesman who embraced these qualities. Hopefully some young man or woman can read this book, and believe again that anyone can be president, as long as you stand by your convictions and stay loyal to your friends and to yourself. I am not a fan of most 20th Century Democrat presidents, but I am now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman","review":"Most complete picture of Truman and his relationship with other historic characters that I have ever read. Certainly one of McCullough's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is my favorite McCullough book, and I have read nearly all of them. I grew up brainwashed into thinking Truman was a terrible president. This book has me believing he may have been the best leader we've had! Like all his work, DM has done a thorough job of researching his subject and presenting it in an interesting and enjoyable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give 'em Hell, Harry!","review":"Wow what a book. Not only are we given insight into his achievements and failings, we get to know the man in many indepth ways. I'm only about half way through the book (on Kindle) because I lost my recharging cord on a trip and had to re-order. Can't wait to get back to it. Anyway, I love the way he persisted in courting Bess, finally winning her over; he was quite the romantic and the most faithful of all the political giants I've read about. I had never learned that he was noted for his bravery on the battle field and a beloved leader of his men in World War I--this was interesting to me and it explained some of his actions as President of the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great portrait of American history","review":"A superb portrait of American history, full of atmosphere ranging from the XIX century's race to the mid-west to the XX century's politics. Maybe a bit hagiographic, but dense of history and men who did the history in the XX century.No doubts one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Download is Bad","review":"Kindle edition is missing several pages. Amazon said they fixed it . I reloaded it after deleting the bad copy and problem still exists. I am returning it and borrowing a friends hard copy to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plainly Speaking...","review":"McCullough's textured crescendo is so penetrating and readable that I would caution those of you seeking insights into leadership that you may find yourselves becoming a bit out of sorts... Truman embodies the kind of leadership so profoundly absent in contemporary American politics, and his trajectory is a progression through an era whose character and depth flies in the face of modern-day pop culture. I found myself at once both feeling better prepared as a student of history and aspiring leader, and melancholy at the remote prospects of ever seeing this type of personality in our political landscape again...Nonetheless, I consider it a must read. Forewarned is forearmed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype!","review":"An astonishing achievement, this book captures the life and times of an outstanding President and fascinating man. Everything is in here -- excitement, global drama, even romance. Absolutely an unforgettable book about an unforgettable, humble man of tremendous character. There isn't a dull page, and you can't help wishing Harry (or at least someone like him) were around in Washington today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great audio book too","review":"Although there is much left out of the abridged audio book, it partly makes up for it by including actual audio of some of Truman's speeches and even one melodramatic speech by Douglas MacArthur. The audio book focuses most on his early life, military career, the atomic bomb, his race with Dewey, and the Korean war. Unfortunately much of his private life, Israel, and the birth of the UN/NATO is short changed.What never ceases to amaze me about American History is how it repeats itself. The Korean War was the \\"wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time\\". Truman had to make tough decisions between taking North Korea and extending the Chinese conflict. Now NK is one of the most dangerous countries in the world, but would it have been worth the cost to finish the job as MacArthur wanted?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I never realized","review":"This is an eye opening book. The number of events and issues that he handled are mind boggling, and set the future path of the country in ways I never realized. He is one of our great presidents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom's book","review":"Arrived quickly, great price, all interested in History want this.This is a book cokkector's item, and a really great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman.","review":"What is not to like if written by McCullough? Anything he writes is first class. It is very educational and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally Poor Quality For Papareback Binding","review":"The book was great, and the author was most worthy of the Pulitzer Prize award for his work. However, the binding was exceptionally poor. Given the 1,100+ pages of the book, this paperback needs to be bound in a different fashion. The book completely fell apart during my reading of it, as large sections of pages fell out of it. I did not subject the book to any harsh treatment or unusual wear, and it simply fell apart under normal reading conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titillating hagiography for the popular culture","review":"A mass culture entertainment devoid of intelligent critical analysis"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too long, too meticulous, too detailed","review":"i am required to read this book for my high school american history course. i must say that i am terrified of this book, and i simply cannot bring myself to read it pleasurably. i put off reading it as long as possible; it is so boring, and i absolutely cannot remember all those details. i do believe that the possiblilty of my enjoying this book exists, with the sole exception being only if it were much shorter. but perhaps i am a bit too young to be able to fully appreciate President Truman and his life; whatever the case, i severly wish there were cliff notes to this book. i would not recommend reading this book unless you have absolutely nothing left to do with your time, or you just like to torture yourself. and to teachers out there: please, for the mental sanity and good health of your students, please do not require them to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Still reading. Only 10% read. So far it's an excellent read. It began with more detail about Harry's pre-generations which, to me, was pretty uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give 'em hell, Harry, was more than accurate.","review":"David McCullough renders a fine portrait of Harry Truman. IMO this country has possibly had only two great Presidents--George Washington and Harry Truman.I think Lincoln meant well, but it might have been better to let the Southern states go.Theodore Roosevelt's contribution of National Parks is nice, of course.FDR's New Deal had its merits, but Eleanor was likely the better humanitarian.JFK did not last long enough to really make a difference, and RFK was killed before he had any chance to get in office.So, I will hold my opinion that George Washington and Harry S. Truman were the two that made the mold..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The (2nd) Greatest President of the Century!","review":"The second Greatest President of the 20th Century and the Greatest Political Biography. One word describes both: Truman.Truman the man embodied all that is good in American politics - providing leadership both domestically and internationally when both were in desperate need for it and a personal life that exuded decency and integrity.Truman the book, by David McCulloch validates Emerson's maxim that \\"There is no history, only biography\\". Incredibly well crafted, McCulloch's book at times reads like a novel. A well-deserved recepient of the Pulitzer Prize, \\"Truman\\" is a great read for even non-history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Biography","review":"This is the best biography I've ever read, and I've read many. My favorite part of the book is its lessons in leadership and decisionmaking. Truman walked up to the worst kinds of problems, faced them squarely, sought advice from his advisors, thought carefully, and then made prompt decisions based on the merits as he saw them. He knew he might occasionally err, but he was paid to decide, and once he decided he never looked back. He moved on to the next problem. No agonizing, no focus groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Harry Truman the man, the myth - this book has it all. This is a wonderfully written biography that gets at every aspect of Truman. From his boyhood in Missouri to his rise through the political ranks David McCullough does not dissapoint with his book on the former president.A must read as a companion to any serious study on World War I, II and Korea - Truman's life touches all these conflicts as a soldier and leader. This is a great biography and I highly recommend it. JVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Very much enjoyed reading this book on whom I thought was a great President. He was. McCullough's writing is excellent.Truman faced a lot of crises and handled them very well.Despite length, the book was a page turner for me. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in History"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!","review":"McCullough brilliantly brings Truman to life as he woven the 19th century and early 20th century together. Truman's amazing rise to power, was told in simple, clear language, with excellent sources. The cast of characters in Truman's life from Pendergast to FDR to McArthur leapt off the pages.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in the man or the times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Hardback","review":"The book itself was a winner - a gift for my husband. He \\"devoured\\" it. The only disappointment was how cheaply and poorly-bound the paperback was. Even with extreme care, it fell apart within the first 70 pages. The replacement nearly made it to the end, but not quite. Buy and read this book, but go for a better-bound version unless you like handling it in pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman Fires MacArthur","review":"Harry S. Truman, in my opinion, was one of the best Presidents this country has ever had. He made a lot of tough decisions with the philosophy \\"The Buck Stops Here\\". He didn't back down from what he believed was right for America. Even with the dropping of the bombs in WWII, that incident brought many troops back home to their families and sent a clear message to the enemy. He handled the insubordination of Gen. MacArthur the only way he could have. Take him out of his command and show him that he was not in charge of this country. I shudder to think of the American soldiers lives that would have been lost had he been allowed to continue his war efforts. God bless you Harry S. Truman. You brought my dad home to me. I will be eternally grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman","review":"For those who like biographies and history of United States individuals Truman is an excellent read. McCullough kept me interested the entire book with his detailed description of people and events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written portrait of President Truman,","review":"Well written portrait of President Truman, a fascinating character, the almost \\"accidental\\" President who turned out to be imperfect, but over-all, one of our better Presidents (and I am reviewing this as a Tea Party Conservative!) McCullough is, as always, highly detailed and full of interesting facts. For example, did you know that when Truman was a young \\"nobody\\" working as a bank clerk in in Kansas City, he roomed with another \\"nobody\\" named \\"Arthur Eisenhower?\\" Yes, the brother of you-know-who."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Man who Said What He Thought","review":"Truman was president during my first 5 years. I grew up in a Republican household and seldom heard a kind word about him. This biography does a good job describing where he came from and what he did. And yes, he just may have seen more change in his life than any other president.I came away believing that he was an honest man who tried, and usually did, a good job of running what had became the most powerful nation in the world during his years of national service.This is a well written biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written book about President Truman","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in American politics.

Just an excerpt. I thought this was a full book and very disappointed and upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character","review":"The character of Harry Truman showed through in this book by David McCullough. Although I might not agree with Harry Truman's politics and I certainly cannot admire the era of the political boss, it is clear that Truman rose above this and consistently did what he believed to be in the best interest of the country. He was an honest man. This is unusual in politics and even more unusual in the Democrat Party."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding review of an undervalued POTUS","review":"This is an exceptional biographic work on one of the most important US presidents of the 20th Century. It is a useful narrative not just on Harry Truman personally, but moreso on the critical decisions that were made in the aftermath of World War II that set the stage for the fall of communism fifty years later. Although approaching 1,000 pages in the softcover edition, the narrative definitely piques your interest and sends you back to amazon.com seeking additional works on Truman, George Marshall, and Dwight Eisenhower."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only biography that made me cry.","review":"I had no idea that biographies could be this compelling. It left my heart aching, wondering if we will ever see a person of such integrity and sincerity in politics again.

HE MUST HAVE HAD MORE FLAWS THAN EXPOSED. HE LIVEDTHROUGH SOME TRYING TIMES. AND PERFORMED BEYOND EXPECTATION.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece.","review":"McCullough is the finest writer of his genre today. If the amazing popularity of his John Adams' biography wasn't enough to convince you of his skill, this book certainly will. The research is impeccable, the detail intricate and the style so readable that the nearly 1,000 pages go by in far too short a time. I had read Hamby's Truman and nearly choked on it, but I am glad I gave HST another look, because his story, as told by (an admiring but balanced) McCullough makes a great case for the comment that Harry Truman was exactly the man the Founding Fathers had in mind when they put their faith in the future of our popular government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry S. Truman brought honor to the presidency","review":"Having read and enjoyed several David McCullough books I was at first intimidated by the 1,000 page size of this tome. But in usual McCullough style it was a real page-turner (for three weeks) and I could not stop except to work and sleep until I had finished. This is a truly intriguing story about Harry S. Truman and his presidency. Numerous other reviews on the site can give you a review of the content and I will not repeat that here but assure you this is a story well worth your time to read. It puts the likes of William Jefferson Clinton to shame. We as Americans could not do much better than to elect the likes of Harry Truman to the highest office of the land. I do not subscribe to the Democratic liberal philosophy and certainly would disagree with much of Harry Truman's \\"Fair Deal\\" legislative programs, but indeed he was a great President and even greater American. Do not let the 1,000 page size keep you from enjoying this must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you do not have time to master all 1,120 pages, listen to the audiobook","review":"As a 40-year-old, I never knew Truman nor knew anything of his impact, that is, beyond his decision to use the bomb against Japan. If I were given a test where I had to name the presidents of the 20th-century, I would probably forget Truman -- and Hoover.So, what a tragedy it would be if I neglected McCullogh's Truman, because I did not have time to read the book. Thank God for the audiobook.Unlike the \\"Adams\\" audiobook, the Truman audiobook is abridged. The edits were beautifully handled, so that the \\"story\\" of Truman comes through so eloquently. McCullough, as we all know, is our great American storyteller.Having now learned more about Truman, I have such an admiration of the man - and his presidency - that he must now rank among the Top Three of the 20th century. Truman is the extraordinary one, and Kennedy is the mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Man in a Dirty Business","review":"Captures the dirty part of our political system, a greatly powerful presidency. At end most presidents show their weaknesses - usually some form of rampant egoism. McCullough shows us a Truman that avoided most of this with humility that came from true confidence founded in self-love. To paraphrase the wee man of golf, if you didn't bring it with you, you won't find it after you arrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another David McCullough Winner !","review":"I've read most all David McCullough's books. They are detailed, absorbing, and they move through time and events in a logical, well paced manner.I've never known much about Truman except that he ascended to the presidency when FDR died and he was responsible for dropping the atom bombs on Japan. Wow ! Was I ever missing the \\"rest of the story\\". This book is excellent in all respects.I gained an enormous education about Truman, an enormous amount of respect for him, and a motivation to travel to his Presidential library someday.Any book I've read by McCullough has been excellent and this is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man Of Character","review":"It took me 6 weeks to finish this book, six enjoyable ones at that. McCullough has a way of making history come alive. I found myself thinking \\"what would Harry S Truman do?\\" in a situation I was in. What shines through in this book is Truman's character and the ability to pick himself off the mat as he often needed to. Not only is this book a great biography about a great man but also an excellent inspirational one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have never know such joy at reading a biography like this and know of no other story that encompasses these events and personalities in quite this way. I believe it is unequaled as an American epic and as a standard for non-fiction. I have read this volume twice and still look forward to living this remarkable life with Harry and Bess again and again. I recommend this book to everyone that I know because it is so rich in the details and joyous in the telling of a great man's life. McCollough has done a service to his country by delivering a biography of a president that is both thorough and heartfelt. I treasure my copy and must tell my friends to purchase their own. Truman is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman audio book","review":"I ordered this audio book for my mother, who is visually impaired. This was a birthday gift and arrived right on time.

You will read (or listen to) this more than once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Point well missed","review":"This book contains a few good and encouraging points about life and comments on familiar stories. The author assumes that everyone is worried about dying and not leaving anything behind. He does accurately describe the human condition in other respects, the sadness that goes along with desires or expectations that are unfullfilled by virtue of being unrealistic. However, positive human influences he attributes to God. Negative human influences he attributes to flukes of intelligence. He then concludes life is short. Entertaining? Yes, but about as insightful as a pack of fortune cookies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"This book is a treasure - the best I've seen on what is truly important in life.

This book was about a black man went looking for his son and he found out things that he never known. He finds out about his son killing another person. Yet, in the book he finds that there are different people, who are kind and trustworthy. My favorite part of the book was when mr. Jarvis said he will build the blacks a new church. It is a sad story because Kumalo's son is hanged at the end of the story. This story I thought contain miracles and hope because Kumalo's dreams of restoring the land came true. So, I think that whoever likes stories about hope and miracles should read this book. Everyone should have the same rights as other people and don't give up. This story is about miracles so read this book if you believe in miracles."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Africa - 60 Years Past","review":"Although this book is about 60 years old I just read it for the 1st time. It is a keeper and a treasure. It is a book that you will want to revisit often at least for awhile. I find the book to be filled with spiritual messages. You will see the making of aparthaid long before it was abolished. The story itself is quite suspenseful and Paton's writing style is unique. I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didn't like the way it swiched to another topic in the middle of the book. It didn't make sence. It really screwed me up becove of that.

Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it.

That being said, CTBC really moved me it was as close to a life changing book as I've really ever read.I don't have too much to say about this book, except that it was outstanding! The content was extremely deep and profound and I had no trouble getting through it. I'm not much of a reader, but this is perhaps my all-time favorite book. I'm not sure what it was that I liked about it, but it really touched me. There aren't a whole lot of books similar to it (which disappoints me), but I'm truly glad to have found Cry, the Beloved Country. I look forward to rereading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Culture Shock In Apartheid South Africa","review":"Paton's acclaimed tale about a pastor in Johannesburg looking for his son is South Africa's finest literature. Kumalo's struggle with faith in man, in god, and in himself is a compelling look at what happens when fear and hate dictate what happen in any government or group. In addition to describing the evil apartheidist regime, it lays bare the fundamental spirit of man. Paton apparently fashioned his novel from The Grapes of Wrath, and while it is tedious at times, it is a valuable historical document and a wonderful story, and important too."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was cool.","review":"The book was in really good condition, but had some smudges on it. Great quality though and reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting--yes","review":"How on Earth could *anyone* think this book is boring? (I have always doubted others' insistence that our culture has been turned by television and computers into a short-attention-span travesty, but now I am reconsidering that skepticism.) If this book is boring, a speech by Martin Luther King is boring. A beautiful day at the beach, or on a mountain, is boring. A beautiful woman is--boring. And frankly, if you think those things are boring, I have little use for your opinion.More pertinently, there is so much about this book that is so moving, and what is moving is exciting by definition (at least in MY opinion). The universality of Paton's dialogues, the way he shifts so effortlessly from present to past tense to convey tension and emotion, his command of the Zulu culture and of the history and terror of his native land--all of these factors are simply astounding. This is a book people will read three centuries from now--and it will be just as exciting then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow moving, but interesting topic","review":"I had a hard time deciding between three and four stars for this book. It is a classic and deals with a very difficult subject, but the story-line seems scattered at times. Paton was trying to communicate the pain, fear, and anger that punctuated life in South Africa in the 1940s. This sociological topic is difficult for young people to grasp...well, it's difficult for not-so-young people to grasp if they have never experienced it. Thus, I found the book's topic interesting and learned a lot. The main character was complex and well-rounded. The raw emotion was captured. Because of this, I give the book four stars. However, a word of caution: when you read it, be prepared to accept the slow-moving, disconnected story line and just enjoy the characters and the sociological portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books I have read","review":"WOW I had to read this book for class but, once I started reading it, I really loved it. It is a great book about race but doesn't give blame to any one race and makes them all look good and bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry, The Beloved Country","review":"This is by far my least favorite Oprah Book Club Book. I don't know if it was the style of writing or the language barrier but I had the hardest time focusing on the story line. I would notice I had read 10 pages but had no idea what had happened. It was very slow moving and I just could not get into it. A few people wrote that they felt the book was boring and maybe that was my problem too."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Africa at its heart","review":"This book takes you into the heart of South Africa. You see the different perspectives of all those living through some of the same situations. You see the main characters vision of South Africa through the church. You see how poverty can change ones outlook on life in general. Poverty will make one make decisions that they wouldn't normally make. You see how a tragedy can bring neighbors together during a tough time. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to see South Africa through the eyes of South Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"the author probably flunked 6th grade english","review":"The author needs to learn to use quotations.

I made it half way through the book and couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific writing abilities for a potentially great novel.","review":"I was initially intrigued to read a South African historical fiction novel. However, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I frequently cringed when I read through functional dialogue, poorly written detail of scenarios, and rudimentary story structure. I couldn't believe that someone who held high ranking in a country actually published a book that was so bland. The dialogue, I must emphasize, is so bad that it's hilarious.I read about halfway through the novel and HAD to put it down. There was no way I could possibly waste my time reading something that made me think that anyone could get published. And an Oprah book?

Unwilling to leave something unfinished, I struggled to complete this seemingly short book. Constantly expecting something of interest to develop, as pages went by I slowly realized that my hopes would be in vain. Unless you enjoy a struggle, I wouldn't recommend this monotonous tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's my Literature textbook... what can I say??","review":"Frankly, I hated this book after reading Book I.

It got slightly better after Book II so it ain't so bad, it fact I'll even go as far as to say that it's touching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always wanted to read this book because I thought it was considered one of THE great books of our time. In addition, I am extremely interested in South Africa and apartheid in general. I was disappointed by this book and forced myself to finish it. I felt the characters were just shells of people who were difficult to envision and impossible to identify with. The reader is never let inside the heads of any of the characters. It's as if the story is told from someone sitting 500 yards away from these folks. Also, I found the author's writing style confusing at times, especially the dialog scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was required for sons school reading","review":"Read this along with son.This book very difficult to get into and hard to understand.I think it has a very important meaning but sure there is better books written now that are easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book I ever read","review":"Cry, The Beloved Country has to be one of the most confusing and boring books that I've ever read. It made no sense to me and I had no idea when people were having a conversation. The words in this book were way to big for me and I had a lot of trouble understanding them. The African words were very difficult to read and understand and I found myself constantly looking in the back of the book for the meaning of such words. This is one book that I don't think I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book about life in South Africa.","review":"This book gives amazing insight into life in South Africa before Apartheid became the offical State social policy. It is incredible that the optimism that Alan Paton promoted in 1946 when he wrote this novel loosely foreshadows the life and non-violent struggle of Nelson Mandela."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIMELESS PICTURE OF RACIAL DISPARITY AND HOPE.","review":"I cannot help but wonder under what context the readers who panned this book undertook reading it. (I didn't find it to drag, and breezed through it over a weekend.) The sentences ARE short and pointed, and dashes instead of quotation marks ARE used for dialogue, but not consistently. But does this distract from the story, or give it the flavor of the the country and peoples of South Africa? I cried several times during this story both in feeling the pain of a son convicted of murder, and in the joy of hope. As a middle age woman, the wisdom conveyed through advice both to and from the priest spoke so clearly to the youthful rebellion our generation played out in the 1960s. I was so pleased to find high school students giving it five stars! Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"horrible recording. Not only is the reader nearly always monotone, his different voices vary in volume so much that I constantly had to keep adjusting the volume. Also, the recording was not done well, and the reader was not very articulate to begin with, so the entire sound was rather fuzzy. I couldn't listen to all of it, it was so bad. avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multidimensional","review":"I thought this book did a good job of presenting characters that were very multidimensional. The characters displayed traits both positive and negative. As the reader, I felt sometimes encouraged, oftentimes sympathetic, and every once and a while disbelief at the actions of the main character Stephen Kumalo. However, I would have enjoyed knowing a bit more Kumalo's son journey while in Johannesburg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cry, the Beloved Country","review":"It is true that Cry, the Beloved Country tells us of suffering, of injustice, of conflict, of South Africa. What sets this book apart, however, is its beauty: the beauty of the language, the beauty of faith in the forge, the beauty of the people, some struggling with their oppression, othes struggling with their privilege . You cannot fully appreciate this book if you only see it as a statement. It is not merely a statement, but a . . . well, a cry, not of pain only, but also of hope. It is profoundly touching.It astonishes me that I did not discover this work until I was twenty years out of college. Beautiful, touching, unique in style, and very relevant. It should be on every English department's short list."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN 5 STARS!!!","review":"I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK 15 STARS IF I COULD.BEST BOOK THAT I HAVE READ IN A LLLOOONNNGGG TIME.GREAT JOB!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"This is a wonderful story about a Zulu Paster, his family, and a white man named Jarvis. The story tells about the injustices of the time in South Africa and the beauty of the country. The story is wonderfully written with vivid describions and the charactors almost come to life. Although it did have some slow parts overall this was a very good book and I would recommend in to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My class was recently assigned this book to read to go along with our unit on Africa. Cry, The Beloved Country was filled with extrodinary passages that made me feel the pain and suffering of a country under a time of great turmoil. At times the book was a little boring, but it never seemed to disappoint me in any way, with wonderful descriptions of this beautiful country and the struggle of its oppressed people. This truely is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This review will include my personal opinion of this book.","review":"In \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\", a reverond tries to restore his tribe and his family. This story takes place in the 1940s, in South Africa. The reverond whom tries restoring his tribe and family takes a journey to the great city of Johannesburg, where the reverond's sister and son are. His son murdered a man, and his sister became a prostitute. The reverond wants to bring his sister, and his son back to his village. I personally think that this is a great book and that everyone who knows how to read should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love literature and I hate to be politically incorrect. And perhaps I'm being unfair - I did read this a while ago and only because it was required reading in high school. But many classics and important novels are actually good! I'm being sarcastic, but the point is, that I remember this book as being unbearably slow and boring. Yes, boring! It was well writeen, and the dynamics of it were interesting and it did stick in mind for being a great view and exposure into another's life and culture and time. But it was slow and boring and uninvolving. The characters and the \\"lyrical\\" writing resulted in my feeling removed from it. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry? More like a weep.","review":"Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country has a very interesting storyline. The book is about how a native priest struggles with an ever changing world, filled with injustice and surprises. Yet somehow, the book is unimaginably boring. I think that book has a great base, but it's unique writing style makes it excedingly more boring than it would be in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORE","review":"the style of the writing was really confusing, I had to read this book this summer for my sophomore honors english class. I agree with Dave, The author just wasted my time describing things on...and on...which completely bored me. I only had 5 days to read this book...so i skipped some pages that some people stated \\"poetic\\". I may be harsh...like Dave...it could be because i cant fully apreciate his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing style spoiled the story.","review":"\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" had a very intriguing and educational plot, but Paton's writing style is what ruined it for me. The dialogue format was confusing at times and the switching of narration also put a damper on the story. Symbolism was strong, but easily spotted. If only the writing style wasn't so bad. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not reccommend","review":"I sloughed through this book with much difficulty - as an avid reader, I read the book not as much for the story it told, but for the way it was told. The novel was often repetitive - several passages were copied word for word (the first paragraph of Book One and the first paragraph of Book Two, for an example). Dialogue was repeated multiple times, and descriptions and phrases were reused. Paton's attempt at creativity with his use of dashes to begin dialogue was distracting at its best points. The base story of South Africa and Kumalo was engaging, but the story as it was written was difficult to process and dull. The only parts of the novel I actually enjoyed were Paton's passionate tangents in which he would leave his characters for a moment and discuss the actual problems and solutions.If this novel had been a movie I had rented, I would have turned it off within the first ten minutes and returned it to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and not just because Oprah picked it!","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago for Academic Decathlon and it is a wonderful book. It introduces you to entirely different era, atmosphere, culture and belief system. It really makes you think about what it would be like to be oppressed and hated and what it means to fight for something that you believe in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC book!","review":"This will become a classic. It deals with the situations that apply to many African countries. VERY informative and an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was disappointing","review":"I felt that this book was poorly written and an imposition on the reader. I understand that Paton was trying to introduce the speech patterns to the reader, and he did so successfully, but it took away from the book's rythm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting for a textbook, boring for a novel...","review":"I read this book last year as part of an AP English class, and wasn't very impressed. Sure the book serves as a good history lesson, and has a somewhat interesting storyline, but it is lacking as far as pacing goes. I would only recommend this book if you're really interested in old South African society. If you're looking for a good read, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cry, The beloved Country\\"","review":"Book was in \\"OK\\" condition, however, description did not say it was stamped on front and sides with \\"discarded\\" It was purchased as a gift and sent directly to individual and was suppose to be in like new condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty grueling to read...","review":"This book is based on an interesting concept, but the book itself is grueling to read. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.I actually can't believe that this one is on Oprah's book club. Even more distressing is the fact that such a marginal book would spike in sales like it did when it hit Oprah's list.Get a mind of your own and spend your time reading a better book that you actually pick for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"change of writing style - the book is a winner","review":"yes, the storyline is great, its churns your emotions, you feel for kumalo and everything and everyone around him. But hey, this is not the first time i have read a book that is as moving. But definitely the book gives you a peek into the aparthied situation in Southafrica. Just a peek, there are more worser things happening there.I honestly struggled to read the book and understand it because of the language. I like simple language, which is understadable in todays world. And i think if this book was re - written in not so poetic style, i would have loved it.Its a tough read. You need to clear your mind of distractions to understand the book.But seriously whats the hue and cry all about!!!! Not fascinated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooorrrrrriiiiinnnngggg!","review":"OMG! I read this book in high school and thought it was the most boring, torturous book ever. Now my daughter is reading it and was not just my immaturity that led me to that conclusion. Kumalo's trek to Johannesburg takes FOREVER. I was like oh just get there already. Tedious details and see it coming from a mile away plot developments will have you snoring away in no time.

He is just the best jazz musician.He puts you into a mood that relaxes you and just puts you into agroove to the music mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Touchdown\\"!","review":"First of all I have to strongly disagree with the other reviews written on this album, by reviewers who seem to know Bob James only from the songs that have been sampled by rappers. The five cuts on this album define \\"smooth jazz\\" before it became bland and uninteresting. I feel he hit a creative peak with this album that he only reached again with his duet album \\"One On One\\" with Earl Klugh. \\"Touchdown\\" features excellent supporting players like Hubert Laws, Earl Klugh, Ron Carter, Steve Gadd, Idris Muhammad, and David Sanborn, there's definitely nothing formulaic about the performances here. This album was James' first to crossover and hit the top forty on the pop chart thanks to hit theme from \\"Taxi\\", \\"Angela\\", and his first gold album. \\"Sun Runner\\" received heavy airplay from contemporary jazz stations when this album was released back in 1978. This is one of the best smooth jazz records of this or any era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Magic!","review":"...That's the best way to describe this recording. TOUCHDOWN is one of those musical occurences which happen only once or twice in a lifetime (such as Chick Corea's RETURN TO FOREVER, or Dave Grusin's MOUNTAIN DANCE). There are so many reasons why. For one, there is the incredible assembleage of talent. The CD boasts such names as David Sanborn, Earl Klugh, Hubert Laws, Ron Carter, Eric Gale, and Mongo Santamaria. Then, there is the material itself. \\"Angela\\" (a.k.a. the theme from TAXI) is laid back (and check out that heartbreaking solo from Eric Gale). \\"Touchdown\\" features Bob at the keys and Sanborn's hard-driving sax. \\"I Want To Thank You\\", \\"Sun Runner\\", and \\"Caribbean Nights\\" are as smooth as they come. This is, bar none, the best CD that Bob ever put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Album","review":"I had this as an LP back in the 70's There's a wealth of professional musicians contained here, most of them still with us today.

Instead, Collegebooksdirect stated that this is common practice for them (which clearly violates Amazon.com's selling rules and guidelines) and that I should have contacted them earlier.

I've been wanting a set for years now, and now I finally have one.These wrenches are not the best in terms of construction, however, they are quite strong. They are also quite effective. I would have liked to know what sizes come in this set, but they were not listed here. So, here they are:7mm + 8mm9mm + 10mm12mm + 13mm14mm +15mm19mm + 21mmThese wrenches are simple enough to operate, and low cost enough to not worry about losing them.I have a mechanic friend who tends to borrow tools without remembering to return them.

Unfortunately, the cover art doesn't show who the band members are until you open the CD. This Badlands has absolutely nothing to do with Jake E. Lee or the other members of Jake's old band. Musically, I couldn't even stomach listening to this. If I had to make some kind of a comparison, I'd say think Greenday without the edge. Perhaps that's not a fair assessment, but I wasn't looking for watered-down punk when I bought this.

My favorites are Onslaught, War Zone, Freestyle, For All Yall, Showdown, Frame, Two Turntables and a Mic, and Throw Your Hands in the Air. There aren't really any songs I dislike, but some are average. The production is very good and the guest spots by Busta Rhymes, Heather B, Cocoa Brovaz, Q-Tip, and Rock from Heltah Skeltah were all good. Louiveille Sluggah's guest appearance was pretty weak, although I'm not a big fan of his anyway.

Great, great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"The soundtrack to this movie is so much more than a remixing of old songs from the '50's, but all but one track is just that; old song remixes. The only track I listen to is the last one, the one actually written for the movie. I love the beautiful instrumental background music throughout the movie, but I didn't get it on the soundtrack. They need to do another one with just the instrumental!(They did that with the \\"Shrek\\" movies and it's great!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is The Cranberries?","review":"I'm surprised where is The Cranberries.It's the first time that I know about one movie that use one music and don't put in your Cd.When I saw the first time i think very beautiful the music Dreams in the movie but now I'm very sad because don't have this music in Cd.I don't Like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Hyped Drivel","review":"I like many of the artists on this album, particularly Tori Amos and Alison Krauss, but this is as mediocre an album as the movie's star, Julia Roberts, is an actress. Other than Barbara Streisand none of these artists have any feel or understanding of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Songs!!!","review":"I have not heard this soundtrack aside from the bits and clips from the movie but I do STRONGLY remembering Les Paul and Mary Ford's \\"How High the Moon\\" a CLASSIC song from the 50's which was not even featured on the soundtrack!How can an entire song be played through a portion of the movie and not make the cut for the soundtrack?I am a little disappointed as I grew up listening to Les and Mary and have always been a big fan! I recommend getting one of their greatest hits albums for the best and most memorable of their tunes.I don't beleive I will be buying this soundtrack because of the lack of this and a few other songs I felt were rather important to the mood and setting of the film on top of the fact that they were the few I actually REMEMBER from the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Charming.","review":"This album is perfectly charming. It features contemporary pop (if you can consider Tori Amos pop) stars singing inspired big-band era songs, and in almost every instance, pulling it off without a hitch. If you don't like Celine Dion, there's no way I can convince you, but she does better than not-make-you-want-to-vomit-with-sappiness in a very controlled version of \\"Bewitched\\" that showcases the song as much as her voice, and threatens the album's closer, Barbra Streisand. Like the movie, the album probably won't move you to tears, but you definitely won't be suffering buyer's remorse, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Professional Soft Phone Use","review":"The soft phone concept is cool but to use this headset you have to make it your default audio device for mic and speakers. This means your regular speakers can't be used at the same time and switching involves control panel, sounds, reset default, etc. you're not going to have time to do this when a call is coming in. If you leave your speakers as default (cuz you spent a lot of money on them and love to use them for music, etc.) you can still use this device as the mic only.... but then your callers hear themselves talking with you. Platronics tech support says you can adjust the volumes to minimize this but the end result is never business quality. So.... unless you are ready to give up use of your speakers this item is a piece of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"After reading the reviews I was skeptical, but Plantronics makes great products so I gave it a try. I think it works great. The previous reviews about the speakers for you computer not woking if you use the headset are not true IF you change your settings. I use google chat and changed the settings in chat and everything works perfectly. I would have rated it a 5 but it always needs to be \\"refreshed\\" on my iPhone. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"With a name like Plantronics I expected a lot better quality out of this product. Using the headset between my computer and my cell phone was no smoothe transition, and required a lot of \\"tweaking\\" to get it work when transitioning. The voice quality was poor, and callers would complain they could not hear me at times. There was a constant crackling noise in the audio. The unit was lightweight and sometimes I would forget it was on my ear. I wish it was as functional as it looks, but I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Doesn't work well with Dragon Speaking.

Jay Beckenstein and Marcus Miller are used once again on \\"Shamboozie\\", supported by a great brass section. The Billy Joel rhythm section and Eddie Daniels are featured on \\"Janus\\" (named after the two-headed porter of heaven in the Roman myths). One is reminded of the TV themes of Mike Post or Dave Grusin. Next comes the poignant \\"Roberta\\", a tune written by and featuring the late Mike Lawrence.

It discusses Two Leggings search for power through traditional vision quest and his inability to receive anything substantial. Ultimately, he receives something of value extended to him by his father-in-law.

Conwell","review":"Can a story be so good that those who hear it are inspired to help found an university? Here is one of those wonderful stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acres of Diamonds sparkles!","review":"This book will not appeal to those who think that one's own surroundings offer no advantages. I agree there are some places so remote or lacking in oppritunity that to not relocate is rather a apathetic approach to life. Yet Mr. Conwell is trying to encourage the citizens of a huge city of Philadelphia that money can be made there just as easy as any other big city. I will not reveal how he suggests this can happen but I agree with Mr. Conwell's approach and logic. Helping people meet their goals will have a good effect on your ability to meet your goals. However, I feel that only works if you are dealing with good people. Ethical imbeciles don't play fair and have fun doing it. If one has the chance to meet and deal with decent people, or you encourage that side of them, then Acres of Diamonds is enchanting. I was enchanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to your success!!","review":"I started reading this book and could not stop, I read till the end! Everything about it is just AMAZING!!

The author's name was mispelled on the cover and the title was wrong on every inside page. The printing was oddly spaced making it unpleasant to read. I had to return both copies that I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acres of Hot Air","review":"I received this book from a pseudo-intellectual for Christmas. Not wanting this person to feel their efforts were unappreciated I decided to read it. What a waste of time. Conwell is a pontificating windbag intoxicated with his own ego. I guess that's what happens when you have a captured audience and they are compelled to listen to dribble ad nauseum. Basically, Conwell's point could have been made (and understood) in ten pages or less. Why his ramblings continue onward is because his listeners were too polite to stand up and walk out. Conwell needs an elementary lesson how to articulate his thoughts. A self proclaimed professor, Conwell is overcome with himself and weaves a lecture of rehashed parables that cumulate full circle without basis of fact or theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acres Of Diamonds","review":"A simple story, yet within is one of the most inspirational messages on achievement - that everything one needs for success is probably right in their vicinity, and all one has to do is to recognise it.

This is a great concert. This is one of those times when you know he was in the mood to perform and was enjoying every bit of it. He and Joan Baez sing together on a few songs and manage to stumble over each other in the process, but this is such a wonderful evening of music that you don't really mind.

Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"dylan bootleg 6 cd","review":"You will enjoy this cd if: you like Dylan's earlier acoustic/folkie music and like the feel of a live performance.You will probably not enjoy this cd if: you don't like live cd's, if Dylan's voice gets on your nerves, if you are only interested in the album version of the songs, of if clapping and crowd interaction gets on your nerves.I really like this cd. As I listen to it I feel like I am part of the crowd. Most of the song introductions are included; so you get to hear Dylan crack jokes, strum on his guitar and mess with his harmonica.I think it is a good performance, he doesn't slur his words too badly (like in other albums), and much of what he says between the songs is really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":":-)","review":"It's great to see Clint and Bob back! :-) I like the sound, and the direction they're going in.

Also we have tough winter weather and I really wanted indoor games that would appeal to my boy and girl aged 4 & 8 year olds,We bought several toys under this catagory (Mousetrap, Elefun, Carrera Slotcar trac, Tinker Toy etc.)and to my suprise the Honeybee Hop is the hands down favorite!This toy is so simple! It is showing to be quite durable and the music is not too annoying, especially as it is drowned out by the giggles and laughter! This is a great workout the three kids currently using it are all very sweaty!I would ignor that it looks like a baby game as this would work for older kids too. This would make a great BDay game toy. Also I think a hilarious drinking game for adults too!!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Xmas Gift 2008","review":"This was an unexpected, hidden gem of a gift. Great for a kids up to age 10 or so. Non-stop laughs. Before using it, I was worried that my kids would trip over it. No need to worry, it's flexible and durable enough that it stops at the slightest obstacle. Silly sound effects. Only downside is that it is a bit loud with no volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"I bought this for my five year olds birthday party but we just couldn't wait to try it out. She LOVES it and so does her 1 1/2 year old sister :) They jump over it and run from it, haha. It seems pretty durable thus far, my 1 1/2 year old has stomped on it, thrown it and it still works fine. The surface must be flat though, or the bee will stop turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeybee hop","review":"I gave this to my 3 year old granddaughter for her birthday. She loved it!

They love honeybee hop. My son has not broke it yet which I think is miraculous. Yes the music can get annoying but they like it. Works great on the kitchen floor and is great for when they have much more energy than I do. It wears them out enough that we can sit down and relax afterward. They create many interesting ways to use it. Sometimes they run from it, sometimes hop over it and some times my son just watches it for awhile and then tries to catch it.We got it for them for christmas and it was well worth the money. The batteries have not yet had to be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"HoneyBee Hop by Hasbro","review":"We bought Honey Bee Hop by Hasbro for a three year old.

I bought it because I'm always looking for different ways to keep my two boys active & moving, but it just doesn't rotate, even on our hardwoods. It starts, but stops before my kids get the chance to jump over the bee more than once. So needless to say, they lose interest in it quickly. Very disappointing, because it seems like it would be a lot of fun if it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fun didn't last long","review":"I bought this for my sons 3rd bday.he was so excited, it was a fun new game.

It is such a simple concept, but it can easily keep her busy for a half an hour. He likes it, too, though it doesn't keep his attention that long. I agree that it works best on a hard floor(we use it in the kitchen) and it is a little annoying. But It doesn't take up much room and is great for burning off extra energy. I would definately recommend this toy! (I also recommend Playskools Tag Tails game)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"My four year old loves this!

I now know why. It's a hazard. Pros: toddlers love pushing it & it's realistic looking. Incidents with this toy include: tot's head got stuck between handle bar and main cart, tot's foot got stuck in bottom tray slats, wheels continually got stuck on deck furniture with the gap they have in middle, causing toddler distress. Also, the cart is light weight enough that my boy is compelled to race it along the walls and on top of tables. Finally couldn't take it anymore and threw this toy out today. Get the Little Tikes plastic cart instead (our kids love those at nearby rec center), which I'm going to buy to replace this one. I used to be anti-plastic, but with tots, no more. Steel and wood products and tots don't mix well. Plastic is far more safe, as companies such as Step2, Mattel and Fisher Price know all so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchsase","review":"Read this book many years ago and got a lot out of it.

In this time I had done a bit of reading up on philosophy and psychotherapy. Looking at this book again I find that, contrary to claims by Dr Harris, his methods are not scientifically validated and the whole notion of group psychotherapy has been trivialized.

No linear notes and the picture of the band is not accurate. Misleading. It does not show Papa John (electric Violin) who is on most of the tracks but it does show Marty Balin but he is on only one track. Very misleading when there is no linear notes to explain the band members. What is the Airplane without Marty Balin with his lead vocals and harmonizing with other members including Grace Slick. In addition, the sound is very tinny and not clear most of the time. Airplane fans--there are alot of other live Airplane cds out there that are a hell of a lot better than this one. Skip it!!!

As a child, I found some loops in my bag to be too short to fit on my loom, and others I forced on there but worried my plastic loom would break. With these, however, my daughter didn't find any too short. I'd give them 4.5 stars because there were a few loops with strings, and one string seemed to want to unravel the loop when I pulled on it. However, I don't think the strings are going to affect the usefulness of the potholder."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best loops!","review":"I've tried other cotton loops (and some nylon loops) and these are the best. These loops have rich color, durable weave, and just the right amount of elasticity. My 6-year-old son loves making pot holders and these are the BEST for his young fingers. The loops make the project difficult enough to make it challenging, but easy enough that he's not too discouraged to try. We use these loops with the Harrisville loom, which I recommend. If you're looking for something for younger kids or kids with underdeveloped fine motor skills, then consider nylon (Nylon loops are super stretchy - good for weaker hands, but they shrink and the finished pot holders are only big enough to be used as coasters or for play kitchens.) These cotton loops hold their size beautifully so that you end up with a \\"true\\" pot holder size, and they hold up wonderfully in the laundry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I purchase this product for my Sony TRV33 handycam camcorder, yes the tiny and lower weight video camera in the market, and guess what happens?

Rather, it is those who, as his opening chapter point out, eat at McDonalds and test drive new Mercedes who are ironically enough the greatest haters of the West.But Trofimov also shows us another more tolerant side of Islam when he takes us to Mali to witness an election in that country, which has been Muslim for centuries. Mali shows that Islam need not necessarily be oppressive to its adherents.The chapters on Saudi Arabia are an excellent introduction to the country for anyone who is not familiar with it.The book also has some great pieces of adventuring that Trofimov gets into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally gifted children","review":"As a clinical psychologist and a parent of an exceptionally gifted son I want to say thanks to Miraca Gross who made a wonderful description of these children.

The game is always a hit - at least one game is played every time a group gets together. Previous players want to get in on a game and are eager to explain the rules to newer players.

Grandmas learn quickly to relate to their grandkids and it's a lot of smiles all around because of the element of luck. It can be a quick little pass time away from Video games when you start anywhere in the deck not just at the 3 level.

We play one game of Five Crowns followed by a game of Mexican Train Dominoes. I love the dominoes game, but Five Crowns is the absolute favorite when put up for a vote by all of the women. Part of the appeal is that it's easy to learn. I'm told that you can play this game with a regular deck of cards, but I like the graphics of the Five Crowns deck. We are on our third deck and I've purchased a spare because I know we won't tire of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great card game","review":"Five Crowns is easy to learn (has similarities to Phase 10, Shanghai Rummy, etc.) and is fun to play with friends. The card design is an interesting twist on traditional playing cards - some friends thought the Jokers looked \\"creepy\\" though. :)As stated on the box, the outcome can change radically in the last round, so everyone stays \\"in the game\\" throughout.My only minor complaint is that the deck size only supports up to 7 players, and the manufacturer expects you to buy a second game for eight or more. We've reduced the deal to six cards for that number of players, and it seems to work out fine.Overall, a very entertaining game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"I played this at a friend's house before buying it, and really enjoyed it. After I bought it, I enjoyed it a bit less. I think four is the right number of players; any more and it's a bit unwieldy. It's a bit like Phase ten, and sort of in the same family of game concepts as Uno. My wife thinks it is a fantastic game."},{"rating":"2","title":"FantasticFunCardGame","review":"I have my 81 yr old mother and & step father living with me This game is so much fun, goes fast and it's great for them because you have to think to make the right choice.

I currently am using mine with the circuit card holder and it makes the work so much easier. One note... inside the vise is a little bent metal disk that presses against the one side of the clamp when you tighten the handle. If you crank down a little too hard, it will break this piece, but you can remedy the problem by taking the unit apart and putting a nickel on either side of the clamp halves. Problem solved and it actually centers the clamp in the opening as well. Highly recommend these Panavise tools"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Lego set","review":"This is another great Lego set. (Just like the title says!) I love the suspension bridge, and there are alot of parts to make a small forest castle keep. The catapult is pretty cool too. I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes the castle Legos.

I commend his effort, however I feel he was let down by the publisher in the production department. While the text is informative & near comprehensive, the photos are of very poor quality. They were obviously not retouched with Photoshop which I would consider mandatory in this day & age. If the author is reading, I'd suggest Schiffer or another publisher that knows how to do historical photo books. The price of this Naval Institute Press book is obscene considering the poorly put forth photos, which are far too small & far too dark (and fuzzy). For the modeler, I'd suggest the handbook by Patrick Hreachmack, supplemented by the appropriate Squadron/Signal books, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every kind of brownie you can think of and more!","review":"This book is jam-packed with helpful brownie-making tips as well as 50 variations of brownies and blondies!

Fun & easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with this Loom","review":"This loom is not too big or too small-just the right size for travel or just staying at home and weaving. The tools come with it and make life a lot easier while weaving. Starter yarn colors are available in the package which means you don't have to run out to the craft supply store and buy yarn right away unless you don't like the yarn provided.The information booklet is handy, only because I already know how to weave-but for beginners I would suggest they add photos of real weavings to enhance the instructions. I am very pleased with this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely made loom!","review":"I have experience using table, laptop, and back-strap looms. When it came time to purchase a starter loom for my 10 year old granddaughter, I chose this one and was not disappointed. It is quite sturdy and well made with smooth wooden surfaces. The plastic parts seem well made and well attached. Directions are easy, straight forward, and well illustrated. The included yarn is of a nice quality. This is a well made entry level loom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gift","review":"My 9 year old son asked for a loom for Christmas. We had visited a factory and he saw the big, mechanical looms, and also a few hand looms (but big, with floor petals, and 5 feet tall). Obviously we were not going to pay $1000 for a loom for our 9 year old son, so we were looking for something. This one is nice. It is strong, and has kept him entertained for hours. Does take some work, not stepping on petals and sliding through the thread, comes with two sticks, one you leave in, and one you put back in every other time. Comes with the materials needed to start, and shows you in the instructions how to add different things. Makes one piece of cloth, maybe 12-18. Not huge, but keeps his hands busy. i believe I saw in the instructions on how to make a longer piece, but we have not gotten to that yet. Too complex for a 5 year old (our other son), but for a patient 9 year old, it works great. I also think for an adult, it would be fun, maybe the more complex designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Beware for those of you Rumi fans who thought this book was going to be an updated edition of the old one. It's not! It is really a sequel by Michael Brown to the original and after the inspired collaboration of him and Barks produced the first Illumination-there is no way to follow it that could come close to the enlightened selection of poems, set in perfect sequence and illustrated profoundly by Green. Just buy a second copy of the first book and forget about this one.

O'Neill has made a name for himself within the military community as one of the premiere experts on insurgency and revolutionary warfare. After reading this volume, I no longer considered this to be in anyway surprising. Written in the late 1980s/early 1990s, it is a short book that nevertheless touches upon all aspects and types of insurgencies in a rigorous and analytic manner. Readers should be aware, however, that it is incredibly dry, but to the point - something that a \\"just the facts\\" type reader such as myself can appreciate. Unfortunately, I have not been able to read any of Mr. O'Neill's more modern works, but will nonetheless suggest that readers might want to take a look at them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best adventure story that I have ever read","review":"Simply put, this is the most exciting adventure story that I ever read. One of the other reviews said that it would make a good Indiana Jones movie and it definetly would. I wont go into the plot as the other reviews outlined it pretty well.

The worlds that he created were in a class of their own, detailed, extravagant, mesmerizing. While some of this may have been due to being paid \\"by the word\\", the results were gratifying to the reader.This particular story is not a typical fantasy. Rather, it falls somewhat into the genre of Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Fu-Manchu. \\"Satan\\" is a criminal lord, dealing in vice and drugs. His followers are motivated by the chance to gain Satan's power through mounting a staircase leading to his throne. If they choose the correct seven steps, they win.\\"Satan\\" is NOT Satan, but he IS a gloriously evil character and very hard to defeat. The story is told through the eyes of the good guy. Who wins?

I was appalled by this disgrace of an album, the rapping is pants, and the beats are dreadful. They aren't the hardcore,punching beats as in the other 3 albums, instead they sound more suited to missy elliot or eve.

Her live performances as captured here have little of the finicky-ness of some of her studio recordings, but have greater staying power as a result. The Frauenliebe is rivalled only by Brigitte Fassbaender's extraordinary recording, and certainly eclipses Baker's two studio recordings of the cycle. Do yourself a favor and bathe in this one.

It's smooth, like a good aged wine. There's descarga in here too, but the interplay between the instruments and the arrangements are really the gold of this album. Simply put, some of the world's best musicians (certainly the best in Latin music, although they are versatile enough to play anything) coming together in harmony for a CD that does justice to the Latin Jazz movement as a whole. If there ever was a latin jazz album, it's this one. I'd highly recommend it, along with other's, like GIovanni Hidalgo's Worldwide and other CDs.

Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"blueberry candy","review":"The best thing about Melissa's dried blueberries is the plastic bag it comes in which you can reseal. The ingredients are whole blueberries and high fructose corn syrup. A serving is 1/3 of a cup (2 servings per 3 oz package). Each serving contains 22g of sugar and the total carbs are 34%. That's a lot for 1/3 of a cup of blueberries. They offer 2% vitamin A, no vitamin C or iron, and 6% calcium.

New archeological evidence and increased sources make the most recent editions and writings of a history ESSENTIAL to its most accurate understanding.That being said, this has a foreword by Teddy Roosevelt... I enjoyed this as I was reading it, but as I further researched the Mongols (as I'm obsessed with Ghengis), I came to find that this text was extremely inaccurate. A glaring example is when this text attributes to Ghengis the act of boiling alive over 70 men of his enemy. More recent writings attribute this vile act to Ghengis' ENEMY directed at Ghengis.

The first editions of this book were in large format hard back and paper back form and were produced prior to the 1973 version. The only problem is that the later edition has all of the same identification information as the original. It was requested that the book be trimmed down as it was too much for a student to digest in a semester of studies. It was further requested that all references to miracles, and specific names of players in the Missouri expulsion be removed as some of their descendents are now teaching at BYU. After the author reduced the content, what was left is a dull, dry, waste of time that leads to very little understanding of subject matter.

The recepies in this book are suitable for older children, and many children starting the diet are just over or even before a year old. Even for older children many recepies in this book are not suitable because most children who start the ketogenic diet are just too disabled and just no able to eat many things for watever reasons. At last, when we started the diet in 2002, there was hardly anything on market what could be incorporated into the diet. Now,8 years later there are so many low carb products available that the recepies in the book just mke no sence anymore. There are much better and convenient solutions available on the market. This book is out of print for good reason: it is OUTDATED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work!!!","review":"I'm a big fan of low carb eating, however the recipes in this book rely on having different butters and marinades and cream sauces prepared ahead of time.For somebody with a full-time job, for whom cooking is a chore rather than a hobby, the recipes are entirely too complex.Also, having to flip back and forth from a recipe to the directions for preparing a butter or sauce is really annoying.Unless your kitchen appliances have names like \\"Viking\\" or \\"Sub-Zero\\" and you have a lot of storage space for ready made sauces and the like, look elsewhere for a ketogenic cookbook.I will be selling mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book but poor quality","review":"The book has a few decent suggestions, but don't expect to learn any techniques here.

O'Reilly always puts up the \\"commentary\\" title (unlike the mainstream media and other cable news networks, i.e., 75% of Americans believe the media slanted their coverage of the recent election to support President-Elect Obama) when puting forth his personal opinion, and if you watch the show he takes on both sides of the issue while still advocating the ethics and values that made the United States a good force in the world. I bought this to see if I was missing something; however, it served to just support my analysis that his show, overall, The Factor is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in on O'Reilly's name","review":"Sensationalism sells. No two ways about this. Mr. Hart realized this, and cashed in on Bill O'Reilly's popularity.Apparently, those who hate O'Reilly have neither watched his show, nor read his books, for those paint a very different story than this book.If you want a manual on how to hate Bill O'Reilly, you've got the right book.If you actually want some substantiated arguments without sensationalism, look elsewhere.Only in the far-left's world would a pro-gun control, anti-death penalty, pro-choice, anti-\\"corporate weasel\\", bipartisan basher be considered a \\"far-right conservative.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Even 3 paragraphs show the inaccuracy","review":"Hart disputes O'Reilly's claim that the US \\"gives far and away more tax money for foreign coutries than anyone else.....\\" by countering that per capita the U.S. is near the bottom of the list.

The fact that ANY radio personality has made a mere 100 notable mistakes should be cause for celebration; most aren't that accurate. Most of these errors, in addition, are tiny mistakes, or mere areas where FAIR disagrees with the commentator.But I'm getting off topic. This new book latches onto a few errors of Bill O'Reilly. For instance, he confused two radio awards for a short period. These awards were about equivalent, but were latched onto by the media as evidence of a lying streak.If you want to read this kind of junk, go right ahead. FAIR.org stands with Al Franken, Ann Coulter, and others as vicious fact-omitting mudslingers with little room for pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect companion to O'Reilly's show or books","review":"I know it can be tough to read O'Reilly's books and watch his show, and although he claims it is a \\"No-Spin Zone\\", it is anything but.This book shows O'Reilly's past lies (or is it O'Lielly) and shows you how to watch for his present and future lies.O'Reilly's question: \\"Who's Looking out for You?\\"My answer: F.A.I.RHighly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pathological Liar","review":"I think the term that best descibes Bill O'Reilly is pathological liar. He lies so much that its hard to tell if what he is \\"reporting\\" is truth or lies. He lies so much even he can't keep up with them. O'Reilly is a classic case of hating in others what he doesn't like in himself. Thus the accusations of \\"liar\\" flow freely from him. The man needs psychological help."},{"rating":"2","title":"A needed book","review":"Of the many things that irks me about O'Reilly is the way he keeps describing himself as a serious journalist. If this bizarre claim hadn't already self-refuted itself, this book helps. Watching O'Reilly on TV is an enormously frustrating experience. I think you respond to him like you would a cheerleader. If he pulls for your side, you like him; if he pulls for the opposition, you find him insufferable. I was always irritated because when I heard him I heard no content. This book validates that impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I think the book was a waste of money!!!I don't remember reading sooo much rhetoric in my life.It's like the author just doesn't like O'Reilly so he writes negative and untrue things about the man.Trust me, don't buy the book, you'll ask for your money back!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Hart not credible","review":"\\"...uh, Bill if you feel so strongly about this, why don't you tell that same retailer to quit selling your book on their site - after all do you want to be associated with such a company?\\".Bill O' was right.

It is a very weak album and their worst to date. The music is similar to the early years but the singing is not and the lyrics are crap for most of the songs. A large disappointment from a long-time fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"The reviews on this are so evenly split it's funny! Granted there is nothing new or original on here but this album is FUN! Don't Cry (Just Suck), Dirty Balls, and Cocaine Cowboys will have you singing along in no time. Damnation Angels is so good it doesn't really even belong on this album. To all the naysayers all I can say is that I bet if this was released before or after Last Command you'd all eat it up. I try to not place a time period on music and just enjoy it for what it is. I think what hurts this album is that Crimson Idol was so damned good and also the production of this album is absolute rubbish. I like how WASP can be serious on one album then just have a party on another, it's what keeps them interesting. This is a total party album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil's Wheels...","review":"This album is not for the faint of heart, as Blackie screams like never before. There are some great balls to the wall rock n roll tunes on here...but there are also some forgettable tracks.Probably a must for true WASP fans (the first 6 songs are all great)...but this should not be the first WASP CD you get. It can get a bit repetitive and doesn't really show what they (esp. Blackie) are capable of...4 stars anyway because this is a great one to crank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"This can't be Wasp can it? What a pathetic excuse for a Wasp album.

This disc is a metalhead's dream come true: sex, booze, rock-n-roll and F.T.W are glorified through some of the fastest and most impressive guitar riffs yet! Some songs, such as \\"Helldorado,\\" \\"Can't Die Tonight,\\" and \\"Dirty Balls,\\" race at breakneck speed while others are more melodic like \\"Damnation Angels\\" and \\"High on the Flames.\\" There's absolutely no fluff or mush on this disc. It is 100% pure hard rock that pulls no punches and leaves no prisoners! This is certainly W.A.S.P's finest acheivement since \\"The Headless Children.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to good ol' W.A.S.P. sound","review":"Finally, Blackie Lawless decided to get rid of that stupid electronic sound used on KFD and record an album that sounds like W.A.S.P. again! It's not their best album, but it's good to see the band back on course again and playing what the music that made them famous. \\"Helldorado\\" is a song that I've been waiting for W.A.S.P. to record since \\"The Headless Children\\" album (their best studio effort, IMO) - I play the album at least 5-6 times a day, just can't get enough of it... Highly recommendable, especially compared to \\"music\\" these new bands release.

W.A.S.P.'s KFD was and is the best record released in years, but when W.A.S.P.'s single-digit IQ fans couldn't handle its sophistication, Blackie decided that sounding like AC/DC or early KISS was the right career move. Trust the guy who covered \\"Somebody to Love\\" to pander. This record is so derivative that I'm surprised it didn't come with KISS Army entry forms. There isn't an original thought on the thing. \\"Damnation Angels\\" is a \\"Hell's Bells\\" ripoff. \\"Dirty Balls\\" could have come straight from \\"Rock and Roll Over.\\" Any high school 80s metal cover band could perform this record start to finish (and probably has). Boring. Blackie's excuse for this travesty is that he wanted to sound like the band did in its early days. Excuse me, Mr. Lawless, but Chris Holmes never sounded like Ace Frehley before. Or wrote like him either. What's your next cover, \\"Black Diamond?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy KFD instead","review":"What was Blackie Lawless thinking when he made this record???????? it is like a bad bad version of inside the electric circus.. Buy it only if you see it on MEGA sale..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasp's Worst!!!!","review":"Really nothing more to say. Blackie is awesome, he is a great vocalist and writer. Unfortunately, this displays none of his finer qualities. It was an attempt to get back to the basics and play some down and dirty rock and roll. It's dirty enough, but the songs are just piss-poor. Avoid this release, anything else from their catalogue is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple but complete","review":"I would not be getting such a great book if not SYBEX, which has lots of advance examples, tips and tricks.

This remix CD is, in my opinion, a failed attempt at making this song better, or even just as good. The only remix version on this CD that was tolerable was #6 for the simple reason it was not cheapened by the migraine thumping repetition of commonly used bass beats. If you adore club-techno sound, mind-numbing noise you will like this, otherwise stay away. Track #6 was musically tolerable, but the pace of audio and instrumentals was severly off. One of the best things about the genius of Sinead is her ability to match the music with the lyrics. She did that in the original version. Leave it alone!

Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for little kids","review":"I first played this game last year, at a study-abroad program. Games would start with just two players, but pretty soon we would have a whole crowd of people gathering in and playing. The game is very fun and enthralling. It may seem like it is not very educational in the traditional sense (one doesn't learn facts nor counting) but it exercises your mind, and makes you think in different ways, so I would say that it is quite educational in that context. As it is a card game, it's durability is based on how well you take care of it, and the cards don't bend easily, but they do bend a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game that plays tricks with your eyes","review":"I played this game after it was introduced to me a couple years ago. It is a game where you have to make a set of three cards that have different colors, shapes, number, and fill types by finding three cards that have three of these distinct characteristics. After you stare at all those shapes for a while, your eyes start playing tricks on you. You think you see one when in fact it is not.I registered for this for my wedding and bought it with gift cards I had received. Now that I have it, my husband and I play all the time. Great for people that like chance and challenge, but if you can put this in front of a bunch of kids in a classroom (as I did), it keeps the room quiet for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun game of pattern recognition","review":"Set is a fun game with simple rules that improves your pattern recognition skills. It is easy to carry around, being only slightly larger than a deck of cards.The games can become one-sided though, if one player is significantly better than the others. In this case, a time handicap (eg a 3 second delay) or tweaking the scoring (eg different players need different number of sets to win) can help balance the games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same great game as always... but no plastic case?","review":"I love Set, and have played it for many years. All of the decks I've bought previously came with a nice hard plastic carrying case that fit the deck as well as the instruction booklet... very handy.This deck did *not* come with the plastic case, which makes it easy to damage the cards. A very annoying cost-cutting move. This is why I've given it 4 stars rather than 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, but competitive game...","review":"The game SET is really a diamond in the rough.

It's so fun! Yes, it is addicting and you will see the shapes in your sleep. If you enjoy challenging your mind, you'll absolutely love this game. Super simple yet complex. I've yet to beat my 11 year old who seems to be a natural. Still, I know I have stealth like set seeking capabilities just waiting to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fun","review":"I just was introduced to this at a small family reunion. My 75 year old mother, myself, and my sister all played this wonderful mind stretching game. It's quite easy to learn, easy to see (my mother has vision problems) but challenging to play well. I must admit we played cooperatively, not with high levels of competition. Afterwards, each of us felt we had gotten \\"mind aerobics\\". We felt refreshed too.I highly recommend it to all ages.Just wish there was an electronic version so I could play it solitaire on the plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Set","review":"As a \\"senior\\" I enjoy this game to keep the old wheels turning.

We got so hooked onto it that we bought a SET for ourselves and a couple of gift SETs as well!It is very fun and easy to learn even for young children. However, it is not a \\"winding down\\" or \\"relaxing\\" game - it charges you up as your brain is constantly on the lookout for the matching patterns.There are no limits on number of players - it can be played by as few as two players, or as many as you want. The same set of cards has so many different ways of making sets that each game is totally different.Best of all, it is like a pack of cards, so you can carry it with you easily on trips and play anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the red-green color blind","review":"The open symbols are drawn with thin lines, and the cards use red and green as two of the colors. Red-green color blindness is fairly common, about 5% of males have it. And those who are red-green color blind can't play this game. I hope the game is reissued someday with a different set of colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to play with all ages","review":"Set is a great game to play with all ages--you can play with half the deck to simplify the variety of sets you can make which makes it easier for younger players to get the hang of it.

He first played it online in his math class, and now we have this card game. Even my 6 year old really enjoys it. You don't have to read, you only need a logical mind to play!

Like many \\"simple\\" games, this one is harder to master than one might think at first. Set is a pattern identification game and if your mind is bent in that direction, you will do well. Part of the game is also being able to identify when there is NOT a pattern. These aspects make this game a challenge. A great game for folks above about 13 or so. It gets extremely frustrating for kids and my teenager walked away in frustration while the rest of us were hollering out patterns. If you want a game for a family get together that is mostly adults, give this one a try. If you want a game for your family that includes young kids, look for something a little more age appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly Basner's reveiw!","review":"I think set is a very fun game for 7+.It is a good game because it is half a brain teaser half a consuntrashone game.

After playing a couple of rounds with people frustrated and unimpressed, my husband set us straight and we have enjoyed it ever since. My husband and I like fast paced games and this isn't incredibly fast with two people, but when there are more eyes, the pace picks up. I have also found that the more we have played it, the quicker we get at it, though it is still plenty challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game!

Fairly portable and lacking any formal setup requirements, it's a good game to take along on trips or anytime when you're going to be waiting for awhile.It's not the most exciting game, but it's a fun diversion and prods your brain into action."},{"rating":"2","title":"best simple family game ever","review":"do not pass up this brilliant card game. its simplicity, ingenuity, and eventual competitiveness make it engrossing for hours on end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set Card Game","review":"This has to one of the most simple yet intelligent games to play - as you have to think multi dimensionally - colors - shapes - numbers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages!!","review":"I have shared this game with several people (children and adults), and they were all skeptical at first, you know, rolling of the eyes... But EVERYONE gets into it! Set is a great game to help with concentration, focusing on details, and looking for the 'not so obvious'. So far, the children have been able to pick it up very quickly, and tend to improve faster than their parents. I love this game because families can play it together with the parents having no real advantage over the younger kids.Because it's a \\"card game\\" that doesn't require the little ones to try holding a fanned out 'hand', it's a great game for them to start with. Just don't play when tired, your brain will freeze up. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome game","review":"SET is so much fun! Everyone has an equal opportunity to win or lose, no matter the ages.

It is an engaging exercise in pattern matching that provides equal footing for players of all ages (ages 4-5 and up).Our seven-year old can win this game against her elders without any \\"special rules\\" or other such condescensions. Usually games that young children can realistically play and win are based on chance and don't involve much thinking.This game is based on the ability to mentally organize four categories and is quick and easy to learn, without waiting turns and without many rules to learn. These features also make it very easy to play with people who have never played it before. There is not much they need to know before starting the game. (Hint: study the examples on the box to jump-start your understanding.)An excellent game, just excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Game","review":"Like Apples to Apples, SET, a Game of Visual Perception, is appealing to many ages. The directions are difficult to grasp at first, but as you follow the instructions and learn to play the game with the \\"simple\\" set, the object of the game grows clear. It was successful on Christmas Day for the 9 year old all the way up to Granny and Grampy. We could play in sets of 2 to 6 and anything in between. It can be fast or slow depending on the players. What I liked best of all is that everyone is working toward the same goal and so when someone finds a \\"set\\" the other players often respond with encouraging words and admiration.An added benefit are the skills associated with visual perception and brain development. Can't help thinking it will help my kids with the SAT/ACT someday or at least increase the likelihood of passing geometry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for kids and adults also helps learn useful skills","review":"We played after family dinner with kids from 4 to 15, and adults too. Great way to get everybody to interact with each other, and the kids were so pumped up by how well they did compared to the adults. This is not a silly game, and kids get great thinking skills from it. My daughter is learning disabled and did REALLY well, it made her proud of how well she could think and gave her lots of positive feedback. I like to play it alone with her when we don't have time for more complicated games at night, but it also works very well in large and diverse groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is wonderful for almost all ages!","review":"This is probably one of the best games that I have ever played. Not only is it fun, but it is educational and challenging as well. It can be difficult at times, because the part of your brain that you use to play is often neglected. It takes a little while to get the hang of it, but once you understand it, you'll never want to stop! It's sometimes frustrating for some people, but I love solving puzzles like this, so the challenge is exciting for me. It can be played by yourself or with more people. Apparently, students at a university in the South were required to master this game, among other things, in order to earn their PhD. Try it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding game!","review":"I was introduced to this game at a dinner party and have been hooked since.

We regularly work on social and personal skills. SET reminds my students to think before they speak (saying \\"SET\\" without a set, just to beat someone else to it, costs a point!)and helps the more hyperactive student concentrate. It was also a fun game for my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for Halloween","review":"I just purchased this for my Red Riding Hood costume, in red of course, and it's great. I was worried it would look cheap, but that was not the case at all. It has a little weight to it, and the hood falls around your head beautifully. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the button on the cloak. You can't see it in the picture because it on the inside of the cloak, but it connects loosely around the neck. It kept un-buttoning, but I just put a safety pin there and it worked great. Overall, a really good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"One of the best books I've ever read.

She's wearing a miniskirt and she looks hideous in it. She probably thinks she looks very ~HawWWTtt1~ in that skirt. I think the skirt looks nice, but not on her.

When I was a horn student in Highschool back in the 80's, my parents brought it back for me from Europe. I have been looking for this recording on CD ever since then because I completely wore the record out. It is absolutely the best horn playing you will EVER hear. I used to play the record at least ten times a day - it inspired me to practice four hours a day and to despair that I would never play half as well as this genius. It brought tears to my eyes to hear it again and to remember what it was like to fall in love with Horn music and to spend so many happy hours rejoicing in the sound this man made with this wonderful instrument.

The man is question is a deeply flawed one, driven by many of the seven sins. When he kills his girl friend and flees in his car, he has what would appear to be a fatal accident. Instead, he mysteriously finds himself in the land of Ata. Thus, begins this fantastical Utopian tale.The book is simply written and chronicles one man's entry into a world where the dream state is reality. It is a world where unconditional acceptance of others prevails, and symbolically all are spokes in the circular wheel of life. Much of the book is redolent of Christian ideals. How much of Ata is in this man's mind and how much of it is truly real, I leave to the individual reader to discern. It is comforting to think, however, that the kin of Ata just may be waiting for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You","review":"I had read this book some years back and I liked it then and wanted to re-read it.

By the end of the DVD Vinny is singing along with everyone else, and if you watch the whole DVD it teaches kids to not let negative attitudes get them down - Ernie keeps on going despite what Vinny says/does.Great DVD to start your toddler/preschool kid on the ABCs and 123s.

They were a little younger when I first bought it and while the storyline (Ernie finds a 'Furry Arms' room key on the street, returns it to the hotel & starts teaching everyone how to count) went over their heads at first, the catchy tunes, skits & scenes (mainly from the early Sesame Street episodes) soon caught their attention. There's a cohesive plot & everything links well.Now my 3-year-old knows most of the words and even my one-and-a-half can say some numbers - it's a great video, fun to watch even for adults, and I highly recommend it.Learning about Letters is more of a cut-and-paste of other Sesame Street skits & scenes - not that this isn't good, just that it's standard fare. I like that they are taken from the earlier Sesame Street episodes as I prefer the quality then.

The thing is I found this book is not that easy to read, especially the part for general processes, i.e. predictable times, accessible times, predictable projections, etc. By browsing the book, I can only grasp the results they derive, but can't follow the details because of the heavy machinery. Nevertheless, this books contains full details, compared to 'Limit Theorems for Stochastic Processes' (I haven't read all, neither have I read C. Dellacherie and P. A.

He created an atmosphere that was mysterious and new to me. It drew me in to want a more conscious understanding and realization of what really happened. Elie described each camps treatment with great visuality so I could identify what was going on, but did not disgust me to the point to stop reading. This book showed how people act when they are in an extreme situation and that you need to be independent to survive. His words brought out emotions of sadness and helplessness and the question of why it took the world so long to acknowledge and respond to this great massacre of people. The book Night had an enormous impact on me which has made me curious to know more about the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to...","review":"I had to read Night By: Elie Wiesel in my High School English Class. At first I did not want to read this book. I wasen't interested, nor did I have time. But once I got passed the first 25 pages, I got into the book. It has a great story, even though it isn't a joyful topic. The Holocaust was an awful event that killed millions of people, Jewish included. This book is a great illustration of this event in history. It has an unforgettable message that will make you think about what happened. Through the book, you get to travel into a death camp with a young boy who is present for a lot of horrible things. I am happy that my English teacher made us read this book, it has put a new perspective into my life. Thank You Mr. VanVickle!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent recounting of an incredibly horrible event","review":"In Night, Elie Wiesel shows life in a Nazi concentration camp from a very personal perspective. This perspective gives the reader a special insight that the typical mundane fact-laden history book just can't give. This is probably about as close as you can get to having an idea of what concentration camp life (there's an oxymoron for you) was like without having to actually go through it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breathtaking Story","review":"This book was an excellent one and one of the best I have read all year. Wiesel uses simple language and sentece structure, making this story even more moving. He just comes out and says what many go in circles trying to express.When Mrs. Monguillon, my English teacher, gave us this book, I looked at the title and thickness and thought, \\"Oh great, a children's book!\\" Boy, was I in for a surprise!I heard that Elie did actually met one of his sisters again after the war. If he did, that's great. I think I will check out some more of Elie Wiesel's books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was very heart warming but at the same time cruel and unusual.

Overall I thought the book was exellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End","review":"Night was a very touching book. He held ones attention up until the end. Elie gave you a realistic feeling of how it must have felt to be in the scariest place ever. He stayed strong and gave hope when hope could not be found. He made it easy to read and not so gross that we all became sick when we read it.The only part of the book I would do over would be the ending. I did not feel it gave out as much feeling and depth as the rest of the book. It left the reader hanging because you just do not know what happened next. The rest of the book told you where he was at and how he felt and the end did not. It made the book incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Holcaust Book","review":"I liked this book because it shows the reality of violence and hate and how it affects people. There was nothing in this book that I really disliked, or anything that I would change. Elie's purpose for writing this book is to tell the world his story from the Holocaust, and open people's to the suffering that went on. The most memorable part for me was when Elie's father died, and because of all the pain he went through he had no more tears to cry. This is an excellent book that everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Festive Book.","review":"My thoughts on the book are wow, it had so many realistic parts in it.

But other than that I would suggest this book to others"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a realistic and well wrote book.","review":"I throughly enjoyed Night. I appericate the fact that not all Holocaust victims are cheerful and happy they were left to live. He shows how such a horrible thing can affect us all. Elise Wiesel is a very brave man to write such personal thoughts and angers to the public. The book itself is well written, surprisingly so, since it was an autobiography and I doubt he thought he was going to be a writer when he was young. I recommend this book, but be warned, it isn't flowery at all. And Mr.Wiesel makes no attempt to hide just how bad it affected him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary.

I was not impressed with this book at all. I have read many many books on the subject of the Holocaust, including some by eyewitnesses and survivors, and I have to say that this is the first time I would not recommend a particular book on this subject. The narrator did not hold my attention at all, I found myself skipping pages, looking for more substance. I finished reading it, and frankly, I found it lacking in historic and personal meaning. Excellent authors on the subject of the Holocaust are Simon Wiesenthal and William Styron (Sophie's Choice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicole Bratlie","review":"I thought this book was a very inspiring book.

Other than the start of the book, it held my interest thruoghout the book. The book was interesting and at the same time sickening. It was awful to find out everything that the Germans did to the Jews. Some of the camps they were sent too werent that bad, but when Hitler found out that the camp was being to humane he would have the guy that was the head of the camp killed. Then the camps that were descent would become inhumane and the Jews would get hardly any food, and would get beaten all of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massacre of the Jews","review":"I like the book because it tells us what kind of a man that hitler was and how the jews had to live for 6 years.

Overall, my expreience was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid and unforgettable","review":"A true account of a teenager's experience in the horrors of concentration camps, Night is both vivid and apalling. Elie Weisel isn't very wordy, instead, he uses base imagery to describe the nightmare of the Holocaust. In the beginning of the book, the Jews cling to optimism, even after being forewarned by one of their own. But as the story progresses, Elie loses his hope, his faith, almost his will to live. Only th presence of his father keeps Elie fighting for life. The most remarkable thing about Night is the way it shows everyones' different reactions to the concentration camps. This book exposes raw human nature, when humans are forced to face a horrifying ordeal. Night, despite its depressing topic, is a book that's hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"The book is trilling and exciting and each time you stop reading it you want to read more of and keep going.

The author's style of writing is so penetrating and piercing to your mind and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is one of the best books I have ever read. It is such a dramatic story of one 15 year old boy's will to survive in a concentration camp. He lost his mother and his sister but he would not give up. This young boy holds on to his father and tries to not lose him. All through the story the young boy survived with little food and water. All around him people were dying and beaten. The boy himself was beaten many times, but that did not stop him. I recommend this book to everyone. It is such a good story, and it tells what really happened in the dark time of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night was a fantastic novel","review":"Elie Weisel did an excellent job in writing this book. It may not seem to be a difficult read, but if you only read it once you haven't even scratched the surface of the book's meaning. I've read this book several times over the past few years and every time I read it I find new meaning in the words. Mr. Weisel wrote with book with a lot of care and I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so and for those who own it, read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\"","review":"The editor and most other reviewers have done a great job in reviewing this book, and I can only add a few things from my viewpoint. I thought that I was past tears, and I wasn't. I thought that I could forget, and I couldn't. But the lessons of history should not be repeated over and over again by generations that forget. The first steps to Auschwitz are the steps of blaming the innocent and glorifying the guilty. Some even do it in the name of God or Country or Policing the World or Rescuing the World. Let us begin by rescuing ourselves and living our lives as examples, not rescuing the past or the future or God or Country. When we have proven our own worthiness and freedom from evil beyond all doubt, then we may avoid the Auschwitzs in our own country. That is all we can do for history and for ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-read","review":"I found it to be one of the most moving and captivating books I have ever read.

But as far a literary works go, this book certainly is nothing special. Weisel's attempts to inject the story with emotional descriptions (I am not suggesting his experiences were not gut-wrenching) turn out a bit lame, and it doesn't make for great reading.

Good for a history student, of little value to a bookworm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detached account of a horrific event","review":"Night, by Eli Wiesel, is the story of a fifteen-year old Jew imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Wiesel wrote this book about fifteen years after the event in order to distance himself from it somewhat (obviously, the experience left too much of an impact to ever be forgotten.)Through his direct prose and straight language, Wiesel informs the reader of the horrors of the Holocaust. SS guards, barracks, showers, transportation, death marches, rations ... nothing escapes without Wiesel's observations. However, the book lacked description, perhaps because the experience was still too painful for Wiesel to recall-or perhaps because words do not exist to describe the trial.If only one book is read about the people behind the Holocaust, it should be Anne Frank's Diary. However, if one book is read about the Holocaust itself, Eli Wiesel's Night is compelling, shocking, and enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review of Night","review":"I read this book because, it was an english assignment and I thought that this book would be boring like all the rest.

The actual events and that this book deals with is very diturbing and depressing. I believe that this book should be read by all so that mybe this horrible tragedy and terrible injustice agaist a group of people will never happen again.

Even though this is a very short book, you quickly pick up on the characters personalities, strenghts and weaknesses.

It told how some of the prisoners still showed courage and compassion towards others while most of the other prisoners were greedy, selfish pigs.

He writes this account so matter of factly, so unemotionally that one cannot help but feel the numbness that he must have felt while being a prisoner there. One gets the feeling that to be numb there was to survive. It is heartbreakingly truthful without all of the flowery filler that we are so used to in today's writing.Not many books move me to tears.

Night is filled with a dark environment and tragic events that makes you want to keep reading because you must learn what happened during the Holocaust.

It was written by a man who was once a young teenager in a concentration in Auschwitz, Buna, and Buchenwald. It is a story that tells what really went on in those concentration camps during the holocaust. Elie and his father were both transported from the ghetto to Auschwitz, along with his mother and sisters who were never seen again after the point of split up when they got off the train. This book will really get to you, and it is a little hard to understand but, htis is a must read book. I recomend reading this book just so that people can really understand what it was like and the horrible things that went on in the concentration camps. Hitler tried to say that being a Jew was a race, something that he could not prove. He tried to prove it though.

The horrific things he witnessed made me cry for him and the people involved. This man witnessed Evil, pure unadulterated Evil.

The Germans made them work & work they only got a certian amount of food, they somtimes didn't even have any clothes, they also were seperated from there families. Alot of the Jews were killed durring this time period.Night makes you stop and think about how easy we have it because we didn't have to go through anything like that.I like Night because it is true and it was how life really was, it was also very interesting to read about the Jews and there lives in the early 1900's I belive you should read it, so you can understand what they had to go through & how hard it was to be a Jew in the early 1900's & how easy it is for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"Before I decided to read Night, I had a numb kind of feeling towards the Holocaust.

Night brought the Holocaust and smacked me in the face with it. I have never ever been so shocked by a book. I cried, and I rejoiced. Every person in this modern day should read night. I think it would show us all what hatred can do.

He found an unlikely teacher in a man named \\"Moshe the Beadle.\\" Moshe taught his pupil that man could not understand God's answers to man's questions; man could only ask God the right questions.

It is a true story, which makes it more interseting to read. You can feel Elie's emotions as he explains all of the horrible things that he, his friends and family had to go through during the war.

This book also displays true events that occured durring the Holocaust.I enjoyed reading this book because I liked the way that there was never a dull moment.

I had always heard about the Holocaust and had even seen shows and movies about the Holocaust, but I did not understand the extent of the Holocaust until I read Night. Reading the novel, I felt as if I was there suffering right along side of Elie as he struggled to stay alive.

It was a very good novel and I believe I would recommend reading it if you have not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night, a long nightmare.","review":"You can't say much about likes in this book because its mostly violence. There is nothing to dislike about this book. It tells a story that people went through not to long ago. This is a part of history. I like the book just the way it is I would not change anything about it. You can never change the past. Elie's purpose for writing this book was to let the people know what really went during the Holocaust. Some say the Holocaust never happened, I wish they would tell that to the millions of people who died or the ones that lived but never got to see their mother, father, son, daughter, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, cousin, or any other family member again. One man led this horrible nightmare.

I think he wanted people to know the horrors they experienced and how they had to sacrifice everything to survive.

And the book was a true story that made it even worse. What I disliked about the book was just about everything because no one should be treated like that and I really didn't like reading about it. You really can't change it. He told the true even though it was bad. I think the purpose for publishing the book was to let people know how the Jews were treated and how unfair it was to them. The most memorable part (which I really don't want to remember) was when they were using the children for target practice. That was horrible.The book to me was not good in the sense of what was in it.

This book definetly offers an in depth look into the holocoust(sp?) that no teacher can teach"},{"rating":"2","title":"English Assignment","review":"I think this book would be a good choice to read because it puts a slightly different perspective on the Halocaust. Elie Wiesel's account of this tragedy is more about the moral issues of the victims and of the feelings and thoughts that crossed their minds. The book does not talk as much about the unspeakable cruelty of World War II but more about the heart ache that went with it. The book is also good if you have not read any Halocaust survivor stories since it is rather short. It grabs your attention right away and does not let it go. You can get a better grip on what the Jews and many other minorities went through during this time. Which I think was the authors goal when he wrote this. He wanted to try and let the book identify with people as much as possible. It is very moving and you feel as if you are going through each struggle with this 15 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"night\\" sky contains 4 stars","review":"The book Night, by Elie Wiesel is an extremely interesting read. This nonfiction story about Elie Wiesel's childhood is a life-struggling journey through many parts of Germany from the 1930's to the 1940's. This book will draw in the reader on the first page. The descriptions of the concentration camps are uncanny. It's almost as if the reader was really there right next to Wiesel fighting for his life alongside him. The great thing about this book is that it is a short read that can be accomplished within the vicinity of a few days.Elie Wiesel has many people in his story who, for the most part, keep him alive. He meets a young musician his age, and his father who \\"saves his life\\" on numerous occasions. By this it means that he will not let his son give up on hoping for life. This is a heart warming, yet a tragic, story of Nazi Germany and a young boys struggle. I would easily consider this book for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying","review":"I read this book over the summer for my freshman English Honors class. To say the least, it is one of the most horrifyingly objective and meaningful books ever written. I read it in a single evening, unable to put it down. It was like a car wreck-It was terrible, but I had to finish it. I couldn't stand not reading it.The spiritual, emotional, and physical changes that Elie goes through serve as a frightening allegory to the condition of the human race, as well as teaching a lesson about the tides of war. Simply perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teriffic Book","review":"Elie Wiesel's book, Night, was excellent. To me, it was very moving and had a strong meaning to it. The horrific incidents that occured in this novel were worthwhile to learn. It not only showed the hardships the prisoners had to go through, but also the suffering and many deaths that occured. To me, the book sent out a strong message to the readers. Overall, this book has taught me much and had a strong impact on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"The book Night was an excelent book to read about the jewish hollicost. It gives an insiders views on what went on during this time in history with the jews. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that Elie didn't tell us what happend after the hollicost ended. I wouldn't change the book because Elie was really there and he knows what happened. Elie wrote this book to let people know the truth. The most memorable part in the book was when the jews were released."},{"rating":"2","title":"starlightnight","review":"I liked the fact that this book displayed good illustrations of what the holocuast was really like. The book was kinda of strung out i thought it could have been completed in a shorter period of time. If i could change anything about the book i would maybe focus on the actions of hitler more and show how he was directly involved in the killings. Ellies purpose for writing this book was for people to realize how bad it really was to be a jew in put in that situation, it described some real life events to show how crazy the holocaust really was.The part were they were killed for marching outta step, i really thought that was a little drastic, but it showed how much you had to focus just to keep your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A testament","review":"This was a powerful testament to a dark period of human history.

Thanks for your quick reply!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Disturbing","review":"This is an excellent, and true, first-hand account of the horrors of Nazi concentration camps. It affected me and was greatly disturbing, as most accounts of this subject are. The strength and the ability to persevere and overcome the most extreme of human suffering is inspiring, yet should be unnecessary. This book is a graphic account of WWII atrocities. The memories and images from it will always stay with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very educational book on the holocaust.","review":"This book is very good. I found it quiet moving at a lot of times. The only thing I didn't like is that during the book he would mention things that he did after the war and it kind of made the book less thrilling. But other than that I thought it was a great book. Another great book is \\"I am David\\" if you like \\"Night\\" then you'll like \\"I am David\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, gripping, fast paced.","review":"A spartan, gripping account of Wiesel's personal horrifying experiences as a jewish teenage boy taken with his family by the Nazi's and suffering through the work camps. His only mantra becomes \\" Stay with my father\\".As a mother with two small children at home, I read this book in a day ( I am not sure what my kids were doing whilst I was so engrossed.) but this is simply an unforgettable, haunting book.I have given away my own personal copy of this book and rebought another...several times.If you are interested in personal accounts of the holocaust or tales of extraordinary survival against the odds, I cannot recommend NIGHT enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night by Elie Weisel","review":"Before I read this book, I knew little about the Holocaust. While I read Night, I started to realize how bad it must have been to be one of the jews in the concentration camps. Being starved and worked to death in the fields, then the crematories, unbelieveable. But it wasn't until the night that the SS made all of the jews run in the freezing snow that I started to feel their pain. In Night, Elie Weisel described how he and his father struggled to survive the whole time, when at the end they came so close to collapsing. They helped each other subsist by sharing their only ration of bread each day with one another. When I got to the end, I was so relieved, yet angered with what had happened during this terrible time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"Night is a reality book. Its very and impacting. It showed me as a fifteen-year-old girl that not everyones life is a walk in the park. People suffer and experience things that are immoral and damaging.Night showed me a new prespective to the Holocaust.Night was easy to comprehend and exciting. You always want to know where they will be sent next and how they will be treated.Most of the time I dont get into books and I dont like to read. I read Night in two days after school and it was very appealing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! A Crowd Pleaser","review":"I have just got done reading \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel. It was a very good book. I enjoyed this book so much I couldn't put it down. The book gives people a real description of how the Holocaust was, and how the Germans treated the Jews. It is a sad book. The Germans did so many mean things to the Jews. I felt that Elie Weisel did a great job on telling this story and what it was like when the Germans took over; put the Jews on trains, and at the concentration camps. If I was in his position, I don't know if I could let all those people know what happened to him. I would try and forget about it even though you couldn't forget about something like that. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing - it changed my view of life","review":"the book NIGHT by Elie Wiesel portrays a young Jewish boy's journey through the Holocaust. From when he gots taken away, to when the book ends, I couldn't put it down (and i'm not the most avid of readers). The fact that his and his father's life was in Elie's hands kept you in suspense from beginning to end. A simple crumb of bread or a drop of water, can determine life or death. After reading this book, i noticed many things i would have taken for granted otherwise. I started to be grateful that i'm alive, and how fragile life really is. NIGHT taught me one of life's most valuable lessons. NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is truly a masterpiece, as it brings you along on his journey through the Holocaust, with death looking upon him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ONE word out of place","review":"This is a book that makes the most of simple, well-chosen English to create a powerful, poetic picture. The whole thing can be read through in a couple of hours, and then read again to pick up all those exquisite images created by the author's prose.Even if you are not interested in the Holocaust, you can read this book if for no other reason than to see an example of powerful writing that is balanced and not overwrought with detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"?Why Jews Suffered?","review":"The novel Night by Elie Wiesel inspired our freshmen class. The content of the book was based on a true story. It was a story that went into great detail on what went on and what millions of Jews went through. The story dealt with the suffering Jewish men, women, and children endured. Elie and his father went through many concentration camps through his teenage years. He dealt with disease, death, starvation, and hard labor work. I liked this book becasue it shows how cruel people are, and what went on to the millions of innocent Jewish people."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 8th Grader's Opinion","review":"Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" was on our booklist for school.

I loved it...because it showed Humanity at its darkest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I think that this was a pretty good book. It told all the things that had happened while they were there. He used great detail and you could tell that he put a lot of feeling into this book.I now realize how lucky we are to have been born in a differnt time era then that. I feel so bad for everone who had to live through that. They must have been really strong people. This was a really sad book and it really makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality overpassed fantasy...","review":"Ellie Wiesel's Night, describes with short, powerful words hell itself. He was only fifteen years old when night covered his life and took him in its profound inners. Every page has many different messages and confessions that make the reader see through Ellie's eyes death in all senses. His God died, his mother and little sister were turned into ashes and his father was a martyr until death.Night is a book that can't be compared. The entire euphony of the words left me simmering; I can't even imagine the waves of emotions that asfixiated this boy's soul.The book is a journey through the many varied shades of the night;powerful, honest, no compromises.It is a true literary masterpiece, but what is shocking is the fact that it had to be written. As Whitman once said, war is ninety nine parts diarrhea. Reality overpassed fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is one of the most descriptive acoounts!!!","review":"NIGHT was one of the most descriptive accounts written down for everyone to read. How the author lived to tell his story is beyond me. everyone who reads the book will cry and might of nightmares because of the details that were within. All in all, the book is one of the best and it should be used in history class across the country to show people what really happen in the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is great","review":"i am an 8th grade student in a college level english course. most books we are required to read are terrible. this one was the only good one of the whole year"},{"rating":"1","title":"night","review":"I relly did not like this book but i had to read it. If you like learnig stuff you should read this book i learned a lot but it is about the jews durring the hollicost. It is baseed on a true story. you also might enjoy this book if you like sad stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary for NIght","review":"Personally, i didn't like Night simply because it contained material that was too graphic for a reader such as I. Too many times the book told of people getting burnt to death, hung, shot, or beaten. That kind of stuff makes me think more of people dying then of the message the author was trying to get across to the readers.If the author had based the book more on the whole Holocaust event and not on his personal accounts, i think that i would have enjoyed reading the book more. I thought that the book wouldn't had been a personal story so i when i found out that it was a personal story i wasn't as interested in it. I do think that writing a story like that would take a lot of courage on the authors part but i just don't feel good about reading of babies and women getting killed over another person's prejuduce way of viewing the rest of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elie Wiesel - Night","review":"I think that this book was disgusting. It was well writin, but very graphic. It told the story the way it really was which was good in a way but bad in others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes for an unsophisticated read","review":"Ellie Wiesel does not know how to write a book!!! He tries to make his novel dramatic by writing one line paragraphs and short, terse phrases. While reading the novel, Wiesel writing style makes him seem more like one who has researched the holocaust endlessly than an actual survivor of the horrific event. Actual first hand accounts of the holocaust by concentration camp survivors are few and far between. That is why I gave this book two stars rather than one. When Wiesel can buffer up his writing, I'm sure his novels will be great and remembered works of literature; for now, they are immature writings by an unknowledgable author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does it have to be so sad???","review":"I was assigned to read this book for socratic seminar in our eigth grade class. While we read it in class, one of the boys actually started to cry! But on the other hand, it's hard to believe that someone would acctually DO such HORRIBLE things!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate v. Life","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a very real and provocative story. It's very emotional and true. The true story of Elie and his father is well documented in this little book. So compact, yet so life-changing. Elie struggles with his trust in G-d. \\"G-d is dead.\\" In the camps, people be came so desensitized, that they couldn't even bring themselves to cry for the death of a close relative. \\"To cry was to die.\\" It has changed the way I think about life and hatred. How fragile they both are... And how they simply cannot mix or the outcome will be awful. A single drop of hate can kill; thus, changing the lives of thousands (and Millions in the case of the Holocaust). I've listened to the stories that my grandmother told me about her experiences during the Holocaust. Wiesel tells the story exactly the way it happened for himself as well as countless others. Being able to relate to the book is a plus, but Night is definately meant for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elie Wiesel's Journey","review":"Night was a very intresting book.It's very descriptive. Elie's true experience was very emotional. As soon as we started reading this book in our Freshman class, you could tell that evryone was enjoying the book. Night opened our eyes to the horrors of the Hollocost and made us realize how much freedon we have. Not only are we fortunate, but Elie Wiesel was very lucky to make it through the Hollocost.I think that Elie Wiesel is a good author because, he told the story very well. It was detailed and intresting and not at all boring,like most non-fiction books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downfall of the Jews","review":"The novel Night by Elie Wiesel was a great book. The book dealt with Hitler, hating the Jews. This is a true story about a boy who went through the Holocaust. This novel describes the pain and suffering the Jews went through.This book is recommended by us to learn facts about how the Germans critically decreased the population of the Jews in the concentration camps. This book will inspire you greatly to treat others with the same respect you would want.If you read this book and think it is good try the other recommended books. The books are written as a trilogy, Dawn, and The Accident. These books are all written by Elie Wiesel himself. He is a great author and actually experienced the horror of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrelenting... A book that should never be forgotten.","review":"I know this book is already acclaimed and pretty much reccommended by everyone, but I felt I had to put in my own two cents. This book was so unrelenting, so horrifying..it's not a story about an adventure. It's not a story about a hero triumphing over his villain. This book is a essentially a series of horrific and tragic events happening to a young boy, and how he survives them. As Elie Wiesel says in the novel, \\"Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as God himself. Never.\\" And neither should we."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night","review":"This book is about a fifteen year old boy who was taken with his family to the concentration camps during Hitler's rampage. He and his father were seperated from his mother and sisters. He tells about life in the concentration camps and their struggle for servival.This was a good book. Some parts were suspensefull and some were funny. It was sad, although not as tragic as I thought it to be. In the end it was sad that his dad could not make it since they had been through so moch together. I do not understand, though, how they were able to detach their feelings and relationship to family members during this time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This novel is one of the few books that is hard to put down. Its about the hardships of a fifteen year old boy during World War II. This book is a perfect example of what our world should not ever do again. No one should have to face what the Jewish people went through in the concentration camps. To think something so horrific would happen in the twentieth century! These are some of the realities we have to face, that such hate was in this world and still i today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the incidents","review":"With less covert descriptions than most holocaust books, \\"Night\\" effectively shows the incidents of the holocaust. It is a mournful, yet truthful story of terrible and horrific events.Some critics remark that the book is \\"too grotesque\\" for readers, but the pains of the past must be realized than be avoided.This book is recommended for high schoolers and older, and certainly not for children due to excessive brutality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The long year","review":"This book was very great.

Maybe that person was just trying to get a reaction, and that's fine. But there is no way you can compare this to a classic like Appetite. As far as \\"On Down the Road\\", it is a very good album. Izzy knows what kind of music he wants to do and he does it very well. It seemed like a long time between the JuJu Hounds and 117 degrees, but Axl has proved that Izzy was working rather quickly! Pick up this album if you're an Izzy/Slash/Duff/GNR fan, it's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as previous efforts","review":"I give this album only two stars because it only has two good songs on it! They are \\"Sweet Caress\\" and \\"Lot To Learn,\\" all the other songs are pretty empty and without much feeling that Izzy Stradlin usually carries in his music. I was so disappointed in this album and I have been anticipating it's release for awhile. Hopefully Izzy will redeem himself on the next one.

You can't go wrong with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breach of Promise by James Scott Bell","review":"After having read many books by James Scott Bell, and being extremely pleased with his mysteries, I was surprised to experience a complete \\"downer\\" in this book. All the way through the book, I felt uncomfortable. The book was told in the first person which made the main character's feelings even more depressing.

That said, this is the worst book I have ever read all the way through, well mostly. I gave up and scanned the last 20% of the book and only because one of the previous reviews mentioned the unbelievable ending.The characters were poorly developed and unbelievable. Not even caricatures could be as shallow as this bunch.The courtroom scenes were melodramatic and untrue to life. The anger of the father character was totally unrealistic for a man genuinely trying to get custody or visitation with his child.This ranks in the top 5 of the worst books I've ever read.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight Indeed are the Bonds of Love","review":"Tight indeed are the bonds of love. Love drives lovers to act irrationally, spontaneously, defensively, protectively. Betrayal devastates and separates.

This is definitely a read again book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read; with a healthy dose of reality!","review":"One of the things I like about Bell is his honest approach toward writing. Having been involved in a custody dispute myself in the past, it is easy for me to identify with the main character. Men have a history (sadly) of being biased against when placed on opposing ends of the family courtroom.Without spoiling the ending; suffice it to say that if you are looking for a warm fuzzy conclusion, you might not find it. Bell is a stickler for reality, and he delivers in this book. Through faith in God and devotion to his child, the main character finds strength that he never knew existed. In the end, the final pages will, if nothing else, give you pause....and a deeper faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner","review":"I loved this book for several reasons: The beautiful portrait of a father's love for his daughter, the flawed but lovable character of that father, and the gut wrenching agony of a custody battle and all that goes with it.

It is impossible to even get a decent piece of toast out this thing.

I waited and stopped it at 4 min and it was not good enough and turned it back to 10 mins. I went to see what my toddler was doing and sure enough the smoke alarm went off. I had a fire in my toaster and smoke everywhere!! It was a horrible experience. Granted that it was my fault for letting the toast go for 10 mins, but if it did its job as a real toaster, I would not have almost burned my kitchen down.Aesthetically, its nice looking and the crumb tray is the best thing about it.

I am impressed by the author's ability to get us inside the minds of characters from another century and another culture (I am not Chinese). I found it fascinating, and have read it twice. It inspired me to read more fiction set in this same time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Definitely not the best book I've ever read. Not even mediocre. The plot started out okay, but then went in a completely different direction. The characters were not \\"alive\\", the description of the \\"set\\" was...okay...but what really bothered me was the plotline. It was as if the author didn't have a cohesive plan other than the very beginning and the very end, and then shoved in as many disjointed and confusing action scenes he possibly could. After reading it I immediately gave it away. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, BAD, BAD!","review":"I had to read this book for school and it was so bad that I didn't read the whole thing. The day before the test I had to force myself to TRY to read the book. Luckily, I was spared and did not have to read thanks to my motion sickness on the bus.And anyways, even though our teacher said that he was a good rescearcher, he got some facts wrong. As said in another review, the Ox and Tiger come after one another. It's impossible that Chen was four years older. Also, it's kind of overrated how Hong has about 5 different father-figures."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this book","review":"It totally sucked to me compared to <u> 7 Daughters 7 Sons</u>. Both of which my teacher made me read at school.One of the reasons was becuase this auther had absolutely NO idea about Chinese history, tradions and blah blah blah. One of the mistakes is that the Year of the Tiger and Ox are only One year apart so there was no way that they would be four years apart unless Malcolm Bosse has some dumb*ss to help him write this book.Another thing is how dumb this book is. Chen tries to seduce a girl and only think about them as well. He doesnt care for anything but his studies and even that isn't enough. When his brother is hurt badly he doesn't even seem to notice.He is so wierd and obviously out of touch with the world.The story is entirly for people who don't give a damn about what they're reading. So take it from me and all those other people. DONT EVEN TOUCH THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"River Pirates!!??","review":"The plot twists were minimal and predictable.

It was foreign or for other countries usage. Very disappointed that it did not state this when I ordered it.Love the movie and wanted it but was concerned to re order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinema Paradiso","review":"Another three-hour monster covering most of a man's life. Actually, the life of a special friendship between a projector operator in an old theater and a wonderfully naughty ten-year-old boy. It alternates between the amusing and the sad, as life will do, and you'll think about it after it's over.Writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore has an excellent visual sense. He must, if I noticed it. Also, he has a very obvious love of old movies, and I wonder just how much of this is autobiographical. The truth doesn't matter. The ability to make me wonder is the point. Character-based stories do that. I've been preaching it to novelists for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful coming of age movie.

Ego? Greed? I bought this edition because I thought it included both the old and new versions (the jacket is a bit misleading...), I was sadly mistaken. By the end of this film I knew more about these people than my own family and I felt as if I'd been watching them in \\"real time\\". There were no thoughts left unspoken, no questions left unanswered, wrapped up nice and tight like an episode of \\"Murder She Wrote\\".

A famous film director (Toto) returns home to Sicily after staying away for 30 years. He reflects back on his childhood. As a young boy, Toto had a fascination with movies. Toto's Father is missing in Russia in World War and is never to return. A film projectionist takes the child under his wing and mentors him in film projection as well as life as he grows to be a man. He ultimately encourages Toto to continue his studies and leave Sicily \\"forever\\" so he can blossom. Story highlights the impact that films had on the community during this era - symbols of friendship, love, hope, dreams, a better life. The story line, the cinematography and the music are all first rate in this movie classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the Original First","review":"\\"Cinema Paradiso\\" as released over a dozen years ago in American theatres (and on VHS), and \\"Cinema Paradiso -- The New Version\\" on DVD, are very different movies, in my opinion. Fortunately both are included on the new DVD, so it's a great contribution to anyone's DVD library.I'm among those who feel the original was better, and so I urge you to watch the American theatrical release first. That's the one that got the Oscar. And that's the better work of art, IMHO. Nevertheless, the New Version will be irresistable to those who love the original, even though it may burst a few bubbles wisely left intact in the 1990 release."},{"rating":"1","title":"the director's cut was a great disappointment","review":"Most director's cuts of movies have novelty values. Some such as Blade Runner or the Extended Version of The Fellowship of the Ring not only enhance the experience but also made one wonder why the original versions were released at all. Sadly, the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso was a major disappointment. The addional footage in the first half, such as Toto losing his virginity were inconsequential, however the addition of a major sequence in the second half, when after the funeral, Toto met and rekindled his relationship with the now older Elena altered the trajectory of the movie and worst of all, diminished the emotionally charged ending.The original version of Cinema Paradiso is one of my favourite films of all time. There is also little doubt that Tornatore is a wonderful film maker, however, in this case, the original editor(s) deserved praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy this","review":"I had this movie on my wish list until I just checked the specifications and saw that it is dubbed. I want it in the original Italian with subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatrical Version's Better!!!","review":"I'm overjoyed that this is apparently going to be the 155-minute theatrical version! The extended version tags on another 20 minutes of belaboring the already made point that you can't visit, go back to or recapture the past. I will NEVER watch the extended \\"New\\" version again. The theatrical version won an Oscar for a reason - it was already wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic perfection. A work of art.","review":"When this film debuted at Cannes, it received a standing ovation. Once you've seen it, you'll know why. It simply doesn't get any better than this. Three cheers for Toto and Fredo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-cut the director's cut!","review":"The original version of this movie is wonderful - hence the Academy Award. The ending is one of the truly sublime moments in cinematography! The director's cut adds so much melodrama, including footage which besmirches the main character much to the emotional detriment of the film. The result is a mediocre soap opera, and the ending of the movie is totally devoid of emotional punch because the whole arc of the story is ruined by the end of an extra hour's unnecessary footage.Fortunately, the DVD has both versions. Watch the original and love it. Ignore the director's cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version! You must get the director's cut!","review":"I'm giving one star not for the film but for this version only. The director's cut has more than 50 mins additional footage which is vital to the story and was cut to make the film more acceptable to cinema audiences. With these additional scenes, this is an excellent 5-star movie but otherwise, viewers will be unsatisfied. The main bone of contention is that the Elena relationship is not properly resolved in the shorter version so you'll be left wondering how it all turned out. Take my advice, pay a little more and get the full-length version. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My fault, but still frustrated","review":"In searching for this title, almost all of them were sub-titled in English. I selected, purchased, only to find out that is was all in Italian. So, it's basically useless for me. Ended up renting it from a video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This could have been a heartening, romantic-but-realistic memoir conveying the magic of small town life in the 1940s, growing up, etc. Some of this was achieved. But something rotten in Italian culture insists that men are just boys and must always be forgiven and humoured for their dirty jokes, their ogling, their public masturbation, and their use of prostitutes. The women in this film are largely passive, or at least without function. I switched it off about 2/3 of the way through. It was conveying nothing one might wish the human race to live up to. Despite its popularity and the critical acclaim, I think it's just another easy-sell reassurance that nobody needs to grow up. The worst thing a movie can do is to demand little of the viewer, and Cinema Paradiso demands nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"how does it end?","review":"I have attempted to watch this twice. In each case the disc gets \\"hung up/caught\\" somewhere in the middle of the viewing and won't move on. I don't know quite how to describe it. I have watched other movies just to be sure it wasn't my DVD player.Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinema Tedioso","review":"Sorry, i know a lot of people adore this film, but it made me slightly nauseous. It tugs so relentlessly at the heartstrings that it got on my nerves frightfully. Cute little boy who adores cinema, gruff but kindly old man who befriends him, boy saves old man's life in fire and ends up doing his job, crikey, all it needs to complete it is a lovable hairy dog. Also I was shocked that when the boy leaves home he never comes back once to see his mother in 30 years. What kind of a son is he? He could have come back to see his mother on her birthday at least, or for Christmas. I thought Italian men were supposed to be nice to their mothers. Disgraceful. This film kept on trying to make me cry, but I remained resolutely dry-eyed. I prefer films that make me laugh anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornographic","review":"The previews make one think it is a sweet movie about a child who yearns to run a movie projector. That it is, BUT the previews leave out profanity and offensive hand gestures the director makes the children say and do. If I were to imitate in public what the children did in the movie, I would be arrested for public indecency and have to register as a sex offender. And, there are adults that engage in very offensive acts. It is porn and sadly very troubling because the children are made to engage in very blatant immoral activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both versions in one box!","review":"I loved this film in its theatrical release in 1989. I certainly felt it deserved the Academy Award (for best foreign language film). I also loved seeing the full version that lays out all the details of the relationships, and their resolution.I also enjoyed reading everyone's opinion as to whether the original version or the longer one is better. I can't decide myself. But a critical point to make is that THIS DVD contrains both versions (on either side of the DVD). So regardless of which you prefer (and here is the perfect opportunity to find out), it is on this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one word that pops out when watching this: NOSTALGIA!!!","review":"To make it short, this is the one and only movie that makes me cry every time I watch it. It's the kind of movie that melts your heart and keeps you thinking about it for days ahead. Also, I've never heard a soundtrack as beautiful as the one in this movie. It only helps bring out your tears more easily, especially in the last sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the 2002 version","review":"Sometimes, directors should leave well enough alone.Cinema Paradiso in its original version is a lovely, funny movie about a boy growing up. It is one of those movies that can be seen again and again.The director's cut is a mess that clutters up the original story with a totally unnecessary subplot, turns one hero in the movie (Alfredo) into a monster and the other hero (Salvatore) into a stalker. The editing is such a botch that end of the movie becomes meaningless. Had this version been released in 1988, the movie never would have won the Best Foreign Film award.This new version is a textbook case of why directors should not recut their films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"A story about falling in love and meeting people who change our lives forever. It tells the story of growing up and moving away from home, while never forgetting our past and where we are from. The main character (Salvatore) returns to his hometown after 30 years of being away and discovers that he was never really gone. His feelings are unchanged about the people he had affection for while growing up - mainly his first love Elena and Alfredo, the projectionist and his father figure. During his visit, he learns he must let go of some longings and desires that can never be fulfilled. The ending I will not soon forget. I was amazed and felt this is more than just a movie, it is hard to describe in words."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite movies","review":"I have to say that this movie will stay in your heart forever. It is a beautiful film, and I would recommend it to anyone. I first saw it in a films class in college, and I own the sound track which I would also give five stars. Buy the sound track and the movie; you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One","review":"This film is perhaps one of my favorites of all time....it is the story of a friendship beyond the boundries of age...the protoganist lays in bed on a rainy night and remembers life in a dreamy cinematic way...of first loves, pasions, and most of all his friendship with Alfredo...the ending is perfect and will linger with you long after the film is over...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is formated for Europe, not the U.S>","review":"Beware!

I had it reformated by a professional who made a pricing mistake and it cost me $20; otherwise it would have cost $40 to reformat. ..I was determined to have a copy I could play on my dvd.

But they are EXACTLY the SAME MOVIE !!There was no quality control on this item and now I have to send it back . If you order this you RISK getting ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel","review":"I had been all my life in love with movies but I should admit that \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" is probably one of ten top films I ever saw. And not just for the film factor from which the script grows but for the characters, the losing of inocence, the nostalgia of the good old days, the face of that early love that one never will forget, the passion, the beauty, the music and so on and on and on. Cinema paradiso deserves to appear in golden bold upper case type in the History of Cinema. Unbeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and brilliant","review":"The more time that passes, the fonder I become of this movie. I concur with those reviewers who have described it as one of the finest films ever made. I first saw it with a friend on the large screen and was touched beyond words. This film has remained in my memory as one of the most emotionally significant experiences of my adult life. My friend has since died, but I look back on that afternoon with great happiness because we were able to share our mutual passion for Italian films and experience this extraordinary story together. The photography is lovely, the characters memorable, the music heart-breaking, and the story life-affirming. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on something truly wonderful. E' un capolavoro, un miracolo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for original version, 1 star for new version","review":"I must add my voice to others who were disappointed by the \\"Director's Cut\\". Having been so impressed by Tornatore's film the first time, I trusted that he would make it even better. This is not the case. Our favorite little boy, when grown up, is still obsessed with his first love, but so much so that one wishes to slap some sense into him. While trying not to give too much away, watching this middle-aged, grey haired man struggle with purely adolescent issues is nothing short of pathetic. In the case of this movie, less is indeed more. Still buy the DVD if you want -- the original version is there, too, on the flip side. With the original version, you have sweet sentiment and artistic subtlety. With the new version, you have over-the-top sentiment and a tiring soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Version, Same Results","review":"This movie is the director's cut that Miramax Chief Harvey Weinstein chopped down into the US theatrical cut with which most American audiences are most familiar. The \\"new version\\" adds in extra bits here and there throughout the movie, but the most noticeable change is in the third act, where Toto's adult life is given more screen time. The story takes a darker tone here than in the rest of the movie, but it does not diminish the power and beauty of the ending, which has remained intact. This DVD is highly recommended for fans of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic moments from the lion's mouth","review":"This charming reflection of the journey along cinema's history is effortlessly symbolized by the movie poster. A young boy consumed by the magic of emergent technology is carried along life's path, guided by the sage wisdom of a replacement Father figure.For those bored by pithy (pathetic) tough guys and CG SFX - who cares - this film is guaranteed to open up a new world of cinema, particularly for those who usually avoid sub-titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming...","review":"Last year, a good friend of mine, her boyfriend, and her best friend were in a terrible car crash. My friend along with her friend were killed and her boyfriend was seriously injured. Since both my friend and her boyfriend were in my film class, my professor showed this film.At the time, I was impressed with it, the pain of what happened was all too real... but looking back, she made a good choice in showing the film. It showed me a little bit about dealing with loss as well as fulfilling your dreams... It's a wonderful movie about life, love, and passion... check it out for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifique!","review":"At the school that I attend, I was required by my French teacher to watch this movie. At first I was thinking, \\"This is going to be another cheesy foreign film.\\" I was wrong. Although this film had a simple storyline, it represented some complex ideas. The little boy in this film, Afredo, was quite endearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films...a must see","review":"What a movie! This movie will bring tears to the eyes of anyone who watches. It has a great combination of comedy love and drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This isn't the greatest movie ever made. The film-making technique isn't groundbreaking. It traffics in many cliches. The acting isn't always first rate. For an American audience, there is no real star power. It's in a foreign language (possibly, seemingly more than one) with English subtitles. Nevertheless, I absolutely love this movie. What's more, is that every single one of the people who I've recommended this to, people who have NEVER watched a foreign film with or without subtitles, have ended up really enjoying it as well. The bottom line is that it is a wonderful story, and you'll love it.By the way, see this version before seeing the new version that has 51 minutes of footage that was originally left on the cutting room floor. The story is stronger here. But then be sure to watch the new version to find out what happened to the lost love."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extended fiasco!!!","review":"As one of the reviers said, i was completely enticed by this movie when i first saw it. Then, when i bought this DVD, it seemed to me as if i was watching a different, stupid movie. And then i realised that it was the famous \\"extended version.\\" One of the things that i loved about Cinema Paradiso (the original version) was the ending; it was unexpected. The end of the extended version was adapted to Hollywood standards, which in my opinion, are completely predictable, and thereby for dummies. Please, this version is completely insulting!!! By all means, by the original version! I urge you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS FILM!!","review":"This film is just timeless it's one of those movies that you put on and get transported to another time and place and just remember every aspect of the scenes and the lines.

YOu will not regret getting this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"I must admit, that this review is for the original release and not the director's cut.Glad I got that out of the way.This film is beautiful. So beautiful and eloquently acted and filmed that subtitles are virtually unnecessary. This is a movie for movie lovers. And what a movie it is. Sublime.I first saw this film at the Cabot Cinema in Beverly, MA and toward the end of the movie I was wondering why everyone was whispering. Well, they weren't whispering. They were crying. I was among them.Morricone's score is unforgettable. This is a film about human compassion, passion, dreams, and letting go.

Tornatore's best achievement. This is a movie about a movie-lover, a story of Toto who fall in love with the magical world of movies, a world that he was introduced to by his friend Alfredo, it is also a about cinema and how it is dying due to the change of time and the aggressiveness of TV. This is a love letter to movies and what it represents in our life... a masterpiece by all means; if you love movies then you must see this one either in the Director's cut or in its original version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for other generations...","review":"If you want to enjoy a wonderful masterpiece... subject, characters, MUSIC... you must have this Discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best movie I've ever seen","review":"I saw some reviewers say that they like the theatrical (shorter) version better than the Director's Cut. I think it depends on what version they saw first.Whatever version you see, you fall in love with this film, and don't want to change anything in it. I saw only the Director's Cut, and I wouldn't drop a single episode from it. This is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinema Bellisima","review":"A film than never loses its freshness and enjoyment. By far one of the most superior films ever made in any language. From start to finish, you become involved with the characters. They are people you care about and feel the pain and sorrow they encounter. The director's cut is 51 minutes longer than the theatrical release, and is definately worth watching. A true masterpiece in film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie","review":"I love this movie. I met the director at the Academy of the Motion Pictures during the foreign movies symposiom.

You want to know them personally. A film to see over and over again. It will make your heart glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The past through rose-tinted glass","review":"This is a beautiful and moving story about love and nostalgia. In the beginning, Salvatore, a middle-aged filmmaker of some renown, is informed of the passing of Alberto, the old projectionist who had befriended him and had first awakened his love of cinema. As he travel back to his hometown for the funeral, memories of his childhood and youth come tumbling out of him: the boy Salvatore's fascination with the workings of the projector, his growing friendship with Alberto, the raucous, communal warmth of the theater and the ectascy and heartbreak of his first love. These memories have a purity and richness sharpened by the passing time. We the viewers can't help but to be swept up in these vivid scenes and perhaps marvel, along with the older Salvatore at the end of the movie, how movies are akin to our memories and dreams, where colors are forever vibrant, beauty never fades, and love always just a heartbeat away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Buffering","review":"I enjoyed this movie, however, the quality was only OK and the streaming kept getting interrupted. Several times, the film would stop the note \\"Buffering\\" would appear. I had to go over and restart to get it to work. Very frustrating trying to watch a movie that way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"recaptures the glory days of Cine Citta","review":"I could see the influence of Fellini but this film stands on its own as truely great and captures the Italian mastery of human interest that epitomizes our impression of Italian culture. The story of the old projectionist taking the little boy whose father had been killed under his wing is very moving as is the protagonists first tender love and the surprise consummation in the end. This film moved me to tears many times and reminded me of what I love about Italy and Italian fim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"This product arrived on time and in good condition.

We enjoyed the original version the best. However, we watched the new version with great interest. It's a great movie, a timeless classic. It is subtitled in English, but that does not detract from our enjoyment of the movie.It is only the director's cut that is rated R, not the original version. The original version is marked \\"not rated\\" on my VHS copy, but doesn't contain the sexuality that is included in the later version. We enjoyed this movie enough to purchase the DVD copy although we already owned it on VHS. This is definitely a DVD worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of life, frienship, love, boyhood and the emotions we carry deep inside","review":"A msterprice by Tornatorre and Morricone! The critical acclaim is fully deserved - the performances are strong (particularly that of Philippe Noiret in what is one of his best roles), the music is wonderful, the cinematography memorable.Yes, the film is ostensibly about the role that movies play in our lives, but in reality Tornatorre is using the \\"cinema\\" as another one of his vehicles (as the ship in \\"The Legend of 1900\\") through which he tells us the important story of how important and charater-forming our early friendships, loves, fascinations and disappointments are. As the years are going by, the main character has all grown up, but part of the little boy is still alive insde and it does not take much for the memories to flood the silver screen accompanied with the poignant Morricone music.This movie is a gem for those who like Tornatorre, Italian cinema and a \\"must see\\" for all seirous movie fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going beyond perfection","review":"When I first saw Cinema Paradiso back in my college years, I thought that this was one great credit requirement. The film, with its lighthearted yet sublime tone, first stirred my senses to the beauty of Italian cinema-- and you never forget your first time.Well, after viewing the director's cut (an added 50 minutes of additional footage never seen before), what was thought of as perfect is now nothing short of excellence. I don't want to give out the details of the film as I wouldn't want to spoil the experience for new entrants into the wonderful world of Cinema Paradiso, but the ending simply made it for me. I don't really care how other reviewers responded to the ending, be it \\"deus ex machina\\" or \\"better edited than not,\\" but it came as a heartrending closure of an affair long past-- kind of like making amends with a fallen-out friend.This DVD is an extremely satisfying movie experience that should be seen by avid filmgoers, enthusiasts, at least once in their lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie!","review":"I wonder where I can find the newly released director's cut?

I just canceled my order upon learning that this is the American Theatrical version and not the Director's Cut. Shame on Lions Gate for releasing the HACKED shorter version instead of the longer Director's Cut on a 50GB BD. They will probably try and double dip by releasing the shorter version first and the the longer (I just won't fall for it) You are better off buying the two-disc deluxe edition DVD and enjoy the film as it was meant to be.

The frame bottoms don't have the little \\"pads\\" on either side of the hinge, so I have to watch where I put it to avoid scratching the floor with the hinge.

In Shakespearean Negotiations, Greenblatt offers typically brilliant and engaging readings of some of Shakespeare's major plays. His book is of interest to a wide audience beyond an academic one.

If you even speak a lick of german you'll understand the idiocy and mediocrity of the lyrics in these terrible songs. In Songs such as sehnsucht, betrafe mich, and the terrible \\"buck dich\\" (which literally means \\"bend over\\") there's the added element of electronica techno that's just simply hilarious to listen to in these harder-edged intentioned songs. This cd's a joke lyrically and musically. If you want me to give you a taste of how stupid these songs are, i will translate the first verse to buck dich: \\"Bend over, i order to you, turn the sundial away from me, your face is indifferent to me, bend over\\".

It diserves more. ALOT more. This cd is by RAMMS+EIN, a German industrial band. They are hard in most songs, but soft in others. It gets you into the moshing mood! Two of the best songs are \\"Sehnsucht(hunger)\\" which is extremely hard, fast, and exhilarating, and \\"Bestrafe Mich(punish me)\\" which is an adrenilin rasing masterpiece. If you like Metalica(and who dosn't), Rob Zombie, KoRn, or any of those, you will LOVE this cd...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Rammstein","review":"This is my favorite Rammstein album. They are forceful and somewhat sinister sounding, a plus compared to Mutter and Reise, Reise which, although very good, are more conventional-rock sounding. What really sets this band apart though, is that they sing in German. It somehow sounds cooler in another language, and since I can't understand what they're saying I can really concentrate on the the music itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a great album, and I don't seem to tire of hearing it. Ironically, their radio hit \\"Du Hast\\", is probably the lamest song on the album. (Not that it's lame, just that it under-performs the rest of the album.) Rammstein has a unique, hard-driving, techno/metal sound that appeals to a number of people I know who have otherwise completely different tastes in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rammstein At Their BEST!!!!","review":"I got this CD after Mutter, and its the best Rammstein CD yet.

My mom thought I was Crazy, and maybe I was, but it was the most inspirational Cd That I bought all year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done better everywhere else","review":"This album, and Rammstein in general, try many different concepts which would be a good thing except you'll find each concept done better everywhere else. If you want some hard rocking industrial then check out another band originally from Germany known as KMFDM. If you want the intensity then go buy an album from Slayer (can you handle that?) and if you want REAL industrial then get a cd from Front Line Assembly. Anyway you look at it, Rammstein just dosn't cut it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neubauten for the Taste Impaired","review":"I'm not going to be as harsh as my friend from Dresden, Deutchland, but I'm not going to praise Rammstein either. The songs are catchy but lack the sophistication of Einsturzende Neubauten. I would normally be all for any group that can make it big in the US singing in a foreign language, but the average fan of this band probably isn't listening for the lyrical content. They probably just listen to it because it rocks. That's ok, but unfortunately that attitude is the reason so much mediochre music hits big while bands that are so much better will forever languish in the underground. But that's ok. That's the way we'd want it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"These tunes blow you away!!!!","review":"I'd heard Engel from the Mortal Kombat Annhiliation Soundtrack and I'd heard Du Hast on the radio and I was hooked.

What could be better?! This album pounds into your skull with crunching heavy metal beats that bring names like Ministry to mind. Sure they are not KMFDM or Atari Teenage Riot, but if you want Euro-metal at its best, this is the band to listen to. These guys rock harder than anything! Sure the two singles 'Engel' and 'Du Hast' kick ass, but other songs such as the title track and 'Spiel Mit Mir' make this a worthwhile keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful, primal and addictive","review":"I am gratified to see how many people out there love this CD as much as I do. I'm not alone! Yay! I could listen to it several times a day and not get bored, and I have. The fact that the lyrics are in German doesn't bother me in the least, and I feel sorry for all the whiners who get hung up on the language barrier. So what? German is the next best thing to Latin for inspiring primal, medieval imagery; I compare it to Orff's \\"Carmina Burana,\\" with guitars. (How's that for an esoteric leap?) One should experience the lyrics not as words per se, but as another level of sound equally as powerful as the music. And as an added bonus, \\"Sehnsucht\\" is an album both my girlfriend and I enjoy equally- she's a reformed industrial/goth type with no taste for metal, but she likes this one!

Sorry folks...but immigration needs to be curtailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a bore","review":"This CD tends to get a little weary aside from the hit single off of it, which is only so good to begin with. Industrial is a pretty dirty style of music if you ask me, unless it is done properly as is done by Econoline Crush, Gravity Kills, or Nine Inch Nails (that is, their song \\"Perfect Drug\\", since everything else they do is awful). Rammstein, unfortunately, has a sort of roughness that isn't of any real value. They're typical of the myriad bands that sound hard but have nothing of substance behind the gutteral \\"singing\\". I say that this should be skipped over, perhaps in favor of a Mudvayne CD, where the makeup isn't to shock you into pulling out your wallet so much as it is a way to underscore the music (the cover on this CD may be tempting for the casual poser, so I had to include that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"And that's even too much","review":"I hate every minute of it. Incredibly stupid lyrics, synthesizer tunes which lack even the creativity of a band like Modern Talking (another German quality product) and riffs Kirk Hammett could play.

First, their attitude: they act as a sort of Mansonesque band on stage, which, sincerely, don't seem very original now. They just copy old Skinny Puppy's shows (in fact, I think their show artistic manager is the same; Second, their music: they think they have invented metal-industrial or something like that... wow, have u ever listened to OOMPH's records???? Rammstein is just a copy of this band, sorry, but that's the way it is, and their songs are metal in its structure, but they add some synths here & there and hocus-pocus, here we are the gods of industrial... and everyone buys their records and hallucinates with this band. One said that, I repeat: everyone has its likes, I am very critical to this band, but I respect everyone who likes it, obviously. BUT I HATE RAMMSTEIN!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterile","review":"I dont get why everyone loves this band. Their music is boring and repetetive, the lyrics are stupid beyond belief, and worst more, they rip-off Type O Negative to the EXTREME!When I used to live in Russia and they played their, people who listen to pop actually went to the show! So I guess its better calling Rammstein a pop-metal band, considering true German metal is Kreator, Sodom, and Necrophagist.Avoid this garbage, get Kreator's Endless Pain and Necrophagist's Epitaph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"Not really the album I expected from a highly publicized group of \\"firebreathers\\".Couple of unlisted tracks show some promise.None of the other tracks besides Du Hast really ropes you in, at all.Try before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ich hab das sehr gern!\\" (I like it very much!)","review":"I really love the music, and because I understand German, it makes it that much better!

I've never heard anyone combine one riff and a synthesizer like that before. They're one of the most metal industrial bands there are. I first heard of these guys when I got my MK 2 soundtrack, which contains Engel. The best song on that CD. Then a few years later, I got my Matrix soundtrack, and I heard Du Hast. I immediately went out and bought this, and I was not disappointed. These guys rock, and they have yet to leave my CD player. I have no clue what the hell they're talking about, but they rule anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A brilliant record. If you like KMFDM, you'll love the 'Stein. They manage to get in some truly heavy metal riffs with some synth. Not as synthy as KMFDM, who sometimes use female background vocals, so in that regard, Rammstein is a little more hardcore. But the beat and the attitude are there. If you ever have a chance to see these guys live, take it!

The album didn't disappoint, although a few of the songs took a while to grow on me. Not so Sehnsucht - I enjoyed this from start to finish, the techno sound mixed in with heavy guitars was just my kind of music; thumping, full-on industrial. Some people say the lyrics are sick in some of the Rammstein music, but I couldn't give a damn! I don't even understand the words - it's the sound that matters to me. I have all their CDs now - I just wish I could wipe my memory and rediscover them!!

The choppy hard guitars are very unique in this album. Every song on this album is a heavy song that you come to expect from this band.The first thing you notice is the album artwork, featuring the members of the band looking like something out of a horror flick but humorous at the same time, and the back of the album showing a sunny beach, the exact opposite of the front cover !

Sehnsucht was their current CD so I bought it. (Since then I have gotten all the others). This is a spectacular metal disc. Every song is great, some virtually perfect. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because Du Hast (their signature song here in the US) is a direct rip of Ministry's \\"Just One Fix\\" from Psalm 69, and nobody can tell me that Rammstein wasn't familiar with it because Ministry has virtually sired this entire genre.Besides that, anyone who buys this album will love it, even those who normally avoid metal.

The songs compose of mostly rough-sounding guitars and drums at the begining; however, towards the middle of the song, everthing quiets down a bit and sound effects become dominant. One quibble: the sometimes opera-like vocals, frequent in the middle and the end of the songs, detract from the band's otherwise strength and powerfulness.Although definately not for the masses, Rammstein's Sensucht has a lot to offer for the few who can connect with this odd style of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it, but I don't love it","review":"The style isn't bad. I just don't think it has enough great songs. Du Hast is the exception. That song will always get you going. It is incredible. The rest of the Cd, is questionable. You might want to give it a try though, if you like White Zombie, Static X, or other hard music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy.....but","review":"I give it two and a half stars. I'm not sure, for a little bit, this album soundz pretty good. There's heavy guitar riffs, vocals are powerful, but, somethings missing. I'm not exactly sure. The songs just get really annoying after a few plays on the cd player. Du hast is a catchy song, and I guess i got caught in it. There's power here, but originality and musicianship is lacking. They definately have potential, so, if you're a metallica fan or such, I suggest this, but, I would get other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY!","review":"As a student of German, I found the lyrics a novelty.

Check those guys out! In any matter, Sehnsucht is excellent! I love the title track, as well as Bestrafe Mich and Buck Dich (yes, I know, the umlauts are missing). I even went as far as to translate some of the songs myself so that I could understand them.... and sing along better(; Even if you can't speak German, you find yourself trying to sing along with the songs. The CD is definitely powerful. By the way, \\"Du hast\\" does NOT mean \\"you hate\\", that would be \\"Du hasst\\". \\"Du hast\\" means \\"you have\\". If you see a translation that says \\"you hate\\", you can be sure it's wrong. For accurate translations, check out [the website.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely check out","review":"Rammstein have become legends in their own field, creating music that's not industrial, or metal, yet a cross-breed of both.

However, I do not know any German, so it is not as catchy for me. Du Hast is cool anyway, but you people who have the same problem as me should consider Anthrax.

The reader will marvel at the narrative complexity and layers of meaning hidden in the apparent formal simplicity of \\"Jeanne Dielman\\" for instance, and discover the overarching formal, sociological, and political themes in Akerman's films.

Furthermore, the book is long on the \\"this is why our art is the best\\" arguments that are tacky and dead-ended. We already bought your book, we're interested in BJJ, don't be a egotist about it.

I got the movie and watched it yesterday. It was lousy! Made in the 70s with an obvious 70s feel to it (which was tolerable), but the actor portraying Dirk Pitt was wrong, his portrayal of Dirk Pitt was wrong, there was very little action although the novel was filled with it, they didn't tie up plot lines, etc. In short, it was terrible. There's another movie on the same disk, \\"Man Friday.\\" I have no idea what it is about, but I'll give it a shot and see if it's worth keeping the disk, although I doubt it.

This is not as bad or as funny as Le's other masterpiece, \\"Eye of the Dragon\\" (undoubtebly the worst film of all time next to \\"Caligula\\"), which Le directed. The key plot is not even worth being described for, nor are the characters. The action sequences, music, sound editing, are so off-key and pathetically dubbed, you can't help but laugh at it (not to mention a good script, direction, and acting, which this film thoroughly lacked). This is a very bad film, but for the ultimate comedy because of its effortless way to succeed at being a good movie at 1%, rent \\"Eye of the Dragon\\", which isn't even on sale here (and thank god for it), but it is worth renting.

Oh well she is an older woman now, and her voice is not as sweet. I guess time catches up to all of usAs an aside, one has to wonder about the music industry.

My first complaint is that there is too much usage of the French language. For example, there is an entire poem in French. I took three years of French in school, albeit a long time ago, and yet I could not make the translations of the poem or the conversational phrases. The story is filled with useless conversations in English. I am planning on finishing the book, I am halfway through, but it is difficult when I am not particularly enamored with the characters.

All of the characters are there -- the butler (who plays a major role despite what a previous reviewer claimed), Chocolate Henry, Mother, Sgt. Brandy, et al -- and Phule's escapades as he outwits his superiors in rank while accomplishing his mission's goals are as humorous as ever. There's mystery, organized crime, abductions, even romance!

Unfortunately I was unable to get past about 1/3 of the way. I am sorry that Mr. Aspirin allowed someone else to write this book. It was very poor. The characters were all there, but they were not the people we had grown to love in the previous books. In many cases they were behaving in ways that were totally out of character.Most of all I missed the butler. He always imparted quality to the crew. I do hope that Mr. Aspirin will write another Phules Co. book. I hope that only Mr. Aspirin writes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're going to write a sequel, read the predecessors","review":"The summary pretty much says it.

The characters, on the whole, are dull, soulless cardboard cutouts of their former selves. Conflicts were resolved too easily, with a minimum of humor. My last thought upon finishing it was, \\"That's it! \\" I would have preferred to wait for another \\"Phule\\" book and never get one, rather than seeing the series shamelessly trampled like this. (It was, however, tolerable if you didn't think of it as part of the \\"Phule's Company\\" series.) I hope Robert Asprin is ashamed of himself for putting his name on this, even with someone else to share the blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series with nowhere to go...","review":"It is unfortunate that this series has fallen into a repetition of the same old gag. The premise, perhaps, was doomed from the start. Wacky bunch of military misfits are foisted off on equally misfit commander(promising, but here's the fatal flaw), wacky misfit commander is rich as Croesus. Therefore, instead of interestingly thinking or fighting its way out of trouble, the unit simply BUYS its way out. Perhaps this is a bit of wish fullfillment on Asprin's part considering his recent financial troubles, but it is a disappointing come-down from the thoroughly charming (if a bit formulaic) \\"Myth\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"If I could give the book less than 1 star, I would. I love the MYTH series and the Phule books previous to this one, but if you're looking for the same sense of easy-to-identify characters and fun, look elsewhere. I have some doubt as to whether Aspirin had anything to do with writing the book at all; maybe he just provided the story idea. In any case, the characters completely lose their established personalities, becoming both boring and unbelievable, and the interesting plot ideas crash and burn horribly - which can't be a great surprise since the Phule series is character driven. Whoever Peter Heck is, I hope Aspirin comes to his senses and doesn't let him near another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die hard phule fans only","review":"I similarly found this book to be disappointing, and not up to past standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful book","review":"All the negative reveiws are correct. The most endearing things about the first two Phule's Company books were that each of the character's had their own Voice and were described in such a way to provide Character.

'Blah' is the word that describes the book best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird little word-choices too","review":"Dumbed down, maybe deadline pressure. Everything an author or would-be author would read and start to pity the forced action of formerly delightful characters.I don't know who \\"contributor\\" P.Heck is, and now I really don't care to find out how he may have butchered Mark Twain in a sort of revisionist historic mystery setting.What is it with the bizarre word choices? Is it a cry for help (or hidden excuse) to the Literary Critics? In some rarified language? Even the names chosen for 'new' characters are strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have looked forward to this sequel ever since reading the first two books. Many of the characters from those books were either greatly ignored or just seen in passing. Also it had Willard Phule worrying about money of all things. This from a man that bought a hotel so he could have the manager help him. A man who bought 2 Port-A-Brains (cost of a small corportion) so he would not have to possibly wait for a pay terminal. I can't believe Asprin wrote this. Makes me think Heck wrote it and Asprin get the credit (read as BLAME). Makes it very doubtful that I would buy a 4th one, especially if anyone's name is on it besides Asprin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is clearly the worst book of the three so far and may signal the start of the decline. Usually, it takes longer for his series to begin to go downhill, but we're seeing it in only the third book.What made the first two books funny and charming is almost gone in this installment. The characters seem to have no depth and less wit, and the \\"hilarious situations\\" come off forced and stilted. Asprin's \\"voice\\" seems to have changed (perhaps due to the unexplained presence of a co-author) and not for the better.Summary: Internet fan fiction would have been better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An appropriate title and I was the fool.","review":"Unlike its light-hearted, original, and funny predecessors, this time Robert Aspirin (with Peter J.

There is none!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Phule and His Money","review":"This book has none of the belly laughs associated with the first two books. It is written in an entirely different style, leading one to wonder if Robert Asprin or Peter Heck wrote it.If this were the first in a series, the series would founder and die at book two."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for asprin; still better than many others","review":"upon reading the other reviews, i agree that robert asprin must have left much of the writing to his collaborator. the characters, who seem like old friends after the first two novels, do not act (or even talk!!) as you would expect. however, the story was still entertaining and had some good laughs. nowhere near as bad as \\"sweet myth-tery of life\\", the worst book i have ever read by asprin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I did read reviews before I read the book, I read it with an open mind, determined to make my own decision. Frankly, I had to agree with the negative reviews. This book was a let-down from the other two Phule books. I did not find it nearly as funny, and it was a chore to get through it. The characters were not as interesting, nor was the plot as involving. If you've read the other Phule books and enjoyed them, go ahead and read this, but don't make it a priority. This is something to read on a long plane trip, or something similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent book, but did Robert Asprin write any of it?","review":"I was excited to see a new Asprin book on the shelf -- finally back to Phule! It seemed that the writing style was quite different and there was less humour than the first two books in the series. If you're an Asprin fan, buy it! If not, stick with one of his earlier works (though not the recent non-Phule sci-fi books - they are lousy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a long time fan of Robert Asprin ( going back to Thieves World ) I was very disappointed in this installment of such a fun series. It's pretty obvious right from the start that somebody else basically wrote the book. The character's voices, mannerisms and speech patterns all changed. Sushi no long speaks with an accent in broken english, and the other characters also lose that individualism that the first two books had. You could pull dialog from the first two books and pretty much know who was speaking by the way it was written but that was lost in this book. All in all it read more like an attempt to make money on a hit series than a real effort at continuing, what had been, a great bunch or books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I loved the first two Phule's books-but this one feels as if it was written by someone else. It had no depth, no flavor, limited humor, and none of the characters rang true--they all seemed flat and expressionless.This one is a waste of money--don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hack (Heck) attempting to fill too large shoes","review":"This book is too obviously not Asprin's work. There are clearly Asprin like touches in the plot and a few of the lines, but overall this looks to be mostly Heck's work. The previous Phule books were light, sprightly works that jumped from one witty quip to the next without much concern. The plots were funny and the characters engaging. This one is not. The characters plod from place to place with no enjoyment. The plot, in outline, is very funny. The execution of the plot is awful. It reads as if Asprin supplied the overall outline and the direction while Heck filled in the rest, with little supervision or oversight from Asprin. The series suffers. Unfortunatly, I have already purchased both in this new Phule series. Please do not make the same mistake. If you must read them, get them from a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but who to blame?","review":"The book was, without a doubt, disappointing from the hideous front cover on. A lot of reviewers have been blaming Peter Heck. Well, it's quite possible that he's to blame, but I wouldn't rule out Robert Asprin, either. Look at the disappointing Sweet Myth-teries of Life, for example, which had only his name on it. For that matter, look at the copyright date. Asprin left off Phule's Paradise with a cliffhanger (a deplorable and self-serving habit of his) SEVEN YEARS ago! Maybe Heck did what he could (obviously and unfortunately not enough) with Asprin's work.The best thing I can say about this novel is that it didn't end with a cliffhanger. Hopefully Asprin's realized by now that by delaying so long between books, he's lost the right to use cliffhangers ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one will ever convince me this was written by Mr. Asprin","review":"This book bears only a superficial resemblance to the first two books. Plot elements are barely strung together at all. No real action is ever taken by Phule than to pull out his credit card and propose business deals. Problems seem to come and magically resolve themselves with no apparent action taken on the part of the principals. This is probably the last in the series because few people that read this book will ever buy another \\"Phule\\" book. Which is really sad because I loved the first two. I can only guess that the publisher invoked a contract clause allowing the book to be finished by a ghost author. The humor is lame and the plot is almost as bad. I normally see better FanFic published on the Web. With all apologies to Mr. Asprin who has brought me so much enjoyment with his previous works, this one's a dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"I enjoyed the first two books in this series enough to read them a second time, but this collaboration was absolutely atrocious.Every indication seems to be that Asprin wrote an outline which Peter J. Heck attempted to flesh out into a book: Unfortunately, Peter J. Heck has no sense of character or comedy. I only got a few dozen pages into the book before throwing it against the wall in total disgust, but time and time again I saw scenes which -- if the old Robert Asprin had been executing them -- would have been hilarious. Here, however, they fell flat and lifeless to the pavement.There are no laughs here. The characters and the scenes are forced. All sense of a point is missing.No matter how much you loved the first two books, avoid this installment at all costs. Indeed, the closer the first two books are to your heart, the deeper this book will thrust the knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"This book was very disappointing. The previous two Phule books were great, but this one was choppy and forced; the plot seemed terribly contrived and the characters uninspired caricatures of what went before. It was a chore to read, but nowhere near as bad as the sequel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've happened across every book in this series completely by accident, and until now it's been a pleasant surprise every single time. This time? Well, it was a pleasant surprise to see a new \\"Phule\\" book, but until the last few chapters, it just didn't... FEEL right.Not a book I'd recommend (although I would strongly recommend the previous two books in the series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Phule and his money\\" was me.","review":"One has to wonder if Mr. Asprin wrote this book or did Mr. Heck just get stuck with it. There are way to many inaccuracies with this book to be the supposed writer block and could only come from someone not familiar with the series or from someone who could care less about it. The story line is flat, the humor is non-excitant, and the characters that where so alive the first books are cardboard cut outs now. I am normally a big fan of Mr. Asprin's work, but if there ever is another installment to this series I will read it, but I will not buy it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting this sequel and was very disappointed. No humour, scenes that seemed to serve no purpose, characterizations were wrong. My favorite character, Mother, was reduced to a dull personality. The impression I was left with is that Peter J. Heck wrote the story and Robert Asprin put his name on it. I will be very hesitant to purchase any of Asprin's books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as NG Evangelion","review":"This show has got to have one of the best story plot and endings i've ever seen...coming close to the controversial Neon Genesis Evangelion... the show had it all a good plot, a lota of twist and turns, good follow up's, great armament(check out the burapodan...or whatever it's called), a hot babe and a crazy lil' brat...put that with a cowardice sort-a Hunter and u got an action-packed, hilarious and a side of a hell-lotuva mayhem and destruction...hey its a drama too...how'd that happen...

I originally saw it on the sci-fi channel and loved it. Since then I've been dying to acutally own it. The story is fast paced and futuristic. An evil alien known as Zeiram has started attacking different planets and an intergalatic hunter known as Iria and her brother named Gren are dispatched to eliminate him. On the next last 3 episodes it is the conclusion of what happened. Overall it has great animation, a great storyline, and characters that you learn to love. If you love animes like Akira, Armitage III, or ghost in the shell i recommend you check out this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story, great animation, great voice overs","review":"The story is complex enough to keep you watching instead of just another \\"guys with guns shooting each other\\" movie. The characters switch from bad guy to good guy constantly so it will keep you guessing until the end. Also, the voice overs suitted the characters in almost all instances, which is great since I hate subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gren...why?!","review":"Well this is a pretty good anime.

See what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must own anime","review":"Iria: Zeiram the Animation will leave you wanting more. The characters are funny and by the time the movie is over you are thinking to yourself, 'I wonder if there are any other Iria animations.' The anime is almost 3 hours long, and has a great storyline. Iria is a bounty hunter out to stop Zeiram, which is supposedly an indestructable monster. She is very hot headed and won't let anything get in her way when she wants to prove herself as a good bounty hunter. The movie itself has average animation quality, as well as sound and music. There are several scenes which are rather classic animation humor, but for the most part the movie is pretty serious. I recommend this animation movie to anyone ages 12 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great animation, great story, need I say more","review":"I saw first part of Iria on sci-fi channel the other night, I loved it. The movie mixes a great plot with fantastic animation. It's going in my anime collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but falls short as an overall production","review":"The concept of \\"Iria\\" is unique and entertaining as a story, it also does an ok job at engaging the audience. However, you would be mislead if you expect a feature film quality production from this DVD. The music is poor, the action is simple, the look and detail of the backgrounds is a bit shallow and the pasing gets really slow at times.The best context for this DVD is as an ok TV Series, but it is certainly not \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", it is not \\"Princess Mononoke\\", it is not \\"Ninja Scroll\\", and it is certainly not \\"Akira\\". So don't raise your expectations of \\"Iria\\" to the level of any of these films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best animea movie I've seen.","review":"This is one of the best animea's I've seen yet. It keeps you glued to you r seat throught the whole thing.

The idea and design of Iria and Zeram was great. I had watched the live action version and had expected more from the anime version. The pace was too slow and the soundtrack died in spots essential to making it more exciting. The story itself was very shallow. With plot and pace being so lack luster, it becomes easy to overlook the outstanding job of animation. Artwork is the only reason why I rate this better than a 1. This is , if you watch it objectively, an example of anime failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs.","review":"Iria is one of my fav. anime. Good story, good chars, nothing I can really complain about. But whatever you do, DO NOT listen to the english soundtrack. Turn on the japanese with subtitles.

Definitly worth the purchase, but *DO NOT* listen to it in english!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Anime","review":"I orignally watch Iria on HBO about three years before it was released in the US. I love it. The movie follows Iria, a young female bounty hunter. It is set in a far away galaxy. The problem is this un-killable monster from outer space comes \\"Zeiram\\". To make a long story short it becomes a fight between Iria and Zeiram, with some strange things a long the way.I gave this a 4 star rating because, the movie feels too long, over 2 and half hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school Anime","review":"I remember seeing this on the Sci-fi Channel, or Cartoon Network, or something back in the 90's and thinking I have no idea waht this is but it's cool. I caught it in the middle and since then had seen it from the beginning and even caught the live action films that inspired it.Iria: Zeiram the animation is old school anime but still holds up today. it's futuristic yet retro/eurasian designs are still some of the most inspired I've seen and the action and weapons are top notch. A great little series to pass some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iria... GREAT story... Incredible action","review":"Anime while at times is incredible is also at times one of the boringest things I have ever sceen. I personally love anime for the detail in the shows but at times they put me to sleep. I got my Iria DVD in the mail and figured I would pop it in and watch an episode now and another one later ( there are 6 episodes on the DVD about 3hrs of footage ). Since there was about 3hrs on the DVD I figured there was NO way I could sit through all of it during one sitting... MAN WAS I WRONG! From the begining to the end I was hooked. This show is none stop action and entertainment. Man, I paused this DVD everytime I had to leave the room, I didn't want to miss a second of it. I loved every hour of it and plan to watch it again soon. GREAT SHOW... BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A title where the villan is the more intriguing character","review":"This animation is a strange anime for several reasons. Firstly the animation is up to the standard of some Manga productions. It is clear and well realised. The story is strong in that the villan is far more interesting than the heroine. Iria is a bounty hunter who is caught up in tracking the creature 'Zieram'. There follows a complicated tale of her adventures that are frequently inter-spersed with flashbacks. However the real star of the show is Zieram who proves more than a match for anything that it comes up against (It absorbs there DNA thus making itself stronger). The music is good and the dubbing is fair. Overall it should appeal to science fiction fans as well as those who enjoy a blockbuster type animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"IRIA - Sexy Bounty Hunter","review":"IRIA is a benchmark piece of animation. Done in 1995, IRIA continues to stand the test of time with it's beautiful artwork, excellent storyline, and fantastic characters.Synopsis:Iria, a bounty hunter who has just reached legal working age, must track down and destroy a nigh-invincible space creature named Zeiram. Her motivation is revenge for the death of her brother, whom Zeiram kills at the outset of the film. A twist is thrown into the plot when Iria discovers that Zeiram has assimilated Gren, using Gren's body to reform its own after it is destroyed in a spaceliner exposion.Standing in Iria's way is Tiddan Tippedei, a huge business conglomerate specializing in weapons development, that wants to capture Zeiram and use it for purposes of war.Iria is an excellent female protagonist, a bad-ass chick with a heart of gold; not to mention an arsenal of super-cool gadget weaponry."},{"rating":"1","title":"overated, unengaging story","review":"I'm really surprised at the high reviews.On the positive side, IRIA has some interesting character design and atypical elements of science fantasy. Plus the DVD is about 180 minutes long.On the negative, IRIA is unengaging and more action than story or character based. I found myself bored, and quickly not caring what was going on.There's nothing particularly special about the animation, though it does feature some nicer background paintings. Hold frames of IRIA are drawn better than most. IRIA pales in comparison to GHOST IN THE SHELL, ARMITAGE III, NINJA SCROLL, GIANT ROBO, and even THE BIG O, in my opinion.A rental, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really complete...","review":"The final evaluation of this DVD is that the story is not \\"finished\\", just like a first draft. With a bit more work and less ustilization of \\"jumps into back episodes\\" to reuse the animations and make some extra time, it would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several pitfalls","review":"I didn't think this anime came close to the caliber of Ghost In the Shell or other top animes.First, you get a little tired of seeing the good guy constantly shoot at the indestructable monster to no avail.Second, the kids Iria befriends are so obnoxious that they become nothing but an annoyance.Third, the English dubbed voice of Iria is dreadful. Not only does it lack the cuteness of the Japanese voice, but the acting is worse than what you would hear in a cheesey car dealership commercial.I just began watching anime, and after seeing Ghost and Princess Mononoke, this was like watching Scooby Doo."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Iria, despite having an entire series included on a single DVD, is a huge disappointment.

I really did not enjoy this movie at all. Bad animation, really bad acting, did I mention that I didn't like it? The reason why this even got a star is because it did a better job at sticking to the real story ( a lot was still changed though).Disney's movie is much much better even though it changed the story even more than this movie did and the anime is supposed to be really good too (made in 1979 and is the closest to the original story than the other two are.)My recommendations: Watch Disney's version,then the anime version(if you can find it), and then read the original story. After that, if you're still curious about this one, go ahead and watch it.

The first phase of the band with Guy Speranza and the three Tony Moore albums (Thundersteel, PoP, and Immortal Soul) are in my opinion the band(in reality Mark Reale)'s best work.Restless Breed falls short here. The riffs just aren't up to what I would expect from Reale and the vocals really hit me the wrong way. Forrester's voice is hard to listen to for a whole album as he screeches much of the time. The songwriting as well doesn't seem to come together here as maybe only the first track Hard Loving Man would make the cut on any of the first three albums. The rest of the album seems a bit lost and never gets it together.So, while not awful it is one of the weaker Riot albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guy Speranza Where Are You?","review":"I'm a huge fan of Riot WITH their original lead vocalist-Guy Speranza.

I wanted to correct my grammar which weren't very good but Derrida did not help me he was talking difficult stuff.While my grammar was attacked however, Miss Rogers did concede my principal point, which was that Derrida, having constructed his own metanarrative, is as susceptible to wilful misinterpretation through the prism of other metanarratives as he inflicts on others. Moreover, in some of Derrida's earlier essays, he specifically attacks Heidegger for misunderstanding what he means when accounting for his own form of deconstruction. Yet it seems to me - and surely to most? - that the central tenet of deconstruction is this: that authorial intent cannot be guaranteed as ultimate meaning; and that ultimate meaning does not exist.

Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derrida Tries But Fails To Charm Us","review":"The problem with this book like Derrida's other books is that it's hard to read. Derrida thinks he is saying something so deep but he can't say it right, he always uses strange words that I don't know the meanings. I can't find them in my dictionary and I even have a French one. If he knew what he was talking about then maybe we could start talking, but he never makes his point.

The performances by the three main characters are strong and after watching it for only the 2nd time last night I'm certainly pleased because it was definitely well worth the wait. There is a very sexually provocative scene that I recall seeing from my initial viewing and I remember it being the first time I'd ever viewed anything so sexually explicit in a movie. Surprisingly the movie was only a tiny bit dated(to be expected after 43 years)and the subject matter still very powerful. The late actress Sandy Dennis gives the strongest performance of the three. If you are on the fence as to whether or not this movie is worth a look in my opinion it most certainly is. I'll most likely be watching it again very soon--really good movies never go out of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Holding Back","review":"For 4 bucks how can you go wrong.

I own every recording I can find of these guys. I recently purchased both \\"Chicago Tapes\\" with great anticipation. I have to say I was very disappointed. The recording quality is dismal. It sounds like the signal on the master tapes bled through to other layers, and we hear a distorted echo all through both CDs, and the vocals are poorly mixed. Lou Gotleib (rest his soul) sounds as if he did not survive his hippy days in the sixties with all his faculties intact. He rehashes the same old gag lines with limited audience response. If you are a diehard fan (like me), then you may still want these CDs, but don't look for the spark that used to make the Limeliters so exciting.

I found it dull, I bought Totally Buble at the same time as this one and find Totally Buble far superior to this one. Lyle Lovett does a better version of Mack the Knife (which is more of a transliteration of the original German than we are used to hearing thanks to Bobby D.)than this CD. Frank Sinatra does a better version of I've Got You Under My Skin than the duplicaiton of the Nelson Riddle/Frank Sinatra arrangement version on this CD. A Foggy Day to me is the CD's only saving grace. The CD is gathering dust in my collection. Michael you can and have done better, your other CD's are full of the verve and warmth of your voice, this one is cold and emotionless. I wish you would have thought this one out a little longer.

Frankly, short of catching a scathing case of the shingles there is nothing I would rather do than curl up with my favorite Buble' recording and weep openly for the state of music to come. This young man is a weak comparison to Paul Anka much less Sinatra. His cardboard arrangements,nescient lyrics, and those special nasal utterings, appealing only to beagles and Otolaryngologists are at the very least, annoying. People, are we this desperate for another Johnny Ray? Suffice it to say Johnny Ray might be the only person truly suited for a Michael Buble' recording.

Crump, Author / Self-Publisher, \\"The Upside-Down Year\\" (Oregon, U.S.A.) I find John's book very helpful to me. It is not a book you read and then put away. Because I'm an author and publisher, the book is like a bible to me. This book is one that I keep near by because I'm always referring to it. It keeps giving, and giving, and . . . Money well spent.Marc C. Crump"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Marketing","review":"If you're an author or publisher of a book or information product, this is something you should keep on your desk at all times. It's a little like the \\"Energizer Bunny\\" ... it keeps going and going. You really do get 1001 marketing ideas and John Kremer also provides resource lists, website urls and insider information that you won't be able to put a price tag on. This is an absolutely indispensable marketing tool for both authors and publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Farse","review":"Quick fix marketing tips never last. 10 minute a day marketing is like telling a fat women to workout 10 minutes a day and look like Cheryl Tiegs in the 1980s. It is a farse and you shouldn't buy into such objectivism. The cold reality of the situation is that over 30,000+ books are produced a week in publishing. Of course, only about 5% are actually quality books, but still the numbers are staggering. There are no quick fix lottos. The successful author is realistic and makes contacts, networks, and his tool is the grindstone. Some doors may open, most will close. This is nothing but a car salesman's handbook and I highly recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"In depth and very useful","review":"The book is written from the perspective of the publisher but if you happen to have your books published by a small publishing company (pod, or self-published) you will gobble any amount of help. The other great thing is that you can contact John Kremer in person and he seems to be the expert's expert.You want your book to be a bestseller? You need a little encouraging? From personal experience, pennyless and at the disposition of others, authors get a kick out of any kind of contacts. If you're brave enough and if you want it enough, Kremer says, and spend 10 min a day marketing, you'll get there (eventually).1001 Ways is a very helpful (big) book and there should be something for everybody's who's interested in the ridiculously complicated field of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelmed!","review":"Sorry to rock the boat, John, but I am overwhelmed with every book marketing book and person there is. Some don't even write clearly and succinctly. I don't have time, and the books cover far too much information. Can't anyone write an \\"Easy Bookmarketing\\" book, like I did for homeschooling (EasyHomeschooling Techniques)? Can't anyone just give some basic 1, 2, 3 steps about the very most important money making ideas? Is it really this hard and this complicated?! I would like to see a thin book that only includes what's absolutely necessary. I have several responsibilites and like I said, I just don't have time! I even tore my books up into chapters thinking that would help but the whole system is disorganized. I don't like to hear about other people's experiences or be included in a book for big publishers - leave out the filler. To be fair, John is a very nice guy and has answered my personal emails several times. I feel the same way about all other book marketing books I've had."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want some ways to market your book--this is it!","review":"This book is filled cover to cover with ways to market books for the individual author or a publisher and for anyone. It has something for everyone--no kidding. And while it is quite large and seemingly unconfrontable in page length, it is nicely broken down and organized so that you can pick subjects or areas to read first if you do not want to tackle the whole book at once. I read the book cover to cover and then tabbed those items I use most for later reference. All the way from putting the book in ready form for publication to releasing it to follow up marketing and sales. And more importantly it really covers all areas of publishing, not just the traditional book store but the little niche areas that you could really get sales from and did not know about them and then lays out the road map for doing so and you don't have the re-invent the wheel to come up with it. It is literally read and get going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable if you are serious about marketing books!","review":"If you only use a handful of the ideas you find in this book, you'll achieve phenominal book marketing success. I used this book to launch my own marketing campaign for my first self-published book and continue to go back to it again and again for new ideas. Does it work? Yes! I'm currently using it to: prepare a new launch for a completely revised edition of my first book, develop a marketing plan for a book I am publishing for another author, and find new ways to introduce my second self-published book slated to go to print in the next few months. John Kremer is the \\"guru\\" of book promotion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Useful Tool for Writers","review":"John Kremer's book on marketing for writers covers a critical subject: what do you do after publication to market your book. Only a handful of available titles address this critical issue. Most publishers do little publicity; instead, they edit (maybe), print, and ship. Marketing is mostly up to the author. But most writers are clueless. This book is a wonderful resource. Use it. Borrow from it. Most publishers refer their writers to this book for a good reason. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Authors Bible","review":"This book is great! I am a new self-published author and this book served me like a marketing assistant.

They're dishwasher safe (always a plus) and long enough that I can leave the ends off the grill, so they'll stay cool enough to handle and turn. The skewers are a little less than 1/4 inch wide and relatively thin, which keeps food from sliding around and rotating on the skewers, giving better control for cooking. Also, they're thin enough to fit between fork tines, and food doesn't stick at all, so it's easy to slide food off onto a plate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got just what I wanted","review":"These are just what you would expect from the product description.

I'm sure they will work but I hate being miss-led. I work with stainless steel every day and I'm certain these will not last as long as stainless would. One star for miss-representation."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do the job","review":"They hold stuff, are flat (to hold the food in place when you turn them) and a good length so you can close the lid. You will need a glove because they do get hot. If that bothers you, buy the longer ones that have wood handles and let them hang over the edge of the grill. Good value. Unless you really need 12 you can give half to your neighbor. Maybe they will invite you over for dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine set of skewers","review":"I never seem to have enough skewers when guests come over so I picked up this set. They are not too thick, but not so thin that they are likely to bend. Nice sharp tip for ease of adding meat.

Good product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnet sticks to skewers","review":"The first thing I did when I got the skewers was to see if my small refrigerator magnet sticks to them.

However in all other respects the rest of the film is first class.Leading experts from various martial arts areas (Kendo, various forms of Karate, Jujitsu, Kung Fu, Tai Chi as well as weapons experts etc) are all shown demonstrating their skills with devastating effectiveness and discussing them with equal facility.Amongst the better known martial artists are:Chuck NorrisDan InosantoMaster Poi ChenMike StoneMaster Moses PowellUnlike one of the previous critical reviewers I actually found the Jujitsu master the most impressive of all the guys on display. The truth is they are, or at least were, amongst the very best at the time the film was made.

I didn't get instructions with the stroller, so I called the company directly. I was told that it doesn't come off and that it just gets tucked under into the basket. They said if I removed the boot I would scratch the frame because the rod is not that easy to loosen. Why on earth would they design it this way?????? I mean there are snaps all over the stroller. Couldn't they make it so this boot snaps off (easy on and off)???

He reads the lyrics off of a computer screen set in front of him as if we were at some karaoke show!! Then I went to meet him and because I didn't buy his $25 CD he brushed me off and asked if anyone had cd's for him to sign. It was so desperate, I felt sorry for him.

This one is on my top ten list though. I liked the characters because both the hero and the heroine were stubburn but they were people I could relate to. I find that a lot in her books. I felt the plot was interesting because it took you to more than one setting and described some of them. This made the book even more special. I rate it an 8 because though it's on my list there were some parts I didn't like. Including how Tanya was treated by her \\"father.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tales that Come True.","review":"This book is full of charmful characters. I can't help but falling in love not only with the heroes alone, but with other characters as well. How can I help it when they are so arrogant, so proud of themselves, and so... incredibly charming? The heroes spirits, their passions, and their intense conflicts make this book special. Lindsey has mastered her craft again. The story reminds me of fairly tales, yet those fairy tales are much more realistic, far more romantic and... passionate. She made the entertainment that reaches its high quality. If you haven't read this book, I recommend you start it now. This book is the one you shouldn't miss. Also, I'd like to recommend another book in sequel, \\"You Belong To Me\\". This later book brings back the characters you admire in \\"Once A Princess\\" while giving you another great intriguing story about one of the most charming characters I can't help but falling in love with since \\"Once A Princess\\", Vasili Petroff."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an enjoyable read","review":"I have read alot of Johanna's books and enjoy most of them but this was not one of them. There was too much anger,hostility,and misunderstanding between the main characters throughout the the whole book. The WHOLE book!All the way to the very end. Now I dont mind at all books that have anger and misunderstanding when characters first meet and here and there throughout the book,but this was ridiculous. It's expected that there will be strife and misunderstanding between the main characters,it's what keeps a book from being boring(with a few exceptions).

I kept waiting for the part when they would be completely sincere and the truth out in the open. It failed. The pants with blood? She doesn't raise hell when his mistress kisses him in front of her? She thinks she is the butt of a joke for way too long, and he thinks to the very end that she is a whore. I still gave it 4 stars because the storyline.

It is a perfect first counting DVD for kids to learn from and it fits nicely with the other Leapfrog products. Throughout the DVD the numbers 1-10 are repeated and re-arranged over and over, but not in a boring way. The DVD makes kids think too because it puts the numbers in different orders, has them answer which number is missing and so forth. The animation is bright, colorful and kid-friendly.

Doesn't seem any different to me than the baggies that cost far far less. One thing on the plus side this bag does fit the iPhone 3G, 4, 4S (but not 5) quite well for keeping it splash resistant.

No, but my nails begin to bend and chip when I stop taking it and my hair falls out much, much more. I am glad the FDA doesn't control yet another thing in my life.

But I would recommend this book to kids ages 6-8. There were two main characters in the book. It didn't tell ages but I think one might be five and the other around 10. I think the theme of this book is that people are deaf and no different. These illustrations are kind of boring and they need a lot more color. This book took place at home and their school. This story really didn't remind me of any personal connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Book!","review":"I read the book I Have A Sister, My Sister Is Deaf. I absolutely hated this book. It is about two sisters. The younger sister is deaf. The author shows how being deaf is no different than not being deaf. The older sister, who is not deaf, treats her sister like a regular person who isn't deaf. They play together very well.I didn't like this book because it lacked description and detail. I also didn't like this book because the pictures were dull and they had no color. I also didn't like how the author didn't give the characters names because I thought they should have names.The only thing I liked about the book was how it made me grateful to not have a disability.

Well, now it's not even safe to expect anything close to it from those 'Hollywood Metal' makers.Their conclusion of their saga is simply terrible comparing to anything they had done before. Allright, the first song is not bad, but the rest of the material consists of... harsh vocals, strange narrator's passages and empty melody lines. Instead of developing their sound by exploring untouched melodical territories, these guys decided to ruin it by collecting garbage and mixing it with their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff from Rhapsody but not their best","review":"I wudn not start on this album if u r new to rhapsody. this is a good album by anybodys standards but if u want perfection get symphony of enchanted lands or legendary tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose the Narrator","review":"This is a very talented band. I liked this from the first song,although they need more variation in their music-most songs sound the same. When they do change the nature of their songs, they are excellent. Their drummer only uses a few different beats(usually the frenzied sixteenth note double bass worn out riff) which really limits the sound of the songs. Listen to Symphony X- V for a much better version for this general music style. The last song is a fantastic epic which is TOTALLY RUINED by the dorky narrator who sounds like a very bad actor with a lisp-I laugh every time I listen to this. The narrative is poor as well. Still-I enjoyed this and will try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power of the Dragonflame","review":"Luca and Alex have outdone themselves with this one!!! This is the best Rhapsody album yet!!!

With a song like Agony is my Name, I cant prevent myself from laughing at it. I ended up giving this cd away to a friend it was so terrible. I like the way the band thought, but their lyrics are absolutely terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"a litmus test","review":"The music of Rhapsody is a litmus test for the quality of a human being in these declining days of Western civilization. If you like this album, you are a good and noble person. If you don't like it, you are a soulless robot sleepwalking through your mediocre and degenerate existence, just like the other ninety-nine percent of the human race. Rhapsody mixes the highest quality of classical music with the most powerful rock-pop ever crafted. They are, by far, the best popular music ensemble in the world, or that has ever been in the world. Some people love them. Some hate them. Almost no one is neutral. That's why they are a litmus test. A soul detector. If you have one, you will love this. If you don't, you won't.

DragonFlame was their frist album I purchased through the advice of the reviews I've read. It is, in essence, filled with powerful songs and outstanding intrumentals. This is great power metal with a symphonic edge to it. There is a fine line however...one can* play this music working out but some songs lean towards being too soft. I just rcved Enchanted Lands album and although the music is of good quality....it is better suited to being heard watching a movie. I don't know who can listen to magical flutes and the like on a constant basis. This aside, Dragonflame is not filled with that garbage and has some very very heavy rifts and powerful ballads. Great songs, great sounds, and it's hard enough to listen pumping iron. If you like power metal...this is a great cd to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but they are getting stuck","review":"I enjoy this CD immensly as I do with all Rhapsody cd. However I can tell that they are starting to cop their own style. Not that this is good or bad. But their music is becoming predicatble and similar. The compositions are excellent with the choir, but what would you expect from Luca. My only wish is that on his solo stuff he would use a different singer to avoid it sounding too much like Rhapsody.All in all if you like Rhapsody you will like this album. It may not become one of your favorites but it is strong non the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great album","review":"I was greatly impressed with this album, more so with the beginning than the end. Rhapsody never ceases to amaze me as they create soaring and memorable choruses, Malmsteen-esque solos, and \\"epic\\" song writing.

This is still a great album that's worthy of the praise it receives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding strategy book for general managers","review":"As a practicing general manager, I found this book to be one of the most useful I have read on the subject of strategic management. The text is clearly written and illustrated with numerous current examples. Unlike many other books on strategy, this one does an excellent job of integrating internal organizational issues with considerations of market competition. Most importantly for me, perhaps, is that the treatment of how strategy is actually carried out in large organizations rings true, giving me a high level of comfort with the relevance of the material. The book gave me numerous strategic insights and left me with a much improved integrated framework of strategy. I highly recommend it to any general manager wishing to improve his strategic thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Core concepts obscured by lousy writing.","review":"Overall the concepts in the book are (1) important to understand and (2) easy to understand. So why is the book so poorly organized, the writing horrible, the examples unhelpful, and the book an overall disappointment? This isn't multi-variable calculus. The only logic I can posit is that the authors were more interested in writing a scholarly text than a readable one. Although many concepts are made unnecessarily complicated, the biggest grip I had is with the writing style. The examples only loosely tie in with concepts, and flowery \\"professor-speak\\" obfuscates relatively easy concepts pointlessly. And in their effort to be PC, they'll switch pronoun gender from \\"he\\" to \\"she\\" or \\"him\\" to \\"her\\" multiple times, even in the same example. Just sloppy. But the text covers the basics, so it gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with level of text","review":"This is a new textbook in the crowded field of business strategy texts. I had high hopes for a book authored by three excellent faculty members from Stanford's Graduate School of Business. The topic coverage is well targeted and includes such process issues as managing strategic change, aligning incentives, and the managers' roles in implementation. Unfortunately, most of the concepts derived from economics are illustrated with examples straight from an introductory undergraduate text in microeconomic principles.

The second terrific aspect is that you get to know others in this game. If someone is newer to the group their personality is revealed in their answers. We play where everyone is encouraged to answer the questions as outrageously and funnily as they can.

I got it used at only $ 8.00, and I saw that it had 2 disks and I thought that it would be good to have because it's 2 disks of pure live ELP, and it was such a low price.

Even when the budget sank lower with each successive sequel, at least the things were funny. Tremors 4, sadly, isn't even all that funny. The film is way too talkly, with very little action to speak of. Yeah, it's cool to see the beginning of the \\"graboids,\\" and Michael Gross deserves credit for his 180 degree turn from our beloved Bert Gummer. And the film isn't without its minor charms (the town of Perfection--as much a character in this series as Gummer himself--started out with the lamentable name \\"Rejection\\"), and those may be enough to satisfy die-hard fans.In the supplemental materials, the crew (and Gross) liken this film to the original Tremors.

Several years before this book was published, commercial machines were available with mass ranges well over 100,000 Da and resolutions of 10,000+. Not only poor, but misleading.

He was a most prolific lecturer. However, this program can be regarded as a bait and switch. It is presented as a work by Alan Watts, but the majority (over 90%) is narrated by someone other than Alan Watts. In the arena of Zen, I can only describe this as the difference between fire and ice. When you hear Alan speak, most erudite, it's fire, when you hear the narrator speak... ice... the narrator lacks any effect, and leaves you listless... not able to listen to the message. Do not purchase this program... you will be disappointed. Only purchase programs that are original lectures by Alan Watts.This is the first review I have ever posted... but was compelled to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watts is excellent, but they screwed up the cassette","review":"I have read Alan Watts now for many years. I used to listen to him on PBS in Berkeley. Watts has a fantastic and interesting style of speaking. He has absolute authority, is interesting, witty, funny, has a great speaking voice. This I knew. What I didn't know was that they simply have small sections of actual Alan Watts speaking, other than that they have some \\"cheesy\\" eastern-synth style music \\"droplets\\", and not meaning to be mean here, a person that is about as interesting as cardboard reading from, presumably Watts book. In other words, instead of spontenaity that Watts always has, this is cement...it is static. It is the anti-zen.

It tells the chronological story of the people and places that shaped Zen into what it is today.It is very specific, using the original names of various people, places, concepts, and sects of Zen. There are hundreds of words you will encounter that you've never heard of, you will hope to retain due to intrigue, but will ultimately forget because you are not Rain Man (at least I'm no Kim Peak).Interspersed into the rich history of Zen is a large amount of what Alan Watts is known for: profound, rich, yet simple, insight.I found this book to be of use for both a history lesson and spiritual growth. Perhaps more a history lesson than a genuine spiritual guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation for Western thinkers.","review":"I read this book in 1983 and still consider it one of the most important books I've read.

This book will help you understand how you think as a Westerner, as well as give you a whole new way of seeing the world from the Oriental view.It's a short book that concisely explains Zen and general Buddhism, along with the older worlds of Taoism and Hinduism out of which it originated.They say this will be the Asian Century - this book will help you understand that part of the world.I find this book pretty hard to get through. I made it about two thirds through, and then decided to wait until I read some other Buddhims books first, then come back to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"Not only is this a great introduction into Zen (and larger philosophical problems), but also a competent critique of contemporary Zen Buddhism in Japan (of course by contemporary, I mean circa 1957). This work presents Zen as a specific historical hybrid of two similar cultural trajectories (Buddhism and Taoism). It is scholarly (including Chinese notes of the specific technical words/ideas and important passages and quotes) which allows Watts to be both an advocate for and a critic of this system of thought - at once shows the usefulness and also the contradictions inherent in Zen as a system or practice. It is never about finding a \\"new\\" system but about learning how to see one's own system as a construct that smooths over the randomness with the semblance of coherent consistency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Throughout these pages, Watts points directly at the enigma that is Zen..

Szulewski said! :) It couldn't be said better. I bought another outdoor blanket which actually has blanket/cloth material on the surface you sit on, which works out great for cold weather days but if you're at the park or beach EVERYTHING sticks to it and it's a royal pain to try and get it out. With this blanket, everything slides or wipes right off. It looks great. It's a great size. It's compact and folds super easily. HIghly recommend it! I get it as a gift for everyone having a baby. It's a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and Attractive","review":"I bought this blanket in the cocoa bubbles pattern and really like how attractive it is and how sturdy it feels. My one year old hopped on it as soon as I unpacked it. He kept crawling to the edge, then back to the middle, and bouncing around to express his approval. I think it will work well at the beach and for any time we are on the grass.Two minor problems: While the blanket has a nice \\"folding guide\\" (hard plastic piece) sewn in and strong velcro closure for securing it closed, it's not that easy to fold up as tightly as you need (i.e. match up the velcro strips). Also, it has a very strong \\"chemical\\" smell from the polyurethane backing. I've had it airing out for a few days but it's going to need a few more. Also, if you like to wash things in the washer (this wipes clean easily), you will probably need to take it to a laundromat to use a commercial washer. The instructions say any washer should hold 5 cubic feet or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible smell","review":"This blanket has the most toxic smell ever! I am returning it immediately! I am trying to research if it's made of pvc but that information is not readily available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disappointed with this Blanket!","review":"I had very high hopes for this blanket, despite the negative reviews about the awful toxic odor, because there were still so many other positive reviews here on Amazon and on other merchants' sites, and I also really like the other JJ Cole Collections products. I thought perhaps I would have better luck, or that the odor would not be as bad as some of the reviewers made it out to be. But it was WORSE! After opening the package, I immediately smelled the horrible toxic-plastic smell. It was completely overwhelming to the point that after I put the blanket back in its packaging and shipment box to return it, I still had the smell in my nose and throat! Terrible! I wish there were a way to give it just a half of a star for this so you could see that it's been reviewed, but it does not even rate a full star. 0.5/5 = 10% = very low F."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blanket, No smell....","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for. I needed something so that I can sit with my new baby and not have to worry about the blanket blowing all over the place...This has enough weight in where it will stay where you put it. I did have some concerns that other reviewers where saying about an smell from the blanket. The minute I opened up the packaging, I took a big wiff and I couldn't smell anything. So maybe the issue of the smell was fixed, or maybe I lucked out from a production line perspective. Overall I am very satisfied with the quality of this blanket."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubber smell too strong to use indoors, even after washing twice","review":"This is more of a rubber mat with a fabric cover. I would not have called it a \\"blanket\\" if I'd seen it in person first. I bought this to use both indoors and outdoors, but the rubber chemical smell is too strong to have inside the house or in my car. So it lives in the garage now, and I have yet to find anything to use it for. I did wash it twice, and the smell is reduced but still pretty strong. I don't think it would bother me for a picnic on the grass outdoors, but it's not acceptable otherwise.Would not buy this if I could do it over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GREAT","review":"This product is awesome. It is easy to set up, heavy weight/durable, easy to clean off and fold up! Perfect for day trips and just sitting out in the grass. Easy to carry! Baby-proof.

I think I will go with the similar (slightly longer at 7ft. - 84\\"X54\\") TUFFOblanket instead, which is 100% Cotton on top and Nylon on the back, also water resistant. The fabric make-up may not bother somepeople, but one of the reviews said that the blanket off-gassed an icky smell, which prompted me to find out what it is made from.I gave it two stars because I was forced to give it something, and others seem pleased with it.

And I love the built in fold guides and the carry strap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blanket ever","review":"I love this blanket and we brought it to a beach. My 15 month had a nap on it and it's definitely softer than a beach blanket.

We use it as bub's play rug inside, where he can drool and lick and crawl around.For outdoors, it works perfectly as a picnic blanket, keeping everything dry on damp ground.The fabric is easy to clean, it looks great, and the way it folds into a pouch is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Beach Blanket","review":"We just got this and used it at the beach and it worked wonderfully. It was quite windy and it didn't blow over or anything. I didn't have to chase it around. Depending on what you want to use it for it will either be too small or just right. I use this for my 7 month old so I don't have to worry about her eating the ground. Perfect size for my two kids to sit on. If you want to use it for laying out at the beach then it will be too small. Your legs will likely not fit on the blanket. I was hesitant despite the wonderful reviews because people were complaining about the smell. When I opened the bag there was a slight smell but when I opened it up at the beach it was fine. No smell. There was also some concerns about the velcro. It does unfortunately face the ground so it does pick up debris. Overall I am thrilled with this blanket. Not having to chase it around when it is windy is good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"I am super impressed by this picnic blanket. I can't say enough good about it. I would recommend it to anyone. Perfect for picnics on wet or damp grass, the beach, whatever!

If you put it on the grass and the grass is cold or damp you will get cold and wet in no time. I would not let my baby use it, it is too risky. I would be better off getting a foam mat, like a yoga mat or similar, it would be much more useful. Even if I go to the beach, I will not take this as it would stick to the skin, a regular towel would be better. So sad I got fooled by all the good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it now, arrived smelling like gas","review":"When the blanket arrived it had such a strong gasoline smell that I had to move it outside. I unfolded it and sprayed it down outside and let it air dry and air out for two days. The smell had not improved. I was set to really dislike this blanket, but eventually (over about a week) the smell faded. We used it for a picnic at a very muddy park and we were the only family with dry bottoms! Clean up was a breeze and I didn't realize it when I bought it, but the little flap that stick out when the blanket is unfolded is the part that will be against your body when you fold it back up so I didn't get muddy carrying it home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good item","review":"easy to carry, sand shakes out easily. A little hard to fold back up, but overall a really good item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I ordered this blanket because I wanted something that sand wouldn't cling to easily on the beach. This blanket was perfect. We used it on grassy areas on the way down to give my 10 month grandson a crawling respite from his car seat. Then we used it every day at the beach. I loved the large size and the fact that sand would shake off of it. I was concerned about washing it since the company recommended a commercial washer but decided to go ahead and wash in my home washer. It came out perfectly. I love the way it folds up easily and to a carriable size. This was just what my family needed on our trip! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because some debris does stick to the velcro as some other reviewers have mentioned, but it is not much and it washed off great. It never interfered with the folding of the blanket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"We've used this blanket indoors and outdoors.

We have been using this for over 3 years now, so this is not an impulsive review.

All in all, great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this but its heavy!","review":"I got this fir a beach holiday and its fab!! You dont get a damp bottom, its robust and the colour and style of it is fab. It is slightly on the heavy side to carry - if it was carried alone its fine - because of the strap its easy (its also easy to fold) But i took it in my beach bag with all the essentals and it was a little on the heavy side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, you'll love it!","review":"We used this blanket 1-2 times per week all summer. It's a great blanket. Never felt any dampness from the grass. Holds up well to spills and other baby mishaps.

We get asked all the time where we purchased this blanket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Chemical Odor","review":"I was excited for this blanket as the reviews are great. I was extremely disappointed when I opened it and it had a HORRIBLE CHEMICAL ODOR! I would NEVER allow my infant to roll around on this thing. It CAN'T be good for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality, but...way too small","review":"I bought this blanket based on other customer reviews, after a summer-long search for the perfect picnic blanket. While it is well made, reasonably priced, and much nicer looking than other blankets out there - it's WAY too small. I take up the entire thing if I'm lying down on it in the park. If another person is there, forget about it - half of our bodies are on the grass. I'll probably use it at the beach if anything, and will keep it on hand as a spare blanket, but plan on looking for a larger one for next summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not waterproof","review":"This mat is just ok. Yes it folds nicely but I learned the hard way that this is NOT waterproof in any way.

The photos are so off it's perplexing, let alone misleading. The solid outer fabric color is practically army green. For the inside lining, the darker stripes aren't dark gray in color, but chocolate brown and the lighter gray stripes are actually olive green. The orange is however orange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Park Blanket!","review":"Although this is listed as a baby product, I don't have any kids and I love it! I use this as a great alternative to a blanket in the park for a number of purposes...reading, picnics, a night at an outdoor festival, you name it! The fact that it folds up to a small size WITH a shoulder strap makes it very easy to carry and convenient. It is made out of a lightweight nylon fabric on the side that goes down (on the grass side) so it's water and stain resistant and easy to clean, and the side you sit on is very soft and comfortable. It also has a small outside pocket when it's folded up, so you can carry small stuff with you, like keys, a book, a small water bottle, etc. I highly recommend this to anyone who spends any time outdoors!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky chemicals!","review":"Not sure why this has gotten so many positive reviews. I can't imagine anyone would miss the horrible smell coming off this product. I have been trying to air mine out for a few weeks now and it still fills our entire spare room with a kerosene smell, this is after leaving it outside for a few days. I'm afraid to put my baby on it. After all, her nose will be only a few inches above the gasses that are coming out of this thing. Very cheaply made, and another reviewer said it's not even water proof. Don't buy the hype- looks good in the pics but not in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blanket ever","review":"This is the best blanket I have ever owned.

The blanket folds up and has a flap with velcro that makes it into a bag which I think is the best feature.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blanket, although kind of pricey","review":"I think this blanket is great. I took it out on a picnic and, sure enough, some water was spilled - but the water easily wiped away. The blanket is easy to fold up and tote around. Seems perfect for the beach as well.

I recently took my infant son to the park and he enjoyed playing on it--it's nice and thick and any spills just wipe clean in seconds. Plus, you just fold it up and carry it over your shoulder when you are done. Best Amazon purchase I've made in a long, long time. Highly recommended, great price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best beach blanket you can buy!","review":"We have tried many different blankets for the beach and by far this is the best. Sand does not stick to it, and it's heavy so it won't blow up or away. It's also very easy to fold up. I've never had an issue not being able to velcro it, you just have to fold it the right way. It even has a flap that is stiffer than the rest to use as a guide so that it folds quickly and easily. It is so compact that I keep it in the back of my car at all times. I can't tell you how many times I have pulled it out for a spur of the moment park trip and it's been GREAT!! Love it. Well worth every penny. We've also had ours for 3 years and it still looks new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blanket ever","review":"I love this blanket...good for parks, beach, your backyard...really anything! It's big enough for my baby, me and my husband!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome travel blanket for all weather conditions","review":"We bought this blanket b/c our friend has the exact same one and it was very useful on many occasions. We like it b/c unlike most other blankets in this category, it has the nylon-like material on both sides, making it easy to clean and better for putting down in wet conditions like a dewy grass field. We have another blanket that has fleece on one side, which is nice and cozy, but we also end up having to put it in the wash more often b/c it gets wet dirt/mud on it, or if my kids spill on it, things soak in rather than wipe up.My husband, toddler and I fit fine on it but when we add baby to the mix, it can get a little crowded but we all still fit and I would not call it a deal breaker. It is not teeny tiny when folded up, but also not huge and bulky. I'd say it's just right to throw in the car or stroller for day trips. May not want to take on long plane flight trips if you also travel with a lot of other carry on baggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really works well.","review":"I really like this. Both sides are waterproof and wipeable. It packs up really nice. It's pretty big. I feel like this would work well on a picnic. I bought it for couch with puppies. Works well for that too although they love digging at it to make the vinyl noise (they're weird). It's held up well. Only complaint is if you use it on couch, the flaps for the packet it folds into are awfully rigid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute,but way too small","review":"I really wanted to like this blanket, but it's just too small.

It's a great color and the quality is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blanket !!","review":"This is a great blanket, exactly what I was looking for.Easy to clean up, water resistant, folds up into a massanger bag - so easy to carry.I bought gray/green one and the colors are very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blanket","review":"One of my friends had it, and she talked about it very highly. And when I looked, it was on sale so I bought it. This is a very nice blanket. We keep it in the trunk of our car, so we can use it when we go to a park. The great part of this blanket is you can wash it in the washer.Unfortunate part is the durable outer fabric is not waterproof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"This was great to have with us on our vacation to the Gulf Coast. It was wasy to fold with two people, might be a little more difficult alone but never had to try so not sure. It was difficult to remove the slightly damp sand that inevitably ended up on there but that is a pretty minor downside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Outdoor Blanket","review":"We've bought this blanket twice b/c we lost the first one and after reviewing several others, think this is the most washable...many have \\"water proof\\" backsides that touch the ground but don't have a very wipeable top surface which is critical for toddlers!

It is a wonderful size and easily wipes clean. The design is very cute as well (I have the blue cocoa bubble). Just wanted to let everyone know that I found this at my local Babies R Us (they had the light green stripe and the brown cocoa bubble one) for $19.98. You can also use one of their 20% off coupons, which makes this a much better deal than online/amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Conscience Text","review":"I found this text to be very useful to me and prefer it among other steel texts. Concentration on bridges makes this book even more valuable. The text in, many sections, deals with some more advanced theories about steel which you may not find in many texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was in Jamaica while reading this book. It was so disappointing to read when it was much more about the author than Bob Marley. I would give this book a half star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"Many books written by Jamaicans about other Jamaicans tend to hold back on personal opinions -- maybe dem fraid of the consequences. Not this one. In a very entertaining account, Don Taylor discusses his time with Bob Marley in a very frank manner. I was most intrigued by the strange relationship between Bob and Rita. Bob, at least according to Taylor, used to beat Rita. She in turn retaliated by forging his name on checks. Some people have complained that this book is too much about Taylor himself but the title after all is \\"Marley and ME\\" not just \\"Marley\\" and that first chapter of his own harrowing growing-up years on the Kingston waterfront is riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reputable Supporter Would Have Written This","review":"The late Taylor's role in the Marley saga has always been suspect, whether pushing Bob's widow into signing a false will--and getting a kickback from the opposition for his efforts--(as disclosed in the Cayman Music court case) to reportedly embezzling Marley's tour money. A hateful book by someone undeserving of trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Handler's Tale Is Bad News About HIM","review":"Marley's first mistake was to put his faith in Taylor. A classic tale of a manager's betrayal. The author's come off as a monster, even though he tries to build himself into someone more important even than Bob. Sadder than sad. Marley wrote a song about this guy called \\"Bad Card.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Support This Crook","review":"Don Taylor was Bob Marley's manager, yes. But he also stole alot of money from Bob - he lied about concert earnings to put more money in his own pocket. Anyone who buys this book is directly supporting a man who stole from Marley. Bob was pissed when he found out about Taylor's dishonesty, and he wrote Bad Card, a song off of his masterpiece, Uprising (1980). I refuse to pay for a book that will benefit a man who stole from Bob Marley. Don Taylor, you are a filthy thief, and your attempt to capitalize off of Bob makes me SICK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"Being a fan of Marley i found this book hard to put down. It tells the exciting story from Bob's managers point of view and shows insight to some of the songs giving you a new understanding of the King of Reggae. I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to see Bob in a new way as it follows him from his early days until his death in 1981."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Marley's Own Albert Goldman","review":"Man, this is the unreal story. This is a nasty thing done by a guy who lived off Bob, and then he tried to take bad advantage after Bob was gone. He's just like the writer Albert Goldman was with John Lennon, acting like a backstabber, trying to bury somebody he was jealousy of after he had passed. Nobody needs to bother with this thing, it's evil to the core."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so negative?","review":"I have read just about every book available regarding Bob Marley. This was the last book on my list, and now that I have read it I know why. Don Taylor's version of his life with Bob is written in such negative context. He fills the pages with pats on his own back writing about those he loaned money to and never got it back. About what HE did for Bob. Definately left me feeling angry, bored and dissapointed. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming, with both tension and humor.","review":"Michelle Reid is one of my favorite series writer and I always purchase her books. Just like her prior books, this pulled at heart strings and alot was due to the love that Vitto and Catherine shared for their son. I reccommend if you are looking for a fast pace, sensual, sometimes humourous read. Their son Santo was adorable.Just like the prior reviewer, didn't respect Vitto that much in his defense of \\"the other woman\\", but felt he suffered sufficiently for his mistakes. I loved the ending, it made me smiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I was disappointed with this DVD. I usually like all of Denise Austin's video workouts, so I bought this one for my little sister. She wasn't interested in it, and I can see why. Everything seems too choreographed, and then kids are fake. They don't look like \\"normal\\" kids - they're obviously dancers/actors, or something. I also bought Billy Blanks - Tae Bo Kicks for my little sister, and she loved it!!

It is easy to follow for all ages. They love to do the family part. Sometimes it is difficult to get kids motivated, but this DVD really helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitness made fun!","review":"My kids and I love this workout video! It is perfect fun activity for daily workouts, for bad weather days or just to do when we don't have other sports. The first 20 minute workout introduces moves in a way that my 10 year old can follow (but I can still get a good workout if I do it with her). The 2nd workout is more difficult but alot of fun because of the buddy system and the use of balls. I started to not buy it because of the bad rating, but I am glad I did. It has kept my kid's attention and Denise is so positive and motivating. I definitely recommend this to any parent who is trying to get their kids more active!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin's Fit Kids is a great video","review":"The video is very well done. I appreciate that it has a segment for kids as well as one that involves the entire family. It is a great workout with lots of high energy. I researched for a long time to find a great video for my Fitness Literacy Kit and finally found one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy for 10 year old","review":"This was a cute idea but not motivating or challenging for my 10 year old. She wanted to start getting conditioned for soccer season and this was a waste of money for that purpose. May be good for younger kids who just want to get up and move around but not for anything more serious than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I have been buying workout video's/DVD's with Denise Austin for years and have been very happy with them. However since Denise is no longer with Artisan (she is now with Lions Gate) the quality has changed. The camera man can't seem to sit still. When I buy a workout DVD, it's not because I want to look at a pertty face. Far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we, or as in this case our child/ren, need to do. By the second workout, the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow. Still, it is not the quality I am used to from Denise. It could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Younger Children","review":"My six year old (who has NEVER been very excited about exercise) really loves this DVD. The routine is active, fun and most importantly easy to learn. Other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered. She completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning, she asked to do it again! My 2 1/2 year old has a great time \\"dancing\\" with us as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!","review":"This is a horrible workout video! I should have listened to the reviews and not have bought it. It's not repetitive enough so my 6 year old had a hard time following the moves. It's also a very BORING workout. Boring setting, boring music and boring moves. Denise doesn't know how to motivate children. Don't waste your money on this one. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor video","review":"Neiter myself or my 3 year old enjoyed this exercise video. I didn't think it was kid-friendly, and it didn't hold his (or my) attention. The cover promises an exciting workout, but in reality we found it bland. My son likes my adult yoga and pilates DVDs a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I purchased this for our middle school. I donated it to the alternative and girl's special gym class. They all were appreciative and could not wait to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that kid friendly","review":"I really didn't like that it had yoga in I didn't know it when I bought it but I would not have purchased this knowing it had yoga. Other than that Denise doesn't really seem very into it almost like she doesn't really know what to say to get kids motivated. The music is not upbeat AT ALL but very dull. My kids didn't even like it. I would recommend looking for something with more upbeat music so your kids will be more into it. This is not a good workout video!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a little bit loose","review":"When I put it into my chinchilla's cage, they began hoping from one ledge to the other like crazy.

It is a fine book, both, for a student composer taking lessons, or a beginner \\"self-taught\\" composer (if you are somewhat familiar with European \\"Classical\\" music styles (17th - 20th centuries). Also, it is a good reference. Unlike his earlier Serial Composition book, here, Smith Brindle considers many diverse styles; some of them, have much relevance to today's eclectic \\"compositional scene.\\" I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good help for intermediate level","review":"Dr. Smith Brindle offers a very usefull text for those who alredy started in composition. This book provides both theory and practice. It's a good choice for one familiared with the main counterpoint and harmonic procedures, as well with a background in Music History."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE!!!","review":"Great books on music composition are, in my opinion, extreamly hard to find. This one is very good. It covers a lot. As a fan of the composition of diatonic art-music (sometimes with chromatic color added) I love the first half of this book, and the last half covering modern music composition including atonalism, etc. is also great.As a fan of melodic composition the approach given in this book is great.To get the most out of this book the student should have a knowledge of basic music notation and diatonic harmony.In my opinion, this is one of the best books on begining musical composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"Suspend all your cynicism, turn down the lights and bathe in this lush, sweeping, sentimental album of Cannonball, backed by Bill Russo's strings.

Right?","review":"Imagine if you took every dark and self-loathing thought that a person ever had and then lumped it into a book. If you can imagine that then you might just understand this book. The art is phenominal, the writing is heart-wrenching and extremely clear and beautiful, but this book is not for the easily upset. Though Ware's comic style is often misread due to its breaking of the common left to right, top to bottom format this book is definetly worth the time it takes to read it. If you're a common reader of Graphic Novels or just starting out this is a great book for you.Warning: don't buy this for your ten year old son. Comics aren't just for kids anymore and if you don't know that yet you will soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjusted for accessible viewing.","review":"This is yet another masterpiece from the wonder that is Acme Novelty. This book is a collection of assorted comics and advertisement parodies that would mortify even the most seasoned of profligates. Be aware that if you own everything already you will probably not be seeing anything new. But this beautifully sized, securely hard-bound collective of Acme Novelty tid-bits is perfectly adjusted for accessible viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful, but depressing","review":"As another reviewer noted, the type in this book is so small that reading is an effort. And the stories are depressing enough that a little goes a long way. The book is quite lovely, but I seldom find myself reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - better sources of this info","review":"Marginally useful at best.

If features more than 600 full color, sharp photos and covers over 5,000 models. There is a useful introduction to the collectible, and it provides basic radio terms and descriptive information. Everything is listed by company. It appears to be a very comprehensive listing, but there are probably many models that do not appear. I'm certain no book has every model of all of the radios made. Items are easily located, and every major maker is included. Prices are updated for 1997. I'm a novice in this area of collectibles, but it appears to me that the book is quite comprehensive.

Sadly enough this game is not what I expected it to be. I do acknowledge though that Oblivion has great graphics and gives players numerous places to explore. I personally didn't enjoy the game much, but I am willing to give it another chance if in the future there is a special edition since I refuse to pay an additional $30 for the Shivering Isles extension pack. Strangely enough, I do find myself recommending this game to any RPG fan out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Favorite","review":"It's a Bethesda Softworks RPG for XBOX 360... Should I really have to write anything else? The game is landmark for the console and should be on everyone's list. Games are beginning to outclass this one in terms of graphics, etc. but the game itself is still solid and a lot of fun to play. The explorable areas are practically endless and the environment is truly beautiful and wandering aimlessly can be as much fun as pursuing the many quests available in the game. If you like RPG's, or are already familiar with Elder Scrolls titles like Morrowind, you should not even be reading this - buy the game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Open Ended Adventure Title that No 360 Owner Should Miss","review":"I can't remember the last time I played a game so huge and involved and enjoyed it as much as Oblivion. There is a ton of customization, deep and open ended gameplay, multiple quest & story lines, and a large world to explore. How this game fit on a single disk will baffle me for the rest of my days.I must warn everyone though, this game will take over your life and soon you will find yourself playing hours and hours per day. Even after completing the 'story' the game is far from over. There are dozens of hidden dungeons, miles of landscape to traverse... I don't think I can make a complete review of this title without missing a ton of exciting and interesting features.So why don't you do yourself a favor and if you own a 360, get this game. Adventure & RPG fans will no doubt enjoy this game to death, but even people who don't may find the compelling gameplay too difficult to overlook. It is truly one of the greatest games of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oblivion","review":"Great game for the XBOX360. Enjoy it very much. I play it on my 52in Sony at 1080p.

Also, the button to stand is the same as when you're given the option to take something. My character has been arrested a few times because he got caught stealing when he simply wanted to stand-up.

My first impression was the amazing personalization that the game allows for your character. You can tweak just about every facial feature, which adds some interesting fun. The play itself has a kind of old school feel to it, a little clunky. Considering that the game is several years old it still holds up when compared to games such as fable II though. It seems there is a lot to explore in this game with diverse stratagem to make your way through it. If you like RPGs then I say this game is worth a shot.

I played it for about 4 hours or so and I was starting to get bored. There is a lot of detail and involvement in creating and setting up your character. In the end it's an OK RPG, maybe it works for some people, but not for me. I'm also playing Mass Effect and Bioshock right now and both are waaaay funner. I went to my local used games shop, and they only offered me 8 bucks for my copy of Elder Scrolls IV. They had a lot of them on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I guess I'm missing something here, but the game was confusing as hell. I've played RPGs before, but mostly ones from Squaresoft which aren't as customizable as this one was. In my opinion, the customization is annoying...it makes the game way to complicated. I'll put it this way - I've played for over 20 hours and I still don't know how to get my guy to gain a level. There's just way too many skills and stuff in this game.The graphics are okay. If you're not playing on a HDTV, this game will look a lot like a PS2 game. The gameplay is pretty tedious. Combine those 2 features and you've got one heck of an overrated game.One last gripe - and maybe this only occurs on my system - but the graphics \\"skip\\" around very frequently while playing. This was by no means a smooth playing experience. It seems like they made the worlds too big for the 360 to handle or something, because it skips around quite frequently during normal gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"oblovion xD this games is awsome xD","review":"i do not own this game but my uncle deos (im using my moms acount) and it is like the best game in the world i was obsessed and now that i have 360 i have HAVE HAVE!!! to get it xD i would buy it its worth the money and i love it. it is so good.

Been playing for around 30+ hours now, and I still haven't even joined a guild, or did any missions. Just roaming around doing random things, so I know for a fact I'm going to get my moneys worth out of this one.The only reason I rate it 4 stars overall, is because even though it seems to be a pretty vast game, the map is actually a bit small for my liking. Hell, I cant even wander into the Black Marsh.

It seems that NOBODY these days knows how to make TRUE HORROR flicks like they did in the 80's.

El disco es muy pop.I want the old Julieta back. Rock mata pop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julieta's crossover to pop is a success","review":"Mexican singer-songwriter Julieta Venegas somewhat of a breakthrough album, as she left behind her previous punk/rock sound to a more pop style. The change apppears upfront in the album's kitschy cover, showing Julieta as a traditional bride dressed in white against a pink background. Predictably, some people have accused Julieta of selling out, but there are many great songs here: Lento (great video as well), the mexican folk-inspired Andar conmigo, Algo esta Cambiando, Oleada and others. This was her first work produced by Coti Sorokin and Cachorro Lopez, and the results are better (at least in my opinion) than the previous productions by Gustavo Santaolalla. She would make another album with Sorokin and Lopez, Limon y Sal, which I think is even better than Si, but this album is very much worthwhile listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's too bad she isn't more well known in the States","review":"After hearing Julieta Venegas on the KCRW \\"Sounds Eclectic\\" compilation (\\"Casa Abandonada\\"), I have been a fan ever since. Although she's well known in Latin America, she hasn't yet got the recognition she deserves in the US. I loved both \\"Aqui\\" and \\"Bueninvento,\\" and eagerly awaited her latest album.\\"Si\\" is a bit of a departure from the other two, but it's still a stunningly-crafted, well-written album.

It's nice to see how Julieta's style changes. It is definately more of a \\"happy\\" album and a lot of the songs have an electro/pop kind of feel to it.

Mr. Smith examines conceptions of the divine family and council of the gods, more general notions of ancient aspects of divinity, and the roles of various divinity. Especially insightful is his critique of James Frazier's category of \\"dying and rising\\" gods in the Near East. In his analysis of Isaiah, he gives considerable background into Mesopotamian views on the divinity of statues of gods, whithout prejudice. There is a lot more than I can list here in this book, but if you're interested in how the idea of one, all-powerful god came about, this is really essential reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholars Dream","review":"This is an excellently documented book, written by a true scholar.

The second season was not as good (especially once they did away with Godric). Almost so bad that I stopped watching, but I really really REALLY wanted to see Marianne die. I started watching season 3 to find out what Sookie was and because I thought the involvement of werewolves might add some new flavor and be more fleshed out than it actually was. By the time I realized that wasn't the case I wanted to see Russell die the True Death--at this point I will give due credit to the villians on the show. Bravo--but the season finale may be the straw that broke the camels back. NOTHING was brought to any sort of conclusions. It was more like a midseason cliffhanger or your average episode of Lost. Spare yourself (as well as your time and money) and forgot they ever made a Season 3, this show is just going to start spinning in circles."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an outrage","review":"This series has gotten absolutely stupid and CHEEZY.

It thrusts the show forward to crazy levels, even more epic in scale than the Fellowship of the Sun conflict and even Maryann's craziness. (No spoiler alerts though!) This leads to some very good storylines, and some that are just plain boring.In spite of a few fallbacks, the show is still of great quality. No matter how ridiculous the characters' situations are, they remain true to their personality and character. \\"True Blood\\" has a great balance between the consistency of its characters while still surprising us at every turn.This season also introduced (and killed off) some great new characters.

I was impressed how closely Alan Ball had followed the book and was excited to see further seasons of the True Blood series. Season Two was a horrible disappointment that I actually thought couldn't get worse. Alas, Season Three was irksome to say the least. There isn't anything closely resembling the books other than the names of some of the characters. My biggest wish is for Alan Ball to stop doing any further damage to this wonderful series of stories written by Charlaine Harris. I can't believe she actually gave Alan Ball full rights without monitoring his scripts more closely. Don't bother watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"too far.","review":"I enjoyed the first season...it was interesting, witty, original.the second season was a bit graphic..but the third season is beyond graphic, it isnt' funny, it isn't interesting; it's a gore fest from start to finish. Gore for gore's sake. I not only couldn't stand watching it, I had to get it out of the house, I couldn't stand the sight of the box.

All I'll say about season 3 is that the show isn't treating Tara very well. It's not the role she plays so much as the way directors are portraying her. For one thing, her appearance. She is perpetually greasy -- her face is extremely oily all the time. Is that supposed to portray a southern black? If so, it's stereogyping and it is ugly. And the show has her lip wobbling and chin bobbling at an all-time high; for heaven's sake, let the woman show unhappiness via a broader range of expression. She's a good actress and deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood","review":"I watch the series and like to own it. the people who portray the main characters truly resemble the way I picture them in my mind when I am reading the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood Season 3 - Going Downhill?","review":"I love True Blood but I just don't know if I am loving it less with every passing season.

Maybe it's because I like my records focused, but this record has no direction at all.

It is appropriately trippy, sometimes rocking out quite a bit. The songs with vocals do stand out for obvious reasons (character, good lyrical content), especially the opener \\"Linoleum\\" with ghostly vocals by David Sylvian spiked with a roaring guitar.

A couple of scenes were boring, especially the ones with the opera singers.

The cloth where the childs legs dangle wore off completely on the corners (where the aluminum bars are)! I ended up having to buy another stroller! If your child can't sit still and wants to stretch his/her legs behind the foot rest...this stroller is not appropriate!Also the wires that hold the canopy got twisted by the handlers at the airport!Although there are some pros like price, weight, and rugged wheels the cons for me still outweigh the pros.Cons:1.It gave out by 7 months2.Little storage space under chair3.The recline doesnt really recline all that much4.When walking my feet would always bump into the wheels5.

I looked down at my little guy and he was standing on his left foot on the footrest and I couldn't figure out why .. well it turned out that the seat broke right out from underneath him. He weighs less than thirty pounds .. he's not a giant or anything. What a cheap piece of doo doo .. I would never buy another product from this company and especially NOT this stroller. It's not even as attractive as it in the pics .. what a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this stroller when my son outgrew the infant carrier and we no longer needed the travel system.

It was about $30.00 more but well worth it.

I WANTED To make it work because all of the other reviews on this stroller were so positive, but it didn't work for my toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STROLLER!!!","review":"I purchased this stroller for my 9-month old to take on his first vacation since it folds like an umbrella stroller and is light weight. We were very suprised and extremely pleased that we did. The handle bars are higher than other lightweight strollers so my husband (6'2\\") and myself (5'6\\") are hunched over trying to push this. My son has never been uncomfortable in it even going through a zoo. We even took it on a plane trip and it was so quick to fold down to be gate checked. This is a must for anyone who is traveling or even going for quick trips to the mall. Has almost all the benefits of the large travel systems (no cup holder or snack tray, but they get in the way sometimes) but weighs a lot less and takes up a lot less room in the trunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact but not light","review":"I am not crazy about this stroller. It is much heavier than our Graco Metrolite Travel System stroller, it does not have any cup holders for parent or child, it's not that easy to fold down/open up, the canopy holder is not well made - the canopy can easily fall off. The only good thing about it is that it folds up smaller than the Metrolite stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful at first","review":"This stroller was great at first. We loved it for a while but as our daughter got older and bigger the seat started to fall apart. Now our daughter who just turned two is barely 24 pounds. Size wise she is small. But she can get in and out of strollers herself. On the part where the child sits the two bars that hold the fabric in place started to rip the fabric not even six months after we purchased the stroller. It has now been eight months and we had to go buy a new stroller because the fabric had ripped so much our daughter started slipping out of the stroller and got her foot caught in the wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 girls","review":"I love this stroller!

My six month old does well in it and likes it better than the big stroller he was used to.

I've gotten lots of compliments on it and \\"I wish I had that one..\\" type remarks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret getting it","review":"This was our second light weight stroller that we bought when our first child was 24 months old. Our major reasons purchasing it were the reclining capability, light weight, rain cover, big wheels, wider seats and much lower price tag than the other popular ones (such as Combi, Maclaren and Peg Perego). We thought we got a real good deal for the money... but now the child is 40 months and the stroller was falling apart and we had to buy yet another light weight - Maclaren Triumph, hoping it'll be our last one! The problems with the Chicco Capri stroller are 1)the canopy is useless and does not stay in place when it's not being used, 2) it's very hard to push and does not maneuver well with a child over 35 pounds, 3)wheels lock up often with a heavier child. In retrospect, we should've spent the money and bought a more sturdy ligh weight stroller to last 3 toddler hoods!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sets off Alarms at Malls!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this stroller when I first bought it at the store. Then, when I went to the mall the next day, I was setting off all the security alarms. I took everything out of the stroller and walked through again and still went off.

No one will ever be able to meet the expectations of the \\"experts\\", but thank you, Brian and Kevin, for letting us enjoy Dune again. I'm looking forward to the rest. Let's learn to enjoy books and stories without being so critical about the style. Some will never be satisfied, but most of us are. Literature is for entertainment as well as art. So just enjoy the books for what they are, fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"House Atredies: The story behind the story of Dune","review":"This book is a major accomplishment for the authors, who, using Frank Hebert's original notes about Dune, have constructed a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor, the epic, Dune. I was very impressed at the level of detail the authors gave in referencing the orginal novel, especially when it came to the inner workings of House Atredies itself. I have gone back after reading this novel, and have begun reading again the original Dune novel. Brian Hebert and Kevin Anderson have really given us something to be proud of and worthy of the extra bucks it takes to buy it in hardcover. Although some have said that this novel is nothing like the original as far as style, it is truly an enriching story that only makes me love the Dune series even more. I have rated this novel at four stars instead of five--due to some rather quirky language in some parts. Overall-- You must read this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, its all good","review":"This story stuck marvelously well to the \\"Past\\", that is the past as it was outlined in the orginial novel. Brian and Kevin did try to make it more interesting by adding charecters we had never heard of(2 dimentional ones at that) most of these charecters they added to try and sucker in a younger audience. Still the book is very vivid and describtive, if you are willing to take the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"House Atreides","review":"The sublety and dark complexity of the original Dune novels is absent here...the clumsiness and cliche apparent in this book made it a sad disappointment. Only the names remain the same... do yourself a favor and read Dune again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt at writing","review":"I have read the original 6 Dune books by Frank Herbert at least 10 times each, and I found these prequels an insult to Frank Herbert. Just because Brian Herbert is his son does not make him a good writer. What's missing in these books is Frank Herbert's insight and observational skill. The Dune books make so many observations in regards to religion, science, politics, etc. that can only come from Frank Herbert's insight. As far as I'm concerned these prequels have no place in the Dune universe. The only canon are the original 6 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun.","review":"Let me say right up front that Dune: House Atreides would never be mistaken for a work by FH. Some of the magic of the original derives from the fact that prose is layered upon layers, just like the plots themselves. BH and KA miss many of the old man's tricks - the use of color to set mood, the fact that the first volume was written as an epic poem, then rewritten as prose.Nonetheless, I found the book highly entertaining. All these years, I've wondered about what Ix looked like, what Geidi Prime would look like, and so on. Duncan Idaho's back story was good. More than anything the real strength of the book is in filling in details that FH only hinted at in the novels.Many parts of the book are obviously tongue in cheek, in a kind of nudge nudge wink wink kind of way. Far from being cheesy, I found these portions very funny. I mean, no one is ever going to BE FH, and so playing around a little seems to deliberately acknowledge this fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your Daddy's Dune","review":"This book is dreadful.

Too bad, we miss Frank Herbert very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait and See","review":"I have read a number of the comments that people have written on this page and realized that, unlike the original Dune series written by Frank Herbert, these new prequel books may not \\"stand alone\\" as some people would like them too. I suggest that everyone wait and read ALL of the books in the prequel before they opine about anything. I'm sure that when DUNE itself first came out people didn't see how it would fit in the Sci Fi universe but after 5 more books and a somewhat random movie, they finally understood what Frank Herbert was trying to say. So just wait and see..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the new book very much!","review":"At first I was very concerned if the Brian Herbert and Mr. Anderson could pull off such a challenging endeavor. I was pleasantly surprised that they did it without much trouble at all. I enjoyed seeing the Dune Universe come alive again. These two talented authors left an avenue available for another book following House Atreides, yet in the authors notes in the back of their book they talk about the incredibly challenging task of finishing what the original author left unfinished by his untimely death. They plan to write the next book after ChapterHouse Dune. I can't wait. Best of luck to them and I hope their next endeavor won't keep me in the edge of my seat too long. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune Virgin","review":"House atreides was the first Dune novel i ever read, Infact it was the first sci-fi book I ever read, Infact it was one of the first books i read since i left primary school ten years ago!

I was amazed by the way i really felt i was there had a vision in my mind of what all the charactures looked like, and had emotions that were based on the way the story opened up in front of me. Well anyway the imagination needed to create such a atmosphere to even the most illiterate of people speaks for itself. I am now reading house harkonnen and am once again enjoying two seperate lives!

It could've been exciting if FH dictated it, because it is a good story, but the writing was monotonous. There was frequent sidetracks with obvious information repeated again and again.Writing- D-. Paragraphs full of 3rd person thoughts that are so irrelevant. Hardly any dialouge. Chapters average about 3-6 pages long and ALWAYS switch to a new place every time. Characters are \\"paper thin\\" as another reviewer put it.There are some parts in the book that are exciting and almost feel like Dune but it really comes off like a book for a 12 or 13 year old. It took me a good 2 months to finish it because I had to force myself to read through it. I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but I heard the same thing from people and I still read it anyway. The next book in the series will be better, have hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the Future with Dune's Past","review":"What a great read Dune House Atreides is.The original Dune novel established a universe created by Frank Herbert that is revisited by authors Brian Herbert(Frank's son) and Kevin J. Anderson. Dune House Atreides is set in time approximately one generation before the original novel takes place. The reader is introduced to familiar(and unfamiliar) characters that become the main players in this part 1 of 3 Prequel Trilogy. Right from the opening chapter we are taken on a fast paced ride that gives insight to the many beginnings of friends and foes in the struggle to control spice. Anyone unfamiliar with the Dune universe can pick this book up and instantly become engrossed in it. Fans of the \\"Duniverse\\"(like me), can finally rejoice with the release of great new material that expands the greatest sci fi story ever told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much happens here","review":"I am disappointed. There is not much action. A lot of stuff gets repeated, over and over. It has given me an appetite to read again (fourth time?) Dune, but this one can be skipped"},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying entry in the universe of Dune","review":"I knew that this book would be good when we were introduced to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a \\"lean, muscular, handsome man.\\" All Dune fans should definitely check out Dune: House Atreides, and those who have never read the classic Frank Herbert series would find this the perfect place to start. This novel answers many questions about the history of some of the most real, three-dimensional characters out of science fiction. The Bene Tleilax, Ix, Shaddam's ascension to the throne, Duncan Idaho and the reason why he hate the Harkonnens, Lady Jessica's origins are just a few of the things revealed. The great thing is that while the book answers some questions, it just poses others. While this is not a perfect book, it is a good book. Of course it will not be exactly the same as the other Dune novels, different people wrote them, and no one can copy Frank Herbert's definitive style. But Brian and Kevin do an admirable job, and I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts of Ideas, no development","review":"This book really disappoints. The Dune series was definitely guilty of giving you ready-made people and scenarios, but the telling was what held your interest; you wanted to learn more about these people. The same sense sticks with you in House Atreides, but remains unrequited, because the novel does little to hold your interest (there are only thin plot-lets) and the figures of your favorite characters have lost their dynamic unfolding in the retelling. More a 'Did you Know' handbill of factoids on the original Dune than a true tale, despite its generous length. Only for the Herbert family die-hards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about young Leto-hope there's a sequel","review":"I enjoyed getting into young Leto's head. The book seems to be part of a series as it keeps several threads dangling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it","review":"As a seperate work of science fiction, this book would be quite good. However, because of the fact that it is intended to be part of a previously-written epic, _Dune: House Areides_ falls far short of expectations. It is utterly lacking in Frank Herbert's vision, breadth and scope, and just a few cursory glances at the _Dune Encyclopedia_ reveals several major errors in character backgrounds (Duncan Idaho never lived on Geidi Prime, for example) and numerous other inconsistencies.I suppose no other sci-fi author could ever begin to compete with Frank Herbert on his own turf. It may have been better if this book had not been written. It cannot compare favorably to any of the others in the series, and will always stand in the shadow of the grandeur of Frank Herbert's creation.For a book that is supposedly based on Frank Herbert's notes and \\"recently discoverd files,\\" this novel displays surprisingly little insight and/or character and historical knowledge of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's probably worth your time.","review":"Sure we all wish Frank Herbert had lived to finish his Dune series, but he didn't and this is the closest you're going to get so just start grinning and bearing it, okay? ;-)If you didn't make it through Herbert's original 6 books, don't start with this one, because the master himself definitely tells the story best, but if you're like me and have read pretty much everything the man ever wrote, just can't possibly get enough Frank Herbert, this is definitely worth your time.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do a credible job of bringing Frank Herbert's characters and universe back from the dead. The book is a \\"prequel\\" to the original series, and further good news is that there are clear hints that there will be at least one additional prequel book and a \\"postquel\\" book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap.","review":"I barely managed to wade two thirds of the way through this book, and skimmed through its sequels. Its hard to believe quite how bad and mismanaged all three Prelude to Dune books are, and how pathetic they are in comparison to Frank Herberts novels. Everything is laughably simplifed, especially some of the most interesting characters- Count Fenring is now just a psycopath, the future Shaddam IV is a vain idiot, Baron Harkonnen is really EVIL in a naff, Bond villain sort of way-and the story plods along, written in an awful pulp sci-fi style that makes a mockery of the Dune tradition. Its as if Brian Herbert and Kevn J. Anderson set out to write a parody of Dune, and if thats the case then they succeeded admirably."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for pop sci-fi, but not worthy of Dune name","review":"This book is OK if all you are looking for is a possible history of the events preceding Dune, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. It's written along the lines of the Star Wars type books, and comes across almost like a comic book with very cardboard characters. There are too many references to 20th century pop culture ideas (e.g. feng shui, thinking outside the box, etc...), and it attempts to make all the characters fit in line with their representation in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I guess if you like a book that spells out the plot at every step of the way .. this one is for you. but the most intriguing part of the original series was watching everything that you thought was going on in the first 80% of the book unfold in front of you to become something totally \\"Unexpected\\".

It reads like it was written by a wannabe fanboy, and the story has lost all of the Dune \\"magic\\" that Frank Herbert put into his stories. Regardless of whether or not Brian was in on where his father wanted to go with his stories, it's obvious that he (and his \\"assistant/compatriot/whatever\\", Kevin J.) are incapable of living up to those ideas.This book gets by the same way that the new Star Wars prequels have, by riding on the sentimental attachments that fans have for the originals. I got rid of my copies of the House books after reading them, and stopped even thinking about buying any more of these attrocities. If you like Dune at all, just re-read the originals...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Test: Human or Animal?","review":"I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from this book and drop it in the toilet.

So who wouldn't want a nice prequel to the original? Well, believe me, you don't want to waste your time.Here's what's wrong:* The story is shallow and unsatisfying.* The characters are poorly written and totally unlike the very same characters as created by Frank Herbert.* The plot meanders around with very little interest going on. The things that happen are totally out of line with the other Dune books.There was hardly a chapter that didn't disappoint me. I can't believe I read the whole thing! Arghhhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"long and boring","review":"A complete waste of 700 pages. The story was all over the place then it all just ended. 700 pages and nothing happened.

However, the time I wasted is another story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to be back in the world of Dune","review":"I've just completed House Atreides and like some of the previous reviewers, I found the recaps annoying and distracting. I kept waiting to hear the words 'Previously on Dune...' as if the book were written for a continuing TV series. Aside from this complaint I was happy to be back in the world of Dune. It isn't Frank Herbert but it is familiar and fast read. I'd recommend the book for any fan of the original Dune series."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUNE ... NOT!","review":"I agree with all of the negative comments below.When I heard that there would be a new Dune novel, I went back and re-read all 6 of the originals, just to refresh my memory of Dune.After the first chapter of \\"House Atreides\\" I realized that this book was NOTHING close to the original. The narrative style is repetitive, and written for early teen readers. The errors made, with regards to the Dune universe, are so frequent and so glaring as to totally detract from the reading experience. The only reason I finished the book was so that I could warn other people about it.DO NOT buy this book if you enjoyed any of the originals. If you have not read any of the originals then start with Dune and NEVER read this book. I have never thrown a book away, this will be the first, and I will NOT buy any of the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"To say this is the best of the trilogy isnt' saying much.

Unlike the original Dune series, it is not a great book, and anyone who anticipates such will be disappointed. Still, I was happy to read more of the exploits of Leto, the Atreides family, and their allies and enemies. Some of the new characters were excellent additions. I was jarred, though, by a few obvious errors. For example, after the Tleilaxu take-over of Ix, we actually get to see the Axlotl tanks. However, as we learned in the later Dune books, there are no \\"tanks\\" but instead the gholas are birthed by the Tleilaxu females. So when the tanks actually showed up as physical tanks, and when the Tleilaxu were actually doing scientific research with them, I was disappointed. It doesn't seem to be such a big thing to try to ensure consistency of such a key point of the entire series. Still, the overall reading was fine, and the story was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the originals","review":"I was beyond excited to hear of a new addition to Herbert's Dune universe. I bought the book before it came out and I read it with an intense hope of reconnecting to the world that stunned me years ago. I was unfortunately disappointed. The book was generally simplistic. It did not have the same complexities, intrigue, or language as the orginal. It was nice to revisit the characters and the plots, but it did not \\"say\\" anything, unlike the original Dune series. It was pulp through and through. In addition, the shameless drive throughout the book to leave enough loose ends so young Herbert could write a second book and recieve more lucrative book deals was upsetting. It seemed that some parts were written so a next book could be written, not to enhance House Atreides itself. Read it if you are a fan, but do not expect the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad pulp SF, but not Dune...","review":"Not bad. Okay, so that isn't the finest way to start a review, but it's the best way to start this novel - not bad. It's far from stunning, and far from a Dune book - far from being what is considered \\"proper\\" science fiction! - but it is good if accepted as a fairly simplistic action-adventure sci-fi novel aimed at a predominantly teenage audience. There are a not inconsiderable number of inconsistencies with Frank Herbert's original Dune Chronicles, but these aside, D:HA is fun at a base level. If I were to enter into honest criticism, I would cite weak characters and poor research as my main gripes. However, apart from this, D:HA is a fair (if oversized) read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the authors read the original Dune books???","review":"I did not hope the new book would be equal to the original, but please keep the details straight and logical. I like the character of Duncan Idaho very much, so I paid attention to his background in the original books. He had a sister who died in the Harkonnen slave pit. He was saved by Duke Leto or Duke Leto's father from the Harkonnen slave pit. In this book, he has \\"NO\\" sister. Instead, his parents were killed by the Harkonnen. The slave pit was not a slave pit; it was more like a prison where people were waiting around to be executed (or freed). And Duncan was not rescued. He escaped there himeself. The woman who helped him to escape had the most ridiculous reason to help him and send him to the House Atreides. I did not check for other conflicting details. Since Duncan Idaho was one of the main characters for 4 of the 6 books of Dune, getting his background wrong was really ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan Fiction?","review":"Maybe its the fact that I hold Dune to be the best novel I've ever read, maybe its Brian Herbert's different writing style. I don't know, but what I do know is that this book stunk. I forced myself to finish it. My first thought was that this book read like a star trek/star wars novel. And what do you know? It was co-authored by a novelist who has in the past written those kinds of books! It held none of the magic that the original Dune series. None. Not a drop. I'd only recommend this book to those of you who actually read the ENTIRE Dune series, but please..buy the paperback..it's not worth 25 dead presidents. Word to the wise, continuations of a series after the original author has died are bad ideas.

But after a second reading, I realized it's not supposed to be. \\"House Atreides\\" is a prequel, not a sequel. It's supposed to \\"fill in the blanks\\" of what happened before the greatest book in science fiction history. NO book can ever hope to live up to that kind of hype. But I believe Brian and Kevin do a masterful job of setting up things that we =know= are going to happen in later books without killing the suspense. There's whole new storylines to explore in this series, which they do later on. So Brian's not Frank. But he's working from Frank's notes with the aid of an author who is used to working in other people's universes. If you like \\"Dune\\" give this series a chance. I believe if you come into it with an open mind, you'll find it almost as entertaining as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe no Dune but still...","review":"Ok, so it was not a masterpiece as the original was but what could posibly match that? Maybe a little shallow but it's fun revaling in all that the old Dune was. I found it an interesting combination of knowing how events must end (though not nessicarily in the manner) and new plot points not discussed in other books.The repeatitiveness can get a little bit irritating (ok, Shaddam's hair is pommaded, I get it). But overall I think it's a strong prequel to one of the greatest books ever written.Seriously, worth the read if you're longing for something new in the Dune world, or even just getting started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune: House Atreides","review":"I'm a fan of the Dune series and have read them all. It took me awhile to get used to the writing but when I did I loved it. The elder Herbert didn't spoon feed the reader. The book & the world Arraksis are full of mystery and wonder. I felt the younger Herbert and this Anderson guy didn't do any of that. They lay everything out leaving no secrets, wonder or for that matter depth.If you've read the Dune series from Dune to Chapterhouse you know why Arraksis is a desert world. Why does the author have Kynes asking why? It just feels as though Frank Herbert would have taken a different, more satisfying approach. I've only read about 150 pages of this book and hate it. I'll suffer through it to see what happens (if I can). I'm just happy I got it from the library instead of spending the $20.Definitely two thumbs waaaaaay down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to the Dune universe","review":"It was wonderful to return my beloved Dune universe so many years after Frank Herbert's death.

Some developments seem to be just \\"filling\\", though.Leto's character is a strong-willed, intelligent young noble, heir to a Great House, a fact that explains much of Paul Muad'ib's character; he is not only a result of genetic tampering, but also of his upbringing.I thought it was interesting to read about it; the relationship between the Old Duke and Leto, leads one to see the relationship between Leto and Paul in a new light.This book opened up some interesting secrets and background on the more complicated issues described in the original book, which have led me to understand more about Dune.I recommend this book.

I could only think of Asimov who, after writing \\"the Foundation Trilogy\\", probably the greatest science fiction ever written, came back in his last years to write some dismal sequels and has been suceeded by other authors writing yet more lackluster books. This novel, on the other hand, captures the spirit of the first and best Dune novel, discussing events occurring decades before the action in \\"Dune\\". He further \\"fleshes out\\" the main characters while at the same time being true to the original. The characters are believable and the action and treachery(a key element in the universe of Dune) are fast-paced. I anxiously look forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian is not Frank","review":"When I read Brian's books, I though it was a parallel Dune where characters are simple and contradicts what happen in classic Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale imitation","review":"Within one chapter I knew that this \\"prequel\\" wouldn't be satisfying by a long shot.Most glaring thing missing to me are the strong, powerful, sensitive female characters that populate Frank Herbert's Dune books. The women in House Atreides exist as plot points, to look good, or give birth, or be killed.But most of all, gone are the philosophical musings and obvious brainpower of the original author. It's almost painful to read, and I don't think I will read any new installments, for this reason alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Fooled","review":"People may be tempted to buy this book on some expectation that it will be as good as Frank Herbert's originals.Well, of course, that would be impossible. After all, Dune is widely acclaimed as the greatest Science Fiction story ever. But we'd all love to continue to enjoy the story, so perhaps it's OK for someone else to write it?Unfortunately this book shows that this theory doesn't work. Where Frank Herbert's brilliance shone through using pace, subtlety and imagination, 'House Atreides' is plodding, lifeless and explicatory by comparison.Reading this book may spoil your happy memory of the original series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Going Home","review":"I am currently in the process of reading this book. I first read \\"Dune\\" in college twenty-five years ago and still consider it one of the ten best books I've ever read. I am very happy with this pre-quel. As soon as I started reading I felt comfortable with everything about it....much as I did about \\"Dune\\". I find the story rich, complex and rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, why, why was this even tried?","review":"Frank Herbert was able to say so much more with a flick of the wrist, a nod, or an expression. I can't really describe what it was about his writing that was so...his alone, but I can say this, the writing in this flop dosen't even come close.Re-read the origionals, ignore this sham of a Dune book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: disappointing","review":"It goes without saying that the Dune series is a masterwork of science fiction. Its impact, in sci-fi, is equal to that of The Lord of the Rings in fantasy. It has resonated with readers and grown to mythic status.Unfortunately the same won't be said for the prequels. Where Frank Herbert wrote with beauty and style his son plods along amaturishly. The conversations of Dune usually had levels of subtext and required actual thought on the part of the reader to fully grasp the innuendos. The discussions of House Atreides requires as much attention as the typical \\"Three's Company\\" episode.The really sad mater is that the book isn't really bad. Compared with the usual sci-fi tripe its measures up as at least standard. But compared to good sci-fi its bad. Compared to mythic Sci-fi its nothing short of embarrassing. I'm sorry I bought it. I know I'll not pick it up again, nor its sequels. In general I'll try to forget it ever existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...no...no!","review":"I did not get past the first chapter...and after having read the \\"1 star\\" reviews, I am glad that I stopped. The historical inaccuracies that I have read about in the other reviews is definitely worth consideration by true Dune afficionados. When I read about a \\"no ship\\" being encapsulated in the first book, I laughed my head off. There was certainly no reason why this technology would just \\"disappear\\" for, oh, say over a thousand years later...? I won't go into it any further. Read the other bad reviews; they cover the ground quite nicely.Don't buy it for the sake of another Dune story. The first six books, by the one and only true author of Dune, Frank Herbert, should have been laid to rest. Don't damage his legacy by reading the new prequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only well-written parts were copied verbatim from 'Dune'","review":"The characters are childish, the plot is silly. Completely inconsistent with the original series.Words fail me.This book is more like a parody of the series than an extension. Instead of the bold characters and twisting plot, we get worried one-dimensional yuppies which wouldn't have survived three paragraphs in Dune. There is almost no plot whatsoever. The authors keep throwing in the special effects from all books of the original series, without regard to the chronology of Frank Herbert's universe, and without any real purpose. One of the most dissatisfying books I've ever read.Not worth to bear the name of 'Dune'."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Original","review":"Well, I must say that the review from that \\"French guy\\" was absolutely wonderful, I too felt that this book needed alot more than a boring storyline and laser fights. It's funny to see how the sci-fi fans who call themselves \\"true Herbert adherents\\" dismiss Francois' claim that the book has no real heart. All they can do is complain about how great the book was and it's funny to see different names when probably the same person wrote all the good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune: House Atreides","review":"Disappointing. The story line is fine, but the character development, both in description and dialog is very different from the series. Not only is it different, it's quite poor. It's almost a certainty that the editor of this book NEVER read any of the others.It isn't easy to fill the original author's shoes, but somebody dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"glad i didn't pay for this book. couldn't finish it, for fear of spoiling the world of dune in my head. the style of writing was jerky. you know the way you start reading a book and you are transported into the world, and you are not actually 'reading' words anymore. well this book was just all jumbled words contained on pages. i would not, unlike some reviews, even think of comparing this to any works such as rice or rowling (how offensive!). at the very least, no one can argue that they use their 'own' stories. i do agree with one review that i am very happy that tolkien jr. didn't butcher his father's stories (& dont get me started on the films either)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to a place I'd never been....","review":"Approaching this book with trepidation, I felt that it surely could not match the original. In some respects it did not, however, it did manage to take me to Caladaan and several other places I had never imagined I would visit. To the critics who slate it, all I can say is this: It was never going to be the original, but is a classic in it's own right. There were some continuity errors, but I read to be entertained on occasion, and this entertained me. I look forward to the next offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad writing","review":"While it was great to have a chance to visit the Dune universe again, this was just a poor piece of writing. The only person I could reccomend this book to is someone who has read the series and is interested in learning more of the background to the story. One gets the impression that Dune was written as literature and that House Atreides was written to be a best seller appealing to the lowest common denominator. Unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down Hill For Dune","review":"This was a terrible, poorly plotted book with thin characters. As a huge fan of the original series, I was disappointed with Frank Herbert's son's attempt to recreate the magic of his father's books. Dune: House Atreides is sums up all that bad about poorly written science fiction. I wondered if the new authors had even read the original multilayered, highly intelligent, complex, multifacited novels that I enjoy reading over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't a Dune book","review":"I pick this book up when I'm not in the mood for my main reads. I am convinced that Brian has watched the movie a few times and may have read his fathers works but, it's hard to say. I equate this to a Star Trek/Star Wars novel. Nostalgia and boredom are all that may get me through this book. If you see it at a Garage sale....buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not on par with the originals, but still good stuff.","review":"Of course I didn't expect it to be as complex as Frank Herberts works. It was still a fun book and I wasn't disappointed. It actually exceeded my expectations. It may also be a good beginning point for younger readers to get into the Dune universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a terribly.... enjoyable book.","review":"Our typically french friend's review notwithstanding, I must say, Dune : House Atreides was thoroughly enjoyable.I prefer to view this book as a primer, or rosetta stone of sorts, for the Dune series by Frank Herbert. It gives the reader the 'keys' to the future of the series, and gave some background on topics left hanging by the later books.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't expect another epic on the scale of \\"War & Peace\\", merely a good story.And I got it.I sincerely hope Brian does as well with the next Dune novel, it will be on my purchase list.(Don't forget to read Moby Dick as well, I hear Oprah gave it 3 stars!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Massively Disappointing","review":"The original Dune series is one of my favorite works of fiction, but \\"House Atreides\\" does the original an immense disservice by association.\\"Dune: House Atreides\\" is a poorly-written, badly-constructed, and barely-readable effort. The characters aren't true to the original series, the technology is weak and contradictory, and the plot could be described in two pages. Also, I'm not sure the authors know the meanings of the words \\"akimbo\\" or \\"penultimate\\".If you're a Dune fan, re-read the originals instead of wasting your time with this... book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme opinions","review":"I reviewed the ratings given this book. There are lots of 4 and 5's and lots of 1's. So apparently you love it or you hate it.I am in the former camp. It was wonderful after all these years to be able to return to Dune. True, there are some differences in style, but the book far exceeded my expectations. It is clear that much of the elaboration of the young Duke's tribulations following in his father's footsteps are the author's comments about his own situation. I believe he admirably passes his trial. I look forward to reading the next Dune books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, Enjoyable read - keep it at that!","review":"I enjoyed reading the D:HA for what it was. I must admit I agree with other reviewers that it is simplistic when compared with FH's work, but that's part of it's charm for all the 5 star folk. It ( and the sucessors ) apparently are going to simply explain lots of the references which were left to the readers imagination in the original works. Which happened to be one of the reasons I liked the original Dune so much.The characters did seem more simpler. For example: Fenrig is portrayed as a sadistic assasin... yet my take from the originals his assasinations were to further a goal, dispassionately and clinically... not enjoyably.I hope that they'll complete the other 2 prequels for the fun of it... but pass the baton on to other folk to work on postquel books. Bear/Brin/Benford seem like candidates to *expand* on FHs work, rather than just extend it. <grin> Particularly given the last cryptic chapter of Chapterhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but&#65533;","review":"...lacking in the details. This is obviously not by the same author who wrote Dune. Details show a different concept of the Dune universe. The Bene Gesserit seem ludicrously unobservant (using a mechanical incubator with \\"monitor lights\\" in their birthing chamber - something a BG acolyte could do much better). \\"Foldspace\\" seems to be a place that takes time to cross - more like StarTrek than F.Herbert. The Tleilaxu talk about religion all the time (it isn't the secret of the Dune novels). Thufir Hawat scratches his leg while his hands are clasped behind him (three hands, Thufir?). And this quote of Leto: 'His voice filled the room. \\"Father, you left large shoes for me to fill.\\"' - (large voice and large shoes, is he a clown?). Many details of the novels WERE included, but the flaws are obvious and detract from the quality of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cream. Really poor package","review":"I got this cream. Worked great nice lather. The cap cover was broken right out the box so I could not screw it back on. The cream itself was great as reviewed. I only got a few uses out of it as it started drying out. You would think the product would have better packaging for what the company makes itself out to be. Bottom line get the tub not the travel tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read even if you don't outsource or are not in the business of outsourcing","review":"Atul's book \`The Offshore Nation' offers a very insightful ring-side view of the macro-economic trend towards globalization of services and how organizations and business leaders can effectively leverage this in a global economy for competitive advantage. Atul through his organization, NeoIT, has played a lead role in shaping the sourcing strategies of global organizations and the book is both thought provoking as well as prescriptive.

I had to read it for a book club and if I had the choice I'd have put it down after just a few pages. I muttered and rolled my eyes just to get through it.
