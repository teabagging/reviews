If one reads his text seriously, it can be quite scary to see how Madison Avenue techniques can work so well with the simplistic thinking of Reed's followers. He is straightforward about how he pimps God to get political power; I especially found interesting his discussion regarding his use of language to sugarcoat his otherwise inflammatory agenda. The book reminds me of Mein Kampf, but with a more user-friendly spin to it.Any Christian who actually reads his/her Bible will probably find this book as revolting as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"That Reed and his followers still claim that the \\"Christian\\" Coalition is a non-partisian organization, remains on of the biggest jokes in American politics in the second half of the 20th century.Reed's agenda bears little if any resemblance towards the message of Jesus Christ whose commitment to the poor and outcasts was a threat to the Pharasee's (the Reed's of Jesus' time).

I'm a bachelor with limited cooking skills (and with even less patience when it comes to kitchen chores), but this book offers simple, easy recipes that can be quickly prepared with very few ingredients. The directions are concise, and each recipe is printed on a separate page with a graphic that clearly gives preparation and cooking time. Nutritional information for each dish is also listed. The recipes are generally low in fat, but they don't have the long-as-your-arm list of exotic ingredients and spices that I find in many low-fat cookbooks.Of course some of the recipes are better than others, but almost everything I've tried has been very good. There's nothing fancy here: if you want to impress someone with a virtuoso kitchen performance, there may be better collections. For plain ol' weeknight cooking that's healthy, fast, and inexpensive, this book is a worthy standby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love to cook and was looking forward to the \\"down home cooking\\" recipes.

It contains little useful information. The author devotes a lot of space to safety and tools and even spends an entire chapter on workbenches, but the title promises info on designing and building a woodshop. Is this his version of bait and switch? Also, few woodworkers need to be told that a table saw needs space in front and behind for materail handling.

They make everything so crisp and clear, I never realized how monochromatic and \\"blurry\\" other sunglasses made your vision until I tried these. The amber-color is a little odd at first, but when you realize how much better you can see it is soooo worth it! They are especially helpful at twilight and during rain or snow.

In hindsight, since my daughter is six years old, I'm not sure it was worth it.If you're looking for some fun chemistry experiments to play with with a younger child, perhaps this isn't your best choice. The manual is a lengthy black-and-white single-spaced book with experiments not well highlighted. It goes into great detail for several pages about how to perform chemical experiments in general (which is pretty boring to younger kids).If your child can't read at a higher level they may become frustrated. I have found it's better to dig through it myself first and organize what we'll do ahead of time - something I'd expect the manufacturer to have done when they wrote the manual.

Campbell is a great West Side (of Chicago) blues guitarist. This CD was recorded in Europe, with a European band, which should usually spell trouble, but in this case, the band sounds good.

I have owned this product. I love knowing that I can take care of myself if I have a tire w/ low pressure, rather than wait for a car service to get to me. Yes, it's noisy, but it works! I can plug it into the cigarette lighter outlet in the back of my '04 Honda Pilot and check & fill each of my tires. No need to pay more $$$ for larger pumps if your purpose is self-sufficiency. This is small, portable, and reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, cute package","review":"I give this a 4 star because I have not actually used it, except for the pump.

Song number two is the best, yes the title is a little crass but if you are into this band then it shouldn't bother you at all. Listen to the song a few times and read the lyrics its a brilliant song! This CD was WELL worth the money that I paid for it and I am so glad that it is now part of my collection. You won't regret buying it. Down in Albion is also a really good song. I also bought all of the Libertines albums and I prefer Babyshambles. Pete Doherty clearly went through some stuff and grew as an artist. This isn't as campy as the Libertines, I know that isn't the best word. You know how the Libertines in one of their videos they are all wearing matching band/military jackets, it's not like that if that makes any sense to you. This is a really cool album, worth the money, you will listen to it on repeat, and if this is your style of music you will definitely be glad that you bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the tabloids, this is the best CD Pete Dohertys ever released","review":"The Libertines are one of my all-time favorite bands: no one can deny their onstage chemisty and their amazing music. But this is better. Even though you may have to listen to this CD 5 times before you can understand its beauty, i promise you it is there. This CD has been playing on repeat for me since i ordered in from the UK in November 2005. Trust me, Peter Doherty is an extremely talented guy and despite his drug use he is still putting out amazing music. I love every track on this CD, even the strange Pentonville: it's good for a laugh and besides its a risk. And everyone knows that people who take risks make the greatest achivements."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Freewheelin' Pete Doherty","review":"It's no secret that Pete Doherty's personal life is a mess (and, by this point, Mick Jones has to be a lock for the coveted \\"Best Babysitter...Ever!\\" award), but what's also becoming increasing obvious is that he's a stone-cold musical genius. I miss The Libertines as much as the next guy (especially if the next guy is Carl Barat), but \\"Down in Albion\\" is every bit as brilliant as \\"Up the Bracket\\", and it positively blows the 2nd Lib's album out of the water. Amazing, harowing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"On first listen, four songs grabbed me right off the bat. By the end of the first week, I was up to 10 songs. Not bad for ANY record to have that sort of impact. There are a couple of clunkers & misplace items, but that ain't bad out of 16 songs. I can't say I've been impressed with much of Pete's other output, but this one is an absolute classic. Best thing to come out in years. Hints of The Clash, TVP's, Ray Davies & even Dylan (without ever being obvious about it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"I may be getting old but this is one record i do not like.

The drugs...yeah, yeah, I know. Kate Moss...yeah, heard about her, too. The look? Doubt it. It's something else. His music just seems to work. It's raw, but catchy. It's rough, but delicate. It's real. And maybe that's just something that is hard to find in today's musical landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloppy, romantic, full of brilliance","review":"In a time when American rock music is saturated with passionless, asexual, ironic, apathetic garbage, Pete Doherty and Babyshambles are a god-send. \\"Down in Albion\\" is, without contest, the best rock album of 2006--full of soul, longing, teetering on the edge visions, all the chaos and sporadic discipline that is the foundation of any masterpiece. It's true it does have its flaws: the dub-reggae song, which could've been a fun, ten-second clip...moments here and there when the smack or the snow might've inhibited Pete's rhythm or vocal capabilities a bit. But just when you think he's falling off the edge (or the beat in this case) he returns with some infectious chorus or haunting, witty lyric which all those sober, socially well-adjusted, well-fed, well-slept, forgettables that plague the American scene could never hope to create. Pete, Babyshambles, and the works of the Libertines are the most exciting things to grace rock music, easily, since\\"Kid A\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad Effort","review":"I cheated and bought the British import, so I'm writing this review a little ahead of the US release. This is a solid CD, and while it isn't on par with his work with the Libertines, Pete Doherty's fans will mostly enjoy it.The high-energy opening cut does recall the Libertines, and the overall sound of the CD is pleasantly raw.But most of the songs are more laid-back and reflective. The mood suits Doherty well, giving his plaintive voice room to plaint. If you've heard the single \\"Albion,\\" that's pretty much the mood of the CD.Babyshambles is allegedly a band, not anonymous backups for the star. But it's hard to imagine getting excited about this music if not for its celebrity frontman.Give this disk a listen, and pray that Pete Doherty puts his demons behind him and lives to record further CDs. His voice deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attitude ruins everything","review":"Way way too long. Even the good stuff loses impact when it's floating in a sea of randomness, sloppy musicianship and dismal vocals.Pete seems so convinced of his genius and the loyalty of his fans that even farts and burbs will be welcomed rapturously.Half of the songs (almost all the good ones: Albion, the good parts of la belle et la bete, Killimajaro, Back from the Dead, Sticks and Stones, 32 of December, parts of A Rebours, In love with a feeling) are inferior versions of ones he wrote when he was still in the Libertines, drawn out and repeated over and over.Save your money and download Pete's acoustic versions of these songs from a time when he could still sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus!","review":"You people have no taste! Now, I love Peter as much as the next Libertines fan, but what's all this bollocks about 'freedom'? What is 'free' about drug addiction leading to, on average, poor music. Open your eyes: genius + heroin + crack cocaine = bad music. Now, OK, there are some good tracks, and occasionally glimpses of why we loved him. I for one refuse to give him money to buy drugs with, which, coupled with it being a mere shadow of Libertine glory, is why I will not be buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Talent is with Paul Barat","review":"After listeng to the babyshambles cd and the Dirty pretty things cd, it is obvious that Doherty is lost,unfocused and has taken to many drugs. The songs are mediocre nowhere resemble the energy,talent or enthusiam of the Libertines.However Dirty pretty things displays the energy,enthusiam and agnst of the Libertines.Paul Barat was the driving force of the Libertines and Doherty was just a good singer.So skip this and buy Waterloo to anywhere (DPT) that is if you really likedthe Libertines.Skip this and buy Dirty Pretty Things, this is a depressing cd coming from an ex Libertine."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the Edge of the World","review":"Mateo Macias de Avila must learn to survive on his own after his parents die of the plague in 1519. Fourteen year old Mateo can draw, read, sing and play a guitar. These talents help him once he is recruited as cabin boy, musician, and eventually ship artist on a voyage led by Magellan.I found this book suitable for older children and young adults. Though the reading level is 5th-8th grade, the material is often at an older level. I would lean towards grades 7-9 as the youngest readers for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but LOUD","review":"We bought this toy for our 18 mo. old daughter and 7 mo. old son. The animals sounds and songs are cute and they really enjoy the \\"nesting puzzle\\". BUT, there is no volume control and it is really loud. So, we used some tape to cover the speaker in order to dull the volume a little bit. Of course, 18 mo. old daughter got the tape off and re-stuck the tape on the inside of the toy which is a paper scene and then tried to remove the tape thus ripping some of the picture off.

I could not believe she could actually call this a love story. If I want to read porn books, I would go to the adult shop. I hate the explicit sex scenes in her books. I am looking for love, not lust. And then to have an uncle who would treat a neice this way, like a sex object, come on Catherine. I hate her books and have read quite a few, almost all hoping for a good one. Well there have been maybe 2 out of the 100 or so she's written. Jade Star was my favorite.

Not something I missed along the way. Just a verbatim copy of SWEET SURRENDER - renamed to \\"fit\\" the original Star Trilogy and make it a Quartet. As a long time fan of C.C., Catherine, you're better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total trash","review":"I got this at the library as an audio book--10 discs. I quit at #4. What total trash this was, 3 discs of nothing but descriptions of sex acts. The premise that a 17 year old girl in the Victorian era would be taken to a brothel to \\"educate\\" her in the ways of the world is totally ludicrous to start with and it was just one sex act after another.

The book's heroine-who is supposed to be a \\"bluestocking\\" or intelligent woman, ruins the story.What we have here is the reversal of the jerk hero, instead the heroine is one. Elizabeth is given a miracle opportunity of inheriting a fortune, but instead of behaving responsibly and intelligently, she wastes thousands on pounds on a revenge scheme against the hero's aunt. That was bad enough, but when she spends the entire book treating the hero-a perfectly nice guy-like a enemy just because of one offhand comment by said aunt, I just quit in disgust.The author does have some skill-I made it through three fouths of this book before I quit-so I will try another of her books.

I understand what the author was getting at - that we're all special and worthwhile, even if we're different from our peers, but not everyone believes in God. I wanted to find a way to rephrase that line, but couldn't.The class enjoyed the book, and everyone said they learned something from it, which in this case is the most important part. After we finished reading, each child shared an experience where they had been teased, ridiculed or left out.

Then I located this one on Amazon (I chose the blue one). Perfection! I love that it's so comfortable to use and that it exercises each finger individually - and each finger gets an equal workout - unlike the old V-style exercisers.

That being said, It's a great tool for strengthening all of your hand muscles. I used the website for different exercise suggestions and was just blown away by the number of maneuvers that are possible with this thing. Also, its small form factor means it can be conveniently stored in any pocket. I've made it a habit now to take this thing with me on the go and use it when I'm bored or waiting.

It's a real work out for your fingers when you press down on each button one finger at a time. The excercise where you make a full fist pressing on all buttons, might feel light to some, the key lies in the repetitions.

I thought the one we were supposed to be getting was red but ours was green. At first I thought \\"maybe they come in different colors with the same tension\\". Anyway, I noticed on the Gripmaster is a print saying XX-light! The package says Medium however. Somehow, the wrong one was put into a medium package. This XX-light one does us no good as we bought it to help strengthen our trigger fingers for a more stable trigger pull. I will probably be buying one of the \\"Pro\\" models in either the 9 or 11 lb. Maybe both.To sum it all up, great little gadget providing you get the right one.

I'm trying to learn bass guitar and need to cheat with my ring finger when hitting notes meant for the pinky. Bought the medium Gripmaster which works great but is a little too much to start out with for my pinky finger. Unless you go through the full range of motion, you're just cheating yourself out of the full benefits of the workout. It's just like bench pressing.

This product was an improvement, but even at the heavy tension, it still takes longer than I would have hoped to get a good workout. However, it definitely works, and I like how it exercises each individual finger instead of just the center of your hand. The design also allows for some other exercises which are available on the product's website.

I have been squeezing it for about 3 min, and don't feel anything. It is also SO small that my fingers keep slipping off, which hurts also. This is a fail of an item. The only way I can use it is by putting my whole hand over the thing and squeezing it. Good idea, but I'm gonna return it and get the classing squeeze thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good device, but heavier than expected","review":"It is a good device to work the finger muscles. After trying several moves with it, I have felt that the little finger muscles in my forehand as well as the muscles in my forearm associated with finger movements were strained well. But especially, for my ring finger and little finger was the heavy tension too much. That's why I have also bought the medium tension. I will use it untill I gain enough strength to use the heavy one. So, unlike some reviewers who claim heavy is fine and even normal for an average person, I would like to warn you that your weeker fingers might not like the heavy tension if you don't have strong fingers. Actually, I would have suggested the manufacturers that they produce a version with heavy tension for the first 2 fingers and mdeium tenison the for ring and little finger. So, I suggest you use medium or lower first. By the way, I am a 25 years old male, who is slender but not athletic or strong at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep this on my desk at work","review":"Its a good fidget, or distraction, or little bit of exercise for my hands and fingers.

I've noticed an increase in grip when working on cars and even a slight increase in typing speed. Plus, the little bulge it adds below the wrist and another above the elbow never hurt anyone. :) Drummers, guitarists, rock-climbers and hikers have all recommended this to me, and I can see why. These little guys are killer. I just ordered a red and a black to see how the difference is.I'd recommend this to anyone who works at a desk or spends a long time typing.

While some of the poems are of the cute and cuddly variety that you'd find in gift books, others are more serious, tackling issues such as death, loss and grieving. All are beautiful, except for a few that are a bit disturbing; for instance, in \\"Another Reason Why I Don't Keep a Gun in the House\\", Billy Collins entertains thoughts of shooting his neighbor's noisy dog. Such vignettes are the exception, though, and the only reason I gave \\"Bark\\" 4 stars instead of 5. There are also very vivid and lifelike sketches throughout the book, adding to the poetry's allure.My favorite poem? \\"Dachshund\\", by William Jay Smith - since my first dog was (and still is) a Doxie (and the sketch looks uncannily like him, wrinkles and all!):The Dachshund leads a quiet lifeNot far above the ground;He takes an elongated wife,They travel all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Dunno what happened.

This, and Robert L. Smith's pictures, brought '77 back in full black and white - a LOT of white.Rossi also poignantly relates the losses that Western New York suffered from this disaster that still leave repercussions, such as the loss in faith in the federal government's benevolence and the huge number of abortions that year. It is no wonder to me that Western New York spawned a huge number of fundamentalist congregations to ease their pain.

Mr. Bimba, a Lithuanian immigrant who wrote propaganda for the American Communist Party in the 1930s and 40s, used the Molly Maguire story as an opportunity to demonize capitalism and make heroes out of outlaw coal miners, many of whom were convicted of violent crimes and murders in the Pennsylvania coal fields in the 1870s. Ever eager to excuse the Molly Maguires' crimes, Bimba ignored much historical evidence of guilt and tried to justify the Mollies' criminality as a just cause in the struggle of labor. Today, Mr. Bimba's version of those events comes across as hopelessly biased and outdated. Other accounts both old and recent, such as the work of Dewees, Coleman, Broehl and Kenny, are less biased and more informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justification for Terrorism","review":"The author, Anthony Bimba, was a well known Communist \\"intellectual\\" and agitator who wrote this book in the 1930s to gain sympathy for the radical left labor movement. It's interesting to see a glimpse here of historical collaboration between radical Irish nationalists and Marxists. During the past year we've seen the IRA get caught sending \\"consultants\\" to Columbia to help train Marxist rebels build bombs there; in this book, we see an instance of the self-serving support that Communists in the U.S. have given to Irish immigrants engaged in terrorism for political ends. Most Irish-Americans today are completely oblivious to this symbiosis. This book is propaganda with the gloss of \\"history.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitewashing the Terrorists","review":"This book presents the Molly Maguires in a left-wing fairy tale. You won't often see such biased, one-sided fantasy passing itself off as history. This book perpetuates the myth that the Molly Maguire terror squad were just well-meaning choir boys trying to build support for a union. Somehow, in Bimba's version, all the murders and mayhem get left out.This book was written over 75 years ago when the anarchists and Communists still thought they had a chance to get a foot in the door through American labor unions. Times have changed and this kind of propaganda doesn't work any more.

I have read the Elder/Poetic Edda before, but the copy I had previously was electronic. I bought this translation so I could have a hard copy that was a new translation. What I wish I had known was the translator edited her translation based on what she thinks was added by Christian monks who transcribed the Edda. I have spent quite a bit of time studying the conversion of the Scandinavian people to Christianity and I know that was a problem, but I still would have liked to see it in its entirety and been able to judge for myself what was added and not added.

All of the basic elements of any war game are there. Mr. Wells' sense of humor comes across, along with his sense of whimsy, and the joy he obviously had in writing, and playing, these games. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Novels as good as this one are scarce as ...................","review":"\\"Hen's Teeth\\" is a darned good novel. Scott is a fine craftsman of the written language: her evocative descriptions of animal life, of nature, of the world of science, and of human relationships is fresh and intriguing. The plot is complex and intellectual and involves the reader up and through the surprising ending. And the heroine, Kellen Stewart, is a delight. After I post this review, I'm going to order Manda Scott's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend this","review":"I'm a big fan of murder mysteries and would recommend this one. It delves into the scientific side without going so far as to lose readers who aren't DNA-minded. You still get the idea of what was being done and why it caused problems.My only slight complaint would be that I needed an Scottish to American dictionary to understand some of the terms and slang, but I was able to figure out most of it by context. \\"Cairn,\\" for instance, is an entirely new concept to me.Overall, the book is well written and I'll be looking for more of Scott's stuff.I realize that some readers might shy away from this book because it involves lesbians, but the relationships in this book are no different than what you would find in any other murder mystery. Though several of the characters have been (or are) lovers, their relationships are closer to friendships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Good read ..

But the love never ended.This is a murder mystery and most of the important parts are played by good, strong and lovingwomen. The inspector is a treat, I like him. I especially liked him when he showed up with Tir, anotherstrong smart female. Some might call her a b*tch, but she wouldn't mind that a bit.How satisfying to be the one to look for the one who did harm to loved ones.The ending came too quickly. A worthy read.

First, the practical aspect of swimming any distance at all in San Francisco Bay is unlikely due to hypothermia and currents. It is no accident that Alcatraz was built where it is.The other issue is the \\"using\\" of one of the females to her ultimate death. Luke seems to think that using anyone, even at their peril, is justified so long as he accomplishes his mission.

He describes the \\"confession\\" of the first century Christians and compares it to the Roman Catholic and Anglican view of \\"confession\\". He does not relate it to the modern day reform tradition, where Confessions are part of the constitution oof the Presbyterian churches. The Westminster Confession, the Scots' Confession are just two.He has not examined the writings of the Talmud that were written at the time preceding, during and after Jesus time that better described how Jews believed. He makes up his own ideas and passes them off as fact. This was a book written to convince the early Christians that Jesus met the teachings of Scripture as the Messiah and the Son of God, but the Jews that the author described would not have understood the author, but they did understand Hebrews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"The Daffodils are back!

Bike Week Blues is not even close. The humor is forced and the story is cluttered up with so many characters that it is difficult to relate to all that is going on. Constant references to the need for black cohosh for the women to deal with menopause were overdone.

It also tells you who satan is, where satan dwells, Can a Christian Have a Demon, etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first choice for books on spiritual warfare...must read, must share!","review":"Sumrall hit a grand slam with this book. Because he is not talking theory, nor is he departing from solid biblical ground, Lester does a great job of depicting the nature of the spiritual warfare we are in, detailing the enemy tactics and giving very practical descriptions of what the attacks look like. Lester's tales of real-life demon encounters are inspirational follow up with very practical biblical advice on how to fight back. Of the many I've read on this topic unquestionably the most useful and readable I've discovered. I give out copies of this book often and it is always received and read with enthusiasm by those of all ages. You will want a copy to keep in your library and a stack to hand out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read...","review":"This is a fantastic book for anyone trying to understand the spiritual realm.

It is more of a history of discoveries than discussion on conclusions based on those discoveries.This is my first read in paleoanthropology and I found it a bit difficult. In some cases, discussion on historical hypothesis were glossed over where I felt they could have been elaborated. Although Tattersall comes across as intelligent, I found it to be a slow read due to both vocabulary and flow.

Nowhere is this more true than it is in the study of human evolution, as Ian Tattersall elegantly shows in this smooth-flowing and highly readable book. By blending an engaging account of the discovery of the human fossil record with the history of paleoanthropological analysis, the author shows how the variety of current interpretations arose, and offers an intriguing alternative of his own. If you want to understand where all the controversies that currently rage around the subject of human evolution originated, this lively and well-written book is the source for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!!","review":"Informative, interesting, and contrary to what Anthony, ... said, a very enjoyable read.

The style is almost cloyingly sophomoric, the characterizations are more suited to a comic book than a decent read, and Scottoline's attempts at clever similies fail far more often than they succeed (those are the good points, I'm not even going to bother with the plot). My only guess as to why she is writing in such a simple, one-dimensional style is that maybe her publisher or her agent promised her a TV contract if she wrote something silly with a bubbleheaded beauty as the protagonist. However, as different as the style of \\"Courting Trouble\\" is from some of her earlier novels, I found myself wondering if she had even written this one herself. I cry for the trees that were killed to make the paper for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order it from the library!!","review":"This book reminded me of the original \\"Charlie's Angels girls\\" ...frothy, inane, and embarrassing.

It appears she may have stolen her love for shoes from Sara Jessica Parkers chartacter on Sex and The City. So happens they are both obsessed with same over priced brand of shoes and shoe poor.The relationship she develops with her associates was very irritating to me. AND her quotes for \\"I Love Lucy\\" were so lame. \\"I have some \\"splainen\\" to do.\\" Yuk!

It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author betrays readers....","review":"With fiction, it is a reader's obligation to willfully suspend disbelief. However, here, the author continually betrays the reader by constantly challenging the readers ability to willfully suspend disbelief.We have one of the dumbest protagonists in the history of fiction, and we are supposed to believe she is sharp.The protagonist time and again takes stupid chances--the type of things that a charcter in a low-budget horror flick might do.An Irish American cop speaks with a brogue and an Italian American family speaks with an accent and believes in old-country traditions--all in the same book.Stupid. Stupid. Stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product placement in books?","review":"I got heartily sick of reading brands names sprinkled throughout the book.

It was very \\"Thelma and Louise\\" rather than the murder/suspense novel I thought I was buying. Anne was totally shallow and unlikeable, and even the other Rosato & Associates ladies, who I'd enjoyed before, got on my nerves.And I'm glad to see by reading these reviews that I'm not the only one who got tired of the Mental Notes.

Courting Trouble is the ladder.When her friend is found murdered, Anne Murphy realizes that her mysterious past has come back to haunt her. Someone's out to get her, which is why she has to maintain a low profile. But how could she do that when she's working on a highly publicized case?The overall story development is slow and misguided at times.

Thin plot at best, cardboard characters, action akin to a boring nightmare.

Major Bummer going on here! I am normally a huge fan of this writer, but not with this one. The only reason I even attempted to finish the damn thing was because I paid good money for it. I am so disappointed. The only redeeming quality in this tragedy of errors was the cover of the book.

This plot concept was extremely difficult to believe and the whodunit so very easy to figure out at the onset. I expect much more than what I received from this contrived tale. Get real - at least part of the time!

Anyway, the characters are likeable enough, but there was no suspense or cliffhangers to keep me hooked. I often had to read over and over b/c my mind would easily get distracted. I want to be absorbed into a book and it just never happened. Spoiler alert: The reader knows from the beginning who the bad guy is, and I kept waiting for a dramatical twist that never came. This is my 2nd Lisa Scottoline book and both were mediocre at best. I doubt I will try again as there are too many better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This was the first book I read by Lisa Scottoline and now I am hooked!I liked the main character, Anne Murphy, and wanted to know more about the women who make up the law firm of Rosato and Associates.I enjoyed reading this book and found that it keeps the reader hooked, focused on the events, wondering what is happening and how it is all going to play out. I had a hard time putting this down.I look forward to reading about Anne Murphy along with Mary DuNuzio, Judy Carrier and Bennie Rosato in Ms. Scottoline's future novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Courting Trouble","review":"It's possible that Lisa Scottoline's Courting Trouble reads better than it listens, but even Barbara Rosenblat's absurdly theatric audio tape performance couldn't possibly cover up the ridiculous plot, soppy female dialogue and just plain bad writing.The book starts off well enough, but when newby attorney, Anne Murphy, reads in the newspaper that she has been brutally murdered, an opportunity for a slick whodunnit quickly fizzles over a long, drawn out July 4th weekend.This is soap opera at its worst and the audio version only emphasizes the author's futile attempt to create believable suspense or intrigue. To make matters worse, during the critical action scenes, you have to put up with the performer's verbal sound effects of gunshots and endless fireworks.Bottom line. You're courting trouble if you invest in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great weekend read","review":"I was able to secure an advanced reading copy about a month before national release and spent a wonderful weekend devouring it. Ms. Scottolines writing style is crisp and her characters well defined. You get an immediate sense of them and as a result, are rooting for them all through the book. The interplay between characters is never forced and seem very believable (although I don't know many Bosses like Ms. Rosato).Can't wait for the next installment of this great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not her best effort","review":"I have become hooked on her books. This one has a good story line and a suprise ending, however, it just floats along. Her best effort was, in my opinion, The Vendetta Defense. I think that she could have made more about Ann Murphy and maybe she will in the future. Still it is a quick and interesting read....and after all she dedicated the book to her readers.... so it can't be all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scottoline is coasting downhill","review":"Although Scottoline has some good mysteries and thrillers to her credit, this book has little mystery to it, and few thrills. A very slight plot is stretched quite thin over too many pages. As for the characters, the newest member of the all-woman law firm has plenty of pluck, but little common sense (why doesn't she whip out her cell phone and call for backup all those times she spots her stalker?) Worse still, the other members of the firm appear to have dumbed down considerably from the previous books in the series. If this was any lighter, it would blow away in your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nod to Laura","review":"Courting Trouble by Lisa Scottoline continues the story of the all female law firm in Philadelphia led by Bennie Rosato. The protagonist Anne Murphy is the new kid on the Rosato legal team joining Mary DiNunzio and Judy Carrier, and Murphy carries this story quite well. She is a compulsive shopper and is the beautiful model type who fits in more easily with her male counterparts until she gets murdered, well sort of, and then the female bonding starts. The novel is nicely structured and Anne Murphy is likable, but I guessed who the murderer was early on. That's a definite negative, unless the novel has loads of atmosphere to make up for it, which this one doesn't. In addition, the entire murder scene was right out of a novel written in 1943 by Vera Caspary, Laura. Although the plot was different, the murder was absolutely the same. I would have thought that in the acknowledgements or somewhere Scottoline or the publisher would have given a Nod to Laura."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worsts books ever!","review":"I only write reviews if I feel strongly for a book, and this is one book I feel strongly about, because it was so BAD!!! I can't believe this book was even published, seriously. It appears to have been written by a novice. The plot is lame, the characters are unrealistic, the details are dated, as in this author probably hasn't had a fashion sense since the late 80's, and what is with all the \\"mental notes\\" and stupid descriptions of her cat??? I am just angry with myself for wasting time actually finishing the book. I did enjoy one other book by this author, which is why I bought this book, but never again will I waste my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the fourth of July","review":"This story grows on you. Previous reviewers point out some of the improbabilites in the plot, but this book kind of keeps niggling away at you. Just when you figure you know exactly what's going to happen, something totally different happens. The last third of the book was terrific and I'll pick up one of her other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this got published","review":"This book is shockingly bad. Virtually every scene made me cringe with embarrassment. I expect to have to suspend disbelief in my light summer reading, but this book was just ridiculous. Just to give an example: in the opening scenes, the protagonist, a beautiful young lawyer, hires a male stripper to get naked in the courtroom to make a point in her presentation to a judge. Instead of getting thrown in jail, the judge grants her motion. This is supposed to demonstrate that she's a gutsy advocate, but it is so beyond anything even remotely in the realm of possibility that it is simply silly. The book goes downhill from there. The characters are flat, the dialog is clunky, and the plot is just plain stupid. I can't imagine that anyone connected with this book actually thought it was good. I can picture the author, editor and publisher sitting around laughing at the readers with contempt and condescension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Courting Trouble is a Stepping Stone","review":"Let me be polite here. This book is for somebody graduating from romance novels but will never read Lawrence Block, Michael Connelly or Patricia Cornwell. Courting Trouble's plot isn't geared for any logical thinking human being. Do yourself a favor and try another of Scotoline's books. This one really insults the intelligence of a fifth grader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"This book says it's a fast paced suspense novel. I have 10 pages to go and theres nothing fast about this book. I am still waiting for the suspense and I'm so bored it's ridiculous. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone. And...if I hear the words \\"Mental Note\\" in this book one more time I think I'll burn this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"MENTAL NOTE: SOME LAWYERS MAKE LOUSY WRITERS","review":"MENTAL NOTE: SOME LAWYERS MAKE LOUSY WRITERS:Publishers Weekly said Scottoline's writing might be cloying to readers. You think? This is understatement. I am stunned that this writer won an Edgar. One assumes a writer wins the award for their WRITING ... but if the writing in this book is any indication, this particular \\"author\\" can't have won it for that reason. For what? NO clue. It is amateurish to the nth degree. The story is predictable, silly, and about as exciting as eating Pablum. I always defend mysteries to those who say, \\"Oh I don't read mysteries.\\" There are so many really good writers out there doing real mysteries - well written, well plotted, strong character development etc. But in this case there is nothing to defend. It is everything I dislike in \\"formula\\" mystery. No real character development. Trite yet lacking in real humor. Gimmicky. Full of old old cliches. Full of fluff and no substance. Full of boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest holiday weekend EVER","review":"This book was simply OK -- entertaining if you didn't give it too much thought as you sailed through it. For example, nearly the ENTIRE STORY takes place over 4th of July weekend in Philly. After each wacky or scary incident, after each plot twist, I'd say to myself, \\"And amazingly, it's still not Tuesday yet!\\"The story itself is derivative (anyone ever see the movie Laura?) but the path Scottoline takes to get us to the resolution was enjoyable enough. The characters were fun, if sometimes a little too cute. In short, it was like a candy bar from the vending machine -- fun while it lasted, but nothing you'll remember after you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop in on a dying culture","review":"If you are interested in Gypsy music and dance this is an incredible look at the culture, sans boring narration blah blah. Because Mr. Gatlif had unprecedented access to these relatively unspoiled groups of performers, the viewer feels like a traveler on the Gypsy Trail, starting out in India,through Egypt, Turkey and through the Balkans, ending with a lively village Flamenco scene. I wish that they had continued into England and Ireland, but that is a minor quibble. Each scene goes directly into the performances, with so much feeling and joy. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly decieved","review":"I saw the original film in a theater. Can still recall the emotional impact of the sounds and the images. For years Amazon advertised only an Australian format cassette, and so I was delighted when I saw that it was finally available in DVD format. I so looked forward to seeing and hearing the great film on my HD 36\\" TV. No such luck. This is a total fraud. The advertising should have indicated that it was merely a mechanical transfer that could properly be seen only in the oldest TV format. The whole job was done in a cursory fashion. The subtitles have strange spellings. The sound is not all that great either. A shameful product. Five stars for the film, none at all for this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"this film is fabulous but in the old Video cassette format","review":"Didn't realize it was in the old VHS format as I was really hoping to find it in DVD format. It still made a great gift to someone who loves the film and is hoping to have a friend do the format transfer"},{"rating":"2","title":"A colorful, journey into a grossly misunderstood culture.","review":"This film provides music, color and exoticism. Having viewed it numerous times I am always enthralled by the Romani and the diversity of their culture. Gatlif helps to give us gadje a glimpse into his world without giving away too many of its secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the film itself...","review":"I had seen this years ago and wanted to have it for future enjoyment -- such a feast of color, music, and dance. Such a testimony to the journey of the people from Rajasthan traveling towards Europe -- the gypsies, the Rom. These many years later, I realize the style/technique of the film is somewhat dated (not a big deal), and that these are actors, not real moments captured on the spot. Very minor disappointment. I still enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie is Fantastic, however the DVD seems to be Korean Bootleg","review":"I love this movie and have been waiting for years for a DVD of it. The VHS was available for a while for about $90, but I held off as I wanted to have a high quality copy. Unfortunately this DVD seems to be counterfeit and created from the VHS tape, and most descriptions on the cover are in Korean. I had my suspicion the moment I saw the cover, and then the print on the DVD disk itself. And then when I saw the movie, it became fully clear to me that I was right. Where regular DVDs sell for 19.99, I paid $28 for this. I am afraid that I have to keep this one, as I don't think any other copy was ever made by the producers. By the way, this movie is supposed to come with 3 sub-titles, including English, but the only the Korean one works. So it is your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies.","review":"This is a wonderful view of the Romany culture as expressed through its haunting music.

Through music and dance, using non -actors, this movie shows us a world little seen by outsiders. Colorful, vivid, at times heart breakingly tender, showing impoverished nomads through time. Ultimately life affirming, at least to me, it is a film I return to again and again. I wish it was on DVD. Highest rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misguided by the positive reviews","review":"This is only a very VERY long music video. I expected more information on the life of gypsies.If you would like to know more about gypsies this is not the documentary to choose. There is no information about anything whatsoever, just singing and singing. There is no narrator and people hardly ever talk, so most of the time you have to guess where they are or what their problems are. The video is nice for the first 10 or 15 minutes and some short scenes, but mostly is just plain boring. The music is good, but if you expect something more than that, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for cold fires","review":"You know, preferably the type that doesn't burn. Took this product up to the Boundary Waters; it fits nicely into a Army pack/duluth pack and functions to give the pack a flat back.But after a day of use, the griddle began to warp badly and was covered with a black soot that made everything else dirty. The non-stick wasn't really non-stick, as the first thing I cooked on it ruined the surface. To be fair, the product description says campfire coals, but to keep it hot enough, we had to go a fire going. The pan was placed on two rocks about six inches from the ground.I threw it away as soon as I got home. I'll be looking for an alternative next year, and wouldn't recommend this unless you're in a very controlled cooking environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH 2 CENTS","review":"Video totally useless I asked for my money back they told me I bought it, its mine.

But, I was most disappointed by both the writing and the content. The book lacks the wit and the depth of insight one might expect from the title. I also found Pierce and Blount to be overly critical and harsh in many spots--almost irrationally angry and ornery--it left me scratching my head and saying to myself, what's their problem? So, this book is not recommended for the avid sports reader--maybe it's because these guys have no or very little experience with playing sports themselves--a common probelm with so many obnoxious sports critics!

I've taken numerous speaking and presentations courses, won speaking contests, and I still learned many things from this book. It covers everything from controlling nervousness to why presentation skills are important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, easy to use resource","review":"This book is awesome. I am a professional speaker and trainer and it has helped me immensely. Whenever I sit down to write a new seminar, I refer back to its tips to guide me. The best suggestion in the book is to give the audience a selfish reason to listen to you within the first two minutes. David Peoples also suggests writing your closing first so you know where you are headed. All of the tips are easy to understand and relevant. There is quite a bit of discussion about overhead transparencies and I think most people use Powerpoint presentations these days, but most of those concepts for creating effective slides apply to Powerpoint also.It also gave me a lot of confidence since I knew I had covered all my bases by using this book to prepare. I highly recommend it for those who speak to groups for a living or make presentations as part of their jobs. I am also going to add it to my website as part of my suggested reading list. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Tool for any Business or even Students.","review":"I have checked my University's library and find that there's very few book about this topic. I find Mr. Peoples' book full of experience and advices.

I put a small piece of white cloth in the wash to see how color-fast the rug might be. The result: the washing water quickly became bright red, the white cloth is now bright pink, and the rug.... I got red dye on my hands when I took the rug out of the washer!

We will continue to look for a new rug..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prairie Rug","review":"The rug was not as pictured. There are tassles (not sure what else to call them)on each end that are not pictured. I would not have bought this rug if I knew this. Also, there was no return instuctions, making it difficult to return. So I cut of the tasssles and put the rug in a basement door way. A complete waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Readable Account of Good and Evil","review":"While I admit I loved this book mostly because of Mundo Cani (probably one of the most wondrous characters in American Literature,) it was also a genuinely compelling read. The combat between Wyrm and Chauntecleer is only the first level of the story...but it seems to go deeper than that. There are elements of biblical allusion scattered throughout, and animalistic ritual that add to the epic tone of this novel. Wangerin's beautiful language make it understandable, and while it's a formidable tale, it's a very quick read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a simple fable - but so much more","review":"This is a simple fable of Chauntecleer, a rooster. He is in charge of a small animal kingdom and is confronted by the evil Coctrice, a half snake/half rooster who is the son of the devil, an evil serpant that is trapped beneath the surface of the earth but is trying to get out to destroy God's creation. The book revolves around the efforts of the animals to come together to confront the evil threat and the costs that such action entails. It also has much deeper themes such as the nature of love and forgiveness.I really was not looking forward to reading this book - in fact, I only picked it out of my pile of books because I thought that I had remembered a friend had read it while we were in high school. Much to my surprise, however, I loved it. It was well-paced and the main characters had depth. I recommend this book enthusiastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of the Dun Cow","review":"A wonderful book! Wangerin has a talent for great writing and belivable charactures.

Its poetic language is completely and totally wonderful. Character establishment is big in this book, and the end is thought provoking, and makes you realize that evil still lives (and that there's a sequel!). Take messages from peoms (within the book) and relate it to the story for the real essence of it. A sample:Rue (she said) protection,Rooster's crow confusion,And one more thing to end the deed,A dog with no illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum.","review":"IF you are heavily into symbolism, and IF you like books with talking animals, and IF you didn't get enough out of \\"Animal Farm\\" and want more, THEN perhaps this book is for you. Otherwise, avoid it.The book manages to be preachy, without ever quite knowing what it's preaching about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will stay with you throughout your life.","review":"The Lord of the Rings is my favorite book. The Book of the Dun Cow and its sequel, The Book of Sorrows, come only slightly behind. Both contain courage, sorrow, humor, wonderful characterization, action and love. Both end with mixed feelings, the Dun Cow happier, Sorrows sadder. But both will consume your thoughts for days, months, years. They are nearly perfect books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique read","review":"This is the first book I ever read which, upon completion, I flipped to page one and started reading again. It centers on a rooster named \\"Chauntecleer\\" who's life revolves around keeping his coop in line. He is somewhat arrogant and pompous, but he takes his duty seriously, and his concern for the hens he \\"governs\\" is obvious. He is assisted by a masochistic dog whos presence provides humor while simultaneously invoking a deep sense of sympathy. Another rooster gives in to vanity and unwittingly looses the ultimate evil of the world. Chauntecleer and his allies must stop this evil, or the world is lost.This brief synopsis does not even begin to do the book justice. The characters are vibrant and vivid. the story is engrossing, and even the most jaded fan will find the plot twists and imagery irrisitable. All I can say is read this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor voice characterization","review":"The Audio version of this book isn't very good. The voice characterizations don't fit. I mean that the fox doesn't sound like what a fox should sound like, and the dog doesn't sound like what a dog should sound like. Most importantly, the crow should have sounded strong and regal. He is the lord of his lands and master of all that lived in the land. The voice is not suited at all. When the narrator speaks as a narrator, the story is OK. When he speaks as one of the characters, it doesn't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is in now way preachy in it's language or it's symbolism. The few religios references are meant only to convey a sense of an innocent world. I find the comparison to \\"Animal Farm\\" totally ungrounded, as the moral of the story is incredibly clear and unsymbolic. Even an atheist can read this book and not be offended by the ONE chapter that mentions the word \\"God\\". But if the mere mention of the word is offensive to you, even in an innocent fable-like setting then go away. We don't want you here anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fable for All-time.","review":"THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW is a highly entertaining, yet serious thought provoking novel that uses animals instead of people to tell about the universal battle between good and evil that continues to this day. Though the characters of the book are animals, the story is more allegorical, like C.S. Lewis' CHRONICLES OF NARNIA rather than satirical like George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM. The characterization is deep and the actions believable. The book is full of Christian symbolism and dives deep into issues of faith. Yet, with all the multi-layers and profound meaning, the book is never weighed down by it's depth and proves to be a page-turning, great story that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Flexible","review":"Have not used this much.

I think that this is because he doesn't waste a lot of time worrying about the science of it, or the potential for paradox, he just enjoys the ride (and so does the reader).A failed biographer gets his chance of a lifetime and gets a lot more than he bargained for-- featuring avenging maidens, body-switching murderers, beggar lords, and Egyptian gods. Somewhat lighter than other Tim Powers books (I'm unlikely to reread, I fear) but still very entertaining and astonishingly well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated. Reader beware!","review":"I know this is a popular book and Tim Powers has many fans, but honestly, he is a mediocre at best, and horrendous at worst writer. His writing style is jumpy, his plotlines don't mesh well, his characters are one-dimensional, and his jokes aren't funny. While admittedly there are a few nice ideas buried in the story, especially the way he ties in Egyptian lore with strange magic, the book was a chore for me to read. I had to will myself just to finish it. I think I wouldn't have minded this book as much a five or ten years ago, before I read luminaries like Gene Wolf and G.R.R. Martin, but unfortunately for Tim Powers, his writing comes off as hackish."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Could Have Done Without the Werewolves","review":"Tim Powers is a writer of considerable ability who lacks sufficient discipline. This novel has everything in it but the kitchen sink. The flashbacks and flashforwards are okay, but when the werewolves came in to an already rather complicated tale of Egyptians/Gypsies/London pickpockets/wacky American scientists/English professors I sort of lost interest. The best part of the book by far is the fragment at the beginning by William Ashbless, \\"The Twelve Hours of the Night\\", which is excellent.

Quite imaginative but undescriminating and with oh-no-not-again slugs of action too much like a movie, and with the author being an English teacher he ought to know better -- supposed to be very \\"well researched\\" but not really, it reads like it was writen by a bloke who writes for a hobby and has a dead shaky understanding of the setting in terms of language, politics, culture, etc. Nor can he bring characters to life or make people or situations attractive so he just throws in more distr-action. Not a fan. Wouldn't read any more of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I am a sci-fi/fantasy junkie, and hated this book. The excessive number of unnecessary characters and subplots made it hard to follow, and Powers had to resort to dei ex machina several times to close them out. The middle third of the book read like a bad James Bond movie on steroids, with the principal character being chased by either 4 or 5 separate groups. The last 50 pages were pure looney-tunes. Good fantasy sets itself rules, and lives within them - this book did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome but short","review":"personally i found this Show really AWESOME.

While installing new flooring I really wanted to slide the new floor covering under the edge of the door jambs rather than having to trim the floor to match the door trim. The new flooring ranged from vinyl to ceramic tile to 3/4 inch hardwood. What a time saver and a neat job. Initially I went for economy (sometimes known as cheap) and bought one of the manual door jamb saws, it only took one or two cuts with it to convince me that an electric model was worth the extra price. The factory reconditioned unit worked great right out of the box.

I don't understand why the author needed to discuss Mutual fund, Neighborhood, Nursing Home, then Outsourcing (your business) followed by Pension plan in that order.

Nobody loves their siblings all the time! These kids each have their own lives and interests, but care about each other, too.Indigo's experiences with school and friends and sisters are totally believable, even when you can't believe they're happening.

It only highlights it. He has lots of money but the kids go hungry. What a jerk! (That isn't the word I wanted to use!)As has been mentioned, the book is as much about the kid with thorns, Rose, as it is about Indigo. But there is plenty about him.Adults really ought to read some teen fiction, with an open mind. They would discover that adults are almost always portrayed as jerks, intentional or unintentional jerks. There must be a reason for that beyond \\"teen rebelliousness.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny book with a message","review":"This book was very enjoyable to read. The characters are very quirky, but are also very endearing. They often do funny things, but they take care of each other. The family portrayed is very unconventional, but exists as a very positive family unit.While this book has its funny parts, it also has an important message about bullying. The bully is represented as a caricature through most of the book, with a mindless group of followers. The book brings readers to question how the bully gets his power and why the followers are there.I have not read Hilary McKay's other novels about the Casson family, but I am looking forward to doing so. I am also looking forward to recommending this novel to my students."},{"rating":"2","title":"my guide 1","review":"This is a small book, but is everthing it says- gives a good guide to the various wheel ceremonies and how to build the wheelsI'm very comfortable with my spirituality by now following the Native American / Shamanic path despite being an English guy, and this book gives me practical help in moving towards thisI recommend this book to anyone who wants to follow this path, or just wants to understand other cultures-, how people develop, share values and how this is achieved through their religous celebrations"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book about Medicine Wheel Magick","review":"This is a book about the magickal use of the Medicine Wheel, or Circle Magick as it's sometimes called.

The author successfully captures the telling details of Capitol Hill and political campaigns with a flair for the farcical. The fictional protagonist, I suspect, would remind a lot of Congressional aides of their own bosses -- neurotic, self-absorbed, and convinced the media are out to get him. Great summer beach reading with lots of guffaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Send-Up Of Political Pretense","review":"\\"Potomac Beach\\" is a laugh-out-loud funny spoof of Washington politics that is a welcome respite to the partisan rancor coming from the city on the banks of the Potomac River (hence the title). Although the protagonist is partisan to the core, the author handles his material deftly enough that the effect is not preachyness but high comedy.You can't take the Congressman, his aides, or any of the plotlines seriously, and that is indeed the point. Unlike other political books, which attempt to be high-minded thrillers or suspense novels, this is just pure comedy. It's the perfect tonic for people fed up with politicians and media who take themselves too earnestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I, just like the first reviewer, heard the same song on a Christian rock music station, and bought the CD.

I have had one on the door from my house to my garage for around 10 months. I love the convenience of not having to dig out a key to get into the house when I park my car. What is the fatal flaw? The door can be opened from the inside with the lock locked. Conventional door knobs do not let you turn the knob with the lock locked. You could argue that this is more secure as you won't forget to lock your door. I would argue that the 167th time that you step out into your garage for just a second and then have to enter the #$*ing combination to get back in because you forgot to unlock the door first, the idea of touchpad entry into your house loses almost all of its charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Product was delivered promptly.

The rest of the album is also great.I hear all kinds of influences of 60s pop in this psychedelic masterpiece.

Amazing that I never heard it back in the day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOUTELY AWFUL","review":"This album is so bad I can't even express it in words. One thing I can tell you is unless you are some casualty from the sixties DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! I made the mistake of following the preivous review and it was a waste of money. This is the worst example of \\"psychedelic\\" music I've ever heard. I was trying to expand my horizons and take a chance on something I never heard and boy am I sorry. I'll never do that again.

I thought the stories were very interesting to read and they all surprised me.

Don't give up on E.G. just because you or someone else didn't care for this collection. She is a great author. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I, Richard","review":"This book stinks.

The quality of the short stories may not be George's best work, but they are an enjoyable read if you like either the approach or want to read everything written by a favorite author.What was very disappointing is that all of these stories have been published previously (one was slightly changed from the original version), but this is not noted anywhere in the book. This slim book appears to be not much more than an attempt to take advantage of unknowing buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sham.","review":"Elizabeth George wrote this collection of short stories (with the possible exception of one) in 1999.

First time I've wanted to ask Amazon[.com] to refund my money! Should never have been published. Characters are one dimensional, plots are silly, no redeeming literary or entertainment qualities, a general waste of time, either author or publisher cashing in on what was a strong name in her genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"It has always been worth waiting a year for a George novel - One of my favorite authors. But this book of short stories - not a novel is very disappointing and the stories are not up to her usual fine writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment","review":"I almost find it hard to believe this book was even written by Elizabeth George. ALL of the stories were horrible and predictable less than half way through the story. I can't believe the author who develops her characters so deeply in every one of her other books to the point that you feel like you know them personally, could have written these stories. It was a struggle just reading the first one, but I kept thinking that the next one had to get better. I knew something was wrong when I said that same thing after each story. By the last one it was just a matter of not leaving the book unfinished. I have a co-worker who is also a EG fanatic and I have strongly advised her not to go anywhere near this book. There is no need for another fans to be disheartened. I was a little disappointed with the book before this one, but it is looking much better after reading this horrible collection. The only reason I give it one star is because they won't let you not give any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth George in Shorts","review":"Elizabeth George in Shorts is just as suspensful and whimsical as she is doing the long novel. Normally, I don't read short stories but decided to do so after finishing all of the Inspector Lynley books. I definitely was not disappointed. This lady comes with a great sense of humour in addition to her other sterling literary attributes. All the stories were suspensful right up to the final unexpected endings. I, Richard, the last of the stories, transforms history into modern day life. Both sad and amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"What a pity! An author like Elizabeth George - specially after having written A TRAITOR TO MEMORY should not bow to editors and write just a plain, uninteresting book exclusively for commercial purposes.Other authors have done this and it has been very damaging for their reputation.This book is pure rubbish! By the way something some authors don't seem to grasp: a novel writer is DIFFERENT from a short stories writer and few brilliant ones can do both; the styles are definitely diverse, so each one should keep to their style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I should have known better, I really should. Hardly any writer whose full-length books I have enjoyed write good short stories, they always feel like the outlines of long stories without any of the detail or good writing. And one of the stories, Good Fences are Not Always Enough, the entire plot, down to the chicken coops, is lifted from a short story by HP Lovecraft, The Rats in the Walls, I believe it's called.I borrowed this book from the library - I'm so glad I didn't spend any actual money on it - because it was the only one of Elizabeth George's I hadn't read. Should have left it on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"In general I am not fond of short stories.

This particular book disappointed me in many ways. I could only complete one of the five stories, and can't recommend it to anyone.Will this stop me from buying her next novel? Not at all. She's a master in her field."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Disappointed","review":"I'm an avid fan of Elizabeth George's novels so I thought I'd give her book of short stories a try. What a truly disappointing collection! The first story was off to a good start, but fizzled out in the end, and was wrapped up in a sloppy way. I wanted to throw down the book right then and there but I persevered. To my disappointment, every story in this book was \\"lame\\" , to use my teenager's terminology. I cannot believe I wasted my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am So glad that I didn't purchase this book!","review":"Thank goodness I got it from the library! I have read all of Elizabeth George's novels and this is about as different from any of the others as it can get. I didn't even finish a couple of the stories, as they were so boring. Please don't do this to us Elizabeth. According to all these reviews, your readers do not want more of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Let me state up front that I only read the first two stories in the collection so this review in based only on those stories. If you plan to read this book, this review gives away the plot of the two stories so read no further. In the first story the thief steals 2 goblets from the estate but kills a man in the process for absolutely no reason (unless, of course, you find it believable that someone would commit cold-blooded murder as a diversion for the theft of a few thousand dollars). The second story, a psychological thriller, has similar problems. A man, at his volunteer job, sneaks home to kill his wife and is faced, after the murder, with a surprise birthday party!! How would the wife ever know he was coming home? How could she possibly create this surprise? These plot structures are so fatal as to make the stories, no matter how well written, unbelievable. Readers should stick with her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort","review":"Ms. George does short stories poorly: unexplained motives, unlikable main characters, predictable or weak endings, overly long (just for purposes of including historical research), poor plotting, incomplete character development. These flaws show up within scenes of her books -- I should note I like her novels -- but are easy to overlook in the quantity of pages. Also, the fact that most of the stories were previously published was not readliy disclosed.I hesitate to donate my copy to the library, but perhaps it will save someone else from buying it. I'm sure it was worthwhile from a commercial point of view, but Ms. George should hone her craft before attempting another collection -- something I hope she does, as it can only improve her novels, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential for anyone cosidering the journey","review":"Dissconected from your soul?

The sales person said the signal would be better and there would be less hassels. He was right. I can always depend on this little fellow.

I am even more impressed , that this was done on a budget -- the acting I felt was real and well done, the music score was outstanding, and the choice of film media and use of color filters made the entire film very rich and much depth for the eyes. Zombie make ups were also, just wonderful. Was not sure about a period piece zombie film but the move explained it and it was sensible and cohesive - so kudos to the writer(s)....the feeling you get during and after watching it -- is that you just traveled along with a man, that has found Hell come to earth and with it, brought all the demented and diseased souls of the dammned, to possess and wander about, in the bodies of the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie.","review":"If you go into this expecting a terrific, blood gushing, civil war guns banging, zombie movie- you're going to be disappointed. This movie was so much deeper than that. It was a beautiful, eloquently produced piece of literature. Its one of those movies where afterwards you just sit and discuss all the things that it made you think and feel. Exit Humanity is about what makes us human. Its about the grief of losing, the hope of living. The movie was visually gorgeous with a unique attention to detail. The main point of this movie is that life will move on, albeit not without the influences of the past.

From the non-stop, over-the-top rage screams of the main character, to the cheesy music, to the random, meaningless flashbacks, it was really, really bad. I will say the zombie makeup was quite good, and the countryside and sets would have added an interesting texture to the movie, if the movie didn't induce eye-bleeding in all who watched it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself until halfway through \\"Chapter 2\\" (yes, \\"Chapter 2!\\"), when I started getting sleepy and thought, surely, this must be over soon. Nope! I was only 25 minutes into a 2 hour movie. Save yourselves!I appreciate that this movie must have been made by a novice, and probably very young director. We all have to start somewhere.

As far as zombie movies go, it worth the viewing as long as your not expecting a movie the caliber of Dawn of the Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical gory, campy zombie flick","review":"I liked this film a lot. Yes, it was slow, and no, it didn't have shot after shot of bloody battles, decapitations, splattering jugulars, or severed spurting limbs. But the movie actually tried to take the genre seriously, exploring the main character's real pain from losing his family, and his doubts about his own goodness, or the worthiness of humanity, after having witnessed (and participated in) true horror on earth. The acting is very good overall (excepting the man playing General Williams, ugh) and the cinematography and forest setting is exquisite. Really worth a look. Just don't expect a mindless horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Zombie Movie With Heart","review":"This movie is excellent. It felt more like a drama with a zombie backdrop.

What was \\"bloody disgusting\\" was the fact that this was the S-L-O-W-E-S-T zombie flick I've ever seen...I had to fast forward on a number of occasions. Every scene lasted three times longer than it should have. This could have been released as a 30-minute vignette...not 114 minutes. Don't get me wrong...it definitely had its high points but it was not a \\"Bloody Disgusting\\" zombie flick. This passes as PG for me.

It's kind of an endless loop of the same tone, same scenes, same subpar zombies lumbering towards the protagonist who repeatedly falls on his knees and howls at the sky. The movie is also punctuated by animated sequences that only serve to further muddy an already muddled movie There casting/act is weak - as are the sad-sack zombies. It's neither scary, nor interesting/poetic.

I then shelved it and used another Bible. Recently I saw that this Bible had a Lifetime binding guarantee so I called Holman and they told me to take it back to one of their distributors, a local Christian Bookstore. No questions asked and the volume was exchanged. The new one has some kind of stitching through the first several pages at the front and back. Although the volume is not considered a sewn binding I believe this will solve the issue I had with the previous edition. The text is very clear and large, each verse is started on a new line helping to aid when teaching from or searching for scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"King James Version indexed Super Giant Print","review":"I gave this Bible to our 95 years young friend for his Birthday.

It is not a small book, but it also isn't too big to carry with ease. The paper is very thin; yet, the print on one side doesn't interfere with reading the other. Those to whom I have given this Bible have found it so easy to read (after struggling with regular Bible print sizes). Since it is a regular King James Version (and not a 'New King James Version'), it still has the far more specific pronouns that are vital for properly understanding nearly all texts. Thee, thou, thine and thy are always singular in this version of the Bible, and ye, you and your are always plural. Bibles that don't use these archaic-sounding but easily learned pronouns give uncertain information in many thousands of texts.I highly recommend this particular Bible for its superior print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bonded leather as described","review":"This was the imitation leather bible, which can be purchased at Walmart or Kmart for $12.99.

The cards themselves are wonderful in the descriptions and beauty. The back side of the cards are all the same scene of what appears to be clouds, beautiful orange shades.

We've enjoyed many of Eric Carle's classic titles (The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Brown Bear) but this one is awful. It's highly inaccurate, from the empirical standpoint, and has nothing to do with how a seed germinates. Beyond that, it's horrendous. The other seeds suffer horrible deaths until only this one is left - it's more like Stephen King's The Long Walk than a preschooler book. 1984 is more cheerful.Carle has diluted his brand in a really awful fashion in recent years. Now he's jumped the shark."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tiny Seed","review":"If you want a good book for your children and want to educate them at the same time? Yes?

When one delves into philosophy more and more, the connections that Wiker makes appear highly credible. The ancient Greeks can be somewhat boring to read in my opinion, however the way that Wiker lays out his arguments make this an interesting read. For someone to cover a select strand of thought over history this well is impressive.

By no means proven, but how do people like Aquinas and the author rule it out? You want eternal, unchanging first principles? Lucretius provides one with his indestructible, unchangeable atoms. Atoms are unbreakablein turn because they determine, and thereby limit all physical forces. You want a prime mover? He recognizes any and all physical laws, things that effect changes in the universe, but still do not in any way themselves change, as qualifying. Lucretius is a challenging thinker that requires a real Thomist to provide convincing answers. This author simply does not recognize Lucretius or materialism a such. Lucretius was the inspiration of Newton's universal gravitation, not just an anticipator. A challenging world view must be addressed by this book. One is hardly referenced. It is mainly Catholic platitiudes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic? I'll take it!","review":"This was one of the first lps I ever owned when I got it in 1968 as a 7th grader.

Their playing was superb, whether it was a tender ballad like Sometimes I Think About or rockers like Gotta Get Away.They showed so much more playing ability of that day than most other hit-makers, or bands who did stuff that passed for music. So why are moronic tunes like Wild Thing still getting more airplay than this little gem from the 60s?

The Magoos played in the gym and later gave away copies of the Psychedelic Lollipop lp ( I still have my rather beat up copy ) This was my first experince at a concert and remains one of my fondest memories, even after seeing many others including Zeppelin.

The prose is sharp and concise, resulting in a textbook that comes across as impactful yet never overwhelming. The use of charts, graphs, diagrams and other visual support do much to support the text and give a clearer sense of what the author attempts to illustrate. However those looking for a deep read should consider another text which further breaks down the motives of socio-economic and socio-political trends as this seems more like an introductory text that covers the general concepts.

I found this book very enjoyable--especially the first half when one gets to see the world from the killer's perspective--sometimes with enjoyable humor thrown in. This book is so unlike the writing styles of many American authors I'm familiar with. Granted, a lot of terms or sayings are \\"British\\" and therefore hard to follow, but his writing style more than makes up for it. This is the second Campbell novel I've read. His stories are slow-moving with a lot of detail. For me, the pace is perfect. The violence is never too much or repulsive. It's more the result of a long build-up. I would call this a \\"psychological thriller\\". At the end, I found that I was very sympathetic to the killer. The emotion was real and surprising. Way to go Ramsey!

He took chemo and radiation concurrently as his \\"only\\" chance to live--even so, his prognosis was not good. He found a copy of this book and an audio cassette tape from the Simontons. He read the book, then read it again, then read it again, while continuing chemo and radiation! Each day, three times a day, he listened to the audio tape. He placed as much faith in the book and its suggestions and in the relaxation-visualization tape as he did in the conventional treatment he was receiving. He lived almost fifteen years after diagnosis and did not die from inoperable lung cancer but from bleeding ulcers. This book and the visualization tape if it is still available, are MUSTS for people diagnosed with cancer who are willing to use their minds to help their bodies cure themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvey's Bags","review":"I bought my first Harvey's bag over 5 years ago.

Using a series of guided exercises, the author does an inventory of trust issues and shows us several strategies for overcoming problems. If you want to increase the trust people feel towards you, this book is an excellent resource. It is practical and full of tips and exercises that will illustrate issues that are not always so easy to see. I recommend this book to all executives and those who hope one day to become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a big beautiful loaf","review":"The aroma of this bread baking in the machine is wonderful. It rises higher than my homemade bread and it is absolutely delicious. The ingredients are fresh, including the yeast. It's cheaper than buying bread at the bakery or supermarket, especially if you buy it through the Amazon subscription plan. It has excellent texture, not too dense but at the same time not too light. Even the picky eaters in my family love this bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average live Asia CD","review":"The edition I have is simply titled \\"Live at Budokan\\", which is a Deutsche/UK budget import on Superior/Digimode. Of course, this stands out because of Greg Lake's brief stint here, and you have two-thirds of ELP (yet around the same time Emerson and Lake did an album with the late Cozy Powell instead of Carl Palmer, and then there was 3 with Emerson and Palmer but not Lake). I liked Lake in King Crimson on their first album, but I couldn't take to ELP. It's almost unusual to hear him on these songs. It would've made a little sense to throw in \\"Lucky Man\\" and maybe even \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" for good measure, if you're an ELP fan, but what would the Yes half think?. I was too young to remember the concert, yet it was a watershed event. Asia have had almost as many lineup changes as Crimson, Yes, and Destiny's Child! This is a rare gem to have, even if you only like one previous band or the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asia live 1983 with Greg Lake","review":"In 1983 Asia's former member John Wetton was replaced by ELP's Greg Lake. Lake leaved the band after some weeks, because Asia was \\"to poppy for him\\". He has given only three concerts in Tokio with the band, which are published now, 18 years later.In 1983 there was the most creative phase of Asia. On tour the band was playing the best tracks of the CD's Asia and Alpha with a lot of energy in a chrystal clear sound. The CD includes the Asia hits of this period (f.e. Heat of the moment and Sole Survivor) and the solos of Steve Howe, Geoffrey Downes and Carl Palmer too. Greg Lake vocals are live better then Wetton's. In my opinion this is the best live album Asia has ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Lost Opportunity!","review":"In 1983 the tension between Steve Howe and John Wetton, ended when the bassist was sacked from the band. He was replaced by Greg Lake(Still in Top Form!) to play a MTV's show for Japanese Television. This short lived incarnation of Asia: Howe,Wetton,Downes and Lake, played one gig only and short after Lake leave the band because \\"it was too poppy for him\\".This Tokyo's gig was released on Video as \\"Asia in Asia \\" , and here for the first time is release on CD format. Sadly the shine quality of the performance (Showing the versatility of Lake's voice to sing a Wetton's songs) is obscured by a poor quality recording adding the almost inexistent information in the record's booklet. It is a lost great opportunity to make a descent job on one of the most interesting piece of Asia's history.P.D I wrote this review twelve years ago under a key user that I forgot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"This disc is essentially a watered-down version of the MTV \\"Asia-in-Asia\\" event (from the December 1983 concert) featuring Greg Lake on vocals.The performance is sorely lacking intensity...with Lake's weak vocals and the music unsettling to his range.However, contrary to popular belief, Asia performed two shows with Lake during this brief tour of Japan.Search the internet for a copy of the second show at the Budokan...the sound quality is vastly superior to this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Good for the Man is Good for the Woman in this Movie.","review":"Chester Morris plays a roving husband who has a brief affair with another woman--and tells his wife it doesn't mean a thing!

When confronted with his wife's infidelity, the husband is unable to accept her explaination that \\"it doesn't mean a thing.\\" This is definately pre-code Hollywood at it's finest and this movie doesn't disappoint. Norma's real life husband, Irving Thalberg, wasn't at all keen for Norma to play a part like this, but it's a good thing he relented.

I had previously read A Wrinkle in Time and found it good, but not exactly outstanding. It did, however, stimulate me to read its sequels. I greatly preferred its sequels. A Wind in the Door was about Meg Murry and her friend Calvin O'keefe going inside Meg's little brother Charles Wallace's mitrochondria with a strange cherubim, A Teacher, and Mr. Jenkins who is a principal at Charles Wallace's school, to keep the Echthroi from corrupting the farendolae.

Madeleine L'Engle does a wonderful job with her characters and story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey into human possibility, for adults too","review":"I have read this beautiful book with my three daughters, and I have reread it for my own education and delight. I have even taken to recommending it to physicians, healers and others who are interested in exploring how we may be able to make intuitive journeys inside the body and develop imagery that can be used to guide the body in the direction of healing. As in all of her books, Madeleine L'Engle brings a keen interest in science and familiarity with the classics to support her vivid imagination, so that her work provides effortless instruction in areas ranging from the behavior of mitochondria to the nature of cherubim and of forces of chaos and evil in our world. This book is for every adult who is open to re-visioning human possibility, as well as for kids of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel to A Wrinkle in Time with Charles-Wallace and Meg","review":"This book is the sequel to A Wrinkle in Time. Charles-Wallace is very ill.

As usual, L'Engle mergers moral subjects into pure fantasy with her skilled writing and wonderful characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wind in the door","review":"i think that this book is not a book no one should ever read but if you like science then you will like this book but it is not good at all!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only slightly better than the first.","review":"I just do not understand why everyone thinks these books are so great. I've now read the first two to my daughter, and while she liked the first one, her interest diminished in this second one. I thought that this one would be better than the first, because the first half of the book had a story that seemed to be developing really well. Then they started traveling through space and size and it stopped making sense. There's no explanation as to why Sporos must deepen, or why the teacher is teaching these particular humans, or why the echthroi do what they do. The only thing that's clear is that these particular humans must do something right away or the universe will collapse. Like the first book, there is very little character development and the plot is overly simplistic. Thankfully I've convinced my daughter to switch to the Chronicles of Narnia for our reading time, and I'm hoping she forgets this series so that I don't have to come back to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl saves world","review":"SummerlandThere is evil loose in the world.The forces of good send good send Meg to deal with.We aren't told that the devil is behind itor that it is God that has dispatched the fire truck.Science is always in Madeleine L'Engle's bookson the side of the cherubim ( in the Daniel like Babylonian form).Cosmology and molecular biology aren't really helped here,but not done any real harm either.The bullies attacking the Charles Wallace's of the world are very realas are the Mr. Jenkins'who are supposed to be there to help,but are jealous too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book","review":"It's got mystery to the end.

The reader can tell that her writing style has matured. She does not slip into a didactic mode which (slightly) mars the last chapter of Wrinkle. The science fact and science fiction are sufficient to satisfy buffs of the genre, and sufficiently subtle not to get in the way of those to whom they do not appeal. (whew) More important, though, is the theme, which reaches and suffuses through your mind. Reading Ms. l'Engle's books was my first truly mind-expanding experience.It is a red herring to call this work a children's book. What it truly is is a book for those who want to expand their mind and their view of the universe, including children. I first read this book at age 11 and have continued to read it repeatedly up until 17; I expect to continue to reread it for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wind in the Door by Madelline L'Engle","review":"A Wind in the Door, by Madeline L'Engle, is an extremely moving and exciting book. In this sequel to A Wrinkle in Time, Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace team up with snakes, teachers, mitochondria, and a Cherubum called Progo. It all starts one blustery day when Charles Wallace claims to have seen a drove of dragons in the twin's vegetable garden. Meg and Calvin then learn that Charles Wallace could have an extremely deadly condition: his mitochondria are dying. Charles Wallace is in danger of being X-ed.This book sucks you in and won't let go until you have felt all of the emotion running rampant throughout. The story teaches the fact that amount doesn't matter, everything has a name, and it also teaches true, unconditional love."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"We're in enjoying the online read of this.

When I read this as a kid, I got very confused once Meg and everyone is inside Charles Wallace's body, but I don't remember much else of my reaction.Upon reading this as an adult, I enjoyed the book, but it wasn't all that this series was hailed to be. Out of the four books (A Wrinkle in Time, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, and A Wind in the Door), Many Waters is quite the best, and A Wind in the Door is the one I would least recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"A wonderful continuation of a promising series.

This book came up. I love reading about WWII and what the \\"Greatest Generation\\"\\" did to protect our freedoms. My Grandmother was married to SSGT Nicholas Franzini who was killed on April 18, 1945. In the book Mr. Khoury mentions him and a premonition of his death. He also mentions my grandmother. It is nice to know that the memory of his service lives on in the book. If anyone reads this and has more information for me on Nick Franzini please let me know.

I was eagerly awaiting to read his definition of high trust and how to establish value - neither of which I found in the book. Rather the first part is mainly \\"pump you up\\" motivation typical of motivational speakers and the second part outlines his four step approach to selling. Just saying it is high trust does not engender high trust. He begins the book saying money isn't everything, yet in all of the success stories that permeate the book, money is the top gauge of success. All of the success illustrations avoid naming companies, industries or products. The one saleswoman who reduced her client base from 60 to 12 clients and sold $80 million in one year was a little hard to believe.

If you've read a lot of sales or management books, though, you will already be familiar with many of the ideas it presents.In my opinion, the book title is misleading. This book reads like it was originally named Fourteen Laws for Better Sales before the publisher decided to boost sales by renaming it. The author seems to feel that if he sprinkles the words \\"high trust\\" throughout the text, then that's what the book is about. It's really not.In High Trust Selling, Todd Duncan offers standard advice on selling dressed up in \\"high trust\\" clothes.

A worthwhile read for those who either want to try yoga under the tutelage of a certified teacher and as part of professionally supervised treatment as a means of improving and sustaining mood or adding it to more traditional treatment.

I have never had more than temporary relief of symptoms after yoga. Sure, if you want to do yoga for 8 hours a day, you might get more out of it. The author fails to realize that depression is a heterogenous condition, and as such, she offers false hope to some.

Ms. Weintraub certainly seems to understand the dark days firsthand and she offers positive advice on how a yoga practice can help quiet the mind as well as energize the body.I did buy the book expecting it to have a full yoga program in it. But that is not the purpose of the book. It does have many yoga practices and they have been helpful but her intent is to explain the connection between our bodies and emotions and how yoga can help.

I find this more believable, as I'm pretty sure children don't feel ugly (or common, for that matter) simply on their own.Throughout the story, Hermie and his fellow commoner Wormie compare themselves with others and pray to God to be made un-common.

The book purports to be the story of a German Foreign Legion batallion serving in Indo China immediately following WWII .The story itself is suspect , there is no doubt that many ex-members of the German armed forces sought refuge with FFL after WWII and many would inevitably have been from Waffen SS .

This is a subject that is well hidden in French military documents due to political implications, but to tease those readers interested in what happened to those members of the SS who disappeared into the Indochina theater is nothing less then almost criminal intent.I had great hope that this would be a well written work on Legion incorporation of SS members, but this was not the case.

A fellow Infantry NCO let me read a well worn copy that he had. It probably had been passed around quite a bit among the soldiers of the camp. I found it to be a fascinating and believable story. I spent 7 years in light Infantry airborne units and was an expert at conducting small unit actions such as recons, raids, night attacks, ambushes, and patrolling. It was immediately obvious to me that Kopfjaeger Wagemuller was a well seasoned veteran and tactician of many combat engagements. His command of his people and the discipline of his men kept them winning when the odds were not in their favor.

It is incredibly campy and does not stand up to any real historical scrutiny. I concede that veterans of World War Two would have found themselves in the French Foreign Legion and I am confident that a few were from the Axis powers. And, yes, I believe there would be Waffen SS amongst them. But I have never heard of a full battalion raised for the fight in Indo China (Vietnam). The best part of this book were the first few chapters that dealt with the very last days of the WW2. The collapse of Nazi Germany continues to fascinate. When the action moves to Asia, it becomes repetitive and the author loses an opportunity to develop the characters. Instead it functions as an introductory primer to asymmetrical warfare (and a very brutal version of it). It reminded me of those Sven Hassel novels I read in the late 70's (with SS in the last name called out on the sensational covers).Interesting but strange overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading given the current world situation.","review":"I read this book back when I was in the USMC (3rdBn, 6th Marines, 2nd Marine Division).

E.g. the cover of the book mentions XML, in my opinion an integral part of j2ee. But hey, it is not mentioned in the J2EE section.Then finally this book seems to discuss interoperability, and guess what, it does not. The last chapter discusses a commercial tool (who ownes the shares?) which should help you out.

This is another European release but you can get it from Amazon. Don't miss this one. I fear that we may be seeing the last pressings of the old 60's and 70's Motown soul artists due to lack of interest and meager cd sales of these artists.

The first few chapters, an overexaggerated collection of _fictional_ before and after vignettes, are presented with excruciating, nearly condescending simple-mindedness.The chapters of interest are toward the end, (past 9) advising community leaders how to improve their town.

I've since become an avid fan and collector and I've come to believe she was the finest actress of all time. Isn't that what's so great about movies; that they often make profound impacts on our lives! Well this movie made an impact on mine and I hope it does the same for yours. And if you're looking for the next Davis film - try Watch on the Rhine. Even hubby liked that one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"getting out from under a controlling mother","review":"Excellent, beautifully costumed and lit film of 1942, starring young Bette Davis as a woman who gets out from under her bossy mother's thumb long enough to blossom into a sophisticate who falls in love with an unhappily married man. Later, she helps his sad daughter out of her depression. Good story and cast.I tell you, that controlling mother of hers threw herself down the staircase on purpose!\\"My mother! My mother! My mother!

I watched it with her and ended up just keeping it I loved the movie so much!! I've always loved movies, but used to think most old movies didn't have much to offer...boy was I ignorant!! This is a great example of how great movies stand the test of time. This movie has become one of my favorites!! Interesting story which is really romantic. I am surprised no one has remade it, but I hope they don't because it doesn't need to be remade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable","review":"This is a very heart warming and satisfying movie. I didn't want it to end. In the end, Charlotte is a mentor, trusted friend, and mother figure to Tina. Tina is Charlotte when she was young, and Charlotte is what Tina needs and what Charlotte needed at that age. This movie should have been longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time","review":"It is hard to make a movie that is both sad and uplifting but Now Voyager accomplishes this. Apparently Bette Davis really didn't, as has been said, care about how bad they made her look in a movie. She is perfect in this from first scene to last. Nobody else could have done it. The supporting cast was wonderful. \\"Dora\\", the nurse - perfect. I have looked at it many times and, I'm sure, will look at it many more times. If you are a classic B&W movie fan or a Bette Davis fan and haven't seen this film then get it as quickly as possible. I know that there are films where color is much the better choice but there is nothing like the beautiful B&W photography in some of these classic films. You simply can't do lights and shadows with color the way they did in B&W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, Voyager","review":"This movie is for true lovers of Bette Davis and/or Paul Henreid. It's a romantic, beautifully filmed movie that leaves you feeling warm when it ends. For the period in which it was made (black and white), I would think some men back then might find it offensive to find a strong woman with a heart of gold. My VHS was worn out and then DVD's hit the market and I had to get it. Quality of the DVD was excellent. Not grainy or worn like my old VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"What could be better...","review":"...than Bette Davis chain smoking her way through life, and still looking glamorous?...than her mother telling the psychologist that her daughter is no sicker than, \\"a moulting canary?...than Claude Rains as the owl-eyed psychologist saying, \\"A mother's rights - twaddle?\\"This is an epic picture, completely unbelievable (let's flash back to when she was 16 and in braids!) and completely Warner Brothers (the stock footage of South America...) Ridiculous coincidences, patronizing attitudes to \\"Latin types,\\" and Paul Henried playing an American named Jerry.But it's hypnotic, and not only a must-see, but a must-own.

The beginning of things to come. Not as aggressive or heavy as future releases. they still play 'Good Mourning' live should you have the chance to see them. Choice cut for me would be 'Waiting to Disinigrate,' a great tune that really uses the quiet/loud dynamic rather well. 'Blank Smile' uses vocoder vocal effects that help set the emotionally detached mood of the song. Overall not a bad song in the bunch.There are still cds left if you go to the band's website. I do recommend this if you have their other releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Backpacking Tent!","review":"I just took this tent on a three day backpack trip to above 12,000 ft.

There are short sleeves for the poles on one end and clips from the top to the other end. Super fast and easy to set up and tear down. The rain fly provided excellent coverage. That and the little vent on the end opposite the screen meant that I woke up Sunday morning dry as a bone. No rain, no condensation. Pay attention to the weather so you can set up and stake out the tent facing the right way. Do that, and you'll have no problems.My only complaint isn't about the tent by my local Eureka dealers.

My daughter and I were camping on Current River and got caught in a strong rainstorm. The pitiful little excuse for a rainfly that this tent comes with is almost criminally negligent on Eureka's part. Any tent that doesn't offer a full-coverage rainfly is begging to leak.Woke up with darn near an inch of water in the tent with us. Wet bags, wet clothes, wet us.I hope to never have the misfortune of spending another night in a Eureka tent. At least not this one.I got home and ordered a Columbia Hawk Ridge tent instead. It's made all the difference.

Yes, the movie's original script was censored, but indications are that the original was much racier than even her early films (as one might expect given the production title IT AIN'T NO SIN) so it's not really any tamer than her first three films and Mae has several of her best lines, my favorite is \\"I'm in town - but not for good.\\" The song numbers are the best Mae ever did in the movies. The movie also offers a rare look at \\"tableaux\\", the odd stage art popular in the 19th century of simply posing on the stage which climaxes with Mae posing as the Statue of Liberty, or as George Jean Nathan put it, The Statue of Libido."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mae West as Ruby Carter","review":"BELLE OF THE NINETIES was originally entitled \\"It Ain't no Sin\\". However, the censors disagreed and the result was a changed title and a laundered script.

In one scene John Miljan goes into great detail in describing Mae's physical attributes while proposing, Mae stops him cold: \\"Wait a moment\\"! \\"Is this a proposal or are you takin' inventory! \\" Directed by Leo McCarey and photographed by Karl Struss (Mae never looked better) this is still an amusing example of West-ern humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable romp for Miss West","review":"This is my first exposure (aside from seeing snippets of \\"My Little Chickadee\\" on TV) to a Mae West film, and it certainly won't be my last!

Although \\"Belle..\\" was not Mae's strongest vehicle (especially after being \\"watered down\\" by the Production Code, her constant nemesis), there's no ignoring her knack for dialogue & racy one-liners only the Great Mae could pull off. It certainly says something when a star from generations past can have the same impact decades later. Hats off to ya, Mae!P.S.--When are we going to get treated to a DVD collection of her films?

After reading \\"Inventing Beauty,\\" I know I am but one member of a devoted sorority throughout history. I'll never feel the same again about my bra or my mascara!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and entertaining.","review":"This was the first book I have ever read about the history of the beauty industry. I really enjoyed it and I thought that it had a lot of interesting information. My only complaint is that the book did not go into a lot of detail about hair products, there was a whole chapter about hair removal techniques but there wasn't any information about hair dye, hair curlers, ect. I wish that the book would have gone into more depth about those subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read the whole book and I watched the movie with Rutger Hauer who is a very good actor, but both was not very satisfying.There is a much more compelling and unpredictable novel on the same topic by Irving Wallace, \\"The 7th Secret\\".Since it has been published in 1986, I was always wondering why it never has been filmed.I really can recommend reading \\"The 7th Secret\\". That's a fascinating story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome research","review":"his descriptions of the charachters involved showed a realistic view of the german/nazi mindsetfastforwarded 20 years. He is a tremendous THINKING MACHINE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"This book was full of such intrigue and suspense and the historical background shines. The novel itself is chock full of twists and turns and moves you through Hitler's Europe and what would have happened. The ending was abrupt and was the only part that held the book back from that additional star. As is, the book was a nice read and will keep you hanging and turning pages until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horribily wonderful reading!","review":"It's hard to call a novel covering such an evil topic as Nazi Germany \\"wonderful,\\" however, Mr. Harris did a fantastic job on this book. The building suspense and horror of the characters can be felt, with the last 40 or so pages leaving the reader nearly breathless from the despicable acts perpetrated upon millions of innocent people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced thriller","review":"The book tells how Germany might have been had the Nazis won from the perspective of an intelligent man who does not share the totalitarian beliefs of his leadership. Fast moving story, which holds the interest. Thought provoking in the manner of Orwell or Huxley. Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well constructed thriller","review":"This was a well put together novel. It works as an effective thriller and a clever piece of thought provoking piece of counterfactual thinking.I quite liked the writing style but some of the dialogue was a bit stilted and the book never really lives up to the premise.I thought that it required a certain suspension of disbelief as well.I am impressed at how well a fully recreated alternate world is created by the author. Mostly it seems quite plausible apart from perhaps the ending but I don't want to give away any spoilers.The hero of the book is quite an interesting character and there are some other interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great, but definitely good","review":"It's not quite Gorky Park, but it's as close as anyone not named Martin Cruz Smith has come to showing us the horrors of being an honest cop in a totalitarian regime. Some of the alternative history doesn't satisfy, but most of it really strikes home. Harris definitely made a good decision to not delve too deeply in the supposed reasons that kept the U.S. out of the War. However, the whole scenario rests on a valid assumption: the Cold War was a conflict of power, pitting the dominant power on the European continent against the U.S., the only nation state who could check the dominant European state's pursuit of global domination. Good Book. The details about the new Berlin are really eye-opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"An opportunity for an amazing book, lost","review":"This book, presenting a detective story in a \\"what if\\" world had the potential to be one of the greatest books of the decade, in a terrifying world where Germany had won WWII. However, Harris' writing is not compelling and it is difficult to be drawn into the book. The plot itself is not that interesting and surprising. All in all, an opportunity for a great book, lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Maybe I had high expectations with this book but this is just one more book.Boring and disappointing therefore I don\`t recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent novel","review":"I don't give five stars to rank certain works up there with Moby Dick or Proust or whatever, but to certify that a book has done its job, and this one does it quite well: highly readable and rewarding. You don't just toss it aside and move on to the next pulper. It stays with you and has big questions. The words and sentences have grain and feeling, writ with a sharp journalistic eye. The atmosphere is palpable, weighing on the mind even after you put the book down for a while. This puts it on a higher level than even excellent spy thrillers like Eye of the Needle. Anyone interested in history and politics should read it, because it asks us how important is history? How important is the truth? Is it possible some of the bigger things we've accepted as true in history are in fact artifacts of mythography?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rip off of Gorky Park","review":"I liked fatherland . I also liked Gorky Park. Its practically the same book: An oppressive society with a politicized view of law . An investigator of\\" normal' crimes is assigned to solve a crime probably better left to the higher order (political) police agency. The investigator is different there are whispers of his being anti-party. he is fair , rational incorruptible .There are differnces: in Gorky park the investigator wants the KGB to take the case. Here in \\"Fatherland \\"the hero is a Kripo cop(kriminalpolizei) who does not want the Sipo to take his case. Both are manipulated by fatherly higher ups. both are estrange from thier wives.

It is a very good book with a cool \\"what if?\\" plot. So quit reading and buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I'd read a review of this book, and while the premise was interesting, it was predictible and boring. Just an updated remake of \\"If the South Won The War.\\" only focussing on the Third Reich. Iasn't able to give it less than one star. One star is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty","review":"As with most books, this has a novelty concept, that of a man living in a Nazi superstate had the power been semi-victorious in World War II (and, he carefully notes, it was only a few bad decisions away from being thus). The historical research is beautiful, but the characters are alarmingly obvious and the mystery, muddled, goes so much nowhere. The obvious comparison is to Orwell's \\"1984,\\" yet this is even more mundane; these characters make lip service to desiring freedom or democracy or whatever, but their actual motivation seems to be self-interest and the restless pursuit of a good life their neurotic minds will not allow them. Worthy for a historical read, boring as a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thriller, but Orwell's work.","review":"I couldn't put this book down.As a left-wing author (Harris was a BBC journalist)it seems obvious to me that he has re-written \\"1984\\", but with the political right being the baddies. So, I could only give two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing audiocassette","review":"It almost doesn't seem fair to rate this audiocassette in the same pool with the book. I'm sure, after reading a sampling of the reviews, that the book is MUCH better. Something is lost in the translation and abridgement for audiocassette. Sure, the interesting premise is still there as is the big secret. But the page turning suspense is lost in the process. That's what I get for being cheap and checking it out of the library - right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up from a guy who doesn't read many novels","review":"There are already 70 some reviews of Fatherland, but I thought I'd give my two cents. I don't read many novels, I mostly read non-fiction, when I read at all. BUT, I really enjoyed this book. A German friend recommended it to me. I am interested WWII history, and have travelled all over Europe, so I found this \\"alternative history\\" novel quite interestsing. There are really two elements to this books. The actual story of a burned out Berlin police detective, which was good, but not especially fresh. But, it's the environment in which this story takes place that really gets you. Hitler won the war, and he rules most of Europe. Berlin is a glittering world capital, and of all things, Joseph P. Kennedy is the President of the US?? Oh well, it's all a good read, and you will not be bored with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing story with a good twist that rings true","review":"A great book -- a mix of history, informed speculation, the life of a German policeman and a thrilling storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"Best book I read in a long time. Harris excellently combines fiction and historic facts. Moreover, his fiction is based on these facts. A well told crime story which evolves into a political thriller. Absolutely great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic?Horrible?Excellent!","review":"This book is one of the best novels about Nazi-Germany, I ever read. The possibility, that Hitler has won the war is a wonderful scenario for an interesting criminal affair.The book shows, how life would have been, if it all had came like this. I think, it is well written, because Harris drew a picture of what could have happen. The image, that I have to grew up in a Nazi-Reich makes me thinking....If you are intersted in history, especially German history, read the book. IT'S GREAT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hohum","review":"The plot/story wasn't compelling. This is a _what if_ Germany won the war and we never knew what happened to the Jews. I found it too unbelievable that the world wouldn't have investigated the disappearance of the European Jewish population. A very slow read with an unsatisfing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ABRIDGMENT Ever","review":"Somehow they managed to abridge out all of the alternative history from this alternative history thriller. You'll never know anything about how the United States won the war against Japan and Germany won the war against Russia from listening to this abridgment. They took all of the history out and left a very uninteresting murder mystery. Oh, and Colonel Clink does a lousy job with the voices in his narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Scenario-Author does nothing with it.","review":"The whole basis for this novel, that the Nazi's won the war and Hitler's 75th birthday celebration is coming combined with a detective story is a \\"what if\\" readers dream but the author sets up a great premise and does absolutely nothing with it. Oh, there's a murder, and there's a secret behind the murder, but I can't believe all the other reviewers of this novel were even a bit surprised by the \\"secret\\" revealed. The only reason that even a moron couldn't guess what the \\"secret\\" is would be that there would have to be something else in a book this hyped, wouldn't there? Sadly there isn't. Also, the author pretty much stole the idea from Len Deighton's absolutely superb novel SS-GB which he could be forgiven if it was any good. SS-GB is the real thing and has an actual ending to go with the premise. Fatherland is a very poor imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The basic plot is not believable","review":"The book is historically accurate up to maybe 1943, then it veers off into an alternative version of history - the Germans win WWII in Europe. However, the basic premise of the book is that the Death Camps are not discovered by 1964 (the book is set in '64) and only 14 people knew about the Death Camps and all but 2 of the 14 have been killed off, then the 13th is bumped off by the bad guy #14, .... To run the Death Camps and keep it a secret is too much to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling vision of what might have been.","review":"Akin to George Orwell's \\"1984\\", \\"Fatherland\\" is a chilling vision of what might have been. A Berlin police officer investigates a murder which leads to the discovery of the holocaust a then unknown event to the rest of the world. Harris's story is less a murder investigation than a look at what a grey and depressing existance life would have been like under the Third Reich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable human beings","review":"Dumas' story does not age well. The musketeers live in an age when honor, nobility and dignity rules everything-- which turns them into absolutely horrific human beings. They treat their servants as property-- Porthos even forces his servant to take another, more \\"adventurous\\" name. They terrorize the common folk-- at one point, Athos destroys an innkeeper's entire stock of food because he blaims the owner for an unrelated assassination attempt. And they treat women terribly-- the main villainess, MiLady, is really only \\"bad\\" because she refuses D'Artagnan's lustful advances.The pacing is also about as fast as molasses rolling uphill in winter.The musketeers are supposed to be a classic of swashbuckling. But when you actually read their adventures, you find they're nothing more than arrogant, murderous sociopaths."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Four Rascals","review":"I recently finished The Three Musketeers. I liked it a lot, but I was surprised to see that I had a very different idea of them. I thought (mainly because of the movies) that they were always fighting for a noble cause. I was wrong: they were arrogant, violent and cruel, and above all, they had no idea of what they were fighting for. The Cardinal Richelieu was extremely benevolent with them, considering their high treason to their country. Their support for an English Lord, an open enemy of France and possible lover of their Queen, is unacceptable. Anyway, we feel sympathy for them, forgive their errors and enjoy their adventures. This is a great book that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure story","review":"This book is a staple in adventure reading. Following the adventures of the three musketeers and D'Artagnan was a delight and it was hard to put down. The action of duels, the intrigue of politics, and the search for true love make the book's appeal universal. Great book to get motivate young children to read for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"lizzie berster","review":"This book is about the great adventures of three of the King's musketeers named Porthos, Athos,and Aramis, and their new found friend and a man trying to become a musketeer named d'Artagan. When d'Artagan arrives in France he is challanged to a duel against the other orignal musketeers. They decide not to duel but instead they fight against the cardinal's guards. After that they become the best of friends, and stick together through everything good and bad. I really didn't enjoy this book but I give it 2 stars because it had some good parts. There were some really boring parts that were bad. It was difficult to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"All for one, and more for me!","review":"Reading this book you get the feeling you're actually withAthos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan as they fight for the honor ofthe king against the wicked Cardinal Richelieu and his accomplice Milady. And what a fine fight it is! All the action and adventure a person can get is right here in this book, and here's the good part: it's a classic! It's because of these remarkable traits that it is a classic and it'll go down in history along with other classics such as 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', as great adventures for all ages to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Abridged!","review":"Look, I love The Three Musketeers, absolutely love it. It's clever, adventurous, and laugh out loud hilarious. It is one of my all-time favorites, but this version is abridged. If you are going to go to all the trouble to read a book, why not read the whole thing? At the time I bought this book, I did not know it was abridged. When I began reading it, I realized little parts of the story were missing and I was not at all pleased. If you want Dumas, get unabridged. It may take a bit longer to finish, but it is very much worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER BLUES CLASSIC FROM MR. TAYLOR","review":"4 stars only because it isn't quite as good as RING THAT BELL. This is a bit more traditional ( as much as traditional is possible for MELVIN ) than RING THAT BELL, I therefore find it a bit less exciting. Where RING THAT BELL is an electric blues CD in the GARY MOORE mold, this is more lay back. It still reaches the same hights, just not as often. I don't think MELVIN TAYLOR could produce anything but outstanding CD's. He is bursting with so much talent as a vocalist and guitarist, that everyone of his CD's is a must have for BLUES fans. He sounds like a mix of the best of BUDDY GUY, a large dose of SRV and a pinch of GARY MOORE.I am just sad that I will never see him live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice \\"Little\\" Gift Book","review":"This is a nice little gift book, not a text book on etiquette.

Unfortunately, although the delivery address was NEW ZEALAND, when it arrived the DVD wasnt compatable with the local systems.....so it was useless.........the book was very brief..as previous reviews have stated....its the DVD thats the main part. Shame that as I was hoping to 'see' techniques etc....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but...","review":"As an avid reader about the problems, which have plagued the Balkans throughtout the 90s I found the book to be both informative from a personal narrative perspective, but tiresome from the repeated diatribes directed towards those who were not pro-Bosniac. While little argument can be made against the documented atrocities committed against the city of Sarajevo, no effort was made to look at the Bosnian-Muslim leadership and their role/complicity in the conflict. For anyone interested in the personal tragedies faced by those who lived in the city while under siege, it is a great story. Overall though, I thought the book was diminished by the often-repeated diatribes against just about anyone connected with the then-ongoing peace talks (Vance-Owen), or the UNPROFOR mission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Hits","review":"A.B.

In the studio, the first thing that surprised me is that Ernest was a very good technical singer. \\"King Of Hearts\\" is a solid blues album with a nice uptempo R&B, Chicago and Swing feel with a little bit of guitar bite and Memphis sounding horn section. The cd simply gets one's motor going, with a few ballads at the stop lights. However,if your preference is more straight Soul like Al Green and Marvin Gaye, King's other cd \\"Blues Got Soul\\" would be the better choice. Besides being a talented singer, King was one of the nicest people that ever walked the face of the earth. He made everyone around him feel better with his love of life. We miss you, Ernest.

It systematically covers all of the major topics covered in the courses offered at every law school in the US comprehensively, even explaining the case briefing process. This new edition incorporates actual case law, allowing you to sample the work done at law school before actual signing your loan check and taking the plunge. Dunham clearly explains all of the basic terminology and principles underlying the first year of law school, providing the law student-to-be a firm foundation and a peace of mind before starting classes. I recommend this book without reservation to ANYONE interested in law school or interested in bulking up on their knowledge of the substance and form of law in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd hoped","review":"This book did not teach me nearly as much as I'd hoped.

Even the boys, who usually moan and groan about female main characters! It is true that the descriptions of war are sometimes a bit graphic...there is a disturbing paragraph about a pregnant woman killed during an air raid/bombing, but it is necessary to the plot and does succeed in conveying the horrors of war. I think the class loved the maturity of the story and the realism...they felt very grown-up after reading it and it opened up days of passionate conversation about WWII, cruelty, patriotism, sacrifice and bravery. It was a perfect introduction piece for The Diary of Anne Frank, which they will read next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for camping","review":"Great for camping. Bought it along with the hand grinder. Makes the best camp coffee ever. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the plunger is a little flimsy and plastic.

The only good thing is that I could easily call GSI for replacement parts at no charge even with the shipping.I honestly thought that the stainless steel version would have a fully stainless steel plunger. I'd say for GSI to take this design back to the drawing board.I would not recommend this to anyone until the plunger design is changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Press","review":"This french press is awesome. It is really easy to clean and is not as fragile as the glass ones. I just bought another glass insert for my bodum press to replace the one I broke when I took it with me on a trip and they have really gone up in price. I am very happy to have a stainless steel press that is half the price of the stainless steel inserts. The thermos part is really great, too. It keeps the coffee hot for about 2 hours. I can take it on trips home where the coffee is not so good, and still have my yummy coffee without fear of breaking the glass. I am very very happy with this press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept - but flimsy plastic plunger filter didn't hold up","review":"The product worked very well for a couple of weeks, but I have had to send it back.

I was delighted when I found this CD because it appeared to be exactly what I was looking for; however, when I received it and listened to the songs, I was put off by the amount of static and the \\"far away\\" sound of Sarah's voice, like she is singing through thick fog or at the bottom of a well. I realize that these are old songs and some amount of static is to be expected, but I've heard better remastering of older songs than what I heard on this CD. The sound quality is so poor as to be distracting. With so many Sarah Vaughan compilations out there, you'd be safe to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a HUGE Robert Cray fan but ...","review":"... this CD was very disappointing. Way too mellow. Many of the songs were indistinguishable. I'd like to see Robert Cray return to the creative fire of his earlier blues works, away from the easy listenin' R&B sound. It worked on \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\", but his last 2 releases are too far down this road. Go back to hard driving blues with some edge - please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda Been Good","review":"Sondie said it well. Ever since going to Ryko, Mr. Cray has been releasing what sounds like out-takes to me. Very mellow and repetitive with no flare and nothing to make me remember these drones. I love Robert Cray's music and hurts to say that his last two releases (Take Your Shoes Off) have been major dissapointments; in fact, these jumped out of my rack and into the trade-em-in shop within a week - and this provided some insight; gee folks, if this is such a great cd, why can I buy it for three bucks in perfect shape and choose from several copies in the trade em in shop just a couple of weeks after this release? Ouch babe! If you don't have \\"I Was Warned\\", get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I have several recordings by Robert Cray, and after hearing the first cut on the album, I was looking forward to hearing more. I was very disappointed. This was the most laidback and unemotional set of blues tunes I have ever heard. I hope his next cd is much better. This one did not move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has the old Cray band gone?","review":"This ones for you if you like a soft and over-produced sound. I want to like Cray's last 2 albums SO badly. But mostly, they are uninspiring. The whole Mephis-roots sound is interesting but the result is a muffled sound by producer Steve Jordan. I mean can he drown out Kevin Hayes' drums more. I think not. Listen to the rocking and original Sweet Potato Pie and Some Rainy Morning. Then listen to this bland drivel. Have I made myself clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juke joint inspired!!","review":"I'm inspired to go find a juke joint in the Deep South after listening to this CD. To me it is reminiscent of the blues that is played there. This music is what we Southerners call \\"down home blues.\\"Cray reminds me of a young B.B. King and in this CD he covers everything from \\"he can't wait to see his baby\\" to \\"he's losing his baby.\\" Those are tracks one and two respectively and it only gets better. This man can make a guitar talk as well as any blues musician, and the fact that he can make you feel his joy and pain doesn't hurt either. On this CD you can definitely feel his southern roots. I recommend it as muse music, heck I just plain recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right direction","review":"This album is exactly right where \\"Ol' Bob\\" should be. His main detractors are annoyed that RC isn't doing hard-edged blues anymore. Where have they been? Except for the Grammy winning Showdown, RC's only blues album was his first (a nice new remaster available) and even that one had inklings of what was to come.Robert Cray has taken alot of flak over the years for not being a tradionalist, unfortunate because Strong Persuader was responsible for bringing blues back into the American mainstream in the mid 80's.Robert's not solely a blues man and anyone who listens will learn this. While his guitar playing is clearly steeped in the blues greats, He is strongly influenced by the driving rhythms of 60s Stax material (Otis Redding, Johnnie Taylor) and Shoulda Been Home exemplifies this more than any other of his albums.If you like RC don't listen to that traditionalist and pick up this album. As far as I'm concerned this is The Blues and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album! Excellent cross-over blues/rock...","review":"I love Robert Cray - but this album is something new. He has an energy and sound that really moves, and I like the changes. Old Cray fans may not agree, but we love it.

Having read his debut novel and the first three of the Quartet, this book is a bit slower in terms of action but I found it to be the most cerebral of his books so far. Whittemore is a modern master of storytelling, but his strength is dialogue. The conversations that take place here are beautifully written, rivalling only those of William Gaddis. As I begin his last novel, I wonder why the publishing industry has let these books fall out of circulation? Whittemore's novels are a secret history of the 20th century. One last note, I have read that his first novel has nothing to due with the Quartet, not true. There are bits and pieces that filter through the Quartet. All interested parties should read his first book before trying to decode the mysteries of the Quartet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I've had this router for 14 months with minimal use.

So I connect this cable from the splitter to a 36db amplifier. Before, I had 41 digital channels. After I put this cable in, I now have 24 digital channels. From the antenna plus this 50 feet cable, there is 75 feet of cable. With my original cable from the splitter to the amplifier, it was 6 feet long, a total of 31 feet of cable.

The signal throughput shows no degradation that I can detect visually. I'm happy with the quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cables.","review":"Generally I don't buy Monster products because they're overpriced for absolutely no reason.

This movie makes me miss his past works like \\"from beijin with love\\", etc so much.another point is that, SC are now more concern of the market of the rest of Asia and even Western, he eliminates all jokes which only locals find funny.

There is a lot of footage of adults grovelling at the feet of bad-guys and taking a lot of (depressing) abuse. There are smokers, drunks, and the \\"Evil Team\\" soccer players are injected with HUGE amounts of drug to be powerful.There is some humor, but not enough.

Stephen Chow leads a very funny ensemble cast which includes a deglamorized Zhao Wei.Sure, the plot is well within the Bad News Bears/Replacements genre but what makes it unpredictable are the off-the-wall humor and overall tongue-in-cheek treatment of the director.If you see this on DVD, buy it. Because one viewing isn't enough to capture all the hilarious scenes like the Face/Off like entry of the team members on the rooftop, the musical number where pedestrians join the action and acts as if nothing happened when it's over, and of course, the game antics of the two rivals.A big hit here in Asia, this is probably the most underexposed comedy in the US.

She and Jay \\"Dennis the Menace\\" North were quite believable in their roles. The guy who played the nut-job, Anthony James (a familiar face from seventies TV) was pretty good too. Interesting to see Barry Atwater of \\"The Night Stalker\\" as a cop. The only disappointment was the very brief appearance of Quinn O'hara, she's barely in the movie.

But there is a clear reason why it is not published by a major publisher, and that is the downfall. The Ten Commandmands written on 25% cotten blend paper would not be the same as the Ten Commandmands written in stone. I would like to see this story handled by a good editor.

The story was chocked-full of editing mistakes which only made matters worse for me and with the story line being one of child abuse rather than mystery I am going to demand a full refund! I hate stories like this one where the writer tries to cash in on the abuse of a small child. It's almost like this child's loss was this writer's gain. A chilling thought! Needless to say I will not be buying any more books by Ms. Vickie Adkins anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tattered Pages","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously.

If you are thinking of dipping your toe in the immense ocean of Villa-Lobos's works, this album is a splendid introduction.

The musicianship is impeccable from the composer on up. Renee Fleming is simply masterful, giving chills throughout. Her last pitch in the recording electrifies and thrills right down to the bone marrow.The wandering and diverse work thankfully exhibits enough dissonance to impart a contrasting spice, though the composer keep returning to \`lush'.This is NOT, thank god, 74 minutes of melodic candy, but serious music. It is complex enough to retain interest and pleasure through repeated hearings. There is more to this composition than first meets the ears.

Being an advanced user myself, I wanted to buy something for a friend who wants to learn Illustrator, and I thought the Dummy series would be a good place to start. Several lessons instruct users to perform tasks in a way that real world users rarely use (because of inefficiency, better method, etc.).The Visual Quick Start series or the Classroom in a Book series on Illustrator are far superior to this.

I anchored it with pipe clamps to a 2x6 fastened to the pilings and then put large concrete blocks on the bottom rails to keep them down. Also, I used large cable ties to secure the cover to the bottom rail. Since the connectors are just pushed together, time will tell if they can be blown loose. I cannot see how the supplied stakes and tie downs would work outside in a windy area. I was downsizing from a studier greenhouse that I could not relace the cover. The price is right on this one but I'm not sure how many years it will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"You get what you pay for\\"","review":"I knew when I bought it that it was only $88.00 so as the old saying goes \\"you get what you pay for\\". It was easy to construct, the frame was ok. the covering is what was horrible. First when I opened the package you could see where one of the seams had not been sewed together.After using it for two weeks one side of the front zipper broke and would not secure the front flap any longer. Basically after using it for this growing season the covering will have to be thrown away, for the two weeks it worked I did get my seeds to sow and grow. Unfortunately for the next two weeks I'll just have to figure away to keep the front flap closed until it's warm enough to plant outside.

Trying to repair the damage did no good, as the cover material seems to have broken down at an Alarming rate under our Texas sun as new rips & tears continued to appear until my mother had to finally take all of her plants out, and now just wants the junky thing OFF her deck!!

The plastic tears very easy and i have several and have only owned it for a few weeks.

Its footprint also exactly fits the space we wanted to use in the shelter of the house and backyard privacy fence.The greenhouse assembles without tools. There's a wordless, illustrated guide for putting it together; a simple, under an hour process. We spent some extra time making sure the frame was level and plumb on the slightly slanting lawn.The various frame pieces are labeled with paper stickers. I used a marker to write the identifying label on frame parts because I think the paper stickers will tend to get lost or damaged in disassembly and reassembly from year to year.The green house covering and zipper on the door appear to be well made of durable materials. I'm hoping for several winters of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good until the zipper broke","review":"Easy to put together, seemed to be well made, then one of the zippers started separating.

That's the only good thing about it.I had this greenhouse installed for just over a week, and then we had some 40-50mph winds. That kind of wind is not unusual in most places, and you will probably get something like that at least a few times a year.Well, the plastic joints broke, and now it is unusable. I guess I am going to build a wood frame for it.It would be cheaper to just build your own frame and buy some greenhouse plastic sheets and make your own greenhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I dislike about modern popular literature in one place","review":"I've never written a book review before, but this was more than I could bear. I was looking for historical \\"fictional non-fiction\\" and found the silliest book I've read in some time. The only thing I can really remember about the book that stands out (I finished it last week) is that 3/4 of the way through I laughingly thought that the only thing they missed was homosexuality, but they didn't disappoint and a silly, pointless, passing reference was crammed in. I haven't read Mario Puzo before (but of course loved the movie The Godfather) but I'll bet this is not on the same level as his other novels. If they turn this one into a movie, it'll be on USA starring Lorenzo Lamas as the pope and Bjork as Lucretia Borgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Story, Poorly Told","review":"It would be very difficult to make the story of the family Borgia dull, but Mario Puzo and Carol Gino do their best. Pope Alexander VI, nee Rodrigo Borgia, manipulated his and his illegitimate brood's way to the top of the European food chain using whatever means necessary, and their rise to power makes for interesting reading. However, Mr. Puzo, and Ms. Gino tell the story in a style that never seems to fit history, historical fiction, or romance, and so becomes a hodge-podge of what may be the worst of all three. The history is incomplete, the fiction is plodding, and the romance is overblown. I finished the book because I love Vatican skullduggery, and it served as airplane and hotel reading, but as much as I'd recommend someone read about the Borgia's, I'd never recommend anyone do it with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential but Fell Flat","review":"This novel had great potential but if fell flat for the characters were not richly developed and dialogue seemed flat. The historical era could have lent itself to so many fascinating stories, but instead we got wars and alliances, in a chronilogical series, with little enrichment. A few famous characters were integrated into the plot, but I don't know why for they were never well developed into the story. We know no more about them now then did before reading this novel. I never felt as if I was there in the story and I never really felt for the characters. It was a slow read and the end was so sadly predicable, all loose ends tied up neatly. I adore Mario Puzo's work, but this was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment of historical proportions.","review":"What a profound & shocking disappointment this attempt at historical fiction has turned out to be for me. I can but hope that the blame falls on the inept hand of editors & an incompetant co-author. Tragically, Mario Puzo's last book is also his most flawed & forgetable.A choppy & inelegent style; flat & underdeveloped characters; descriptions of settings that are less interesting than the back of your average box of breakfast cereal.And perhaps worst of all...historical inaccuracies -- especially glaring & obvious in a supposed work of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"very interesting development of the story. but not as good as the original godfather or even the \\"sicilian\\". readable though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe it","review":"I don't know how much of this book was written by Mr. Puzo and how much by Carol Gino, but definitely was not the style of Mr. Puzo, the book tells us the story of the Borgia family, but consider that family as a mafia family like Omerta or the Last Don, I really don't think so, if you read it as as history book may be you will like it (if is true what is written in the book, because it is impossible to know what a person thinks, you will understand this if you read the book), but is not a thriller, it won't invite you to read it unless you want to know the end of the story.At the end of the book, is just that, but of course if it is a true story and that is his end you can't do anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Borgias!","review":"If you're interested in the ultimate fates of the Borgia pope and his four children (e.g., how did Cesare meet his end?), this book might be a good read on three or four pages. But if your are interested in absolute historical accuracy, go somewhere else. Puzo takes one of the most notoriously rapacious killer families in medieval Italy and turns them into a \\"sure they did some bad things, but they had reasons of the hearts to do them\\" people...not even one mention of Lucrezia Borgia poisoning someone...I mean, Hello!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL PROJECT","review":"This book is not a traditional \\"Mario Puzo\\", but it is good. History, religion, blood, betrayal - what else do you want. Very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointing","review":"This book had the makings of something special. The Borgias are an original mob family. Instead of owning a territory or even a city...they owned nations and religions. In the hands of Puzo? WOW!I don't know at which point Puzo stopped writing and Carol Gino picked up. I can only guess that Puzo didn't get very far and/or the editors made a terrible mess of what was left. The story has absolutely no depth, and the characters have even less. The story, if one can call this narrative a 'story', is more of an outline than anything else I can describe. One can almost imagine the bullet points preceding each paragraph. I desperately wanted the early overview chapters to be a foundation upon which a masterful \\"Godfather\\"-like story would rest.Instead, I became desperate to put the book down. And so I did.Quite simply, this book is unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading!","review":"This is another good book from Mario Puzo aptly finished by Carol Gino! I was not familiar with the Borgias at all prior to reading this book which is probably an advantage. It may be a disappointment if you come with that historical knowledge. The story is fast-paced, the characters well depicted (quite similar to the Corleones in more ways than one though). A bit too many graphic sexual themes at times, overshadows the point of the chapter! Good read though and a nice change in era :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Typical Puzo","review":"I have to say I rather like Puzo's books \\"the Fourth K\\", \\"The Sicilian\\" and \\"Omerta\\". I thought this would really be the crown of his career ... we're talking about the Borgia's here. To my dismay this book just doesn't cut it. Dare I say it's pretty boring! Very slow and quite repetitive in the acts in the book this is quite lackluster. Do yourself a favor wait for the paperback if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best book.","review":"Not his best book, because Puzo violates the first rule of writing, \\"Show it; don't say it.\\" This makes it impossible to maintain tension or character development. You are told Lucretia repents, but never see it. This book, is more a popularization of history rather than a novel. It reads like \\"Everyman,\\" a morality play where characters lack depth and walk through their lines. It's episodic: no drama, no melodrama. He's a great novelist, when he writes about what he knows; but here, he's writing about what he doesn't know, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIODEGRADABLE","review":"I was compelled to finish this book!Two chapters into \\"The Family\\" it occurred to me that it was in fact the worst thing I had ever read! And so, I simply had to get to the end to enable me to declare with veracity how appalling it is. I don't know how old Mario Puzo was when he worked on this book but it reads as though it was written by a 12 year old of average ability - for the palate of peers. Cardboard characters, adolescent intrigue, a plodding and disjointed plot.The best thing about this book I discovered, is that the paperback is biodegradable, and so I had no qualms in hurling it into the Irish Sea from a ferry...an act which gave me considerably more pleasure than reading the thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and disgusting!!!","review":"This book was so disgusting I couldn't even finish it! What got me particularly got me was Lucrezia and Cesare's incestuous relationship that I found so terible. What was Puzo thinking when he wrote this piece of garbage! I found none of the characters the least bit likable or sympathetic, unlike the characters in The Godfather & Omerta. When the book mentioned that thet were trying to protect themselves from invasion, I couldn't help but wish they would get overrun by invaders. Terrible characters, terrible, context, in fact I wish I could've given it ZERO stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Puzo's Best","review":"This was not Puzo's best work, that much is for sure. Found myself flipping through pages as the plot droned on and on and on. The incest was disturbing, to say the least. I just really did not enjoy much of this book.

Doug & Ray weren't able, legally, to actually quote from the sessions, but their recreation of the tone, atmosphere and events of the sessions is fascinating. Using 3rd person prose alone, they've been able to illustrate the muse that brought forth the music. You get a feel for the personalities and troubles, pains and pleasures. Given what Doug & Ray were allowed to do, they've done well. This is a most entertaining book, and it offers the best look at a confusing and nearly final chapter of the career of the Beatles.

I would say it is better than some but worse than some others.Overall, if you can get it for 3 bucks or less I would say take a chance and see it. Just watch it with an open mind. I'm not going to give it one star because I knew what I was buying. Just be warned, this is not a great film by any means. If you want a good hijacker movie go see Delta Force with Chuck Norris."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN","review":"Save the money...Mediocre performances and graphics...go watch AIR FORCE ONE...literally the same thing.

Good focal length and decent aperture minimum and maximum. Sigma is definitely a good brand for beginners or people who have a low to mid-ranged budget. The only thing bad is the heaviness/bulkiness of the lens and the AutoFocus is louder than most.

Every shot is sharp. The only issue is the macro switch which is difficult to move at times.I tried shooting at f4 and the result is not as sharp but at f8 is where this lens shine. The lens feel is quite acceptable for it's price. I reccomend this lens because of it's value for money and acceptable performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the Canon. This is cheap, cheap, cheap.","review":"Based on the reviews here at Amazon I bought this lens. Within 5 minutes after it arrived it was out of the box and I was shooting, but I was extremely disappointed. It looks cheap and feels cheap. The zoom operation is stodgy and for the life of me I had a hard time getting nicely focused, hand-held pictures. I knew every time I used this lens I'd end up hating it, so I wrapped it back up and ordered the Canon. That arrived last night and there is absolutely no comparison. The IS USM version costs a little over $500, but it's worth it in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP.","review":"Seriously. Right out of the box I was impressed. It came with a lens hood, bag for the lens and it really made you feel like you bought quality. I attached it to my camera and right away I noticed vignette, back focusing, noisy focusing and over saturation. I could have gotten a bad copy but, it was enough to make me send it back that day. This is my personal experience. I'm not saying all SIGMA 70-300s act this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"trip ruined","review":"I bought this lens several months before a family trip to Alaska know I would want to shoot some wildlife there. The lens worked fine for the first few months I had it, but low and behold, it crapped out in the middle of a 6 hour wildlife tour, leaving me with a load of lousy photos and ample frustration. A family member ended up getting much better pictures using a $150 point and shoot. I've since emailed the company 3 times never to receive so much as even a reply, much less any assistance.I know you get what you pay for, but a company should at least stand behind it's products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance.

The price is unbelievable.The lens even comes with a case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price","review":"This lens looks and feels very solid, with a nice matte finish. The zoom seems to do really well up to 250mm, and then does okay up to the 300mm. If you got more money go with something that has image stabilization, if not this is a great lens for the price. And using a tripod with a wireless remote will prevent any blurring or shake at the higher ranges, and get the sharp image you want. The macro seems to work well - some people have complained of it locking in that mode, but just read the directions and it should work fine. This is better than a non-APO lens... worth every extra dollar. Comes with a lens hood and case to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but only in daylight.","review":"This lens works with a tripod and clear daylight.

This lens is very limited, needs a tripod and tends to get very soft in the corners. furthermore, it tends to distort color and give everything a brownish hue. The bokeh is crude and although I gave it 3 stars in the construction, portability and value for price, I eventually graded it 1 star in the overall, because if the glass ain't right then nothing is."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT lens for the price!","review":"I never use auto focus or image stabilization and get great shots. After reading these reviews I bought these lens and was very pleasantly surprised. As with ANY brand name lens of this long focal range there are greater chances of blurring not because of the build of the lens but because the longer and greater the zoom the more magnified the effects of camera movements resulting in blurred or soft pictures if you don't brace yourself while shooting. I have many images at the longest (300mm) range for this lens that are sharp and beautiful that I didn't expect after reading the rest of the reviews. I completely recommend these lens and I would buy them all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best telephoto lens at $200!!","review":"The lens offers superb sharpness and colors at the 70mm end, but when it goes to 300mm, it starts to have some minor sharpness issues around the borders as well as some chromatic aberrations. But none the less, this lens's sharpness and speed definitly exceed its price(totally). The lens's Macro feature is also a nice addition.*ALERT to canon users: The lens i got started to make \\"error 99\\" issues on my Canon XT after 20-30 days of purchase(although it produced some amazing pictures within that time period...). I think the problem originated when I switch a Canon lens (while it's set to a very low f-stop) to this Sigma lens(which has f/4-5.6). Anyways....Be careful when you switch alot between Canon and Sigma lenses, because someday this lens might fail on you....This may be that I got a bad copy of the lens...or just that I messed up my camera somehow..But the extraordinary performance of the lens(as well as the price) definitly deserve its 5 stars rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigma 70-300 Motorized Zoom lens for Nikon DSLR","review":"I wanted to upgrade to a longer zoom from my Nikkor 55-200mm lens, and it sounded like this was going to be a great substitute for the Nikkor 70-300 zoom lens which is way more expensive. Out of the box it looks and feels great, and the magnification is excellent. However, I hadn't realised how much difference the VR - vibration reduction - on the Nikon makes. I take a lot of handheld sports and landscape shots. The sigma lens produced photos that just weren't clear enough for me. There was a lot of blurring, presumably from camera shake. This was unacceptable so I had to return it. I'll just have to spend the extra $$$ on the Nikkor with VR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigma 70-300 Zoom Lens","review":"only had lens a short time. it has takes night pics without flash. which is a plus at sporting events. have not used all feaures of lens , but overall i am satisfied with the performance.this lens will see alot of use in the future for diffrent photo applications. does not add alot of weight unlike my 35mm slr lens did to the canon t-50 camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the money and for the job...","review":"Not much to say actually... buy this lens, you won't be sorry... it'll do the job, and you won't spend a lot ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No bargain!","review":"Well built, quick to focus, quiet but not quite what I expected. At full zoom, picture is washed out. With MACRO pictures, center of picture is out of focus while periphery is in focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inexpensive zoom telephoto lens","review":"While this lens is not a pro lens by any means it does absolutely what you will need it to do in a variety of photographic situations and settings. No hand held telephoto lens will ever give you crisp clear shots (a chief complaint made in other reviews of this lens), but a serious photographer using a telephoto lens knows it has to be stabilized with a tripod or monopod to prevent camera shake and fuzzy pictures. For a $200 lens in the 70-300mm range this lens beats its Canon name brand equivalent with ease. Construction of this lens is better than the Canon and the Macro feature is something that the Canon lens lacks. I've used this lens in a variety of situations - sports photography, portrait photography, and landscape/nature photography - and it's never disappointed me. Another thing that impresses me with Sigma is that they include a lens hood and lens case with every lens they sell - Canon won't do that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lense hands down","review":"I have had this lense since I started shooting.

At 300 mm on a tripod mounted Konica Minolta Maxxum 5D, I was amazed at how the Sigma lens was noticeably sharper on my test subject (the front page of our daily paper) than the Minolta lens.

Very nice touchWould highly recommend the Sigma products"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have never been more disappointed and frustrated with a piece of equipment before. I can honestly say I hate this lens. Maybe when I was first starting out it was okay but now that I want more and demand more out of my camera this isn't cutting it.Most of all, the focus is utterly terrible. Not only is the automatic focus s l o o o o w....... But it doesn't matter if I'm shooting at 70mm, 300mm, or if my shutter speed is 1/1000 I can NEVER get a tack sharp photo from this lens. Apart from this, the color this lens produces is muddy and dull and not easy to correct in post processing because when you try, the photos just look fake. My opinion.I guess I learned the hard way. Next time I will save my money and spend it on a trusted brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"One year and 5 days!","review":"I've had this lens for one year and five days. Not a great deal of use.

Though it was realitively inexspensive it surprised me in it's clarity /sharpness. Yes there is a bit of a halo at 300mm but not that bad. The auto focus isn't that great but is just ok. I use manual focus most the time anyway. All in all it is very good for most work and you can't beat the price. It is heavy enough to require a monopod for steadiness to aquire the sharpest shot. Good purchase if on a limited budget like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value!","review":"Great results with my 7d, autofocus is a bit slow and loud, but it has served me well shooting wildlife and motorsports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Picture When it Works!","review":"This lense would be great if it would only stop breaking.

This book challenges every assumption and concept that I have ever had and delights me in the sheer, radiant and carefree expression. This book does not play into the hands of convention or popular concepts about enlightenment as the whole experience of awakening and non-duality is expressed so finely. The writing is as light as a feather and falls into no traps of didactism - all is breathtakingly open - often leaving the reader in a flat spin with nowhere to go, nowhere to hide but with a beautiful wry smile stretching from ear to ear.A book to dip into and to dip into and to dip into - long after many \`other' books will doubtless have shrunk in attraction. The narrator or \`voice' is nowhere to pin down and is expansive and unpredictable as the weather.

Using a variety of literary techniques, the author reminds the reader, again and again, that consciousness is really all that there is.

But there are other nice songs in the album that make it a good recommendation. This train... is pretty good stuff, and silverlake is good. The variety of the album is quite wide too, with a mixtures of styles and tempos.It is a perhaps a problem that they have had some absolute classic albums before this in Raintown and When the World knows your name, and so it is very hard to match the quality of these.

Bread's original studio albums are all equally excellent. The difference from the BEST OF albums is that you get to hear more James Griffin songs, because most of the \\"hits\\" were penned (and sung) by David Gates. Songs like \\"Down on My Knees\\" and \\"Just Like Yesterday\\" have the unmistakable Griffin signature.

Most of the material is solid, and there are a few outstanding tracks like Pyramid of Cheops. The vocals are handled by Mike Verscara, who shows himself to be a competent, if not outstanding singer.

I expected a gripping read. After all, the memoir covers a period of Denby's life when he lost his wife to divorce and $800,000 to the stock market bubble. Denby hints at the personal devastation he experiences, but is far too guarded to allow the reader to feel the true depth of his turmoil. At least this reader. The book also lacks focus. Included are portions of movie reviews, re-worked New Yorker interviews with Henry Blodgett and descriptions of 'fabulous' parties held by Sam Waksal, the founder of ImClone. I found it hard to have empathy for Denby, who comes off as a name-dropping wanna-be rich guy who still hasn't learned his lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting look at a self-absorbed, humbled investor","review":"This is an interesting look at a self-absorbed and humbled investor who fell for the allure of the markets and the get-rich-quick mantra of the late 90s. It chronicles, cliched though it is, the rise and fall of a man's portfolio, along with his ties to some of the more notorious corproate crooks of the past few years. It is worth 4 stars if only because the author is remarkably candid about his greed, his desire for quick riches through the market, and his admiration and jealousy of the 'rock star' CEO embodied in Sam Waksal.There's not much original in here, or interesting beyond that rare candor. Candor, however, is a rare quality in writers, and such makes this an interesting trifle of a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please...","review":"As a title, \\"American Schmuck\\" may have been more apt. Rarely has there been a more incisive portrait of the effete, weak, narcissistic and self-indulgent New Yorker than this book.Denby is unwilling to recognize the American disease of conspicuous consumption that has left this culture morally bankrupt and spiritually empty.Only an American in the 21st century would think accumulating wealth and possessions could justify his existence.If you must read this, get a library copy.

It is hard to muster any pity over his extreme immaturity (at age 59) in pouring his savings into the Gen X internet bubble. Despite his divorce, Denby.... has always been and is still... married to an empty pursuit of celebrity, Wall Street, Hollywood, and surface glitz.

A number of songs on here discuss the life of a fictional character, some being rather childish yet at the same time likeable. Many tracks also feature some sort of horn, also. I would most recommend the song \\"Fade Away\\", which has a unique beat and an almost circus-like off key horn melody which is slightly eerie yet enjoyable. Aside from this song, there are numerous other great incomparable songs, a strange booklet, and interesting lyrical features. I would recommend this album to any Blur fans out there, as well as those of any rock genre.I recommend:StereotypesCountry HouseCharmless ManFade AwayTop ManThe UniversalMr. Robinson's QuangoHe Thought Of CarsIt Could Be YouErnold SameGlobe AloneEntertain Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits A Plenty","review":"This has got to be Blurs most commercial album to date.

The following year the band followed up with \\"The Great Escape\\", which was at once a departure from their usual work as well as a rehash of previous material. (A good example of the former is \\"The Universal\\", and for the latter check out \\"Top Man\\", which is really just a slowed-down \\"Tracy Jacks\\".) You could tell they were running out of ideas with this album, but it doesn't stop you from listening to it with the same enthusiasm as their previous CDs. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.

When The Great Escape was released in 1995, it was hailed as the defining English record of the mid-1990's. However, when it became fashionable to adulate Oasis's brand of moronic, derivative pub-rock, it also became fashionable to trash intelligent, original music and this album bore the brunt of that. Although it's certainly much darker and demented than Parklife, it's all about the songs...Stereotypes, Best Days, He Thought of Cars, Yuko and Hiro, and the amazing The Universal. A great album that and the end of Blur's all-English phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blur can write some of the best hooks I've ever heard.","review":"I bought The Great Escape after I bought Blur (the album with Song 2). The Great Escape has a much cleaner sound than the new Blur, but the hooks and group dynamic is (or was) still there. The whole album has a theme of reflection and sadness that I think the band tried to fit uniformly from song to song, and I beleive this forced a lot of the weaker tracks. Either a song is a pitying commentary on these lives of longing or makes a satire out of a chracter's unhappy situation. You can tell the band ran out of ideas in spots. Track for track the album has a high-hook-content, but sometimes they try too hard for that single (Something I think they grew out of on the latest Blur album). America is missing out on great pop singles, it's too bad they sound so British."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive and awful.","review":"After the era-defining and diverse Parklife album, Blur went on to create the Great Escape. Somewhat cynical in tone lyrically, it is clear to see a band on the brink of implosion with the excessively perky arrangements. The lead single Country House was released on the same day as Oasis's Roll With It. Oasis made it to the number one spot subsequently winning the 'battle'. And rightly so, Country House's smirkiness was not what the public wanted and they preferred Oasis's (then) working class authenticity. Overall, Th Great Escape is an over the top, theatrical mess and completely grating. Blur ended up releasing 1997's selft-titled album which, stylistially, was a complete reverse of The Great Escape and saw them embracing American indie-pop amongst other genres.

She does not discount the enormous feelings associated with depression, nor sugar-coat how serious depression can affect one. Rather, she leads sufferers gently to how thoughts and beliefs keep us from authentic living, causing a spiral into depression. Then she shows how crucial it is to know God's truth in order to counteract the lies we believe. Ultimately, Leslie Vernick gives hope in how depression can be used in one's life for good.

He definitely worked on it, and the outcome sounds very good in this album. He does practically all the singing.Overall, if you are any type of rock listener, this CD will get you interested.

Well make that three reasons: the third one being I like hardcover first editions. But I found a novel which completely intrigued me. Set in a world I don't really understand (but which I see from the newspapers and magazines like Tatler does still exist) I felt that Richard Mason's novel drew me into it. His characters are real people, despite their superficial glamour. And his handling of suspense is wonderful. So whatever the hype says, believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this if you're busy....","review":"The Drowning People is definitely not a book for those with hectic pressurised lives - the strain of putting it down has made me late for more than one meeting. A gripping, thoughtful narrative, this is no conventional pot-boiler - but it draws you in like one. Absolutely couldn't put it down; loved the way it took me into a world (smart young London, as the English jacket copy says) of which I have very little experience. Characters are mad but interesting. Can't wait for Mason's next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savor the pages.","review":"Richard Mason's debut is not only startling in its depth of human motivation and emotions, it's also a page-turning mystery. As played out in the castles, manors and London drawing rooms of contemporary English aristocracy, The Drowning People is a stark testament that none of us is made of wood. When a wrong is committed, you and those in your world will-- each in their own agonizing way-- sink. But this is not the ordinary murder mystery that keeps the pages turning. Mr. Mason has created true literature. Imagine Cormac McCarthy gone to Oxford. Prose that curls around your lips and fingers as you slowly turn the pages. The Drowning People doesn't win you with a quick sledge hammer to the head. It lulls you in, like the harmless mare beckoning from its stall, right before you feel a back hoof in your teeth.pragwatt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Stuffy!","review":"\\"I daresay old boy, jolly good effort but bloody pretentious and snotty, not to mention a bit of a BORE I'm afraid.\\" Seriously, good writing often comes from simplicity of form and ideas not by overdone philosophycal drivel on human emotions or by theatrical writing structure and unusual adverbs.

It's the kind of book where none of the characters would ever watch tv if they could help it - the book is supposedly set in the future but is unapologetically Edwardian and irritatingly pretentious, especially the vain attempt at assuming the voice of aged authority. By the way, some of the 5-star reviews seem slightly suspicious, dontcha dink? Tireless self-pubicity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I had read somewhere that this book is like The Beach by Alex Garland and The Secret History by Donna Tartt. It's not. Richard Mason is either trying to write in a pseudo-gothic style for atmosphere, or he is simply writing the way he thinks that a grown-up should. The result is a poe-faced, archaic story with dreadful dialogue. The story is good, though and there are some nice literary devices, but he should have sat on it a while instead of letting the publishers hype him as a child genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convincing","review":"I picked this book up in the UK and was surprised to discover after reading it that it was being 'hyped' over there. It's a remarkably flat and ungainly read, the style erratic and curiously old-fashioned. The narrative is also very clunky and, for me at least, rarely came to life. I found the depictions of the emotional life of the characters almost painfully unconvincing. The author is young, but I can't see that this is something that readers should be expected to take into account. Maybe Mr Mason should do a little more living before writing about life. I'm afraid he hasn't really got the picture yet (and sitting in a study somewhere he probably won't)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYINGLY SOPHOMORIC!","review":"Do you know anybody in the 1990's that sent out telegrams?!

The one thing I wasn't expecting was for it to be boring and a bit long winded. Despite what the reviews say to me the book does sound like it was writen by a 20 year old which does cause a small problem since the narrator is supposed to be a 70 year old man remembering his youth. as for the plot - who cares? The ending is obvious and the people are so cold and self involved that it is impossible by the end to care what they've done to themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Debut","review":"Given the hype this first novel received, and its reputed prodigy author, I was disappointed to find this a cliche-ridden, poorly written work of fiction. I think many readers will agree with me and will find some of the conflicts that shape the plot hard to believe, especially ones that sound as if they belong in a Henry James novel and not in one written at the end of the 20th century.

As others have opined, this tome is impressive debut for so young an author. I became more and more involved with the plot and characters as I read, and at least at first, amazed at this young man's writing style. But the style that a first seduced me beame tiresome. With the characters also speaking in a no-longer spoken form, the question arises, \\"why didn't Mason set the story in a earlier century. And with the story set in the late 20th century, why did these people have to send each other letters to communicate? What about e mail, or better just pick up the phone.

I wanted to find a redeeming value in Ella, but at her essence there was nothing redeeming about her. The same for her cousin Sarah, and finally, James at 70 hadn't learned a thing. He was still juvenile. The writing, while at times slow, was still better than much of what is written, and the book did engage. But I learned nothing about the essential human nature and any redeeming value in relationships. That's too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"catchy premise in narcissistic, overwrought prose","review":"You can tell this was written by a talented adolescent who has been hearing, all his life, how gifted he is. Where he allows himself to get on with the story (about 1/3 of the manuscript), the plot is very good and the details compelling.

The author is young and you have to applaud the success at having a book published - the essence of first love so well documented and his attempt to tell it backwards from an old man's point of view.This is not a book for everyone. A nice rainy day kind of book, when you have nothing more pressing to do, except curl up and listen to the rain - which will certainly add to the mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it...","review":"Well, I for one enjoyed the book immensely. I thought Mr. Mason did a fine job writing as a 70 year old man, and I found the timeline believable. If the story begins in 1994, add 50 years to come to a close in 2044. I thought the book was moving, eloquent and passionate. As you move through the story, you are given details which help you feel and understand why each event may have occurred. Although I am not able to completely empathize with each character for likeable or dislikeable traits, this just made the story more interesting. Ultimately, I will recommend this story to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Novel I've Read This Year","review":"Intrigued by the variety of comments on Richard Mason's THE DROWNING PEOPLE, I bought it - and read it in about eight hours flat. Apart from the astonishngly polished prose, what I loved is exactly what about half the people on this page seem to have disliked: the fact that you know what's going to happen way before the end.Surely this is the POINT.

I see no sign of cynicism, no appreciation of the anachronism of the book, and if Mr Mason was aiming at Waughesque wit, he missed his target. Instead he has only re-inforced an image of upper class society as being unconscious parodies of themselves, and their love affairs scripted in cliche and overwraught emotion. I wish Mr Mason every success in any career other than writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull - Long winded - predictable - juvenile","review":"I have to admit that by the middle of this book I was skimming, hoping for some brief ray of light. There was so much boring fore-shadowing- chapters of predicting really bad things to come - that nothing short of mass murder could have lived up to that angst.

As a mystery, the book stumbles through a plot hobbled by static characters and (sadly) foreseeable developments in its story line. About midway through this tired mess, it becomes clear that rather than looking to follow a clever, or even interesting line of mystery, the author is content to clumsily try to articulate his views concerning heterosexuality. I found myself gritting my teeth as I finished this book, frustrated as much with its lack of substance and intelligence as I was by the blathering accounts of praise that its review pages were laden with. Save the $ and go read your favorite \\"Hardy Boys\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable drek","review":"I completely agree with the review from the Oregon reader, too. The Drowning People falls into that category of \\"young people writing\\" in which there are three epiphanies per chapter and high flown feelings all around; it gets very boring after a while. Also, the behavior of the youth strikes me as belonging to the 30s, not the 90s, so there is an utter lack of realism, too. Don't be taken in by the prologue, which makes the book look interesting. You will be disappointed by chapter 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"In truth it deserves a rating of zero stars","review":"There is a famous quote from a book review which says \\"this is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\\" After reading The Drowning People, I have come to understand exactly what that means. This profoundly disturbing and ineffectually told novel takes 220 or so pages to get to its rather grisly point and once gotten you'll wish it hasn't. I had to read this for a class I respect. Were that not the case no power on earth could have persuaded me to finish it. While I have read books I've disliked before, this is the first time I've literally felt the urge to physically rip the pages from the book and burn them immediately. For the love of all things, RUN SCREAMING FROM THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Drowning People","review":"Wonderful, engrossing story of obsession, love, passion, delusion, and guilt. Once grabbed by the first paragraph, you will find it hard to leave this book, which is designed as a confession with detailed descriptions and explanations of events fifty years past. My only knock is that, on occasion (rare occasion), the dialogue perhaps is a bit too clever. I found it a terrific read. I am awed and a little jealous of the talent of its very young first time author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Drowning People","review":"I was going to review this book until I read the one given by an Oregon reader on March 20 and quite frankly that says it all for me. Very disappointing read especially after all the hype. I was also very confused about when the story was supposed to have taken place - the diction used could hardly be described as modern. I hope the publisher doesn't indulge other authors just because of youth. I won't be fooled into reading another book that is so repetitive and longwinded. The story could have been told in half as many words and with half as much angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagey and rhetorical","review":"It may be that this novel fits into a mystery/fantasy genre which I'm not aware of or into, but I found this a very self-conscious read, and too removed from believable lives to be compelling. I didn't believe the murder, still less the 'games' played among the major characters. There are some good descriptive bits, but the whole tale is undermined by the annoying overdone style."},{"rating":"1","title":"The drowning reader...","review":"This is an ungainly hyrbid between a schmaltzy romance that doesn't charm, and a thriller that doesn't thrill. Add to that a tendency to pontificate on grand themes in a pompous, dated style and you've got a real disappointment. I almost got through it, determined to get my money's worth, but in the end I just couldn't. This is one annoying book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the story, stupid","review":"Once again neurotic critics jumped at the chance to criticize a work publish but the youngest literary phenom. From the opening lines to the closing passages from the perspective of the 21st century, Mason engages a reader in a strangely surreal and vaguely gentile journey through the mind of a man who has lived his life through people and places and not (so much) through time. I cannot remember when I last read a modern novel which used language as something undisturbed by so-called \\"real\\" modes of speech and diction. At times characterization slips and his technique has not been refined but the kid has a gift of telling a story. It's a good read and has echoes, I think, of henry james. Derrida discovered a while back that the author is dead. He only seems to be revived by tormented, still unpublished 40 year old critics who feel threatened by true genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book-- and stayed up all night to finish it.","review":"I first learned of this book by picking it up in an airport bookshop. I had read no reviews, and knew nothing of the author. Diving in, I was instantly hooked. I stayed up the entire night reading. I haven't enjoyed a book so much in years.So what if there are few references to the 90's? Do we need to hear about cell phones, pagers, the Internet, or Ricky Martin in a story like this? Some elements of life play across the centuries-witness the boost of interest in Mr. Shakespeare this year.I found the story fascinating, touching, tragic, horrifying, and heart-wrenching. I reread the first few chapters after finishing, relishing all the hints and clues I didn't catch the first time through. I'll look eagerly for the next effort from Mr. Mason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually good","review":"I read a lot of first novels - and have seldom encountered one as assured or mature as this. With practised ease, Mason handles a complex (but gripping) plot, and manages to look at large life issues with clear-headed insight. Loved his style, too - his words flow very easily. Almost gave it 5 stars, but am going to leave that for his second novel.... Let's just hope it's as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Drowning People","review":"I loved this book and could hardly put it down. The importance of maintaining personal integrity was the dominating theme. Also, the author illustrates through the lives of his characters how each choice we make can determine the whole entire course of the rest of our lives...even something as insignificant as choosing which socks to put on in the morning! The story was emotionally draining, as would be expected of a tragedy. But the writing was beautiful. Richard Mason has a beautiful command of the English language. I enjoyed reading this book as much for the aesthetic experience as to find out what was going to happen next in the character's lives. I am eagerly awaiting more works from this promising young (22 year old) British author! However, I will take in some lighter reading in the meanwhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating characters; nicely written; absorbing story","review":"To use an old cliche, \\"I could not put this book down.\\" The characters intrigued me with their constantly changing emotions and relationships. I was most interested in Ella. At first she seems nervous and unstable. However, the reader soon learns that she is just haunted by her past and unable to live up to the expectations of her aristorcratic family. Then she finds James and she thinks her troubles are over. These two people start a love affair that is so profound it possesses their very being. The depth of this love went so far that Ella made James prove his devotion to her in a bizzare manner.This action is the catalyst to a mystery that will keep the reader hanging on until the very end of the book.I think Mr.Mason will go far with his novel writing if the rest of his books are anything like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm drowning in boredom - is it finally over???","review":"I am not a big fan of English film and perhaps that's the reason I didn't really like this book. It just kept going and going and going. I found so many areas extremely boring but I always (well almost) finish a book once I start. There was not enough story for the length of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"This book was at times slow moving, and the detailed descriptions were often repetative and frustrating. Despite this, I could not stop reading it. The story was haunting, and worth the wait. The slow pace seemed to fit the main character's slow revelation of what had taken place. Although I did figure out the ending before the author gave it away, I don't feel it was too obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written. I couldn't put it down.","review":"I thought this book was wonderful. Other readers have complained about the confusing timeline. On page one of chapter one, it says \\"June 1994; almost 50 years ago.\\" Obviously the story takes place in the future with the narrator remembering events that happened in our present time. I will agree with the readers that complained about the author's use of unneccesary words. I found myself skimming portions of the book just to get past what I thought was not important. I also could not sympathize with any of the major characters. They were all pretty unlikable except of course for the one whose death started the spiral downward for the main characters. However, I feel that this book is definitely one of the better ones that I have read and I would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and difficult to put down.","review":"James was a naive and gullible young man but I still enjoyed reading his story. I thought both Ella and Sarah were pretty evil women. Even though James kept telling us how wonderful Ella was, her actions did not speak of goodness, but selfishness and self absorption. It was a sad day for James when he got mixed up with that family. He should have run in the opposite direction at the sight of either one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Debut","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The characters were solidly drawn and the plot was quite interesting, if not altogether unpredictable. The structure of the novel was interesting, but left some loose ends since the audience of the narrator was never revealed. Still, it was entertaining and all the more impressive considering the youth of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, this is the 40's calling, we'd like our book back...","review":"Sorry. This book should have been set in the 40's. Mason makes no references to anything 90's (no technology, culture, etc.) and no one in this era talks the way these people do! I also thought there was no drama in it, you know what's going to happen at the end 3 chapters before you get there. I felt sorry at first that everyone is saying he only got the publicity based on his looks, but after reading this, I'm afraid I have to agree..."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's got the talent, But......","review":"So this kid is a good looking British with just 20 years behind his back, can he write? Not convincingly. For a 70 year old man, he faults in that. The story was stretched to the limit, how much more could you tell? Bantam is quite a fool I must say :)I would rather give this book 3 stars, but the current average of this book is too high, so I'd prefer to drag it down to its reasonable rating in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating though also run-of-the-mill","review":"oh dear, I was taken in by the hype. I'm afraid this is the kind of mass-produced, pseudo-intellectual novel which is giving British Literature a bad name. The atmosphere of the book is really annoyingly upper-class Englishness which wasn't even really realistic in the 1920s. The plot is fairly gripping but the content is stuck on \\"wisdoms\\" and grand themes which are actually rather banal. The characters you end up wanting to slap, the author's voice is pretentious and pompous . . . a useful doorstop though, so it had its advantages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pants, pants, pants","review":"I must say that this 'haunting' novel really did haunt me for some time. Rushing out, as I did, to purchase this bargain novel (10) I soon came to realise that I had found a flop. Now I feel that I can never trust the marketing of books again; the hype surrounding this naive author was ridiculous. Not wishing to sound too vulgar, I realised this morning that I had run out of toilet paper and decided that I had a worthy substitute sitting on my shelf. I believe that Richard Mason can learn a lesson from this; I hope he could rebuild a worthy reputation of himself in the future, because the kid does have some talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old, too tired","review":"I picked this up on the recommendation of a glossy magazine. I expected something fresh, sharp and young. But this book reads like something from the 1920s. The old man narrator is ponderous and given to flights of 'profound' observation - and the story of love tangles among the aristocracy seemed very dated to me, and not convincing. There are some well-drawn moments and scenes, but not enough for this to be called satirical or a 'comment' on the set it describes. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should have known better than to take my literary recommendations from a glossy magazine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...You are entering Dullsville","review":"Where was Richard Mason's editor? Asleep at the wheel, I would say. The paperback was 388 pages or so, and at least 200 of those could have been edited. We, the readers, would be far better for it. I've never read such a dull, boring, predictable, repetitious piece of fluff. I've no idea what the rave reviews on the cover were referring to...certainly not to this overrated first book. I will never pick up another novel by Richard Mason. Not if you paid me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway through I gave up, should've done it sooner","review":"Not the literate prose that so many reviewers have raved about, not at all realistic, and certainly not interesting! Also, what year is this taking place in? He's seventy, but his parents were teens in the '60's. Couldn't get a timeframe. Storyline? I'm sorry but the critics were amazed that this novel was written by one so young, but it's actually very clear after reading a few pages. Please do not compare this to Donna Tartt's novel \\"A Secret History\\". Now that is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the infrared remote controller instead","review":"I compared this product withSony Alpha RMT-DSLR1 Camera Remote (Black)for my new A550. I decided to go for the infrared remote control instead. The infrared remote can do everything the wired remote commander can do except one thing. If you want a shutter speed slower than 30 sec (bulb) buy the this product. If you don't require this function, buy the infrared remote controller instead. The infrared remote controller has the benefit that you can stand 10 meters in front of the camera and take a photo of yourself. There is also a 2 sec delay button, so you don't have to stand directing the remote when the photo is taken. Add to this that the remote is much cheaper and the choice is clear. There are also a bunch of playback buttons to be used when camera is attached to television set on the infrared remote controller, but I'm not using them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing and not imformative - A definite pass!","review":"I picked up this book because my company is looking at ways to use wireless technology as a business tool with our field sales reps.Despite the hype and promise that this book claims, I can honestly say that it was a complete waste of time and money.Try reading Cap Gemini Ernst & Young Guide to Wireless Enterprise Application Architecture by Korna or Wireless Internet Enterprise Applications by Sharma"},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful tool for business executives","review":"Wireless Data for the Enterprise is an invaluable resource to any manager looking to add wireless functionality to their organization. The book addresses both the business and technical aspects of identifying, developing and implementing wireless data solutions to improve the productivity of a mobile workforce. Unlike many books that tend to deal with the subject on only a conceptual level, Faigen and Fridman discuss the key issues facing wireless applications from a real world perspective, providing numerous cases studies and useful project execution guides. I would highly recommend this book to anyone considering undertaking a wireless project in their own organization, or who just wants to develop a better understanding of the application of wireless data communications in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrapped up with a bow and delivered to your doorstep","review":"Enjoyed the book immensly. Author(s) do an excellent job in outlining the issues and providing the necessary background as to how and why things developed and insight on decision points and future offerings. Author did not bite on the hardware red herring but stayed the course on issues and requirements. Only crticism was over marketing of Broadbeam middleware woven into middleware discussion. This is easily excused when compared with other \\"white paper\\" type offerings. Very easy reading, recommend for technical and non technical alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"your own personal walking tours of the city","review":"We just returned from Barcelona and used this wonderful guide to explore the city. The book begins with about 20 pages of general introduction to Barcelona and then gives 5 walks, separated by area: El Barri Gottic, Sant Pere and La Ribera, El Raval, Gracia and L'Eixample. Each walk takes about 3 to 4 hours (longer if you stop at recommended restaurants and attractions), and are as good as having a private walking tour. There are lots of interesting little stories about the city, the buildings and the people. We've used many of the books in this series and found BarcelonaWalks not quite as intimate and charming as others, but still very good. Also the book is getting older now so it is less reliable when it comes to restaurants and other venues, but we still enjoyed these walks very much. Each section contains a map (which does not name all the streets, which can be problematic) and a few balck-and-white photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Estupendo!","review":"Barcelonawalks is the best guide book I have ever come across.

Nevertheless, I was turned off by her continuous adoration of \\"white skin\\" while everything and everyone black or brown was given a negative connotation. It's a small aspect of the book, but it was enough to reveal the attitude of the author. I won't be purchasing anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I didn't particularly like this book. I read it because it was mentioned on the cover ofHarvesting the Heart, though I have two other books by this author that made no impression on me (to be honest, I think it was by mistake that I even had more than other one, especially since I don't recall reading either!). On the surface, I can see why this can be seen as similar to Jodi Picoult's work - the family drama, the court case... but the characters (other than the little girl), were not very real or endearing. And while the ending was in depth - it still wasn't satisfying. Mostly, it felt like a book carrying a heavy-handed feminist slant and was barely masked in the plot. I wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story","review":"this is my first sue miller novel and i have now ordered many of her other books. i found 'the good mother' brilliant, engaging and thought provoking. the author has a beautiful writing style with a spine tingling attention to detail. whether your heart breaks for the mother in this story or whether you believe she deserves everything she gets, this novel will evoke strong feelings and opinions. a very real exploration of motherhood and its complications."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't like the main character","review":"Even though I didn't like the main character, I did enjoy the read. Even though I kept thinking, what is she THINKING??Oh well, at least you can read this & see that your mother could be worse. I do enjoy Sue Millers books, she takes unique plots and does a pretty good job of drawing you into her world."},{"rating":"2","title":"so involving","review":"This was my first book I read in English.

It makes you think so much about how lives can be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy","review":"It's beyond me how this could have spent 6 months on the NY Times best seller list (there went their credibility)! Rated R (for sexual context). The main character who has a deep motherly love for her child, yet engages herself with a worthless man just for some lustful sex. A complete waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares.........","review":"I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it. I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point. There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance. While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue Miller needs to give readers some credit","review":"Who is her editor? The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say. I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to \\"get\\" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit.Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care what happened to the main characters","review":"I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall. I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it! I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away. I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo. I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic. But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it. The book was too flat! Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what? Like Leo was a good catch?)! I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story. Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars. I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring","review":"This book was so memorable that I got to page 200 before remembering that I HAD READ IT ALREADY! I didn't finish it the first time, either.She uses so much description that you get lost in adjectives and can't find your way out to the dialogue. I wanted to empathize with Anna, the main character, but she is just not likable. I didn't care enough about the characters to even read the book to the end.Unless you enjoy 10 page descriptions of irrelevant things, I don't recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story of sex and morality","review":"Sue Miller's story of a recently divorced mother of a 3 year old child raises moral issues regarding society's expectations of a good mother. Anna blooms sexually with Leo, but in the process \\"forgets\\" her child. The open acceptance of sexual relations and acceptance of the body leads to a clash between Anna's views and the views of her ex-husband. The novel tells Anna's story, but deals with perceptions of morality that trap too many people (men and women) today. You might be surprised who in your life thinks Anna is a good mother and who does not (and don't expect clean breaks on gender lines). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting...","review":"I couldn't put this book down! Miller has written a book that at times is troubling, and at times suspenseful, and ends on a shocking and sad note. No, I didn't respect the choices that the main character Anna made at times, and I think her character remained kind of stagnant and a little self absorbed throughout the book, but it was the premise behind the story that gripped me: Other people can and will decide for a child if a situation is deemed unfit.Was Molly's situation with her mother unstable or unfit based upon Anna's lifestyle and the two incidents that brought it all to question? Opinions will vary if Anna was indeed A \\"Good Mother\\", and for that reason I find this book extremely thought provoking and well thought out.A good, deep read."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"Not sure if this review will apply to all the books, or just one book.The books were in good shape except for the last one I received thatcame from international.

The doctrine contained in this book is specifically Mormon and contains LDS teachings about Jesus such as that He is not one with God (the Bible is quite clear that God is one see Isaiah 43-47, and Deuteronomy 6:4 for some examples), and that He had to come to earth to receive a physical body and be tested. The LDS church also teaches that Jesus is our older brother literally, and that Satan is his younger brother (as well as older than us)It's a great book if you are LDS and want a good picture of what the LDS church teaches about Jesus, but if you're a Christian who believes that the Bible is your source for truth, and want to know who Jesus is steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Lies","review":"What I have issue with is how anyone can write a history of the life of Jesus when there is NOTHING written about this mythical figure by a single contemporary.

I am not a professional contractor and this is the first time I have used a QuikDrive screw gun. I am using these screws to secure about 1000 square feet of 3/4 inch T&G subfloor. For me, the screw gun cuts the time to do this by about 60% and the wear on my body by even more. These screws are heavy duty screws - much more substantial than comparable wood screws you would buy at your average home improvement center. There are 2 downsides of note - 1) each screw pack is only 30 screws. Some people may find this to be too little per pack. I think it is just fine, but it does mean you are inserting new screw packs fairly often; 2) each box of screws only comes with 1 QuikDrive bit.

My 9 year old daughter wanted it pink as we saw in the picture here and on the package and we received another color. It was a light yellow color.

It's going to take her a few more books I believe before she gets over it. Another daring adventure, with some new characters and the introduction of formal schooling thrown into the mix. Definitely another fun addition to a great series that involves mysteries and a town full of fairy-tale creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and clever","review":"I've enjoyed reading \\"The Sisters Grimm\\", and recommend it.I particularly appreciate the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" references.One section had me laughing out loud, an unusual occurance (outside of a Stephanie Plum novel).

Several years before being discontinued the packaging had been changed from a cover with tapered tip to blunt. The product I received must have been years old. It is in the old packaging with the tapered tip, and actually goes on thicker and darker than expected for this color, probably due to its time on the shelf. The picture actually does show the packaging with the tapered tip, but they don't tell you that not only the picture, but also the product is from the archives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berry Satin: Great color, unexpected product","review":"I was initially put off when I first tried this product. The color 'stain' is really thin & watery, goes on like wet ink, and does not feel at all like regular lipstick in consistency. When you put it on, it can easily smear if you're not careful. It does dry quickly and once it dries, you need to apply the 'moisturizer' to seal in the color and keep your lips from feeling too dry. I reapply this coat a few times during the day for the moisturizing effect because the stain on its own feels really dry. However together, they feel fine and the 'stain' does last. I love the Berry Satin color. Minus 1 star: the container and applicator feel a bit flimsy and there is not much in each container. I got this set for ~4 dollars so not a bad deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Wella","review":"I couldn't find details about this Wella product.

But, many of the nuances of the show were forgotten, as well as some of the minor characters.

Looking back it was interesting to see how the \\"Nancy\\" character had a small role in the pilot, then eventually stole the show; how the main characters, Michael and Hope, were set-up characters (like anchors), while all the drama seemed to be going on around them. All of the exceptional qualities stand up over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAAAAMBULANCE","review":"Thirty Something was good for something back in the \\"me\\" days, but now it is a simplistic view of big babies in their thirties who are close to being devoid of character.

The manufacturers of the DVD are not at fault for the writing of the show--their product was in perfect form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray?","review":"A lesson in how to do things only halfway well. One of the best TV series, certainly of the 80's, and once out of the morass of music rights, they don't release it on blu-ray? Epic fail for a show that deserves to look its best. Look up \\"Mad Men\\" on Amazon, and see that the blu-ray version of season 2 sells for $9 LESS than the standard DVD version. So if the economics are not in the way, why do we have to settle for standard def DVDs? Thirtysomething was shot in 35mm film, and could have easily been mastered in the hi-def format. No wonder blu-ray is still a straggler. Until the studios figure out how to market it, blu-ray will remain a niche, unless it fades away forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying characters","review":"I have several shows still on vhs & after watching them this past weekend I remembered how annoying this show was. OMG!...it's almost unwatchable, I wanted to throw something at my tv. The \\"Hope\\" character is almost comical now. I think the reason they delayed this dvd release so long is they were hoping people had forgotten how bad this show really was, especially towards the end. Save your money.P.S. Michael & Elliot constantly playing games in their office then they wonder why their business failed...LOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming.","review":"I remembered this show as being quite good, but I'm halfway through season one and wondering if I can go the distance.The acting and writing are overdone. I don't mean that the characters are whiney and have issues, I mean that the characters are inconsistent, over-played, and come across as very artificial, very staged.There are some fun meta moments, such as dreams, animated photos, scenes replayed from different points of view, speaking to camera. There are some moments of genuine insight. There is A LOT of middle-class angst followed by a scene where the characters laugh at or question their middle-class angst, followed by more middle-class angst.I'm not sure if it's worth continuing. If aliens abduct my discs tonight, I won't miss them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in all its facets.","review":"This show was always meaningful to me. Watching Elliott and Nancy's divorce put perspective on my own parent's divorce from when I was a kid, watching the struggles of career taught those of us in college that our degree wasn't going to be instant success and happiness. Most of all though I will always remember Nancy's cancer. Ironically, Thirtysomething was in reruns on Lifetime when I was diagnosed with my own cancer. The night before my first chemo treatment they showed the episode where she was in remission and Gary died. I cried harder than I had since I found out. The images of Nancy ice skating and the relief were something I held on to, but the shock of Gary's death also served as a reminder that no matter what life is short and we need to appreciate every day we have. 14 years later, my show is back. If you didn't watch it on tv, don't miss it now. Quality like this is rare and should be cherished."},{"rating":"2","title":"D&#65533;j&#65533; vu ¿¿ Excellent!","review":"The 6th record of Dieter&#65533;&#65533;s Blue System project.

Even if you're not a fan but you're interested, this is a great album to hear first.The songs on this album range from mellow to punkish to even disco-like tunes--all in a way that is still noticeably Blur. Musically, the style seems sophisticated for the most part, though, as mentioned before, they do seem to dip in to the more daring, fun jives. Lyrically, Albarn is clever, witty, and overall entertaining. It's a refreshing combination compared to the [stuff] you hear on the radioBlur is a very fun band to listen to, and I highly recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a parody of pop ... you've gotta love it","review":"A dynamite album, with one great track following another. Girls & Boys and Parklife may be the two songs best known from this album, but equal are End of a Century, Badhead, London Loves, To the End, This is a Low, and ... well, why don't I just say that EVERY song is a classic? Those aforementioned \\"La la la's\\" ALMOST mask the sharp social commentary they're thrown between ... Parklife has a more youthful sound than MLIR (surprising, considering it came AFTER that album's release) ... Fans sucked in by \\"Song 2\\" may well say \\"What the hell?\\" to this, but Parklife is one of the few albums absolutely ESSENTIAL to any Britpop collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a great Britpop album from a consistantly brilliant band. It isn't however the best Britpop album of the 90's. That would be Pulp's unrivalled masterpiece Different Class. That album is in a class of it's own. And Parklife isn't the best British album of the 90's either (ok computer OF COURSE!). Get this, by all means get this straight away- it will actually make your life better- but get Different Class( and OK Computer OF COURSE!) first."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of blur's best","review":"Quite honestly, playing this album makes you want to like... Walk through the streets of the UK toting your guitar case headed towards band practice while wearing your union jack bearing leather jacket in the chilly november air. It's inspiring. While listening to it, you're wishing you could make music like this. I love blur. I think it's always been a close tie between them and oasis, but blur always comes out on top because of Albarn's voice. Definitely one of the best albums of the 90s, definitely one of the best in my personal collection, and definitely one of blur's best. you get this, you won't regret it and you'll play it everyday for about 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"It's unfair to measure every British band against the greatness of Radiohead. Don't get me wrong; Radiohead are very good, but the simple fact is they're still just a band. Like Blur.Or wait a second. NOT like Blur. Blur like to write cheeky, intelligent pop songs that you can nod your head to or shout out at pub sing-a-longs. 'Parklife' is a witty examination of working-class British life in the 1990's. This alone makes the album intriguing. Then you hear the songs, and you wonder, 'simply brilliant.'The best songs on this album are 'End of a Century', 'Badhead' and 'This Is A Low' (which does sound like Radiohead). A warning to American fans who have been raised on alternative-punk: take your mellow-pills and accept that music from other parts of the world is not only good, but in some cases better than the stuff your own country churns out. This is one of them. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that welcomed Blur back to me","review":"I had been eventually turned off by the posturing of Leisure and had given up Blur as being not very original, but when I heard Parklife when it was released I was immediately put in my place. These guys really were something else. They weren't singing about how there was no other way and telling you to just watch them play, but much more interesting observations on the drudgery of English life that seemed to actually be satirical instead of adolescent literality. Parklife is rock solid from start to finish and one of my favorite albums of the 90's. It absolutely deserves to be called a classic and should be so many years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Radiohead, but......","review":"There's good songwriting and a lot of talent here, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea. Somehow, it just doesn't work, and isn't a pleasant listening experience for me at all. Radiohead is one of my all time favorites, and this just doesn't compare. I'm not saying everything has to sound like Radiohead (thank heavens it doesn't), but like RH I'll give this album several listens to see if my opinion of it doesn't change. Right now, to my unaccustomed ears, it sounds like Clash meets Duran Duran with some late Beatles thrown in. Maybe a bit too much \\"British pride\\" for me. If you like that kind of thing, then by all means get this album. I will end by saying it's better than 90% of the music being made today,, having good composition, arrangement, and songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nothing but brilliant. A++","review":"The whole album is undoubtedly outstanding that it contained different music sounds of different period of time in england. please don't think it is just a common hit. if you listen to it in deep, you would know it has many messages inside.

The song appears to me to be ground breaking in its time and very catchy. The rest of the album is basically full of bombs - filler around the first track and its title track, \\"Parklife\\". Most songs are just a lot of sounds basically that have no substance to form a quality song. The others just aren't as catchy or pleasing as the first and fourth track on the album. For those that like it: well it's not my cup of tea but you are entitled to your opinions. If you really like and want to hear Girls and Boys and Parklife, just download them somewhere or buy the single... don't waste your money on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars","review":"Never in my life have i heard such a terrible album. First of all, it's annoying. Second of all, it's boring. It's not trendy, not unique...i can't find anything good about it. I picked it for $10 and i want my money back. I was hyped up about getting into Blur, hearing top stuff about them, but this was just a horrible experience. I'm not picky with music either...i barely throw back anything, and i listen to a huge variety of music including alternative rock, punk, ambient, electronic music, acoustic music, electronic music, doom/drone metal, jazz, blues, funk, rap, JEEZ the list goes on and i hope to never hear Blur again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danni Minouge Girl","review":"This is an excellent CD for fans and collectors to buy,the quality of sound is excellent also,and the songs are really cool too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"This book takes the reader into the world of a bright, yet mentally ill criminal defendant.

The direction, and acting, cinematography, costumes, and screenplay are the absolute best they can be. And Carter Burwell's score is the weave that holds all these elements together. I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been written about in other reviews here other than the main theme is one of the all-time great movie themes. This version of 'Danny Boy' is just outstanding too. If you're just starting to collect movie scores, 'Miller's Crossing' would be a good place to start building your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginations Running (Really) Wild","review":"No matter what the gender is, everyone acts irrationally in all of Homes' short stories. It is without rhyme or reason these characters exist to do whatever and to say whatnot. Each tale ends abruptly therefore it is up to the readers to compose their minds about each conclusion. Some are funny than others and all of them are quite bizarre. Extreme usage of adjectives and pronouns in narrating events among more than two people at one time can result in a mild confusion in regards to the actual speaker or doer. Nevertheless, it is a fast read of a collection of peculiar people and happenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Warped Stories","review":"A.M. Homes is a little warped--she's got a dark, twisted vision of contemporary life and that vision serves her well in this collection of short stories.

Homes, and also like the short story collection \\"The Safety of Objects.\\" But this one? Yuck! What happened? Either it was a rush job or she was just in a really foul mood when she wrote these stories, many of which are total head scratchers. If I wasn't puzzled I was totally repelled by the disagreeable characters in many of these stories. This collection was such a turnoff that I'll be thinking twice about reading anything else by her in the future. That's a shame, because I've enjoyed her novels very much, but there wasn't much of anything in here that was remotely enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle","review":"I *LOVE* short stories, but this book was so horrible that I couldn't even make it all the way through.

Though he died in the mid-eighties, his comments shed light on social issues commonly discussed today.

A wonderfully droll sense of humor gives this social activist ornery Episcopalian a great edge.

The story is told in present time flashback noir style-in keeping with Bogart, Mickey Spillane, and Perry Mason-through the eyes of Sam Cohen, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and William O'Neal, the FBI's deadly spy.Revolving around the story are various attractive characters with strong Black and Female parts that bring us to a very surprise ending.Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Point","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029NLK0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThe DVD functioned Ok. The movie however did nothing but drag along. Very boring movie.Not worth the DVD it is recorded on.I guess the movie title say's it all \\"HOLLOW POINT\\". There is no point to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has its share of mishaps but otherwise decend flick","review":"This movie is good. Not an oscar worthy, but, otherwise good enough film. There are moments where you will think \\"Yeah, like only one squad car is going to show up after a huge mafia shoot-out.\\" Or. \\"Why are the mob-bosses running away instead of halting their own henchmen's fire.\\". But, hey, the acting is good. The overall story is decent, and I love Donald Sutherlands witty sense of humor. All in all a satisfying movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"I saw this movie for the first time on hbo because in argentina it went straight to video stores, and I thought it was amazing! Donald Sutherland plays his roll gracefuly and John Lithgow is a perfect cold blooded villain. I finally got it on dvd and the extra features are very good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research but limited applications","review":"I would like to see new edition of this book that includes how the research can be applied to marketing, etc. Obviously the authors were very diligent, but some of the concepts evolved early in their research and no longer apply. For instance, the prospective demand for estrogen replacement therapy in aging women. Recent studies indicate higher incidences of cancer in women that take certain hormone replacements, thus a shock to the demand for these drugs. Let's get a revision and work with a marketing guru to apply these principles. Also, work with a new editor to make this more readable and less like a textbook. And lower the price and go to paperback, and maybe work with a reputable mainstream publisher like McGraw-Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"No product, No stars","review":"Product was never delivered. No explanation was ever given by Seller. Simple as that. I wouldn't waste my time ordering again from this Seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Steps of a master film composer...","review":"Well, just masterful and such a change from the average horror film score we were used to! Here we deal with a true \\"composer\\" in noble sense of the word, someone who truly knows who to write and not these composers who regard themselves as composers just by the simple fact of ownning a synthesizer and a Midi Home Studio... The rest of his scores are nothing short of remarkable, especially his latest one TITUS, truly a fantastic musical journey that enhances wonderfully the visionary reading made by its director Julie Taymor regarding Shakespeare's Play ( who happens to be Goldenthal's wife as well ). Nevertheless, PET SEMATARY is a superior horror film score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack!","review":"This is a wonderful score evil,and also very pretty.I saw the other people were mad the Ramones song is not on this Cd. You guys will have to buy the Ramones album Brain Drain from 1989 that is where you will find the Pet Sematary song plus my fave album from the eighties from them....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"The main reason I purchased this was because of the Ramones song, \\"Pet Sematary\\", which I thought would be included on this soundtrack. Much to my disappointment, it wasn't. I think that if this CD is ever re-issued, this error should be corrected.My opinion is that unless you absolutely HAVE to own everything connected to Stephen King, you can skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not very Good","review":"This was a very promosing album, however it turned out to be quite awful. The main reason for this is the exclusion of the track \\"Pet Semetary\\" by the world's first punk group, The Ramones. The track was written especially for the film on a request from Stephen King himself. I was overall very dissapointed with this album. The instumentals were tedious and were poorly composed by Elliot Goldenthal. This is unfortunate as most of his other soundtrack work is quite remarkable. I would advise you only to buy this soundtrack if you are truly a hard-core Stephen King fan and you enjoy bad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film; Terrible DVD Transfer","review":"I thought I had lucked out when I spotted this for sale on Amazon.

I have always loved kajagoogoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder","review":"This came out when I was in college radio. Unlike commercial stations which were limited to playing whatever the label released as a single, if we got a solid album in, we'd work every track we could. This means that consistent albums like Duran Duran'sRio, Squeeze'sSweets From A Stranger, the debut byA Flock Of Seagulls, the Psychedelic Furs'Forever Now, Bananarama'sDeep Sea Skiving, a couple of theGo-Gos'albums, Toni Basil'sWord Of Mouthwere all good for anywhere from four to seven tracks on our playlist over the course of six months after their release. We had no qualms about giving airtime to what the boring FM rock stations of that day might call \\"bubblegum\\".The debut by Kajagoogoo had an infectious lead single in \\"Too Shy\\" but everything else was pretty much just an album cut and we never went deeper than the one track on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Product","review":"The Alsop-Redmond Laptop Notebook Stand is a very sturdy and functional product. It doesn't wobble or make noise like some stands are notorious for doing. The only flaw with this particular product is that its design fails to accommodate USB or Headphone Jacks unless they are located in the middle of the laptop.

Quality product for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great notebook stand","review":"I was looking for a heavy, sturdy, and adjustable stand to hold my laptop. This stand qualified on all fronts and I think it's a great product. I didn't want some cheap plastic stand that would slide around if you bumped into it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice notebook stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and good quality, but sometimes tricky to move","review":"Does what it's supposed to as far as raising up the laptop screen. It's also made of quality materials and looks good. The only issue is that it can be tricky to move around with the laptop on the stand, since you have to be careful you don't change the angle or collapse the stand. Also be sure to lift the stand up when moving it, as the rubber feet slid off on mine and the adhesive streaked across my desk.Also as one reviewer said, large/bulky laptops probably won't work. I have a pretty standard sized dell lattitude d630, and that fits perfectly.. anything larger probably wouldn't work so great.Minor complaints though, and no reason not to get the stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie and sound track","review":"I loved this movie and would see it again. I was disappointed that it didn't get better reviews and was gone so quickly. I especially liked the song, Your Time Will Come and I have to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the movie, don't buy the soundtrack","review":"I first saw the original movie (Les Visiteurs) in my French class, so when the American version came out I was very excited to see what would happen. I wasn't disappointed, it was just as good as the original. And the soundtrack during the movie is very good, but by itself, without a screen in front of me, it leaves something to be desired. There are only a few tracks that are good, and they are quite short. The music is good, but only in the context of the movie, so buy the movie and enjoy the music along with the comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product - easy to carry","review":"good product. very stable. easy to carry with smooth top handle so it does not cut into your bare hand. has plenty of room around handles so u can wear gloves while carrying too."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy to own","review":"love that it is light and delicate.

We were not familiar with the characters -- apparently they have been much beloved comic book characters for decades in Europe -- but had no trouble jumping right in and enjoying the movie.

They were easy to use (only one programming mode), reliable, and durable. This model is a step down from them. There are several programming modes, making the instructions more complicated and causing much doubt as to which mode is operative and whether or not the programming is successful. In addition, it is too easy to make unintentional contact with the switch when programming, causing mistakes. I have learned the idiosyrcracies of this timer and can use it now. I don't understand why Intermatic didn't leave well enough alone and continue the older, simpler model.

Now for the bad news: I needed to install a new one for my front lights. Installation number one: it would not program properly ... after dozens of attempts, I assumed it was defective (remember, I have had my backyard unit for years, so I know what I am doing and know that these units work; or at least did) and uninstalled it and returned it. As I write, I have reinstalled two more and they simply will not program. Lights go on and off irregularly and the programming you think you have entered may or may not work.

However, after recently installing two timers and having to return them for replacements, I have concluded that the current defects were not a fluke. The quality control on these timers has apparently been abandoned. The first timer wouldn't turn on, the second timer literally fell apart when I was pushing it back into the electrical box, and the third timer (soon to be returned) has developed a mind of its own...turning on and off when it feels like it. Not only do these timers waste consumers' time to install and having to return them to Amazon (great return policy), it is a safety issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to use","review":"My landlady installed this timer for the exterior lighting. My problem: I can't figure out how to even make the blasted thing turn the lights on. I downloaded the manual, which specifies that the timer will operate like a light switch once it is in automatic mode. But I can't get it into automatic mode - when you turn it on, it is in \\"being programmed\\" mode and you have to program it before you can do anything. I've tried both ways to program it suggested by the manual but the steady red light indicative of automatic mode simply doesn't appear.The profusion of modes in this innocuous-looking little timer (manual, automatic, rapid programming, 24-hour self programming, program review) is a user interface nightmare and far too complex to express effectively with a single red light. Without the manual it's unlikely you could even figure out that most operations are done by depressing the time dial. Advice to the manufacturer: next time do some usability testing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Timer. Difficult to use and unreliable","review":"I bought this four years ago and have had nothing but problems. Three problems:1. EVERY time there is a power outage you need to reset the schedule.2. It is difficult to set and understand how to program it. Several times I've confused AM and PM causing my light schedule to not work properly.3. Even when I know I set the timer correctly, it doesn't always work properly.I'm now on the hunt for a new mechanical timer that hopefully works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Timer worked reliably, so far as it is designed to, for a year or so and then began to turn on the light that it controlled earlier and earlier each cycle---clearly defective. Of course, the warranty expired two weeks before this began happening, so I am in the market for a new timer.Reliability issues aside, I will not be purchasing another timer of the same model due to the fact that it was a pain to have to regularly reprogram the timer to follow a dusk-to-dawn schedule anyway (it's a moving target), so I am now searching for a somewhat higher quality, self-adjusting timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Always Break","review":"I'm not sure I've ever owned one of these that has lasted for at least two years.

The front looks cheap and flimsy.The most frustrating was after the installation, I have had trouble controlling on one of the timers and this means I have to go through the effort of replacing it, which is a hassle.

It was easy enough to install, but its operation as far as programming the on-off cycles is exceedingly tedious and counter-intuitive. Even having done it three or four times, I would still need the instructions. But for a once-per-year activity I could forgive that, but it broke this year.

At first I though they were OK even if they were cumbersome to set up. But only one of the five provided reliable service for more than two years. None would work reliably with CFLs beyond the first week. I didn't realize how much better a wall switch timer could be until I bought Aube T1071. Now I wonder why I ever bothered with this Intermatic. When I read some of the reviews praising the Intermatic EJ351C, I have to wonder what other products it is being compared to. The Aube is so much more logical and easier to set up. The caveats on the Aube T1071 are:1) it requires a neutral wire in the electrical box2) it requires a \\"decora\\" switchplate (switch plate with large rectangular opening)I do not have enough experience yet to say how longlasting the Aube is, but just in terms of set up and operation, it is far superior to the Intermatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intermatic EJ1351C","review":"Works just like the 20-year old one that it replaced, but looks better because the old one had yellowed.These switches don't work well with the compact fluorescent lights that I had been using, so after I replaced the timer, I replaced the CFL outdoor lights with LEDs.

The photographs are beautifully done, but the contents of the pictures were so safe and conservative and devoid of personality. Not what I would expect from a book dealing with French taste -- which appeals to me usually for it's bravery and panache in it's interior design.

If they mixed it with cotton, it would stay more square, but then it wouldn't be 100% fiber. I am happy with the performance and I feel like my skin is smoother after only 2 days. I will use it daily, and I am happy with it!UPDATE: October 17, more than a month of using this daily and it is still in excellent condition and my skin is SILKY.

This is not a recommendation to you to read this book: this is an ORDER to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says","review":"I was so thrilled to see a book on the topic by a Christian writer so I bought this book as soon as I saw it. Upon reading it though, I was quite disappointed. The author tells lots of stories but misses many opportunities. She never defines what the problem areas are. She never defines how to overcome them. She never notes how to avoid problems. Instead it is pretty much of a \\"hey, I have a great relationship with my mother- and daughter-in-law, but, honey, it's too tough so don't you expect to repeat whatever I did.\\" This could have been a great book focusing on biblical stories and all, but she didn't accomplish it, even if it doesn't focus on mothers with married daughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was hoping for more","review":"It is a good book, very basic. I can see it mostly helping those people who don't seem to see the world through others eyes. I was looking for more solid advice.

Maybe, but I would recommend Leadership and Self Deception by the Arbinger Institute first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware that it is written from an evangelical Christian perspective","review":"I was looking for help dealing with a problematic mother-in-law relationship, so I ordered this book. I found reading some of the personal stories in the book helpful, but I didn't realize that it would be so clearly from an evangelical Christian perspective. I didn't find that aspect helpful for me, although I'm sure it might be for others who share that point of view.Also, the author is not a professional psychologist or family therapist, so those looking for that type of perspective and advice should look for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Religious","review":"This book was not what I expected.

Again, some references are biblical but often can apply to anyone. ie. \\"He who opens his mouth less is wise\\" referring to \\"the less advice/suggestions you shell out voluntarily, the more likely your advice will be heeded\\".

I grew up during the 80's and these songs bring back some happy memories. My only dissapointment was the ending. \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" has to be one of my favorite 80's songs. So when I heard what sounded like a \\"glitch\\" I immediately returned the CD to where I bought it and went to a different store to find a new copy. The first thing I did was play the last song, and, to my surprise, there was that \\"glitch\\" again. That was a very dissapointing way to end what could of potentially, in my opinion, been a 5 star CD. None the less, it is a wonderful CD including my favorite new song, My My My.

There's no doubt, that this one may be a great mix. There's no doubt, that these songs may be anthems of New York club scene.

And there's no doub't that it may do it really well.I haven't been there, i know nothing about it. And i know, the album isn't meant for me then. But still i wan't to say that. For an outsider, theese tracks sound cool. Songs are familiar, have heard them, like them, but there are no personal memories included. And that's why, for a non-NYC-clubber this cd may seem a bit pointless. These hits by themselves are not endearing enough to charm all music lovers.So take this poor piece of review just as a warning.

Nicholas Cage, John Lovitz and Dana Carvey make this movie utterly hilarious throughout. Cage plays the typical normal, logical, calculating brother of the 3. John Lovitz is the brother you can never trust and Carvey is a goofy, klepto-maniac who hardly uses any common sense. When these 3 come together in a scene it's hard to imagine something funny \\"not\\" happening. 3 Diverse and conflicting personalities make for a great comedy farse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trapped In Paradise Entraps You!!!","review":"3 brothers (Nicholas Cage, Dana Carvey, and Jon Lovitz) heist a bank in a little town known as Paradise.

They constantly run into the locals who live a quaint little lifestyle and are always willing to lend a helping hand. With the starring of Cage, Carvey, and Lovitz, you'd think that it would be a hysterical movie. After watching it, the movie does have some funny moments,and the entire idea is kind of quirky, but overall it's not as funny as one would project.

A great cast of Nicholas Cage, Dana Carvey, and John Luvitz can not deliver enough punch to the awful lines of this film. The idea behind this is two small time crooks (Carvey and Luvitz) learn of a plan in prison about a small town bank that is ripe for the picking. All they need is a little help once they get outside. The help is in the form of thier somewhat honest brother (cage). The characters played by Carvey and Luvitz are just annoying, and Cage is just flat. And to top it off, they tried to add a love connection in it, just plain bad. I forced myself to finish watching this in the hopes it would get funny, but it didn't. Save your change, don't get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful -A waste of ten bucks.","review":"It's hard for me to believe that this movie has received an average Amazon rate of 4 stars. It makes me wonder if the same person hasn't written in 7 or 8 times. I am a devoted Cage fan, and so went into this film with high expectations. As a whole, I found the film a complete disappointment. The gags were weary, the dialogue was tiresome, and the plot was thin. Even the slapstick style humor was weak; almost Benny Hill-esque. The only reason to buy this film is to complete a Cage or Carvey collection, and even then, I'd make it last on the list. Everyone in this film has done better, funnier work. If you're really considering buying it, take your ten bucks down the street and give it to some homeless guy, or buy a handful of lottery tickets, or anything else at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound quality","review":"Shipping was fast.

With the older plates, if you closed your eyes and touched the tree design, you couldn't feel it, it was part of the porcelain. But with the newer plates, it does feel like a decal pasted on. It is definitely inferior.And of course these newer ones are made in China or in Thailand. I would NEVER eat from any of these plates (since the melamine scare).

The quality of these pieces is just awful. Eight mugs had to be discarded due to crazing. Wine glasses are a different color pattern from the originals and the Christmas trees are haphazardly placed on the different pieces. I should have asked the seller about the country of origin. My mistake. We have not used them yet, but don't expect much. I should have returned them, but after Christmas, I was too tired and didn't need one more trip to the post office.

That said, this is not an album for fans of The Dixie Chicks; it is an explosion of sound with just enough rhythm to make fans of more traditional rock really enjoy it. Favorites include \\"Born to Lose,\\" \\"When She Begins to Rock,\\" \\"Sometimes I Do,\\" and the dark classic \\"99 to Life\\" - in the tradition of Prison Bound, a jailhouse lament of the first order. Hard to call a band that does songs about withdrawing from heroin, murdering your girlfriend (\\"my baby's lyin, in a puddle of blood\\") and living on the edge of society anything but punk.

Mike Ness is Steve McQueen and Johnny Cash rolled in to one; aside from his obvious musical gift the man is simply cool.There are a couple of tracks on here I can't get in to, but that's to be expected. No matter what your favorite artists release, you won't like every song. Nothing about the material on here seemed like the band was forcing it; the songs are packed with raw feeling and the darkness of the human heart.

Halloween 5\\\\The Revenge has the main theme done in two ways: first a synthesizer version, and then an electric piano incantation.

In A Stranger In The House, the main theme follows \\"Michael\\" chasing Jamie through the clinic, and then we have myers house and Man in Black. At Tower Farm, Tina dies to main theme and shape stalks variations. Stop the Rage has main theme and shape stalks on percussion. The Attic is very calm, except for shape stalking, and it has a COOL main theme at the end. Jail break features Man in Black and some other stuff. Halloween Finale is a slow main theme.

Some called it \\"pretentious\\"; that's what Americans always say when they can't figure out what the French are up to. 30 years later, the narrative structure isn't any more complex than Pulp Fiction, or perhaps The Hours. During one long night a dying artist (John Gielgud) contemplates plot options for his last book. Memories of his life, and his children (whom he loves too well, or possibly loathes) intrude on his creative efforts. John Gielgud carries most of the movie. What could have been a dreary or ponderous subject is rather buoyant and clever with Gielgud as the difficult author. And then the movie is just beautiful, and beautifully whimsical. Does art imitate life? Does life imitate art? Great subject, great movie, great director: where's the DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gielgud loved it...now why can't we have it?","review":"John Gielgud stated that his performance in \\"Providence\\" was the best movie performance of his life. I wouldn't argue with that. A superb cast includes Ellen Burstyn, Dirk Bogarde, and David Warner. The film attempts to show the world through one querulous, dying novelist, and then the world as it really is. Many films have dived into the creative process, but this one succeeds brilliantly. I'm writing Criterion to ask if they could put this on their release schedule. There are so many awful films that have been released on DVD--why this one remains unshown is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Ages","review":"I too saw this movie at the theatre back in '77 and although it disappeared from the popular media, I never forgot it. Like Brideshead Revisited it lives forever in the mind's eye, and dwells like a black hole in the core of the psyche. I was especially moved by Gielgud's devastating line at the end of the movie. He knows he will be dying at any moment and has made peace with his children. Then he pours a glass of wine and looking death full in the face, he says, \\"I think there is time for just one more.\\" It sounds like nothing, and yet Gielgud makes of it everything.If you don't feel like paying $120 for a PAL DVD, this movie is available for download on the BT sites.You might also enjoy a book that was written with Gielgud in mind as the aging licentious Rector of All Saints Church:Mab's Cross Trilogy: Volume I: The Lost Rebellion (Mab's Cross Trilogy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make this available again!","review":"What a terrific movie this is. Sweet, sad, funny, a real treasure. I saw this at school in a class taught by Robert Coover's son. Had to wonder if there were parallels between my teacher's relationship with his father and the famous-writer father & son in this film. Haven't seen it since and I would sure love to. I liked it ten times better than Hiroshima Mon Amour or Last Year In Marienbad. Some of the lines are really hilarious, like here is this old fart up at night remembering his wife who committed suicide years before and all he can say is, \\"Ah, Molly, Molly, your breasts were a biological triumph!\\" Great stuff. I've taken off one star because occasionally the dialogue becomes stilted & self-referential, unreal basically and plain annoying. The story itself ends very nicely and the entire cast is just about perfect. Please bring this ignored treat back to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than worthless","review":"I gave this book one star because it does, in fact, contain sample resumes and cover letters. But it contains nothing else! And the examples look like generic resumes to me; certainly nothing geared toward those re-entering the job market.The book is broken into three parts. The first is a few pages of work sheets where you write in your job history/experience/education.The second part is devoted to sample resumes.The last is a collection of cover letters.But nowhere is there any information as to why these examples were used. This is just a trip through a personnel person's file cabinet, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in Collegiate A Cappella","review":"This is an excellent example of the best in collegiate a cappella. The songs are arranged by current or former members of the UC Men's Octet and recorded in a studio and released in 1993. The album features Cal songs such as \\"Hail to California\\", \\"Stanford Jonah\\" and an interesting rendition of the \\"Oompa Loompa\\" song which will make any Berkeley student grin and any Stanford student cringe. Wonderful all vocal versions of Queen's \\"Flash Gordon\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", as well as Bill Haley's classic \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" and a wonderful rendition of Simon and Garfunkle's \\"Late in the Evening\\" are included in the 21 tracks in an eclectic playlist. A great gift for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Movie..so I bought the score","review":"First and foremost, I thought the Abyss was a great movie, visually stunning. Another aspect of this fantastic movie was the score, which made certain scenes that much better. At times, the score was better than a scene. Alan Silvestri is a maestro, and this was one of his better works. I strongly recommend it to people who are fans of movie scores. This is one purchase you must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end is pretty good","review":"Buy this CD for tracks 11, 12, and 13. The finale of the score is amazing, with a powerful build-up of the choir and orchestra. The rest of the score, sadly, is a waste of time. Track 1 rips off the main title to James Horner's BRAINSTORM, before settling into a repetitive percussion motif. Tracks 3 and 7 are merely recycled from Silvestri's PREDATOR score. Everything else is simply synth droning and boring \\"atmosphere\\" music. If it weren't for the last ten minutes of the score, I would sell this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most moving musical scores I've heard","review":"The music fills the theatre with a feeling of hope and accomplishment. Will give any person a lift when they need it most. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silvestri takes us deep into the Abyss","review":"The Abyss is a great soundtrack and fans of Silvestri will absolutely love. His trademark writing style is present throughout most of the score. The main reason to get this score is definitely for the last 3 tracks, especially \\"The Finale\\". In these 3 tracks, Silvestri unleashes awe and wonder and lets the orchestra and choir soar into the heavens for about 13 minutes. This material is some of the best music he has ever written and appears in compilation CDs everywhere. The \\"Main Title\\" hints at the material in the last 3 tracks and then bursts into a snare drum solo. The action music, which is also good, is trademark Silvestri with brass and percussion, present in \\"The Crane\\", \\"The Fight\\", and \\"Sub Battle\\". The real treat is the last 3 tracks, so if listening to the score from beginning to finish, be patient and wait for the last 13 minutes. It's well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to buy \\"Cinema Choral Classics I\\"","review":"I listened to the choral peace of the album (can't remember the title) on \\"Cinema Classics I\\" and thought that it would be a great score.After buying the CD, I felt really jilted. From then, I've decided that I'll watch a movie before buying its score, or at least listen to the score before buying it. (This happened well before Amazon and other on-line CD services)I was really disappointed with this - especially that it came from the Silvestri, who gave us the beautiful \\"Forrest Gump\\" score."},{"rating":"2","title":"monster mash","review":"I had been searching for this title for sometime, as I had rented the film for my children a few years back and they have been singing the many songs from the movie ever since, which happen to be very catchy. My children and their friends absouletly loved the monster mash. In fact, when I vewied the movie to insure it was appropriate for my kids, I found myself laughing aloud. I can say that any child over 5 years old and adults as well, will get a kick out of this fun story."},{"rating":"2","title":"For every age surfer","review":"The complete reference for conditioning for surfers to date.

No storage room for batteries, etc.....but very nice case, especially for a young person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small For Anything","review":"When I bought my Lumix DMC-TZ5 through Amazon, this was the case featured at the bottom of the screen. It looked like just what I was looking for, so I bought it. But when I got it, it didn't fit the camera or, for that matter, anything else! It's a nice little case that seems to me great for carrying a pack of cigarettes (small) and little more. Amazon shouldn't feature such things without making sure they fit. I have a small handheld computer/phone and the case is too small for even that, and it's a good deal smaller than the camera.Don't buy the products Amazon features with any product unless you know dern well that it'll fit. I don't know who the yo-yos are who determine what gets featured with what, but they're most likely guessing.Even if something fit this little case, it's way overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claymore DVD Volume 5","review":"This was a action packed DVD.

This is Oingo Boingo and the Mystic Knights before they reinvented themselves into a ska band. Although the songs are reminescent of an old Hollywood musical, listen closely to the words and you will here the dark tones of Oingo Boingo. Sounding like a crooner from the silent film era, Danny Elfman really puts his vocals to work. This was his first movie score under the direction of his brother Richard Elfman. Musical genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent","review":"As a young married woman, I know exactly the sexual pressures she discusses. It's real and it's oppressive.

If you are from WA State or have lived there, this mystery book is for you! As I read this book I felt as if I were at these WA locations. I could totally relate to the area. In addition, the author has a great range in her characters. You will follow Spence (among other characters) on his journey and emotionally relate to him.This book is a very up-to-date mystery. It is set in the here and now and has a touch of Hollywood! It is apparent that the author did her research on not only the locations but the forensics and legal aspects of the story. This book is an easy read but will keep you interested throughout. I highly suggest that you read this book. I can hardly wait for the next book by this author to come out! (Does she have others??)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically sucked in...","review":"I had been avoiding this book for the title for several years walking by it on my bookshelf. I can't even remember when or where I picked it up. I dusted it off the shelf after promising myself to be a more virtuous reader and vowed to read a chapter a night. I couldn't stop until I was halfway through the book.I hadn't know a large part of the book was set in Sedona, a place I have visited and loved for many a year now. Or that the character was thinking many of the same things I was in visiting there. But the soothing memory of the healing energy of that place swept over me as I read the pages. As the main character thinks back to here time on Bell Rock I kept returning there again and again in my mind.I good read for anyone who loves the mystery of the desert or the orient. Or has ever felt alone in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to Business Law","review":"This was the textbook for an introductory course in business law I took. It does a great job at laying the groundwork of the US legal system and explodes many common myths. A large amount of material is covered clearly and consisely. The chapters on contracts and constitutional law alone are worth the price of the book. The authors do a good job hitting the high points and not getting bogged down in details that are inappropriate for an introductory course.There are a few typographical errors that carried over to the thirteenth edition and ought to have been caught. Because this is a survey course, the reader may find supplemental material such as a law dictionary necessary to understand some of the finer points."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Legend is Over-rated","review":"Perhaps you've heard about how great FMW is. Perhaps you've heard how they \\"invented\\" hardcore wrestling. That may be so, but this tape doesn't prove it at all. Why? Let me count the ways.1)It has Horace freaking Hogan on it. In not one but two matches. Sure, it's better than his WCW work, but that's saying very little.2)The announcers are annoying. They can't convey any emotion, and their idea of insight is to rattle off the names of some old school wrestlers. Ole Anderson wasn't the only or first wrestler to work on one body part, so why do they keep on bringing him up? And their jokes are lame.3)The ultra-hardcore Death Match with Mr. Pogo is a lights out match. Meaning you can't see what's going on. Dumb dumb dumb.There is some good stuff on this tape. The work of Hayabusa is amazing. And the women's stuff is a hundred times better than their American counterparts. But really, if you can look around on the internet you can find much better tapes than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big steamy pile","review":"This DVD is a waste of money. For years I've heard about how great the FMW is. I purchased this with high expectations and was let down. The comentators suck like nothing else, the hardcore match with Mr. Pogo is nearly impossible to watch thanks to the brilliant idea of using strobe lighting, and the rest of the matches are mediocre Monday night stuff at best. On the plus side Mike Awsome's hair is at full mulletude. And the bonus stuff is great. Your money is better spent on the ECW DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good.","review":"Some of the ECW tapes are much more exciting and more brutal. This tape is a little more brutal than WWF, but not as exciting as ECW. I have heard some good reports about FMW, but this tape isn't one of the better ones.

I have had to send back THREE pots so far, all of them have arrived with multiple chips in the enamel, some of which have been hastily painted over with enamel paint which not only doesn't match the color of the pot, it is obviously brushed on and scratches right off. Amazon has not been very helpful in resolving this issue by sending me a pot without chips, and Le Creuset has been no more helpful either. If I am going to spend $100 and pay full price for this stockpot, it should not have chips in it. That's what \\"outlet\\" stores with cheaper prices are for!I love Le Creuset's enamal on cast iron cookware, but I'm completely disappointed by this product so far.

It is not for small minds or people who get thier information in the form of \\"sound-bites\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"English is Old, but the Information is Very Interesting","review":"As with anything written per 1900, the English is a bit different, and the style of writing tends to be repetitive. The information draws upon materials most of us wouldn't be able to read, so there's no real way to confirm it's accuracy. Yet many details can be confirmed based upon current practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan's Deception","review":"It is amazing that I could be so blinded and deceived until the truth is presented to me. Although this book was difficult to read, I couldn't put it down. I immediately felt compelled to share with my Catholic friends and family what I had discovered. The information could be life shaking for a Catholic, and life changing if they were opened to the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"From love to hate","review":"When I first read this book, I loved it.That was a long time ago, and I am older and wiser now. Now I realize that it is extremely important to read both sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion. Hislop, sadly, uses the power of selective information: You will only find part of the story in this book. I strongly recommend that you read Ralph Woodrow's \\"The Babylon Connection?\\" before coming to any conclusions based on this book.We Christians are supposed to be as \\"wise as serpants\\"-- do your historical homework before buying into Hislop's ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Christian needs this","review":"This book is quoted and used as a resource for many writers.

I read in amazement how the Catholic faith is really just rehashed ancient paganism! Only the truth is, it ISN'T. A very good website debunking his absurd hypothesis is [...]. An honest evaluation of the facts clearly reveals that Hislop's eagerness to condemn Catholicism resulted in some very poor and dishonest \\"scholarship\\". A big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Study in Deception & Gullibility","review":"It's unfortunate, but the fact remains that there are those Christians who will believe, not what is true, but what they *wish* to believe. This book is certainly written for them. Hislop's whole ramble is predicated on the idea that Nimrod and Semiramis were married. They didn't even live in the same century. They could not possibly have known one another. Sorry, but what Hislop has written is a mixture of lies and illogic. And it is shameful that so many Christians are so intellectually incapacitated, so fundamentally incapable of rational, intelligent, critical thought, that they will take hold of these lies and give them a credence they do not deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad fiction","review":"This book is simply awful. The vast majority of it is not history but tabloid fiction, from the subtitle on. In the subtitle, the author calls Nimrod and Semiramis husband and wife (thus the subtitle of the book), yet they were not. They didn't even live at the same time. Nothing in the historical record associates them. It looks like he just made that up for his book. Not a good start. The rest of his arguments are just as badly researched and based on what he must have wanted rather than any facts. It is not considered historically accurate by anyone.Ralph Woodrow used this book as the basis for his book \\"Babylon Mystery Religion.\\" When Woodrow discovered just how completely false the contents of this book are, he stopped publishing his book and wrote a retraction entitled \\"The Babylon Connection?\\". Get that book rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thesis has been refuted by it's very author!","review":"This books cites sources such as the writings of occultists Madame Blavatsky...who was anti-Semetc and anti-Christian! The author who wrote this book realized Hislop was a hack, and changed his views. He is not a Roman Catholic, because there are genuine Theological reasons not to be one.Claiming Catholics are Pagans are only going to lead people astray. I became a Wiccan in my teens partly because I heard such things...and I wasn't a Catholic then or now. You can't just simply seperate 1500 years of Christianity from Catholicism. It's like taking flour out of bread.Read Mr. Woodrow's NEW book \\"The Babylon Connection?\\" In which REFUTES the things Hislop and he himself said...which tooks tremendous courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research","review":"Heavy reading, but great information once you get going.

Eye opening and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for the Truth!","review":"This book should be read by all!!! It challenges the very existance of all that we have come to know as truth, i.e. Christmas, Easter, Catholicism and much more...I was aware of some of the idolatrous days that we celebrate, however, upon reading this book I have come to learn that it is deeper than that we know! It is interesting to me that intelligent people are the most caught up into societies standard religion and practices of \\"Catholicism\\", even though they are not all professing Catholics. It's amazing that we can challenge so many day to day issues and fail to see what is right before us...If you love the Lord, be willing and obedient to go with this author into the deeper depths of God's word.

The two symphonies here were written over thirty years after Atterberg's first effort in the form, and the idiom remains about the same, though the level of sophistication might be a tad bit higher. And that's not a criticism: This is all excellent music -- looking backward, in the view of some perhaps, but excellent nonetheless as far as I'm concerned. The entire run of Atterberg's symphonies is perhaps the best from a lesser known 20th Century composer -- and well worth the investment of time.

We will not see his like again, and those who have played the part of the Ranger since his passing have been but pale imitations of the original. However, I gave the DVD only four stars because I was led to believe in its advertising that it contained color episodes of the Lone Ranger series (1956-57). It does not. Rather, it contains several B&W episodes from the first two seasons. While they are of excellent quality, they are not in color as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color but...","review":"Is it enough just to have a few episodes in color? It's nice, but I can find more complete episodes in complete seasons.

I thought the story was decent although it didn't really pick up until maybe the fifth episode. The animation was good and the action was better than many other anime. There is a good reason for the mature rating so if you're buying this for a younger kid I would reconsider. It has several scenes with sexual content and it is quite violent. I liked it for the most part and i will be buying the second season. If you don't mind fan service and a lot of violence then you will enjoy this show. The only fault I had with the dvd was the box was damaged when i got it, thus the 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan service","review":"Believe me, i watched this anime. I watched it because i received it as a gift from my members in my anime club. Now I can take fan service, and sometimes shows with fan service in them turn out to be pretty good. I'm defiantly not a prude and have a open mind about anything. But this anime sucked so much, it was basically an excuse to show boobs, boobs and OH panties. .-. Ugh, and the story isn't that wonderful, to be honest I'd rather watch a concert recital of horrible playing then this. :O don't get this box set if your looking for a story driven anime with heart, and fan service.

Now that I got that outta the way, lets get on to my review. Ikki Tousen is about a very dumb girl, that really loves a good street fight. I guess she's supposed to be the reincarnation of some great warrior of legend and her destiny is to kick everyones ass. I'll admit I'm being a bit vague, but this series just isn't very deep. Get it if you love fan service and female street fighting. Bottom line I give the series 3 stars, but had to deduct one star because it was It was labed as the complete series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of panties and nude girls...Just no likable story","review":"Watching this video was like being shuffed threw the doors on black fridays at walmart, not enough plot not enough charector developement.

These schools have male and female fighters that battle for supremacy. Hakufu Sonsaku is new in town. Her cousin and herself are fighting to protect their friends and keep their school on top. More importantly they fight to make their own destiny.This anime is a lot of fun. It has great action, comedy, and some really great characters. It's more focused on chicks fighting and getting it on than the actual story. The plot is a bit thin and kinda out there, but interesting. You can easily get into the characters, and want them to be okay in the end. I guess that is what makes an anime good. Ikki Tousen is a very entertaining anime to watch, but as I said it's main purpose is fan service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult content for Teens?","review":"The story is bad.

The fight scenes/action are decent at first. Eventually, it all becomes repetetively drab. The story's extremely simplistic and never goes anywhere interesting. The writing and characters never rly surpass their generic, mostly perverted/sadistic, superficial personalities. The animation isn't terribad but nothing memorable.I bought this expecting lots of action-packed, varied fights and some fan service. I wasn't left with much but the latter (excluding disappointment) once the season was over.

Nowhere does it say that these songs are not performed by the original artists! All the songs are a poor remake of the original. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST GOT RIPPED OFF! BEWARE!","review":"Read the back cover of the box very carefully. What at first seems like a very attractive 3 disc collection of songs by original artists will soon disappoint. Look for the words \\"Made famous by\\" in the artists column. I missed them and ended up spending $18.00 for mediocre remakesof some classic songs. Though this pick-up band trys to please, they are hampered by poor sound balance and far too many artistic styles to mimic. Be aware that this set is not part of the authorized Pure Mood series that featured all original artists, through the years. How the hell did they get away with it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine work by Howarth","review":"When John Carpenter departed the Halloween film franchise after making Halloween 3, Alan Howarth ably stepped into the role of composer. The now-legendary 'Michael Myers Theme' - the 3 piano chords - is featured here, along with dark, sinister tones that lend well to the atmosphere of the movie. From the ominous low synethesizer tones as an ambulance makes its away through a thunderstorm to the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium - Myers' home for 10 years - to the low piano chords as Myers walks up the stairs slowly & menacingly, coming after Jamie & Rachel, this soundtrack has put together a chilling collection of Carpenter's classic work for the first two as well as Howarth's own original work. A must have for any collector of horror soundtracks or soundtracks in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine effort","review":"With the Halloween 4 score, Alan Howarth was somewhat freed from the contraints of the John Carpenter compositions. The result is that there are less elements of the original themes and scores. Beyond that the soundtrack plays to Howarth's strengths more than weaknesses. The score is very full in it's synthetic symphonic nature. While it doesn't have the themes and motifs found in the compositions of Carpenter, Howarth kept the tension up in this score and used his skills as a studio master, coupled with his experience with the genre to complete a fine effort in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"erie and very intense","review":"This CD is very erie and gives you a great sense of feeling in danger while listening to it. This is probably the 2nd best Halloween film besides of course the original. Try listening to it at night while driving or while you're all alone in the house with the lights off. CREEEPY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I bought these shoes for my 4 year old son and he loves them. Very nice graphics but not too much.

I would definately buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Ever","review":"This album came into my life at a time when I was just beginning to explore music again. It touched my inner self and made me listen to words and not just the music. This music was haunting and you just had to listen to the words. I felt that they spoke just to me at times. I could not believe that this artist had recorded so little, when he was accepted so well. It has something for everyone, and everyone can find something in the songs that apply directly to them. I played this album so much that I have worn it out and now need another. A wonderful listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 1978 Record That Makes Me Think of Summer :)","review":"I think it's because of Gerry's deep, silky-smooth vocals and the uptempo music that makes me think of summer days when I was a kid. Of course, everybody who grew up through that time knows \\"Baker Street\\" (which was one of the few non-Bee Gee's songs to go #1 that year-- and it held that top spot for about 6 weeks!). Although it IS a 1978 classic, there are other reasons to own this great album on CD. There's the pretty (but not mushy) love song \\"Right Down The Line\\" and my favorite track, the wonderful \\"Home and Dry.\\" What a great, inspiring, upbeat track that just makes you feel good all over!! Gerry Rafferty made me a fan for life with it. :) Overall, this is a VERY good CD which is well worth picking up and reliving \\"the good old days.\\" :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered yes, but at wrong speed","review":"My favorite album of all time. Easily 5 stars on the quality of music. However this re-issued gold disc has a longer running time than the original and it is not due to any additional music. The sound itself is beautifully done, no question, but if you're a fan of the original, you will easily notice the tracks have been remastered at the wrong (slower) speed. Disappointing. City To City deserves nothing less than perfect sonic integrity; look for Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's Original Master Recording on vinyl if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Listening","review":"Probably best known for his hit song \\"Baker Street\\", there are several other songs that got a lot of airplay.

Most of the LP sounds okay, but starting with the second track on side two, \\"Whatever's Written In Your Heart\\", there is a lot of crackle in the left channel. It's also present in tracks 3, 4 and 5. It completely ruins the listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly improved sound","review":"This is a review of the new remastered version. The 2011 edition has a much much better sound quality than older versions. The remaster greatly improves the sound! I am so pleased with this as this is a fantastic album. The old versions has very bad sound, veiled, muddy and dark. This new is not perfect, the treble might be a little to bright and it may lack a bit of bottom, but anyway now you can hear all the details of this great album.

I read in another review, that the picture quality was great, but it isn't. Instead of doing the pictures for the book, by scanning the original 35-millimeter prints, as they should have done, for a good result, it looks like they've used video-images. yes, that's right: Video. There are those pink and light-green distortions at the edge of white areas. Pixelation happening all over the place. No clear, sharp edges. Very dissappointing. I love Mr. Romaneks work, and this book does not do his images justice, I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest in Complete Impulse and Atlantic sets.....","review":"First off, I want to say that all of the recordings on here are beautiful. They all capture the pure genius and sheer beauty that is Coltrane, but it amazes me why they put this set together like this. Im giving it 2 stars....but dont be confused, the music is beautiful, its the set thats getting 2 stars. You Do Not Ever Ever Ever in Life Ever Seperate A Love Supreme! It is a suite, meant to be heard in its entirety. How could u leave out 2 movements? This is like one big sample set. They took pieces from all over the place and threw them on 4 cds. It isn't how the music is supposed to be heard. Pay the extra 40 or 50 bucks and buy the Classic Quartet Complete Impulse! recordings. It is a more complete and logical approach to the genius that is Coltrane. Then, buy the Complete Atlantic recordings. These two sets are the reason God put me on this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid movie but great music!","review":"I dislike the movie but I do enjoy Jerry Goldsmith's score Explorers. It's very similarish to Hoosiers a bit but I find this score a lot better.

He liked the fact that a little girl was involved in the story and that Einstein took the time to help her. The story engaged him and he could relate to the sibling relationship and the older sister's issues with math, as his big sister has a math learning disability. Making it better for him was the extra information at the end specifically about Einstein. If you're looking for a detailed book about Einstein's life, this probably isn't for you. But for the younger crowd, I think this one makes Einstein more real, perhaps; more accessible. We really enjoy it and I find him reading it on his own, which is a victory in and of itself. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gostei do livro","review":"Gostei da compra!

It is immersive with the physics and graphical elements. Who knew that going through an abandoned building would be so cool, until you could see the fires burning and chemical showers going off throughout the place.What's really amazing is that this all ran on my old ATI Rage 128 pretty nicely. I can't wait to see what it looks like on my ATI Radeon 9700.The only downfall is that the gunfights were a little too easy, so far. When all you have to worry about is strafing and shooting at each easy target, it starts to get boring. I think some more heavy weapons should be added like the Grenade Launcher and RPG7 from SOF2. Those are a little harder to dodge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a sleeper hit, but for the bugs. . .","review":"I have rarely, if ever, played a first-person shooter this bug-ridden, and that's too bad since the actual gameplay, while it's nothing original, is pretty good (even if the plot is seriously lacking). But you can only find so much enjoyment from a game that kicks you to your desktop whenever it feels the urge, or forces you to endure horrendous scenery glitches. What could have been one of the year's sleeper hits in the genre is wounded by its own severe lack of polish, despite all its beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and its awesome assortment of weapons. Out of the box, \\"Devastation\\" is devastating, and you, as a gamer, should never have to pay to beta test.

First, it is not the normal cast iron Le Creuset products. It is made of a thin layer of steel, with some enamel like paint on it. It does not heat up evenly, and food burns and sticks to the bottom. Second month of using it, the enamel paint start to chip off the bottom. I did not use any abrasive cleaning products, and always used wood or nylon utensils. Contacted the manufacturer about warranty, and never heard back from them.I bought it for $40 when it was on sale. Definately not worth even that, let alone the normal price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crack after few years","review":"These are supposed to be high quality stock pots.

I don't cook food in it. The non-stick enamel is very easy to clean off hard water residue. The pot did arrive with some small chipped area inside the pot, so I suppose if I actually cooked food in it, those chipped areas would get worse over time. I am totally obsessed with red but sometimes the red color can be too bright or too dark but I think that the red color on this pot is perfect and if everything else in your kitchen is red like in my kitchen this pot should blend well. Overall it serves its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy without prior inspection","review":"There's no way I would buy one of these online.If you aren't familiar with the colours, the photos will throw you off. The \\"cobalt\\" comes across as a very deep and rich blue in a lot of online photos, while in reality it is dull and somewhat purplish. Similarly, the red is also much deeper and punchy in photos. In contrast, the \\"caribbean\\" aquamarine and \\"kiwi\\" green are much more saturated in real life.The real problem, however, comes with the enamel. I just bought one from a Le Creuset store, and the enamel is terrible, with multiple black spots where the enamel didn't fully adhere. By multiple, I mean that there are about a couple dozen spots on the lid and main pot. Granted, the spots are small and look like coffee grounds, but you probably don't want to be faced with the hassle of sending your pot back. For these non-French stockpots (mine is made in Thailand), at least, I would recommend buying in person and inspecting carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed enamel exterior","review":"Just received this stock pot.

I wasn't exactly trying to put the pot through it's paces, just boiling water (at a medium heat per the instructions).The color is quite nice, and if you just want a pretty pot sitting on your shelf it is quite economical.

Through their continous contact, Michael and the rabbi's bong grow stronger surviving acts of racism as well as town beatings. Not only did their bond survive through harsh tests: their retaliation struck fear into other racists and those who oppose them. Those who read this book can learn the valuable lesson that true friendship and strong beliefs can overcome tough obstacles in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was thoroughly enjoying the romp through the Brooklyn of my youth though somewhat skeptical of the boy, Michael, believing in all the superheroes stuff while seeming to be quite levelheaded about the reality around him. Then the ending made me wonder why I had wasted all that time reading the book. Michael's refusal to report the atrocities to the police also didn't ring true and the heavy handed racism didn't help any either. This could have been a very good book if the author either did it as straigh fantasy or straight reality. Mixing the two is a cop-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow in August","review":"If, on pages three and four, you don't mind the curse words off, s, a--, goddamned and Jesus Christ as an expletive, then read this book. If you think literary genius demands more from its writers - ei: the ability to express oneself without resorting to foul words - then don't read this book. Pete should stick to writing columns where curse words are not allowed. I can't believe this is on a Catholic high school reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jew And A kid from IReland","review":"This book was an excellent boook until the end. It was intresting to read about what happens to Micheal. The book was a pretty hard book to put down becuse you didn't know what would happen next. There were a lot intresting parts like when the rabbi and priest got together to clean of swastikas. The thing that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the endind it ruined the book for me i thought there was going to be a serious ending but no there were mud figures prancing around.

A simpler time, perhaps, but not without injustices and racism that we still face today. Of course the baseball and introduction of Jackie Robinson as the first black ballplayer is symbolic of these truths. While I thought the ending was somewhat fantasy and different from the rest of the book, I would definately recommend Snow in August."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this to your kids","review":"I enjoyed \\"Snow in August\\" so much I read it to my 7-year old son, one chapter at a time, over the course of the last summer. I had to \\"edit\\" some violent scenes, most notably the attack on Mr. G and the attempted rape of the lead character's mother. (The narrator is 12, the same age Hamill was in 1947.)It was one of the best experiences we've yet shared. It helped us talk about baseball, about religion, about racism, about New York, and about history. We raced through the last chapters -- it took us 90 minutes -- and we still talk about its subjects, months later.Pete Hamill is a great American writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't spark my interest!","review":"Though Hamill's ideas were interesting, the execution of his novel was too simpistic to be an effective story. I would love to see how another author would bring bring this novel's contents (i.e. the richness of the divergent Jewish and Catholic religions, the psychology of gang violence, the nostalgia of 1940's baseball, the mystery of the Kballah) more to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful classic story with a disappointing ending","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars + if it had maintained the promise of the first 3/4 of the book. I loved the little boy, the Rabbi, the mother. And the bad guys were easy to hate. It was a perfectly woven story, full of good characters, scenes, suspense, surprises, twists of fate. But I feel that the writer didn't know how to end this story and so resorted to a fantasy ending which was so unbelievable and unsatisfying. One reviewer could be right though-- it might well be a good \\"allegory\\" to expose young children to. It certainly points out good over evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamill's editor must have been asleep at the wheel.","review":"This book starts out so amazingly promising, the lackluster ending is a huge disappointment. As I read the first half of the book, I actually thought I was reading a new classic -- the kind of book that would be read in junior highs and high schools around the country for years to come. But Hamill loses it about 3/4 the way through. Suddenly, he shifts from a very realistic narrative to fantasy, without batting an eye. Now we've all made writing mistakes and taken inappropriate tangents in our prose. That's the process of writing. But most of the time, we re-read ourselves and/or get good advice from well-meaning friends: \\"Oops! You slipped off course there.\\" WHERE WAS HAMILL'S EDITOR? This could have been such a great book, with an important lesson for every reader about racism. But with a fantasy ending, nothing carries any weight or teaches any lasting lessons. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice start, no finish","review":"A pleasant enough start to this novel carries you along for a good while. I was willing to overlook the hard to believe level of introspection and insight for a pre-teen boy in Brooklyn (or anywhere else, for that matter). I am pre-disposed to enjoy Brooklyn in the 50's because that's where and when I grew up. However, DON'T waste my time with a plot you didn't finish. This is not a novel, it's a fantasy. Very disappointing resolution to the conflict. Don't believe everything Imus says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, A Goyish Book That Shows How Great Judaism Is","review":"What I found most significant about this book is how openly and warmly it describes the humanity and charity of Judaism, and what great literary and theological gifts Judaism has given to the whole world. It also quickly disproves that old, hideous chestnut about the Jews killing Jesus (the Romans did it, folks) - - and makes much of the fact that Jesus was a practicing Jew until the day he died (rem: the Last Supper was a Passover seder). Most non-Jewish publications and books that I read take pains to conceal or gloss over Jewish culture, and / or the Jewish identity of, say, the protagonist of a story. Usually, you have to pick through the prose until you come to a phrase like \\"______'s father was a Russian immigrant, who worked in the Garment District in New York,\\" or some such nonsense. How refreshing to discover a book by a non-Jew that celebrates Jewish tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow in August is about character-building and healing.","review":"SNOW IN AUGUST is a moving story about a boy searching for values.

It is a perfect model of a hero's journey to defend his own, and defeat evil.

He begins to grow up when he witnesses the beating of a jew. And later becomes friends with a rabbi.Then he begins to mature and begins to deal with racial and prejudice issues.

I read it eagerly for the depiction of the interaction between a young Catholic boy growing up in Irish Brooklyn and the new Jewish immigrant saved from a horrific Europe. Unfortunately, what I found was a sentimental and largely uninformed view of Jewish life and a superficial set of characters who stood as icons for real people. Then, after slogging through the book with the hope that Hammil would at least address the hard question of good and evil in real life, he decides to fall back on a Deus Ex Machina to save him from the hard work of having his characters find their own way out.

I am going to buy this for my Kindle and retread it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving read but with some problems","review":"This book was very moving and made me think a lot about faith and miracles, but I wish Hamill had included one more chapter at the end to tie up the loose ends, like Michael and his mother moving out to the new apartment, Frankie going to jail, and the implications of raising the golem. The golem part works if you have a taste for mystical fantasy but it leaves you hanging at the end. And the golem chapters do stir up one problem for me: is Hamill implying that the Jews were not \\"pure\\" enough to save themselves during the Holocost because they lacked faith and that only an outsider can raise the golem? Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but I came away with that feeling. Despite this, Snow in August is a good read that will make you ponder over the issues it raises."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old-fashioned story--that's a compliment!","review":"In an age of neo-post-modern-deconstructionists, it was a treat to zip through this winning morality tale of a Brooklyn altar boy-cum-\\"shabbos goy\\" in the summer of Jackie Robinson's rise to the majors. Opinions will no doubt be divided over the golom-ex-machina magical-realist ending, but I for one was glad to see the eponymous blizzard show up to give the bad guys what was definitely coming to them. Mr. Hamill's prose style is straight-ahead, a nice match for his young narrator's POV.I also like the answer NY Daily News editor Hamill seems to be giving to the quintessential city question, \\"Can't we all get along?\\" Hell, yes!

The book shows how hard and admirably Hamill tried to understand Judaism from his Irish Catholic perspective; the ending shows how miserably he failed. The rabbi couldn't prevent the Holocaust because he wasn't \\"pure\\" enough, but a pre-teen Irish Catholoic can call up the miracle required to save the Jews?? At its worst, the ending smacks of anti-Semitism; at its best, it completely destroys what up to then had been an engrossing narrative by displaying an utter lack of understanding of what it means to be a post-Holocaust Jew. And I won't say anything about how the ending is a cop-out in itself. (See the \\"Deus Ex Machina\\" comments in other negative reviews.) Up until the end, I was excited to be reading the book; after it, I was only angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"As captivating as watching snow melt","review":"The only reason this book is considered by some to be a \\"real page turner\\" is because it is written at a third grade level.

The beginning of the novel is captivating with a great plot and interesting characters. However, the author destroys his own book with the worst ending of a novel I have ever read. It seems as if the author was so massively confused about how to end his book that he just defaulted to magic. If you have a book that is perfectly grounded in reality, introducing a magical element in the last two chapters is the worst possible decision an author can make. Everyone would like to solve their problems with magic, but real people find real ways to solve their problems.

Good in the way it unites a Irish catholic boy and an orthodox jewish man together, in an enviroment where it would be almost impossible. The author Pete Hamill used realistic events in order to illustrate how this is possible. The author uses events such as the Jackie Robinson signing in order to make it more realistic . The Flaw of this book came at the end when michael recreated a jewish myth the Golem, and turned the book into a fairy tale, which i did not like, because the whole time I took the book seriously, and at that point i kind of took it as a joke.

Both are extremely well written in that the reader is totally immersed in the time and place where Hamill takes the reader. For me, this is a major challenge for the writer of fiction, and it is Hamill's greatest strength. In Snow in August, we are taken to a post-World War II Brooklyn, where racial and ethnic tensions are rampant.Unfortunately, the ending is both predictable and rather lame. It seems resplendent with special effects that just do not come off as very believable.I do recommend the book, but do so with the caveat that the ending is really lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golem vs. Superheroes","review":"Snow in August is a book mixing fantasy with reality from beginning to end. Michael loved reading his Marvel comics (first page, first chapter). Superhero figures, such as, Superman and Spiderman who always \\"save the day\\" were created by Jewish men (Siegal, Shuster, Leiber-Stan Lee) who grew up with the \\"golem\\" as their superhero. I believe that the golem represents for Michael his superhero that he idolizes in his comics. Good vs. evil with evil always being conquered. Some reviewing comments felt that the ending was violent but remember Superheroes conquer evil in whatever fashion it takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful Ending","review":"I feel the author cheated me. Most of the book is a fine story of an Irish Catholic boy who befriends a rabbi in post-war Brooklyn. Through Jackie Robinson's first season with the Dodgers, Rabbi Hirsh's stories of Prague under the Nazis, and the menace of a violent local gang, young Michael is learning important lessons about hate and racism. The reader is led along, expecting that at the end Michael will have learned how to cope with the uglier side of life without himself becoming hateful or violent. Instead, the author gives us a ridiculous cartoon ending. Shame on Pete Hamill.

Alas, radio no longer plays power-pop and these albums by Cockeyed Ghost, Love Nut, Gladhands, BMX Bandits all just vanished fast. Read the reviews below for why this record is so good; I just want to reiterate what they said. AND also if there are other Diggers fans out there; do they have anything else available anywhere? I hope the fact that this didn't sell millions of copies won't keep them from making more music. Good stuff. By the way, if you dig this and have it already, then look for records by THE MOMMYHEADS similarly gorgeous songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Les Miserables - Lite","review":"While other reviewers may have found this a worthwhile set, I did not enjoy either movie. In truth, the 1952 version seemed to use the same screenplay/script as the 1935 version. I have thoroughly enjoyed the book in several readings, and on audio, but these two movies are \\"disneyfied\\" corruptions of the story. I realize that two hours is not enough to do justice to Victor Hugo's tale, but the 1978 version is a much better attempt than either of these. I must say that I also resent it when screen writers re-write a masterpiece. Fantine does not meet Cosette before she dies! The absence of the Thenardiers leaves out two important characters that should flow throughout the story as symbols of the ills of the society being portrayed. If you would like to see a version of \\"Les Miserables - Lite\\", then these are for you; however, neither version conveys more than a smidgen of what Hugo wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miserables","review":"DVD was received in a prompt and timely manner and was received in excellent condition.I prefer the 1952 edition, but it's great to see them both and compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riot Act","review":"I can't believe what they did with the barricade scenes. The noble cause of the students and the lower classes was turned into a riot, and those same students were pictured as \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\" louts stirring up trouble. Now, I understand, this was the '30s, Depression Era, the government did not want anyone getting any ideas about revolutions, but this character assasination saddens me. And by the way, people, Les Miserables is about far more than Javert chasing Valjean. It's about freedom, and hope, and opression, and guilt, all those universal topics all of us face every day of our lives. You can't get all the feeling of the book in any of the adaptions, save perhaps the musical, the only version where the writers obviously read the unabridged book. So take my advice, forget the movies. Go see the musical and read the book instead. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD NOT as described","review":"This concerns the DVD itself, not the movies. Amazon lists this a a 2-Disc set, and perhaps at one time it was, but that is no longer the case. I received a single, 2-sided DVD with the 1935 version on one side and the 1952 version on the other.I detest 2-sided DVDs. They're usually less reliable to begin with (often skipping and freezing) and are more prone to further scratches and damage. It's a terribly cheap way to package these films and it also makes no sense since both versions could easily have fit on a single side.One disc instead of two is bad enough, but why not at least put both movies on a single, one-sided disc of better quality?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic presentation of a Classic","review":"Two films well worth seeing of a novel well worth reading. The 1935 that I missed as a two year old is far better than most of the films in the theatres today. Fredric March ought not be missed. Great actors, telling a great story. The book is better, but then you have to spend much more time with it. The film gives you a feeling of many parts of life and history with out the pain that was there. You are a prisioner with out the hunger, is the revolution without the blood and in court without the horror. The 1952 film tells the same story almost as well. If you have to choose one make it the 1935."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clap hands, here come's Charlie!","review":"If you keep in mind that Victor Hugo's classic book is 1000+ pages, you can appreciate how surprisingly well the 1935 version of the film actually succeeds in creating a sketch of this very intricate, envolved story. However the strong point of this film in its cast also represents its centreal problem -Charles Laughton! Mr Lughton, not even being a handsome fellow is mesmerizingly effective as the villain, Inspector Javert in this picture. Incredibly talented, skillful actor. The problem is that he often outstages Fredric March (Who also did a very good job) so profoundly that the focus of the veiwer is easily shifted from the hero Jean Valjeane to the villain, Inspector Javert when it is probably not intended. That said, a movie can have much worse flaws than a distractingly powerful performance by the villain, so enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm miserables","review":"I feel duped! Purchased the video an demand version expecting to see my favorite, Charles Laughton. Got some other guy instead! Very disingenuous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The many versions.","review":"Since first seeing the Fredric March version of this film years ago I have found that the story endures regardless of its cast. Rennie really didn't appear in alot of films compared to other actors but I was glad he took on the part. Its very hard to determine which version I liked the most . . . . there are touching scenes in each film. The newer Liam N. version is quite good also. This year we will see yet another release which I will look forward to watching. I'm sure it too will have the same emotional effect on me as did the others. I liked this particular film and will review it again from time to time. Please watch each version for yourself. Its the story and screen play that make the most difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best One Out There!","review":"Of all the Les Miserables movies(even the one with Liam Neeson) this is my favorite it has in my opinon the best Jean Valjean. I guess you can say what makes this movie is Jean and his performance he is so much better than Liam is and you can truly feel his love for young Cosette. You'll fall in love with Jean! The little girl that played young Cosette also does a good job and you can see the bond that she has with Jean on screen. Marius is also performed well.The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars from me is Javert delievers a lack-luster performance- I found him more annoying than dangerous...It strays from the book a little but, is good none- the- less. This is a must for any Les Mis fan and a must for any old movie buff. All in all this is one you need to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of all film versions.","review":"The 1935 version of Les Miserable is the best adaptation of all of the filmed versions. Charles Laughton is magnificent!!! This item is a great value because it has the 1935 version and the 1952 version so you can compare at least two versions back to back. The latest adaptation with Liam Neesom is the worst. I recommend to everyone who reads this review to purchase this item and as soon as it arrives, pop in the 1935 version and be prepared to be amazed( if you haven't already seen it). Next to the book it is perfect. A must see/own movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wretched Who?","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It was pretty, entertaining and touching. As a movie, it did its job. As an adaption of the classic novel, I thought it was horrible. The entire plot was Valjean's escape from Javert and Cosette and Marius' romance rather than the wretched ones, the rebelling, poverty stricken French citizens striving for a better life. It's too bad that by watching this movie someone who has never read Hugo's story will never fully understand why it's so loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom very pleased","review":"Went to see the new one with Russell Crow and Hugh Jackson. Watched the 25th celebration of the musical. Was going to watch the Leim Neeson verson, but mom said she really wanted to see the one with Fredrick March. We saw the first movie made in 1935, then compaired it with the 1952 version, but liked the acting in the first one better, but the photography in the second one was much better. Mom was blown away when she saw the Leim Neeson verson. Made an 86 year old mother very happy, but I am now going to take a break from Les Miserables until the Hugh Jackson verson comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding classic movie","review":"If you are a Les Miserables fan, you have to have this classic. It is not a musical! The acting is classic and old school but it is very good. The Les Mis story is clearly told and if you have seen the play or musical version, this will add to your enjoyment of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the theater version","review":"I was excited to buy the DVD, because the version I seen in the theater was funny. The DVD cuts all the funny parts, I don't know if it is because it is an unrated evrsion, but I am not going to waste my money to buy the rated version to see if that is the one I seen in the theaters. Do yourself a favor and don't bother getting this, hopefully a theater version will be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful DVD release!","review":"My 1 star rating is for the unrated version of this DVD release, and not for the theatrical version of the movie itself. This is BY FAR NOT the funny movie that was in the theatre. This version has a lot of stuff cut out, including funny stuff and material that helped with character development. Because of this, the unrated version is a chore to watch. It is actually 5 minutes shorter than the PG-13 version available. IF YOU SAW THE EX IN THE THEATRE AND LOVED IT, YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THE PG-13 RATED VERSION, WHICH IS EXACTLEY THE MOVIE THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE THEATRES, (which I give 4 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I though Zach Braff could do no wrong.","review":"I have always enjoyed anything that Zach Braff touches. His charm and wit has always created wonderful movies and t.v. episodes. Or at least I thought it did until I watched this movie. I found the plot dull and boring. The characters were not developed enough to become attached to or care about their outcome in the store. Story may have worked better with just a couple dating instead of a married couple who just recently became parents. The story lines did not seems to flow together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the version you want.","review":"IF YOU SAW THE EX IN THE THEATRE AND LOVED IT, THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT! THIS IS THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE THEATRE. The unrated version has a lot of material cut out, including a lot of character development and stuff that made the movie funny in the first place. This PG-13 version is 5 minutes longer than the unrated. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that this rated version is available in widescreen at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"As much as I love Zach Braff and Amanda Peet, I really thought this movie was a bust. I would have given it 1 star except for the two of them. This is a very dark \\"comedy,\\" and most of the movie is rather depressing as Braff goes from one predicament to another. You feel sorry for him rather than wanting to laugh. Jason Bateman's character is really too diabolical for a comedy, and the constant pratfalls are just not funny. The movie seems to miss its beat somehow. The concept is sort of cute, a guy whose boss just happens to be his wife's ex, but the movie is more like a foray into an evil and disturbed alternate universe than the side-splitting hilarity I was expecting. I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Worth watching, great movie. It will make you laugh with Braff's low intellingence and Bateman's pure evil. Also A guy in a wheelchair goes down the stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miss in Every Sense","review":"Zach Braff, Jason Bateman and Charles Grodin have all been funny on many an occasion. This film just isn't one of them. The film does nothing that the viewer does not expect from the previews and has two, maybe three chuckles in it. It is neither \\"Outrageously Funny,\\" as Bill Bregoli from Westwood One put it, nor does it contain any \\"off-the-wall go-for broke zaniness\\" as another reviewer put it(See the DVD cover.). Overall, it is a story that holds the viewer on edge, waiting for the insanity and laughs to ensue. Unfortunately, as the end credits role, we may be happy to see the villain get his just desserts, but we find that we didn't laugh much on the way. Be glad you didn't drop the $9 to see this one in the theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE EX...CREMENT! 1 3/4 STARS!","review":"Well, well, well! It's hard to be positive about this perplexing film. It's not funny enough to be a good comedy, it's not romantic enough to be a good love story and it's not a very good movie period! This film's only saving grace is a good cast. It's a shame, as the movie has some funny moments, but it's negated because it's so irritating! Zach Braff plays a likable guy who has no backbone and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Jason Bateman who is a fine actor plays a particularly unlikable character so well, you just want to ring his neck. I know if I were in the situation Braff was in, I would have taken care of this Jack A$$ after the second day at my new job. As comedies go this one just isn't very enjoyable, but somehow I managed to watch the entire movie mostly because I like the actors involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this","review":"This movie is unbelievably boring. It's the same old story you've seen a million times in other movies before. There are no funny jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"The scrubs guy plays a husband who has just had a baby to his wife and lost his job. So he moves back to her parents neighborhood to take a job offer from her old man. Another guy working at the company is played by Jason Bateman who plays a guy in a wheelchair who hates the scrubs guy for marrying his high school girl. He tries to do everything he can to see Scrubby fail at his job to get him fired while also trying to break up their marriage so he can move in on her.Overall; there is a few laughs, but it needed a lot more then what it does have to make it stand out as something other then an average comedy at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Movie","review":"These are two movies where I actually loved part 1 and part 2. Usually the second movie sucks, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"silly plots, but among the best action movies ever made","review":"Yes, I do mean that: these are among the best action movies ever made -- but I'll qualify by adding \\"which involve humans doing athletic things\\", such as martial arts movies. (I like the other kinds too, BTW.)But if you enjoy watching incredibly gifted athletes doing great stunts done in a very believable way, and don't mind preposterous plots, then these movies might tickle your fancy. Just being able to watch David Belle (said to be the founder of parkour/parcour) is worth the price in my opinion.So remember, don't expect any Profound Commentary on the Human Condition (thank goodness). Don't get too hung up on the silliness or the stereotypes, that's part of the fun. Just relax and enjoy great escapist fun with a good companion or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I absolutely love this series and can't wait until I'm able to buy \\"To Love Ru: Darkness\\" as well.

However, I will only use some of the exercises in the book. I will definetely not use it to teach content.

I was thrilled to hear it as a nineteen-year-old and am even more awed by its uniqueness now that I am sixty-three. I hope others will discover or rediscover this marvelous musical set too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugei","review":"Unmentioned in previous reviews is the fact that Japan itself was going through a transition in the sixties and that reality permeates the music thoroughly. You can almost feel the economic progress on faster tracks such as the dizzying Tokyo Traffic and Toki's Theme, a catchy tune written to a busy secretary. Overall, you've got more than just a couple things going on thematically; 'Impressions...' is both culturally and musically interwoven, jostling between an ancient medieval society and the economic juggernaut it has become.Make no mistake: this is a complex record, but one that succeeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Interesting than inspiring","review":"I own quite a bit of the Dave Brubeck Quartet catalogue, and while I wouldn't say that Jazz Impressions of Japan is a lackluster collection, its direction and organization aren't as focused as \\"Eurasia\\" for example. The selections, individually are mostly very high-tempo, with choppy rhythms and fills. The black sheep of the disc is most certainly \\"Zen is When\\", which for some reason leaves at two and half minutes completely unnoticed. An interesting tidbit- Dave plays a lot of fifth intervals on the piano-this is essentially what gives us the \\"Oriental\\" tone as we know it. It is also what seperates the music heard on \\"Jazz Impressions of Japan\\" from most standard American jazz. This is not recommended to all, but for true lovers of Brubeck/the music of the orient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly underrated.","review":"I was recently fortunate enough to stumble upon this album and was curious enough to listen to it. It is a surprisingly interesting, melodically memorable album, and features some great playing by the entire band.I personally prefer this album to Brubeck's \\"Jazz Impressions of Eurasia\\", which, despite rave Amazon reviews, I found to be rather boring and lackluster. Unlike many jazz albums, Jazz Impressions of Japan contains many songs that can be whistled. It is excellent melodic jazz featuring a variety of moods.Jazz Impressions of Japan is among my favourite jazz discs - listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DA best!@","review":"my chick works at a hotel, late one night i go back to where they stash the cd player which plays the tones in the lobby. i was going through the rather limited amount of cds they had when i discovered this album.

A wonderful collection of short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desolation of the Real","review":"For anyone interested in reading this, I'd just like to share my thoughts. This bok was one of the more depressing things I've read. The entire premise, it seemed, was that the reality of life in and near rural Montana is desolate, hard, and filled with things that quickly turn anyone apathetic about their own life. Its stories contain some of the most hopeless and luckless emotions and situations, and they can quickly transfer over to the reader. At any given point, I could have put the book down forever and not care at all. This, I think, is the direct result of all of the main characters being desolate, powerless, numb males. They didn't care about the outcome of their lives, and I didn't care about their outcome either.Sure, the writing style may be great from a literary standpoint, but let's be honest.

Like a true master, he makes it look simple. No bells. No whistles. Just lean to the bone writing, with the marrow clearly visible beneath the surface.

There is peace for now in Kansas Territory, with the pro-slavery soldiers having been forced to return to their home states, but Meg's father is still injured, and the bitter cold of winter has settled upon the prairie. When he is unable to regain the use of one of his arms, the family moves to the town of Lawrence, where he starts a store.

Understandable since the band's early output was generally a bit quieter than recent material and less concerned with \\"noise\\". Personally I find some of the later stuff, EP7 , for example, just as good as Amber: my problem is one of concentration. I often find it hard to sustain any kind of concentration for more than about 35 minutes, before my ears want a change of music. That's why Anti EP is probably the most often-played Autechre disc. Its three tracks are all great, although the fade-out to Flutter is a thing of extraordinary beauty. Musically, Anti EP also fits somewhere between the early and late Autechre, which means it's a fairly lively affair but is stilll pretty laid back.

His commitment to Jesus Christ, and living according to his teachings is inspiring. Kingdom Ethics is an important contribution to the field of Christian ethics. So often we see Christian ethics books which ignore the life and teachings of Jesus. These types of books are based off tradition and ideologies. However, Stassen presents a book which is grounded in a deep understanding of Jesus Christ and his work on the cross. His treatment of various subjects is superb, and especially insightful was his chapter on truthtelling. I highly recommend this book, not only as an academic work, but as a book which all Christians should read in order to live as true Christ followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagued with Inaccuracy","review":"This book contains a lot of summary judgement which falls outside the authors' expertise.

Critics panned it mercilessly for relying far too much on special effects and for being \\"not very scary\\". They had only to listen to the music soundtrack to instantly understand what the director had in mind. The movie's central theme is not one of horror per se, but about creeping paranoia and how it affects each character as one by one they fall victim to \\"The Thing\\". Morricone's score brings that out beautifully. Each track is composed to fit in perfectly with the movie's scenes, from the beginning, \\"Humanity (Part 1), to the final \\"Despair\\" where all hope is lost and the two surviving characters wait to die. If you're into horror movie soundtracks this CD is really a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate in Horror Music","review":"This music score is as great and scary as the visual special effects in the movie!

I loved the music so much that I paid $40 for the soundtrack not knowing that the soundtrack was either comprised of different versions or just didn't have the music that was in the movie. This purchase turned out to be one of my biggest disappointments. There are a few tracks that were in the movie, but almost all of the music on this album is a different version plus there are a lot of pieces of music from the movie that's missing like the music at the beginning of the movie and I especially loved the music when Macready and the others discovered the thing beast devouring the dogs, and it's missing.........UNBELIEVABLE! Honestly, I think this is a waste of money considering the amount of money that was spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I've seen the movie many times, and was expecting John carpenter's eerie background music, not this dull work which never even reminded me of the film.

This Morricone \\"limp bisquit\\" of an effort is an insult of inconsequential banality.If you know this sci-fi classic by heart then a listen to the complete \\"Thing\\" suite will evoke the entire story before your mind's eye like no other.

As in Jurassic Park, things get out of control.Gallagher's writing is very poor, however. Cliches are everywhere. He has a very annoying habit of italicizing all the emphasized words in his dialouge.

It is Goldsmith's score that keeps this film afloat and gives it much needed energy, drive and suspense. That being said, I did find this CD a bit disappointing because it omitted a great portion of the score from this recording. You truly have to watch the film to appreciate Goldsmith's work here.

Don't take the \\"Sisters\\" name too literally, i.e. Marilyn Manson and Alice Cooper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothic and exhilerating!","review":"I love this album. My favorites are Under The Gun and Temple of Love....the music is so gothic, dark yet exhilerating! Also good with lots of bass and volume.If wanting to know what SOM is like, this one is a good one.A great album to play at dance parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent text","review":"This book is among the best textbooks of several complex variables.

Most archeologists should be astonished at the number of egregious errors and incorrectly spelled words in this book. Truly shameful, in particular is that Dr. Williams takes as settled the debates on the Vinland map. In 1991 he proclaimed the issue over, yet ignored 1988 studies at UC Berkely and now new information has emerged to authenticate the date of the paper and question the earlier ink studies. Thus, the verdict on Vinland is still open for debate. And that is just one example of at least a dozen that the good Dr. misleads his readership. To put it simply, Williams is just a conservative too afraid to open the field for broader considerations. Fear of controversy gets all of us-- (and it is all of our history, not just that of archeologists)--nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical \\"No Europeans Before Columbus\\" party line","review":"Its great that a Peabody Professor can find fault with everything that does not fit in with the same old story. Williams is dead wrong on several issues. The Vinland Map has been authenticated. The Norse were in America. New Hampshire's Stonehenge dates to 3000 BC. Carib Indians had \\"canoes\\" that held more people that the ships of Columbus. Being anally retentive serves to excuse destroying everything pre-Columbian, including people, culture, monuments and even written text."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought it would be!!","review":"Do Not buy this album!!! This whole album is just a bunch of cheesy remade versions of her classic songs. There is less heart & soul in the vocals, and the productions are really Realllly bad. Although Barbara is probably my favorite soul singer, I give this album 1 star (if I could give it zero i would!!) If you want to hear any of her real music the only place to look is on the Arctic & Buddah label. the only good music you'll find from her on cd is The best of the Buddah Years.

It should be required reading in high school and for every medical profession! It was featured on PBS once and I caught just a part of the story. I searched for years to find the book.

However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle. I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a \\"dud\\", but had the same thing happen with the second pad. The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively. If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product. On a positive note, I love the facial product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INSTANT RETURN","review":"This item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet, so I bought this specifically for that use. I used the triangular pumice attachment only.I was under the impression that the attachment would rotate,but in general it's just a vibrating(2 levels) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually. The vibrations weren't intense enough to make any difference. The actual machine has no function. The body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it and it totally sucked","review":"After two months my conclussion was that I could see no change what-so-ever.

I can use the cream without the machine and get the same result, but the vibrating part is a different story. I use it to massage facial muscles and this does seem to stimulate them into being less saggy around the mouth. The vibration is too strong for the eye area. The vibration also seems to help my aching hands while using it. It is cheap enough, which is why the better review. It is good for a facial massager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"By Cindy Mokund: I think this product is an excellent purchase because the cream helps you remove the death cells of your skin with the help of the sponge making all your body look younger. I can not give an opinion about the pad because i haven't use it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This costume is cheaply made, but that is not the worst of it. It is definitely not true to size. I bought a size small for my 12-pound dachshund. He fits the measurements for that size according to the official sizing information. This costume is SO BIG that I triple-checked all the tags and packaging, which all say size small! I tried this on my 25-pound Beagle, and it doesn't even fit her! She fell out of it right away as it dragged along the floor. The velcro pieces don't match up either. There is a long strip of velcro on the back that they expect you to attach to a tiny half inch circle of it on the other side.Not worth it unless you plan to do a complete re-fitting and alteration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wagon train going west dvd's that I ordered.","review":"This was a different version of the dvd's that I ordered.

But I'll buy this OJAYS because out of the three I have, at least this one has the most of their greatest hits. I was looking for Time to Get Down because it's on that new commercial where two guys are going to a drive in and that cut is actually on the Ultimate O'JAYS.

The Monkeruds go out to see what there is to see in this classical country, but, strangely enough, it is only partly what all the rest of us see. He is at times funny, other times satirical, and at other times plain outright outrageous! But around the comedic accounts is a wonderful stroll--actually, more like a hike--through the city streets and countryside as he observes this very different world and compares it to ours. The Monkeruds take a Ric Stevestour for part of the trip, then spend some time on their own. But whether moving quickly or slowly, they not only get the feel of the land, but also get to convey it to us in a well-written style.I thoroughly enjoyed reading these adventures Italiano.

I've used it for about a month now, no significant flaws, just a great mesh filter. Of course this filter leaves more particles in coffee, but come on, it's a mesh filter so obviously you get more particles than paper filters. Just don't drink the last sip with 'mud' in it. I washed it with soap about 2 or 3 times, just rinsing and wiping is good enough for everyday use. And it has little handle, which sometimes is handy.But.....This is not a #4 filter! It is for 4 cup, not #4 coffee cone or maker. I guess it is about the size of #2. So, if you have non-Cuisinart coffee maker, keep this in mind.

Not only has all the thrash been stripped away, but the rock has shades of alternative music throughout.Although \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" starts out more or less on the right track, the album soon becomes boring, because while the soloing, time changes, and little interludes have mostly disappeared from the songs, they are still mighty long. Metallica originally wrote long songs so as to properly let them breathe, but these alterna-metal snore-fests would be better if they were short.For what it's worth, the public seemed to love this and there was suddenly a new generation of Metallica fans, yet again. It seems that Metallica knew exactly what they were doing by taking time off and then coming out with a different sound that kept them in the mainstream. That doesn't make me enjoy \\"Load\\" any more, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good album, wrong time","review":"Since this album came after the black album no wonder nobody like it!!!

It's lyrically,musically,and idea-wise (it's a bunch of rock ballads for christs sake!) a bad album. It is uninspired,plodding drivel and should be forgotten about. I respect Metallica for having the gall to change direction so sharply,but they seem to have forgotten what made them special in the first place,i.e being a metal band.It's depressing that a band can progress from starting thrash metal to being a dull mainstream rock band,in about a decade. If you want a '90s (studio) album by Metallica then get 'Metallica' or 'ReLoad'.Anything but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern 'Tallica","review":"After you do \\"The Black Album,\\" one of the best records of all time, where do you go? Apparently, if you're Metallica, you temper your metal edged agression with a newfound bluesy style. Many(and that's a huge understatement)people consider this record a sellout, but that's just not true. Sure, it's a departure from the chugging rhythms of their past, but even without that, Metallica prove they can still knock you down. \\"Wasting My Hate\\" has a laid back intro, followed by slammin' C.O.C. style riffs. Actually they sound like a more metal version of C.O.C. And listening to \\"Ronnie\\" and the sludgy \\"Cure\\" you can hear why.The change in style really benefits James Hetfield's vocals, as he sounds more down to earth, with more personality than in the past. Guitarist Kirk Hammett still serves up volley after volley of tasty wah-wah solos, although he at times sounds a little too laid back. This is a minor complaint on a successful transitional album."},{"rating":"2","title":"well...do you really want to know?","review":"Yes, I am a big Metallica fan, and own every album except for Garage Inc. My fave album is Ride the Lightning. That's enough about me, now let's talk about Load.Metallica proves, with this album, that they are still great musicians and have only improved over time. Their songs have so much going on in them. There are a lot of really good songs on this album, but there are also a few that aren't so good. I think they should go back to having 8 or 9 songs per album, because the album gets bogged down. Since I do love the old Metallica thrashing days, this album can seem like a cure for insomnia sometimes with the tempo on some of these tracks. But this album is still great. If you're more of a black album fan you will love it. I like it too.

Its not metal, but its still Metallica. Its one of Metallicas best at that. I cant see how someone could call this a bad album. A lot do because they want it to be heavier. Its not.

But they have toned down alot from what they used to be and people call them sell-outs. That is such an outrageous comment. First of all if you were a true Metallica fan you would respect them for trying to put something out that would sell. Don't get me wrong they do sound softer but metal music in the 90's is much different than 80's metal and Metallica adapted to that change.People, they are just trying to make money and put something out that you like and trying to do both of those is very hard.

This is not good, for us hard metal rockers we want hard stuff, I like Metallic, but this cd just doesn't fit my tastes as does I am sure many other hard rock Metallica fans.

But we were given plenty of warning this change for the worse was coming - The Black Album with its lack of complex structure and angst-ridden sound was the messenger with very bad news.Load is the point of no return - the point where Metallica completely handed over their identities as a musical tour de force in exchange for a chance to grab 90s grunge fans who were filling Nirvana's coffers. And just like Nirvana, Load completely lacked direction and something relevant to say to mature listeners.Where even the very poor Black Album held at least a few shreds of likeness to the Metallica of yore, Load is a mishmash of grunge, glam rock and blues that doesn't work on any level. Song structures are either boring or completely out of place. Lyrics are almost as laughable as early black metal releases. This is simply not what Metallica was meant to be.

But lo'n'behold, here we have 80 minutes of lumbering blooze-rock which wouldn't sound out-of-place on a Lynyrd Skynyrd record. That it's a Metallica album is pretty sad but not without precedent (Kirk Hammett's playing, in particular has sometimes been blanded out by some toothless blues licks). But if this CD had been made by any other band one would be hard-pressed to find anything worth listening to.To suggest that this CD is a product of 'evolution' or 'maturity' is absolutely preposterous.

That said, this album is the worst collection of refuse and nuclear WASTE that I've ever had the misfortune of hearing. If you want something new to add to your torture chamber, play this one over and over again. It works, trust me. Even my cat can't stand it.

Of course everybody wanted another Master of Puppets, but people grow up and always want to try something different. I guess the band feels more comfortable with this material, since it doesn't demand the physical state required to play a thrash metal show. With Load, Metallica change their style completely, with more mature lyrics. Mama Said is an excellent track, with country influences. It proves that Metallica hasn't sold out, just that they are musicians with a lot of different influences and a lot of talent to play almost any kind of music. Kirk Hammet has proved also that he is a great musician, since he has played with people like Santana and the jazz/funk keyboardist Herbie Hancock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Load of Something Alright","review":"Can it get any worse?

It's a good thing I can always depend on a band like Pantera never to change. I used to think the same way of Metallica until they released Load. Even for hard rock which they supposedly are now, this music still sucks on the album.

So, if you start with Load and you like that, then get Reload then the Black record and work your way into the older stuff.

I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands, such as Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Creed, Nickelback, Linkin Park, etc. etc. etc. These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well.(...)But please, people, this is sell-out since it isn't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play.

Since the BLACK ALBUM, Metallica has only released two studio albuns with inedit material: LOAD AND RELOAD (S&M and Garage Inc. does not count - one is a live compilation and the other has only covers).

Why would a fan of speed metal want to hear a Perry Como record? How many Beyonce fans would enjoy her if she began singing arias?The Black Album was bad, but this is horrific. Maybe 2 listenable songs here. No wonder Metallica were so dead set against napster, they knew no one would buy their crappy albums when they can download the 2 decent ones for free.

For everyones information i will agree with people metallica does sell out. They sell out every seat in the house everytime they play. Any album they release will always go at least double platnium. This is a strong cd where Kirk and Jason were finally allowed to play how they felt.

The new stuff Metallica is experimenting with is dynomite. This music is golden. The lyrics are starting to have more meaning and make more sense. Hetfields voice is maturing. Hetfield and Hammet are mixing roles with rhythm and lead guitars, which is good. Although \\"Mama Said\\" is a bit countrified, (not something many heavy-metal bands do), the lyrics are touching and have a lot of meaning. The first ten songs are the best on the cd. If you dont have this CD, you're missing out on a great CD.

If they could get a bass player with the same energy and feel that Cliff Burton had, maybe they could redeem themselves.It's not any different than the rest of the industry I guess.

I love old Metallica, their fast paced headbanging anthems and screaming guitar solos, but the fact is this album is not as bad as other fans would have you think. While it is far from what we usually think of as Metallica, it's still not that bad. When you listen to it, you need to not think of it as thrash like their old stuff. This is modern rock, more alike to Nirvana, Staind, Creed and Stone Temple Pilots than Slayer and Megadeth which their old stuff was like. When you listen to it that way, it's pretty good, just don't think about the other cds while you listen. This an album you should get and listen to while you read a book.

The fact is that they were in a perfect position to be LEADING the trends but instead they chose to be followers. That is unforgivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame as* detour off the metal highway.","review":"I will keep this simple. Metallica still shows decent musicianship, but no balls, no passion no real OOMPH. I love all kinds of music and I dont just hate the change in musical direction. Its a little deeper than that. Just listen to the first disc of Garage days especially the songs that were the 5.98 E.P. revisited. This is the music they cut theyre teeth on the music that helped them define theyre own sound and intensity. When you listen to most of the newer stuff it is clear that they are what, wimping out getting old who knows all I know Is I have been playing Guitar for over 17 years and I do listen to loads of music but my first loves are metal and punk and I cant see that ever changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's second best album.","review":"Many Metallica fans of the past came into this album with a close mind of what they wanted to hear from Metallica. They wanted lightning fast riffs, double bass, pretty much everything that Load isn't. Load is a genious album, simply put. James Hetfield puts forth his best lyrical effort of any album. No one can deny that The Outlaw Torn, Bleeding Me, and Until it Sleeps are among Metallica's best songs of all time. Anyway, don't listen to the close minded naysayers of this ingenious and very moody album."},{"rating":"1","title":"a band under any other name---","review":"hero of the day iz cool but beyond that the sound has changed too much. Great rock but not great Metallica. Then Lars started farting around chasing that Napster dude like he caused the end of the world or something, really they were done with the black album because everything after that was more rock oriented and alternative style. Long live Metallica 1983-1992 and selloutica should find a good new fanbase since most the youth of today are zombies and do not even realize what came before anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Metallica","review":"After making albums such as Kill em all, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice for all, it's really hard to hear this. A once awsome thrash metal legend of a band has now turned into a bunch of preppy, whiny, and soft sell outs. This band in their old days inspired hordes of thrash metal and death metal bands now has country like ballads. And do not call me small minded, do think a small style change in a metal band. Hell, Pantera, Overkill, Slayer, Testament, Metal church all changed their style, but theyt did not turn into these soft losers, they only got heavier and more progressive. Even bands like Megadeth got more mainstream, but it was mostly good except for a few crappers. So really, I'm saying If you want the thrash metal legends Metallica, steer clear of this. This is radio friendly rock or hard rock at most. Atleast I got bands like Overkill who still have just as much aggression as they ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"UG! Im tired of this crap! Not a bad album!","review":"I love Metallica, i have all of thier albums, yes even St. Anger. While St. Anger is not good, Load and Re-Load are not bad albums. Many people would prefer that Metallica had stayed the same and kept rehashing thier old stuff. Load and Re-Load are NOT heavy metal like thier older albums and the songs aren't 9 minute metal epics. These two albums have a darker, mellower, more Alternative feel to them while maintaining Metallica's signature sound. I can understand how a narrowminded \\"heavy metal only\\" person couldn't accept these albums, but people with a taste for all kinds of rock music, be it punk, metal, alternative, grunge, etc. should be able to appreciate these two albums for what they are, genuinely GOOD albums!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALCOHOLLICA","review":"They must have been loaded when they made this. If anyone wants to see my true feelings about this and the disgusting sequel to it; then check out my review of \\"Reload\\".If you're a true Metallica fan, as I am, then you already have both of these sorry attempts to imitate Metallica. You also know how I feel.What saddens me the most is that my 12 year old boy loves them. To add salt to that wound, I played \\"Master\\" for him and he didn't even believe that they were the same band! AT first I was upset, but now I have to agree with him.(he also thought that Puff Daddy wrote Kashmir) I don't blame him though, because that's what's happening to music today and Metallica has jumped right on that broken down mule.For real, true to the heart Metallica the way it's supposed to be, please buy \\"Kill 'Em All, \\"Ride The Lightning\\", Master Of Puppets\\"(my personal favorite) and the self-titled black album. I do like all three \\"Garage\\" EPs as well. They introduced me to alot of other great bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"A followup of the aclaimed 'Black Album,' arguably Metallica's best studio effort to date, Load does nothing but disappoint. It deviates from everything that one has come to expect from Metallica. The songs like Hero of the Day and Mama Said make you squirm because of the lack of everything that is Metallica from the thunderous guitar riffs to Hetfield's vocals. The only song that seems to belong to Metallica (and at the same time doesn't belong on this album, is King Nothing,) which shows why Metallica is the best at what they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics. The Achilles heel for modern Metallica.","review":"Seemingly plagued by a sudden and jarring loss of ambition, Metallica indulges full-fledge in its own overblown excesses while abandoning any semblance of intellect in its songwriting. \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" is a song straight from the Metallica men's willies into the speaker, with no cranial interruption. Unfortunately, that is not songwriting is about. So all that's left is a good Bob Rock mix and some loud, meaty guitars that have no real songs to support (hence, useless). The sonics of the album drew me in upon first listen at the record store. My brain complained when I played the CD at home, and I haven't touched it since.Metallica has died. Or, at the very least, its sense of shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, this is trash.","review":"I dont know what happen to Metallica. Mabye they tried to keep up with time (and failed). Well this album sucks. For Metallica freaks who think that Metallica is god, you people need to get a life. Ok, cause there are way more better bands out there like Pantera, Fear Factory, Cradle of Filth, Slayer, and Cannibal Corpse. If your a normal person you would know there old stuff is the best. But there are still losers who idolize Metallica. Ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleahhh...","review":"It's a pity that Metallica will not be remembered as the best band of the 80s, but rather as the band that perpetrated the worst sellout in musical history.

Load features few good songs, but the majority of the album follows the same rule Kid Rock and Shania Twain are going by: the more variety in styles, the bigger sales. Still, can you blame them? It must be damn hard to make a follower to album that has sold over 10 million(! ) copies in the States only."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the Pearl Jam song goes....Its evolution baby!","review":"Bottom line, its a different sounding metallica, and no matter what \\"hardcore metallica fans\\" say, it not a sell-out.

Thats why metallica has been around nearly 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like Puppets?? no kidding mate","review":"The transition between Justice and Black was much greater than between Black and Load. In all fairness, the album isn't bad and it shows that bands can evolve and do the 180. However, people who reckon they sold out with this one are wrong. If they ever sold out, it was when they released the black album. New producer, shorter less complex songs, softer more simplistic drumming and not really any lyrical vengeance was associated with that album, Load is just inevitable follow up to it.Now really, Black is when they changed, forget the hair, and all the makeup in the booklet and stuff, they changed when they released black, an album caught in a bluesy/older style time warp. Load, suprisingly more musical then black, is just the washup that had to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks","review":"Metallica's older stuff is a lot better, because it is a lot more raw and heavier.

When I first bought it, I didn't believe it. It was all wrong, nothing looked like Metallica, not even the band!

I feel that Metallica made a wise decision in taking a slightly different route.So what about the album? Until it sleeps and Hero of the Day are my personal faves although there is nothing on this album that I did not like. It does lack some the edge of previous albums but this is replaced by a depth which breaths in new life. Mama Said is probably the best example of this.If you are expecting more of the same then this album is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for something a bit different then here it is. Either way, you should at least give this album a chance, it IS good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is bad","review":"i think metallica needs to go back and listen to their albums starting at ride the lightning and stopping at the black album. every album since is really bad, maybe one good song on each of them. in the last 6 years they have only produced 1 song that i would say is great. that song is the unforgiven II, which is really sad that they had to basically steal an idea from anouther album."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful trip into the hell that is a sellout band.","review":"Lets get one thing straight.If Metallica is going to write soft music,then can't they at least make the music good!!!Listen to an awesome soft song like Nothing Else Matters.Then Listen to Mama Said!You may just want to kill yourself afterwords."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is metallica?","review":"I must say that while I don't think Metallica sold out, I do however, feel that this cd is a bunch of crap. I loved there cd before load (even though it was a little different from their previous recordings), and all there other cd's. One reason why I don't like this cd is it contains nothing that made me like Metallica in the first place, i.e double-bass drum, hard-headbanging riffs, heavy bass, amazing solo's, excellent lyrics etc... Until It Sleeps, King Nothing are decent songs but they pale in comparison to any other song Metallica has put out. Bottom Line-Only buy it if you collect Metallica cd's or if you didn't like there other cd's, then and only then will you like this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Sellout","review":"Mettalica has sold out.

For me take 'Bleeding me' and 'The outlaw torn' and that's all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best metallica album, but it's still awesome","review":"Well, load is a different direction for the horsemen, but hey, i don't blame 'em for mixing it up a bit. Wouldn't you get tired of playing the same style of music for 15 years? Their music still rocks, though jaymz's singing isn't the stereotypical screaming anymore. 2x4 and King Nothing rock, although don't expect the same amazing technical skill you saw on the 80's albums. People complain about the lack of double bass drum on this album, but the two bass drums still make an appearance at every live show.

All their previous albums were serious heavy metal music which really doesn't appeal to me. Their newer albums such as Load and Reload really show a more mainstream less heavy metal banging style that really allows all those out there that like Rock/Alternative music but not the heavy heavy metal stuff to buy and enjoy these albums. If your a Metallica fan of the old style, then yes I can see how you would say they Sold Out but if you like music the leans toward the metal side with a nice tune but is not screaching yelling music, then I highly recommend this album as well as Reload and the Black Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but I expected more","review":"If you listen to every album from Kill to the black album then you would know that this album with ReLoad is different. However my response regarding Load and ReLoad is not negative. Its not as powerful as their previous LP's but its still has some of that trade mark Metallica sound. I think what Metallica did here was to attract new fans but for someone like me who has been a fan for about 11 years, it was hard at first to grip this album. Eventually I grew on to it instead of bashing it. Overall its not a bad album if you think about it. It could of been worse the band could've put out a folk or country album. Metallica will always be the greatest band on this planet along with Megadeth,Iron Maiden, Anthrax, Ozzy solo/Black Sabbath/AC/DC/Led Zeppelin/Judas Priest, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Sepultura, Soundgarden, Slayer, Fear Factory, Faith no More, Korn, Deftones, Rage against the Machine, Punk and Blues music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Between 2 and 3 stars, more veering towards 2","review":"well, this album isn't NEARLY as Metallic as others, but it's still decent music if you forget who wrote it.... people say Metallica sold out. my reply to that is, Metallica didn't sell out, they changed their style..I must say I was VERY disappointed with Load, so much so that I didn't buy it. I did however buy ReLOAD, for one song, Fuel.While this album does not scream sell-out, it doesn't scream metal either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most dissapointing record of all time","review":"The \\"Black album\\" was a big step towards \\"mainstream music\\", but it stayed pretty much inside the metal genre. All bands at some point tend to experiment with other styles, and the result of that is almost the same everytime. Metallica's case is a little bit complex. They went through a whole change, and the most impressing was the change of look. The photos in the booklet, tha hair cuts, i have nothing against that. But it shocked everybody. For old metallica fans..with their high-mental-inertia the change was too much, and the sold out was finally completed.All of the speed is lost, and their solos too.The album has a good song, though:Until It Sleeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOAD WHAT ????","review":"If you like this, you have nto heard MASTER OF PUPPETS or RIDE THE LIGHTNING or even AN JUSTICE FOR ALL. I'm not saying a band can change or try new approaches. Not at all. I'm just saying that, when doing so, one must feel that they are doing it with their hearts, and the new music don't loss force or spirit. But both are lacking in LOAD. It seems a band who has never played metal before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Posing","review":"Please, everyone, stop posing as wannabe music critics. You liked Load, or you didn't. Most likely, your sophomoric opinion of the album is no reflection on the worth of the material. Who are you, after all, to criticize? Did you glean the phrase \\"sell-out\\" from your subscription to Rolling Stone? From your pseudo-intellectual brew pub buddies? Did you post here simply for a response, or do you have something to say about the music? If you want 8 subtle metamorphoses of \\"Kill 'Em All,\\" find a garage cover band incapable of growth.If you didn't grow alongside Metallica, hold your tongue. No true (longtime) fan is interested in the \\"we want more thrash\\" drivel slobbered from the mouths of neo-\\"fans.\\" You are incapable of comprehending the fruition of the sweetest collaboration in the genre. Do you recognize the term?The band, Metallica, grew up. The most beautiful part of the equation is, they kept making music.Mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks A Big Load Of Suckage","review":"There are only 4 songs I can honestly make it through on this album. Metallica largely sold albums on their name after the Black album. Every other band would have been put out of business had they released this swill. It just goes to show how crappy the 90s metal scene was that people actually like this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome, but could have been better","review":"A lot of songs on here are awsome, but a lot arent. The best songs on this album are Until it sleeps, Mama said, King Nothing, Bleeding me, Hero of the day and Outlaw torn. Until it sleeps being the best. This is defiantly not there best but its not there worst. Cough(St. Anger)Cough!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"+++ LOAD of CRAP!! +++","review":"I am a hardcore MetallicA fan and i can tell you that this is not MetallicA, this is Metallica trying to keep up with other bands and updated metal. They cut their hair, started wearing make up, and playing blues style rock while drinkin martini's instead of an old fashioned beer can, get me? Load is different in deed, too different. All though they did surprise me with a few good songs such as ''Hero of the Day,King Nothing,Until it Sleeps, and Bleeding Me (The best one on the album). Im not angry or hate them for it, im just not used to it, but still it's Metallica and it was just a fase. Buy this at a yard sale or flea market for cheap, dont pay the full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Change their Name to \\"Popica\\"","review":"I must say that the downturn for Metallica began with the Black Album. The intensity and high voltage sound was pretty much dying on that album. But now, this isn't even the same group. I could care less if they decided to take their music in a \\"new\\" direction. But they should change their name. They are no longer a metal band. They are a pop band. Plain and simple. This belongs next to the Barry Manilow cds.We metal fans will just have to stick with Cannibal Corpse and Slayer. Which is fine with me, they both rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got the title right....","review":"This album is garbage. Sellout pop metal, radio crap from these former thrash giants.

Horrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is being generous","review":"\\"Load\\" is almost the appropriate name for this album. More like a \\"Diaper Load\\" if you ask me. They sold out folks! Bands are better when they start out with a purpose and making a sound of their own, despite what was \\"popular\\". Success and excess ruined this band by chasing the almighty dollar. This CD lacks heart, originality and talent. Spinal Tap has come back as Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had a dream the other day...","review":"...It was about the old Metallica meeting the new greedy b**ta**s. The younger James said to the older one \\"how could you let me turn into you?\\" and continued to toss a match onto his gel-ridden hair and watch him explode. The mullet Lars Ulrich beat up the greedy one, and then pissed on him. Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted teamed up with Kirk Hammetts younger self and threw the older Hammett off of a cliff. Megadeth Mustaine and Metallica Mustaine just stood there and laughed, while Slayer and Anthrax cried at the fact that a once musically beautiful and talented band had turned into a bunch of money-hungry f**ks!(this dream was TOO true)Well, I guess that 'Aint My B**ch' and 'King Nothing' are decent songs, but the rest is crap and proves how lazy Metallica became."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget Metallica, go buy Mayhem instead","review":"Metallica's first 4 albums are the best (ahhh the good old '80s). Forget anything that came after it - I believe drinking too much alcohol has killed most of their brain cells. Now if you are looking for 21st century thrash then try Mayhem -their latest album \\"Chimera\\" is utterly brutal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how the mighty have fallen","review":"No, Metallica did not sell out. They merely changed their style at a time when everyone else was doing the same thing, nothing to get in a stink over. But, it sucks. They tried to change their style like everyone else and they failed miserably. This is a ridiculously overrated album and I'm just glad that most of my friends who once liked it are finally coming around."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad!","review":"the opening track is pretty gooduntil it sleep ,mama said and hero of the day toothe rest is pure crap, outlaw torn is awfull 9 minutes songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica without ideas","review":"They should have taken time off. Spent some time in rehab or just wait for musical inspiration. And I think I am being generous by giving 2 stars. If it were not for the song Hero of The Day, this would be ONE star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very different Metallica, but not THE greatest","review":"I dont know why so many people say that this is one of, if not THE best album from the band. Lets be honest, its ok for a band to change, like most of you said, it becomes boring when a band keeps playing the same thing over the years (like Iced Earth and many others), but hey, this album stands very LOW compared to the first four albums. Ok, there are some new nice things to hear (like Poor Twisted Me and Until It Sleeps), the mayority of the songs simply...!!!This is not like other bands (like Dream Theater, Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, or even In Flames) that change their style, but keep writing strong different material that keep their respective genre growing! If you listen to this album, it completely stands off from what they are supposed to be playing. Look at the Justice album for example, its so different from the first three, setting the direction for a whole prog, trashy, very tecnical thing! Instead, they ... wrote the Black Album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MEMORY INDEED REMAINS","review":"Load is an attempt to stray away from a style that made Metallica famous amongst those of us who were nobody, those of us who fought through High School as nobodies but had this great band, and the few of us that were nobodies fought together, with old school Metallica, it meant so much to us.Albums like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning are untoppable; I think the worst thing a band can do is press forward with mainstream garbage. A collection of poorly designed rythms, and while the lyrics might be pretty good, who cares. The lust is gone.I thank Metallica for the tough years they helped myslf and my friends through, its payed off. But Im in complete disgust with their last ten years and I learn a new lesson from it: STICK TO YOUR GUNS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I happened to be...","review":"cruising regular radio today and one of the stations was Lite FM (just by the title you can tell what type of music it is) and I heard a song titled Mama Said. The voice sounded VERY FAMILIAR! When the song ended and by Metallica, I knew I was done! The last GOOD Metallica cd was.. well, you know. Cliff needs to be resurrected and whip the 3 horsemen back into shape! Long Live Cliff!NO STARS FOR ME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The honest truth","review":"Y'know, a lot of people give credit to metallica saying that they were changing their music to keep up with the times. B.S.I mean seriously, instead of going grunge/alternative, they could've gotten HEAVIER. I mean yeah, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in chains were all around at that time......BUT SO WERE CANNIBAL CORPSE, OBITUARY AND PANTERA!!!!!They should've gotten louder and more evil, not softer and more... mature.Or... they could've just stayed... metallica.I mean, look at slayer. They made some changes, and it was probably good they didn't attempt another reign in blood, but they stayed close to the same. And slayer is, in my opinion a better band(louder, heavier, and more INSANE!)I'm probably gonna get a lot of $h1t for saying this, but if they wanted to do slower songs... why not just do an album with songs like ONE? Start out slow, speed up toward the end, make a @#$!in' epic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & weak","review":"I totally disagree with the reviews that claim how \\"nice\\" and \\"cute\\" heavy metal should be. The FIRST lesson to know about heavy metal is that this music is played fast. This music is energizing, blazing and filled with riffs, except the ballads, of course, which are played by their own atmospheric tunes. However, Load lacks any kind of heavy metal riffs and tunes which are defined way beyond in the beginning of 70's by the bands like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. I request fans of Metallica, especially the new ones who don't know anything about the history of heavy metal, to respect this music and not associate the after \\"Black\\" era materials of Metallica with it. There are LOTS of differences between Southern Boogie Rock and Heay Metal.A few spins of Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" (1970) or Judas Priest's \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" (1984) against \\"Load\\" should be enough to present you the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maturity involves forgetting how to play? Got it.","review":"I have a question. When an band goes mainstream after years of being a well kept secret, why is it always called maturity? Face it dudes, these guys do put out a load, but of what, pray?Maturity? I assume that means to most Alt-heads that the lead singer must whine, the guitars must sound like a pale country imitation and the lyrics must bore.To those who say that one must grow up.. I couldn't agree more! Everyone needs to mature but maturity involves one thing that this former band does not have. A sense of when to quit. Metallica should have quit back in the early 90's when it was clear their style was going to pot.If this is maturity, I will stick with adoloscence thank you very very much, at least children know the value of a good song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Metallica","review":"This album continued and exaggerated the trend that the black album started. It's much more... \\"rockish\\" or \\"mainstream\\" than their albums from the 80s that demonstrated speed metal at its finest. To me, this album depicts the depth of Metallica's talent. How many bands do you know of that could dramatically change their sound, even style, and do it well? These guys are musicians. Most people over the age of 35 will disagree with me, but they are. Unlike many of my fellow Metallica fans, I don't believe they \\"sold out.\\" This album is still Metallica, and it is very good. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I don't believe everyone (my grandmother) will appreciate it. However, if you like Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Bush, Silverchair, etc... then this album is recommended for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Load rules and so does METALLICA!!!","review":"I cant figure out why a lot of people didnt like this CD. I love it! Its among my favorite Metallica albums like S&M Reload Ride the Lightning and ...And Justice For All. There wasnt a single thing that I didnt like about this CD. ... I must say that this is one of the best Metallica CDs. So if youre going to buy Load I recomend Reload and S&M. They are the best Metallica albums EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't give me that sell-out BS.........","review":"I cannot believe how many people have given this album a hard time. Just because Metallica came into this album after having put out 5 speedier albums doesn't mean that this one should be in any way similar. Sure some songs seem a bit slow and not at all what we thought Metallica to be but hey I guess if they like what they do then really what we (the fans/listeners) think doesn't really matter. Personally this album marks a stand against narrow mindedness of most so called \\"hard-men of heavy metal\\"...give this album a chance cos some of these songs are truly epics...for example 'Outlaw Torn' and 'Bleeding Me' are up there with the likes of 'One' and 'Fade To Black'. Anyway this stuff will grow on you I can assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing to do with maturity","review":"Let me ask you something... if a blues band came out with a Thrash metal album... what would their faithful blues fans think???? That's what's happening here. This is not \\"fade to black\\" as compared to \\"hit the lights\\" (which, by the way, Metallica was first critized for selling out on). Fade to Black, Sanitarium, One... all those songs are metal songs. They just have calm parts. The songs on Load are completely different from the category of metal. A thrash metal band went from thrash metal to bluesy alternative. Completely changing your music style has nothing to do with maturity. You want maturity go check out \\"And Justice For All\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM REALLY SUCKS!!","review":"Metallica sold out!They suck now!METALLICA RULED 1983-1991 and now they suck!Sounds like heavy country music to me and I hate country music and hicks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, people see that Metallica really has sold out!","review":"Load was a waste of my hard earned cash. Save your money. Over the last 3-4 years Metallica has shown us all that they have stopped growing musically. They have sold out to corporate America! Check out Mustaine and Co!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it when this happens...","review":"Am I the only one who thinks these guys are gay? Is that their new target audience? Wearing makeup has a different meaning in the 90's than it did in the 80's. This is not some 'inspirational' turn in their career, it is the sound of old guys who need to give up or at least change the name of the band. I hate it when bands (and shows) get run into the ground. It's better to die with pride and just stop making albums. I feel sorry for Cliff, he must be in Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT AIN'T TOO BAD...","review":"It wasn't what I expected at first, but it tends to grow on you.

After two albums, I stopped listening because it was the same old stuff.. It had no originallity what so ever - You can only do so much with \\"speed metal\\". Well, because of this album I'm once again a Metallica fan. It's original, heavy, and better than ever! It was time for speed metal to take a bow. It came, it rocked, it went. Thank God Metallica saw the end of speed metal - with this album, they have stepped into the boundries of what REAL heavy metal is all about. Great CD !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cow semen in blood?","review":"Bad album, bad cover. This signified the end for Jason Newsted. I don't blame him one bit. The heaviest band on the planet with a cover of cow semen in blood? I know, it's not about that, it's about the music. So let's get into it. THIS IS TERRIBLE! Yes I understand growth but c'mon. The real problem isn't the haircuts or any of that crap. IT'S BOB ROCK! He needs to go. He ruined a great band. Anyone who loves this cd probably jumped on the wagon after the Black album. Well posers, stay on the wagon. You'll find me listening to Kill-Ride-Puppets-Justice-Music that still holds up today."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?!","review":"In my book, this is not the best Metallica album, probably one of their worst. The best are Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning. There are some good, memorable songs on this album, but the rest are dead ends. The bluesy thing would be ok if they kept it like the Black album, but in here it sounds almost like country music. The album gets boring if you listen through and this is where Metallica loses its reputation of being a heavy and fast thrash metal band. Lyrically, it's horrible. On some songs it's like James isn't even trying, like on Bleeding Me. The guitar work is good, but the riffs and solos aren't too exciting. The drumming is the least of what Lars can do and Jason, as always, is practically shunned out. It just amazes me how they could make the greatest metal album of all time (Puppets) and then turn into this nonsense. This isn't real Metallica music. This isn't even metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica let us all down","review":"For me, this album signaled the end of an era. When I heard this album, I knew metal was dead and was never coming back. When it became clear that instead of leading a new metal revolution Metallica had decided to follow the alternative trend, I was truly hurt beyond words. Only Metallica had the chops and the street-cred to revive metal at that time and they made a conscious choice not to. Instead, they sounded and looked (in their videos) as if they desperately wanted to be Nirvana. For those of us who supported Metallica in the 80s when they were a no-compromise-at-any-price band, this album was like a physical wound. I will never forgive them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"I didn't grow up with Metallica so I guess I had the benefit of not being shocked by such a different sound compared to their older stuff. I slowly collected all their albums a few years ago, and I think too many di-hards come down on this album, along with reload. Load is a great album, and while its a pretty a big transition from the past, it's still Metallica at heart. Wasted My Hate, King Nothing, and Bleeding Me are my favorites.

Even though black was softer than justice and puppets, it still had some great riffs. Load has none. Songs like mama said and hero of the day are just not what metallica are good at. Absolute no song on here is good. They are so bad they cant even be put into the pathetic category. Stay away from this unless you are a die hard metallica and simply have to have just for the sake of having it. Dont buy it for the music!!!

It's very, very sad... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the REAL Metallica?!?!?!?!?!?!","review":"Metallica is now moving in the wrong direction. Metallica, Metallica was one of the best albums ever written but the greatness of that album seems to have overshadowed this album which was not a very disappointing thing in my opinion. They seemed to have changed styles from fast, hard and difficult guitar work to slower more mellow and almost blues guitar work. Some of the songs resemble old style Metallica, but the vast majority of the songs are a disappointment to the Metallica legend. I'd like to think that Metallica is still capable of creating the genuine hard rock that they use to make, but now I'm afraid that this might be a sign that their reign at the top is coming to a tragic and unnecessary end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?

I'm not saying they have to play fast again, because their previous albums aren't constant speed. Just listen to \\"Kill 'Em All\\", that album wasn't all fast. Most of their albums were just flat out heavy. I was a fan for 10 years (notice I said WAS) and I have to put up with this garbage? Go away, you are bannished from my CD collection.

I didn't pick up listening to them until the black album, but I've since bought and listened to the others and found something that truly rocks. After literally listening to death tapes of all their other albums, I couldn't wait for Load, until I heard it. I never even bothered to buy it. Honestly, I think it wouldn't have been a bad album...if someone else had done it. Guys, I hate to say it, but this was worse than a disappointment.

The group has clearly matured and grown, and they do reflect this in their sound. They still rock just as hard but now James is more or less singing instead of yelling. There are more ballad types of songs on the album, like \\"Bleeding Me\\", \\"The Outlaw Torn\\", or my favorite tracks \\"Until it Sleeps\\" and \\"Hero of the Day\\". Harder tracks are \\"King Nothing\\", \\"2X4\\", and \\"Ain't My Bitch\\". This album is the best they released from 1991-1998 so buy it if you are a Metallica fan.

I bought it on the first day it came out, and I don't regret it for a second. My favourite tracks are Hero Of The Day, Mama Said, Bleeding Me, The House Jack Built, King Nothing, and of course, Until It Sleeps. It's a step better than Reload.

Now I will agree with most of you and say there are a few Side B songs that I don't listen to but other than that, Ain't My Bitch, 2 x 4, King Nothing and Hero Of The Day (and a few others)are above what most other bands are doing... so get over it if they aren't playing 1,000 miles per hour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to my Metallica?","review":"1996 was a sad, sad year for metal. I was a HUGE metallica fan since I was a kid. My older friend across the street introduced me to Metllica with the Black Album. I saved all my allowance and birthday money to buy every Metallica album and tshirt I could get my hands on. I didn't have a 15th birthday party because all I wanted was tickets to the Metallica show.So you can imagine my disgust and disappointment when Load came out. After the Black Album (and a few years after the death of their bassist) Metallica decided to go through a sort of metamorphosis and change their style a bit. No more 90 minute rock ballads...no more speed metal...no more totally insance guitar solos that lasted forever. Basicly they toned it down a notch. I don't like it...at all.

Im not using the whole 'selling out' thing as an excuse not to like this album either. I have listened to Load many times trying to give it a chance; I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't there.

An open note to James and the boys: if you would get back to writing great music like ...And Justice For All and Ride the Lightning, you wouldn't have to worry about your fans downloading the few good songs for free, they'd go buy the album.

It doesn't inspire me to bang my head, kill my parents, start doing drugs and worshipping the devil like metal is SUPPOSED to do. No, it makes me want to listen to FM radio and sing along with Lit, SUM 41 and Blink 182. At least those bands are consistant.

The greatest crime however is the complete reduction of Guattari to that of another instance of the machine Deleuze. Guattari's value to Deleuze seems to always be reduced and it is to everyone's loss. If one would read Guattari before he met Deleuze everything in the \\"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\\" (at least that on language) is already present.

We played it for exactly 30 minutes and could not figure out what everyone else found to be fun about the game. It was soooooo much worse than the WII game. My daughter and I mastered the cardio dance (which really wasnt dancing - more like some kind of cheerleading movements) within minutes. We did a couple other exercises- none that were anything to write home about. The scenery was kind of cheesy, the music (or lack thereof) was horrible, and we hardly broke a sweat doing the exercises that we like. In a word- BORING.

The company should really develop and include in the game an extension for the leg strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not register my movements","review":"I think the overall concept of EA Active is great. The problem is that the actual product does not follow through.- The game does not register my movements. Many times it does not register that I've done the exercise. It just stays stuck in one place. Even if I'm holding still, it will tell me that I'm not.- Too much downtime between exercises. I wear a heart rate monitor and my heart rate drops too much between exercises for it to be effective.- Not intensive, or enough, cardio.- Resistance band is cheap and does not provide enough resistance to really work muscles.Overall, I find this be a big waste of money. I really expected more from EA and Nintendo with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Something Else","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I was so looking forward to getting into some fun exercise, but this was more annoying than anywhere near exercise. As others stated, the leg band kept falling down (and it's not because my thighs are skinny!), if I wasn't holding the controls perfectly, the exercise would stop and I would have to stand there for a long time until I figured it out. This happened over and over. The competitions are not challenging at all. Maybe, just maybe, this would work for someone who has NEVER worked out before. They might find it fun. But if you are looking for a workout that is challenging and enjoying, this is not for you. I wish I would have listened to the critical comments instead of the great ones. I learned a lesson! I would have saved myself time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Awkward","review":"I think this game is great in theory, but it wasn't well implemented, particularly with regard to the controls. The leg strap falls off too easily. It's difficult to get the game to recognize your movements unless you hold the controller just so or have it just perfectly positioned in the pocket of the leg strap. The resistance band is chintzy and weak. I found myself struggling more with controls, the strap, and the band then with the actual workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Active","review":"I got tired of this very quickly.

The game has no idea what my movements are. It says to run on the track, so when I start running in place, the message on the screen constantly switches back and forth from \\"perfect\\" to \\"too slow\\" even though I'm running at the same pace for the entire exercise. The resistance band that comes with the game is not even challenging for my 7 year old daughter. I'm not sure if it's 2 lbs or 5 lbs, but it's useless. When performing curls, the game repeatedly told me to hold still and hold my arms like the person on the screen. I ended up doing about 30 curls and it only registered one of them. I have no reason to believe this is a Wii hardware problem as the family plays lots of other games on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout Program!","review":"I love this program. I have only been using it for a few days now. I have started the 30 day challenge and so far it has been actually fun to workout.

We both have noticed that some of the upper body workouts don't push us hard enough. He is used to lifting 50+ lb dumbbells, so using the resistance band didn't do much for him.

I amped up to the \\"hard\\" setting on the Challenge, and I have to say, it was not challenging at all.

Oh wait again while I take out the numchuk and get the band and put it on the floor and step on it to perform next exercise.Constantly have to stop, wait and stand still for the instructor because the program does not sense motion properly when a rep has been performed correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've been working out with this for the last two weeks and love it. This game is what the wii fit should have been. It's like having a personal trainer in your home and the interval training is a good workout of cardio and strength exercises. Right now I'm 9 months pregnant so I'm doing the 30 day workout in easy mode, but it's great and I look forward to working out on the hard mode after I have my baby to get my body back! There are two things, though. I bought a heavier resistance exercise band because the one that comes with the game is a very light resistance and even though I can't do stomach exercises now while I'm pregnant, I wish this game had stomach exercises for after I have the baby. I guess I can pop in my wii fit game after working out to get in some stomach training.

At first it seemed pretty promising. But within a week both bands broke, so we went out and bought bungee style bands...which is fine except holding both the band handles and the wiimote is a bit difficult. Especially with how sensitive this game is to the direction and orientation of your wiimote.But the biggest pain (literally) is the fact that every single time we did alternating lunges, reverse lunges, or jump lunges, the game would hold us longer on our left leg than our right. I'm talking like 3 seconds longer each time. We ended up just holding our right lunges an extra 3 seconds so we didn't end up all lopsided with one gigantic leg and one normal sized leg.My wife also had so much trouble getting the game to recognize her movements that she finally gave up on the game completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"The leg strap falls off easily. The game doesn't do a good job registering your movements and you can't keep going once it decides your not moving your arm in the exact correct position, even if you are actually moving the correct way. You can customize your workouts but you can't just go in and try different activities, you have to actually set up a workout in order to even just try one exercise, which is time consuming when you just want to try the different activities. There are no core muscle exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for lefties","review":"I, overall, have really enjoyed this product. I am already a fairly active person, and I was looking for something I could do at home in colder weather.I am disappointed that the games almost require that on be right handed to use it. I know it's simple to just switch hands, but it's a lot more difficult that way. With the expense of the game, you would think they would have a left-handed avatar.Also, I don't like the jumping exercises. My personal trainer is always telling me to hold still or that I'm going too fast when I know that I am still or moving at an appropriate speed. But, he's a lot cheaper than a real PT would be, so I can't really complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the Ea Sports Active","review":"Jost got the \\"game\\" today and absolutely love it. My biceps and shoulders are so sore from the bicp curls and shoulder press with the resistance band.

The only minor flaws i found were that the ends that you had the put on the resistance band weren't easy to put on at first as the resistance band smacked me in the face a couple of times. The knee patch also came off a couple of times when excersing and as you can imagine it did get a little annoying, but not annoying enough to stop the excersie just snap it back on and kept going.

Very poor design to have the exercise come to a dead stop if it cannot read what you are doing.Also, the intensity of the exercise is lacking. I am an overweight couch potato trying to get a bit more fit, and I have a hard time breaking a sweat on a lot of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as people say","review":"I am a mom of 2 and have been trying to get some workout in at home. I thought this would be very challenging. The upper body workout is not challenging at all and there is no ab workout. With in a week of using this the resistant band broke. I thought I would just return it since I barely even used it. I was told that I could only exchange for another one. I was not happy about that. I would not get this item again if I had the choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game gets you working!","review":"I get so sore! I have a difficult time motivating myself to exercise because I get bored. I decided it would be fun to try either the Biggest Loser or EA Sports wii game and I'm so glad I decided to get this one. I like it much more than I had imagined. I have had this game for 2 weeks now and I still enjoy using it everyday! I'm definately getting a workout and I'm only on the easy settings. My favorite is the target boxing! I would really like to get the EA Sports Active: More Workouts as this game does not have the cool down and the ab work that I think is important. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a fun workout at home. My 10 year old son and 13 year old daughter love it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big hassle","review":"I hated putting on the leg strap. which always fell down or completely off. Also, when you're doing the exercises a lot of of times the game doesn't pick up your movement so you are stuck and not able to move ahead. Total pain. I ended up buying an exercise DVD instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"When I ordered this I thought that I was going to be getting the wii fit board, I discovered I was wrong when the package came and it turns out that i didn't read the full description on the website. Other than that the game is very good. There is a an option where you can do a 30 fitness program and what I really like about that part is that if you start it and you end up not having too much time then the game allows to begin the whole thing over at another time."},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Sports Active","review":"I love this product because it's like having a personal trainer and it keeps me motivated. I can do the workouts at my own pace and for as much or as little as I choose. So even on a very hectic day, I can still fit in a short workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I have to say that this is a really great workout. I was disappointed with the Wii Fit as it seemed geared more towards kids and many of the activities were for balance and timing. This \\"game\\" provides an excellent workout in about 40 minutes (depending on if you watch the tutorials). It nicely tracks your goals and progress and allows you to enter diet and other activity information. It is also a good mix of cardio and muscle strengthening/toning. 2 drawbacks...but would not deter me from getting the game in any way...the resistance band is very weak. Since I already had some other bands this wasn't a big deal. The other issue is sometimes the nunchuck does not \\"register\\" as in the correct position. Many times simply lunging lower will fix the issue. All around great title and worth the dough if you want to lose weight!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nun chuck Awkward","review":"I wanted to diversify from Wii fit and play a fitness game with my daughter. First thing I noticed is that even in two player mode you are required to strap the nun-chuck to your thigh. We have two nun chucks but the game only comes with one thigh strap - not something one would get extras of. So after getting irritated me and daughter started skipping all nun-chuck thigh exercises which ruined the workout.But even trying it alone I found the nun-chuck as used in this game annoying, I would be hit by the wire, have movement restricted by the wire or the whole strap and numchuck fall off my leg.In short I am still looking for a game to supplement Wii Fit Plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the update in November","review":"EA Sport Active is a great concept. An interactive coach that monitor your form, speed, etc while performing the reps with you is amazing. Unfortunately, this software come with a big issue; it has glitches. Certain exercises cannot be recognized, no matter how you attempt to mimic the fitness model. What happens? The game stops (trying to correct you) and you become increasingly frustrated. This can go on for 4, 5, 8 mins. Worse than the frustration is you lose the 'pump' and your heart rate drops (I wear a monitor). Finally you cancel out that session and on to the next... and it will happen again on another exercise. I contacted the tech's at the software company and they said 'Yeah, we know. We get a lot of complaints on it' only to end the conversation with 'maybe it's your form?' It's not. They made a ton of money on a faulty software. You've been warned. Make a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Active exercise program","review":"I got this program because I needed some variety in my exercises. I have the Wii Fit and Wii Fit plus and liked those. The Active is good, really gets you going and it's fun. The only thing I don't like is once you know how to do each exercise I wish they didn't have the tutorials come up each time, I would rather just go from one exercise to the other without having to click through the tutorials.Otherwise, it's a good program. At least it gets me up off the sofa."},{"rating":"2","title":"works up a sweat","review":"I'm not big on exercise videos but I like the Wii so I decided to try this. I did two workouts sessions and was pretty sore the next day, but I'm not a gym rat and I'm not in the best shape. I'll give it a try, but you do have to be pretty on target with how the controller is either held or placed. Sometimes it didn't do such a hot job of tracking my movements and stalled the exercise that I was working on which was annoying so I had to repeat more reps here and there.Overall, I'll have to see how effective it is, I'm trying the 30 day program so I'll see how toned I get. I'm also curious to see how much variety there will be with the exercises in the 30 day program. I may switch it up to whichever areas I'm targeting. Also, there were a lotta squats...."},{"rating":"1","title":"just OK","review":"The 30 day challenge has a lot of running and jumping which is very hard on the knees. I already had one replacement (and need the other knee replaced) so I have to take many of these exercises out of my workout. The ones left are okay but I don't feel that I get that good of a workout. And you definitely need to have the remote and nunchuck in the correct position or they won't register your movements.If you choose to use the balance board, you either have to take off and put on your sneakers several times or (as I now do) just keep them on while using the board. I know this isn't recommended but it is less of a hassle.I finished the 17th day of the challenge today. I still do WiiFit Plus everyday in addition to this one. I enjoy WiiFit Plus much better than this one but I will continue to use both. (P.S. I DO NOT WEAR shoes when using Fit Plus.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Lunges!","review":"I think this is a good personal trainer.

I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"leg strap too short","review":"I didn't get too far because the leg strap is too short to fit high enough on my leg for the nunchuck to register well. For the first running exercise I could just put it in my pocket, but the squats were just impossible. I may give it one more try to see if there is any way I can rig this thing to work with my body, but otherwise I may just return it. When making a fitness product, it helps to consider that people who aren't fit and are looking to change that may want to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues with lunges","review":"The games is fun and seems to be a good work out.I am having some issues and am hoping someone here may have a solution.There seems a glitch is that while doing the side lunges and the squats, it got stuck after doing only one and would not let me complete another one. I thought it may be I was too far away so I moved closer.It did not help.I retried the exercises but they still did that in the same spot. I ended up having to skip them and go to the next one.

It's a very good workout and really fun. But I think they purposely designed this game to wear out your tools. The nunchuk is always moving back and forth to the leg strap and hand... and gets knocked around during volleyball bumps. After one week our leg strap has shredded. No one is very large or heavy- it just gets stretched too often with all the in and out. I think they should have designed the workouts so that all the leg exercises are together, instead of alternating them with upper body, or included a slimmer tool that will fit easier into the strap and be more sensitive to movement than the standard nunchuck. The resistance band exercises are awkward sometimes. The Wii doesn't always pick up your movements, expecially if the remote and nunchuck are not positioned perfectly. It's frustrating. But I love the game and hope I can get the leg strap replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Sports Active Personal Trainer","review":"Alot of fun and very much a workout.

It was more fun and games. this you actually sweat. the only thing I don't like about it is that the resistance band isn't hard enough. but I figured that I could just go to walmart or some store and buy harder ones (they are pretty cheap). I don't work out really at all but I really enjoyed it I was sweating by the end and there is 3 levels that you can choose from. I choose the easy level to start out with and it gave me a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I hate working out but I did enjoy this workout, you can definitely feel the burn especially the next day. My only complaint is the elastic strap is too long so you have to fold it over to get a good workout and the handstraps doo not stay tied to it very well.

While I did break a little sweat...this game was not challenging enough for me. I could see how this game would be good for someone who is just starting out with exercise, but as I already get regular vigorous exercise, it just didn't cut it. I also found the resistance band to be flimsy and a bit of a joke, not providing enough resistance to get real toning. Also, if I am going to run...I am going to run outside in the sunshine and fresh air, not run in place in my apartment. While I did like the boxing challenges, the rest I could have done without. I liked Wii fit's yoga and strength training much better as it focuses on balance and correct posture. Save yourself some money and get Jillian Michaels or Tie Bo workout videos. They are cheaper and provide a much better workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to workout! No, really...fun!!","review":"I am a 48 year old female. I have a house full of workout equipment.

Have customized several workouts which I do after my 30 day challenge workouts...that is how much fun this game is. Much better than wii Fit or wii Sports. I think I am addicted already. Yes, it can be a little aggravating at times, like when the sensors don't pick up your movements once in a while. Nothing major. I have not problem with the leg strap, or the resistence band. Neither are the most comfortable products out there, but not awful. I love my wii and now my wii workouts!

The workouts, especially without the warm up are dangerous and not very much fun. Don't get this EA Sports DVD, but DO get the \\"More Workouts\\" version. In the \\"More Workouts\\" version, all of the bad points of their first DVD are addressed. I give the \\"More Workouts\\" version 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for bad knees","review":"I received a lot of positive feedback from friends but it would not register my leg exercises unless I bent my knees, beyond 90 degrees.

Wii Fit is fun but you don't get a constant workout. You spend at least 5 mins or so picking out which workout you're doing next. With EA Sports Active, you get a whole workout. You can set goals for yourself to keep you motivated. This workout helps you do the exercise correctly. I love the calorie count as well. It really helps you put into perspective how hard you're working out. You can also adjust the intensity levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Developed For Left Handed People In Mind","review":"I'm still learning the different activities for the EA Sports Active so my rating is tentative. I can't give it a five, though, no matter how much I play and like it because if there's a way to switch the hand for the main wii-mote from right to left, I've not found it. That means that I either have to do some activities (such as the tennis activities) \\"backwards\\" or do them much more awkwardly and somewhat more clumsily with my right hand. That definitely takes away some of the fun for me. Doing things as a right handed doesn't feel natural and I do find it harder to concentrate on whatever activity I'm doing because I keep wanting to adjust the remote in my right hand or switch to my left altogether. Given that some games do allow for a handedness setting, I don't think it would have been asking too much to expect such an option in a game like EA Sports Active."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workouts","review":"I've been using the Wii Fit and have become somewhat bored with the same games.

It does not read your movements as well as WII does which causes you to have to repeat the excercise numerous times. It gets very furstrating at times.

The bands that come with the package aren't adequate for a taller or more fit person. The suggestion is to buy bands that fit your height and resistance need. The problem is that the WII controllers don't pick up the signal as well, so the trainer gets \\"stuck,\\" and you are unable to go forward without bumping out of the exercise. After bumping out of all of the resistance band training exercises, there is no reason to have WII Active unless you need a running companion or the same sports you get on other WII games.Don't buy this product until the resistance band problem is resolved (or at least noticed by EA Sports)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would have rented it first before spending the money","review":"I'm glad they're making video gaming more active for people. Unfortunately, this game needs work. I should have rented it before spending the money on it.

I fought with it and tried adjusting my position for 10-15 minutes and it wouldn't do anything. I gave up.

To keep the leg strap from sliding, I have to tighten it very tight, which seems unwise (restrict the flow of blood to muscles you're working? Bad.) In many of the arm-movement exercises, my arm movements aren't registering well with the game at all. I spend at least a third of my exercise time not actually exercising, but adjusting and attempting to get the game to know what I'm doing.Since I don't have trouble with any other Wii games' knowing what the Wiimote or nunchuk are doing, this seems to be a Wii Active specific problem.And I'm not really getting much use from the game. Only frustration.Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, lots of options","review":"Based on Amazon reviews, I purchased this Wii game to give me another option for exercise besides Wii Fit. I was happy to discover that the EA Sports Active workout was even better than I expected. I always end my workout in a sweat. I especially appreciate the long list of workouts that I can choose from -- I can focus on my upper or lower body, play sports, concentrate on cardio, or do the 30-day challenge.

It also locks up and won't register what you've done at all, no matter what kind of gyrations you try to do to go on. I haven't gotten beyond the first set of workouts because it was so frustrating.

If you do not have them held EXACTLY right, your Mii just stands there and the voice constantly tells you to try it again.

Seriously! Finally, I stopped using the strap and figuring out ways to work with only the wii motes and nun chuck...actually way more liberating! I wanted to love this game, but come on EA think of the consumer! There are quite a few \\"honest\\" reviews here who don't overlook this.

Maybe I'm just a complete moron, but no matter what adjustments I make it rarely registers my movements. I've also had trouble with the leg strap staying up, and I find it very awkward to have to worry about two different controllers while I'm trying to work out.

When I first started it, I thought it would be a pretty easy workout. Thirty-five minutes later and drenched in sweat, I knew differently. It seems easy while you are doing it, then before you know it, you are sweaty and tired! I used my heart rate monitor and I burn around 300 calories per half-hour. The game only says around 200 calories, so it is probably a low estimate for everyone. I guess it also depends on how intensely you do the exercises as well. I don't like the time in between exercises, but I just keep moving during them to keep my heart rate up. Overall, best game on Wii as far as I'm concerned. I would buy this game again in a second!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"Great workout, love the fact that they really concentrate on form.

I ended up making my own workouts and that seems to be working for now but I am looking for something that continues to work for me.

For some context: I'm a healthy 26 year old female. I go to the gym about 3x per week, doing a combination of running (2-3 miles) and lifting weights. If you fall into that category, this game will NOT be enough of a workout for you. I did the \\"high intensity\\" setting, and didn't even break a sweat after 40 minutes. As many others have said, the resistance bands are laughably low. In addition, I spent way too much time trying to position the wii remote and nunchuck in a way that the game would actually recognize my movements. Perhaps this game would seem better if I never did any other exercise, but even then I feel that the annoying technical nuances of the game would make it not worth buying.

I have lost about 12 pounds and gained a lot muscle. I have tried a lot of different workout routines from walking to step excersies to going to a gym and many different DVDs - I never saw results with any of the other attempts I have made. I actually like working out now. The results are a great bonus. I feel better than I have in years. I recommend this program to anyone.That all said, the system is not without its faults. But, they are easily overcome. The hand positions can be a little tricky and the elastic band hardly has any resistance (I've replaced it).On the plus side, this is great for people at all workout levels. I am a beginner, my daughter and husband are runners - they use it to cross train when the weather is bad. We are all able to get great workouts using EA Active.This will change your life. Try it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout! For all levels....","review":"If you think this is easy try the rollerblading....the jumps are really hard!

However, there is one thing that could have been done differently. Wii's come with 2 Wii remotes, so why use the nunchuck if the user is working out alone? It would avoid the length restriction of the wire between the Wii remote and the nunchuck. If there are 2 people working out, then you can use the nunchucks.The \\"game\\" is pretty good, though. I would recommend that you buy a wireless nunchuck, or purchase the adapter to make it wireless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of do this do that, not so much fun","review":"This is a very personal trainer type of game -- you are told to do this and do that, for a dozen exercise... i know, if I can do them, I will be fit, but since it is not so fun, if I have the discipline to stick to this training, I can also go biking and do weights every other day, and that gave me fantastic results too.Maybe because I am a guy, I don't like to be told to do this and do that repeatedly. I would rather play the games on Wii Fit Plus, because it is fun, I need no other incentive to play it. And any exercise for 30 minutes a day can make me fit. Maybe the \\"specialized\\" training can have better results, but if it is not fun, then I won't do it, and there won't even be any result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Software / Accessories Need Help","review":"I must agree with many of the reviews about how wonderful the workouts are. While I do like the Wii Fit, the \\"workouts\\" on that game are much more \\"relaxed\\". I typically warm up with Wii Fit, do a workout with EA Active and then cool down with Wii Fit.So the software is wonderful....But the leg band is starting to tear at the back. I searched the EA forums and that seems to a common complaint. EA's customer support seems to be rather spotty with regard to replacments. Some people are told \\"too bad\\" while others are offered a chance to replace it. Some for free and some for a $20 fee.While my leg band has not entirely died, I'm not too happy about the prospects of dealing with EA customer service for something that really shouldn't be broken.I have noticed that there are other companies that selling accessory packs, so I might check that out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love this!!!!","review":"I got this a few days ago and I am in love with it!!!

I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT IS SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING INTO SHAPE!!! It is sooo much fun!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather work out with traditional aerobic videos.","review":"The pace was very slow, even for someone out of shape like myself. So, it takes far more time to get half the work out.The exercise band was too easy, even for someone out of shape like myself. I needed to stand within five inches of each handle to feel a slight effort. I suppose I could use hand weights instead, but then it would be difficult to hold the wiimotes. I could buy more difficult bands, but it seems a a stronger one should have been included. A toddler would find this exercise band too easy.A lot of accuracy depends on the position of the leg band that holds the control, but I found out it slips off my pants easily. So, I was often pulling it up and trying to make it tighter, which affects my score.I found it confusing to determine what to follow: the trainer, my mii, the visual graph or the voice command. My mii didn't reflect my actual moves or timing.It seems far more efficient to just use an exercise video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Couch","review":"I dread exercising. I hate it more than anything in this world. However this game has me doing it.

Good variety of workout excercises, much harder routines than WII Fit, and good animated venues, however the product does not recognize the signals from the WII handheld devices in some of its excercises. I can't get it to work with squats at all. In others it takes a long time to receive/evaluate the signal even though it shows your avitar having completed the move and then it \\"yells\\" at you for taking to long. It is so close to being an excellent workout product. If you can live without some of the routines then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wii Fitness yet...","review":"I have tried the Wii Fit, Fitness Coach, and Gold's Gym, and this combines the best of all three into one game.

I have and will continue to recommend it to anyone that asks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Workout Game for Wii","review":"I really feel like I've gotten a workout when I use this game. It give accuarate feedback and a nice circuit of exercises. Like other reviewers I have problems with the leg strap unless I put it on tight enough to take my blood pressure. It took me a while to get the hang off positioning the remotes for the resistance exercises, so that take a little patience to learn. Some kind of glove to house the remotes would be a nice add on. I also have trouble with the remotes cord getting in the way, it is a shame they didn't adopt a two remote option technology like Gold's Gym Boxing has. But I would expect all these options to be part of EA Sports 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Wii Active","review":"I bought a Wii about 2 months ago and started out with Wii Fit. While I enjoy doing the Wii fit, I felt I needed something a little more challenging because I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. A couple of people recommended the Wii Active so I bought it. It is awesome! In the 20 minute workout, I was dripping with sweat when I finished. When I did Wii Fit for 30 minutes, sometimes I barely broke much of a sweat. I am doing the 30 day challenge and really like it. I like the 2 days on, 1 day rest system. I find the exercises challenging and I am even doing the squats even though my knees aren't what they used to be. I love the cardio and kick boxing.The only con I've found so far is that I had a little trouble in the beginning with the leg strap falling down but I just needed to adjust it to make it tighter.My only recommendation is to ramp up the step aerobics. The advanced step aerobics on the Wii fit is much better.I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Freezes","review":"I really enjoyed this when I first got it I've owned it a little over 90 days. It keeps freezing up on me, telling me to follow the instructor which I'm doing. I thought batteries, so I changed them, I thought, where I was standing so I moved, I thought, the WII bar so I've adjusted it. Nothing worked, yet all my other programs work fine. I've attempted to email EA, call EA, and have had no response. I feel this is poor customer service and a bad CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great game","review":"I have played many fitness games (Wii Fit, Golden Gym, My Fitness Coach), by far this is the best fitness game. I got the package on the release date and found myself cannot stop doing exercise. It's very fun and also help forcing me to exercise on my surgical repaired knee. It also helped me feel energetic the next day when I wake up. I like the game very much; it is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Out & loving it!","review":"I started the 30-day challenge on the first of January, just missed one day so I will finish Sunday the 31st. I am a person living with MS so I picked the easy challenge without the balance board. Although I was scolded for being too slow on the track, I was able to complete most of the exercises each day and I really feel I will benefit from doing them each day. I would have liked the opportunity to pick and choose some of the exercises and tailor it more to my needs however I can work around this and look forward to another 30-day challenge. At some point, in the near future, I will purchase the next version and attempt the 6-week challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy!","review":"Okay, so I bought this game on the day it came out. I went to the gym earlier to workout but I was so eager to try this out. I figured that I would do a \\"light\\" workout...or so I thought. Boy was I wrong lol...the game estimated I burnt about 170 calories but my heart rate monitor (which is pretty accurate) said that I burned 350! Wow! This is a must buy for anyone that has bought any of the other Wii fitness games (Wii Fit, My Fitness Coach, Gold Gym, etc...) The features really combine all of those games plus more to give you an excellent workout. I love it and I am going to have a hard time going back to using my other Wii workout games!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Video is good, leg strap is lousy","review":"I've been enjoying the workout immensely and definitely feel some results in my shoulders and arms. I do agree with some of the posters saying it's a little cumbersome to be constantly changing things like the resistance band, leg strap, etc. Oh, and I hate the leg strap. It constantly slips out of place and shifts around, no matter how tight I put it. I've resorted to sliding the nunchuck down the front of my shorts leg and my waistband does a great job of holding the nunchuck in place. It's a lot faster than taking off that darn leg strap, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun this is not fun this is real work out!!","review":"This was a beast!! This thing had me sweating and panting!! The game is really like working out with a trainer at the gym! I love it I can use it in the mornings before going to work then still go to the gym in the evenings for shorter sessions. Between this and the Wii Fit it's like having a virtual gym right in my living room! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Active Rocks!!!","review":"I purchased this product to go along with my Wii Fit. I find the Sports Active to be more interactive and the workouts are excellent. The tennis and basketball are very intense (GREAT!). I like the way you can build up from easy to intense and also create your own. I also like the way the exercises move quickly from one to another, where you don't have to wait for the trainer to say gibberish about what's coming up. If you need assistance with understanding the exercise, you can choose to view how to do it correctly. The real-life video integrated with the exercises also is a great feature. This is a great product and I know the exercises do work! GREAT PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"This is a pretty good workout \\"game.\\" I like how you can customize your own workout or use preset workouts. If you customize, you can make your workout harder and add the activities you like best. The sports section is fun but not a great workout. The lower body activities are very good as well as the upper body activities. I would suggest buying a more resistant workout band."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO left hand option!","review":"Buyer beware!! No left hand option! Makes playing baseball etc difficult.Not a problem for regular exercises such as lunges, bicept curls, etc. though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs many improvements","review":"This is a better workout than Wii Fit. It needs some improvements though. The leg strap falls off easily and when it's tight enough to stay up, feels like a tourniqet. The cord between the controls keeps getting tangled and is a bit of a hazard. The sensors are almost too sensitive and the workout stops when it feels you aren't doing the move properly, even if you are. I find the pace a bit aggrevating too. It's too slow, not in time with the music and just doesn't flow. I wish I hadn't spent the money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Star Workout","review":"This game is pretty decent. I bust a sweat everytime I use it. My legs were pretty sore the next day. Don't expect the upper body to be too sore. The band isn't very challenging. I tried using a tougher band but it was hard to hold that and the remotes. Another negative is that you have to pull the strap pretty tight so it doesn't slide down your leg. To me these things are minor. My goal is to burn calories which it does. I used a heart monitor and I actually burn more calories than what they state.Excellent for Beginner to Intermediate worker outers.Good supplemental workout for more advanced folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best workout on the Wii","review":"I have purchased the Wii Fit, Jillian Michael's Fitness Ultimatum, and some others, and the EA Sports Active is by far the best workout. unlike the other games, you can either select a preprogrammed workout or create your own, and there is little to no downtime between exercises. it is a better workout overall, and is a great way to view and maintain goals, including lifestyle and eating habits. I am addicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"Even with the rave reviews ( on all sites) I was not expecting to like this as much as I do. For someone who is starting back up with fitness actives it's great. If you are someone who's already fit and does a lot of gym or outside activities it may not be for you. But I love it. It helps that it's a game and you're almost doing circut training that incorporates activities like inline skating and power tennis to create a fun active rather than hating going to the gym and figuring out what to do with the limited time I have.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE definitive Empire Strikes Back release","review":"Charles Gerhardt and the NPO released many CDs on RCA Victor, mainly of golden age film scores, but also a Star Wars/Close Encounters CD and Return of the Jedi. For whatever reason, RCA passed on Gerhardt's recording of Empire Strikes Back, but no fear, Varese Sarabande picked it up. I love all of the Gerhardt recordings, and this is my favorite of the three. While it doesn't have all the cues that the 1993 Anthology or 1997 sppecial editions had, it still has most of the major themes and is performed superbly by the National Philharmonic.George Korngold (producer) and Charles Gerhardt (conductor) did a huge favor for film score fans with the Classic Film Score series, and of course the Star Wars trilogy recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Be careful when buying.

Buttons to advance pages are not highlighted.

The premade stories illustrate this perfectly.The pinball game is too hard and has no educational value.The card writing activity is too limited, and again not clear how to advance through the different steps. The shape matching activity is noisy, gives insufficient reward for completing the task and doesn't indicate clearly when the child has completed all the tasks. The music activity is confusing, insufficiently interactive, although the music itself is high quality. Overall, this software has a few good ideas, but some are just plain bad and boring. It also suffers from poor execution and obviously insufficient play testing.

At first, I was a bit overwhelmed with the comprehensiveness. After using it to plan and go on two 3-night hikes in the GSMNP, I have come to greatly appreciate this book and especially its layout. Mr. Wise needs to be commended on the organization of the material. His trail descriptions are arranged by sections or watersheds, which corresponds to entries points to the Park.

Also there are hikes and places in this book you will not find in any other book for example: Mills Creek Falls Trail which cannot be found in any other book because this trail today is not a maintained trail in the park but is easily found and hiked.

There's not as sparkly and bright as I had thought they would be. They just look like plastic beads on a wire. The return policy from the store I bought them from was such that it would have cost too much in postage and fees to make it worth returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty earrings, but poor quality","review":"I only wore mine for 2 hours, the crystals fell off on both earrings!

They don't dangle the way they seemed to in the photo, either. They're small plastic beads on a wire. I got them as a gift, but didn't give them to the person they were intended for - I plan to give them to my 14 yr old niece for her birthday, instead. They're more suited to a pre-teen/teenager than a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"the picture makes the earrings look more brilliant and bigger than they actually are.

She loves purple, so I felt they were quite appropriate, and I think sterling silver is a good metal choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"World's Fair Review","review":"The greatest aspect of World's Fair is the way in which it captures the 1930s, balancing a strong feeling of nostalgia that makes the novel very enjoyable with economic and social realism. The 1930s are preserved as a cherished memory as lived by real people and poignant social realism.Doctorow manages to write from the perspective of a child in a way that is enjoyable and believable. The world of 1930s New York grows along with Edgar, opening new possibilities and dangers to the growing boy.Bottom Line: There is really something magical about the way Doctorow captures 1930s New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a novel","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable coming of age novels I have ever read. Based to some extent on the author's own childhood, it tells the story of a young Jewish boy growing up in New York City during the Depression. It ends while he is in the fifth grade, and cries out for a sequel, although after all these years (it came out in 1985) I doubt one is forthcoming. Beautifully written, if occasionally over-written, it is very moving and memorable. Anyone who had a childhood, or is not an alien from another planet, should find World's Fair to be a rewarding reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant yet very tame","review":"This is a nice enough book. The time and the place are recreated miticulously, from throw-away references to popular items and ideas of the day, to sprawling detail of monuments and individuals. All this is fine and good and it's very well written. But the plot is just so damn tame. It's all too gushy and feel-goody and nostalgia for the \\"good ole days\\" that were obviously hell, the depression looming, war on the horoizon, people with nothing to do and nowhere to go and we're given this teary-eyed, Spielbergian child's eye view of the world. Again, it's wrapped up neatly and told pretty vividly, but I just wish there were some real sort of conflict, not just 'what will mother think?' Doctorow was much better in The Book of Daniel and Ragtime. Read this only if you're a fan, and you've run out of his better works, or have some strage attachment to the 1939 World's Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, and Informative","review":"Lovely book about a cat named Mackerel who lives in a lighthouse. Perfect for a child who has a cat (or wants one...) and who lives by the sea, or visits the beach (or dreams about it...). Beautiful illustrations and a story full of imagery, plus real information about lighthouses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best family film in years","review":"This is what family entertainment should be. This film deals with issues that are important to all members of the family and it deals with them without foul language.

I wear a six and this was a little big (and a little wide) for my foot. My heel kept slipping out of them and the only thing that helped keep my foot in was the cheap elastic band going across the shoe. The white is more of an off white with a pearl to it and an orange peel texture. I opened the box but was completly underwhelmed. I returned the shoe. IT also wasn't comfortable to wear or walk in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for a 3 in 1","review":"Good price for a 3 in 1.

It has all the inputs you could ever use and plays all recordable and rewriteable DVD formats in addition to CD's and MP-3's on CD. Please note however, this is a 640 x 480 display. Amazon states that it will display 1080p etc. It will but with lots of downconversion. It is not HD. I realized this before buying so this is not a concern for me. Only problems with TV are that it could use a bit more contrast and the remote buttons are not well orginized - still have to look after using for 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD player doesn't last","review":"I was initially happy with this TV due to its nice picture, size of unit and weight. The convenience of a DVD player built right made it look clean and less hassle with cords and hookup. I didn't use the DVD player that much but when I went to use it after the 90 day warranty, it would not read the disk. I found a repair shop and was told the whole DVD unit needed to be replaced but only the part was covered. The labor of $150.00 was not covered. I called the Sylvania company and they said \\"Sorry, we can't help you.\\" I opted not to get it repaired because I could buy a DVD player for around $50.00. I would not recommend this TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV good - DVD player broke","review":"The picture and sound for this t.v. are good, but after having it for only one month and only using it a couple of times the DVD player broke. Sometimes the DVD won't go in; sometimes it won't come out. It's a gamble every time I want to watch a movie. I took this to a warranty service center and spoke to the technician. He told me basically you get what you pay for. It wouldn't even be worth it to fix the DVD player because they have trouble getting the parts and I would have to pay the labor costs, which would be approximately $200. Some warranty! He recommended just hooking up a regular DVD player, which is what I had to do. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sound Track","review":"I love this sound track. It's an unusual and good mix of types music and lyrics. I particularly enjoy Steve Tyrell's treatment of the Kern/Fields song, \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", long a favorite of mine. I'd love to find more by Tyrell, but can't find him anywhere on the Net. Any ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful.","review":"For the most part, this soundtrack reminded me most distictly of the background music for a Tom and Jerry chase scene. The tracks generally range from 30 to 80 seconds in length, and seem to repeat at least once every three minutes. Honestly, the only reason this soundtrack is worthy of even one star is its adoption of Pachelbel's Canon and The Way You Looked Tonight, neither of which were created by the mastermind behind the rest of this circus-like album. Instead of spending your good ol' greenbacks on this audio version of a hampster-wheel, consider letting the four neighbor kids fingerpaint your Volvo with ketchup and mustard. Ok, maybe this was a little harsh...however: this soundtrack does well to complement the movie, but nothing else. It is wholly unable to stand on its own merit, and coincidentally results in a bloody headache rather than a positive listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is not a soundtrack. It is a score of background music from the movie. Very disappointed and not worth it. There are only 2 actual songs. What a great movie could have done a better soundtrack....especially for us BRIDES :) Save your money for the wedding girls!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of the music?!!","review":"I bought this soundtrack assuming it contained all the music from the movie--so I'll take the blame for not getting what I expected. I should have paid more attention to the contents and the length of the CD. What's there is good, but it certainly is NOT the soundtrack one would expect to get. Where are all those \\"oldies\\" that made Father of the Bride such an entertaining movie? And why is such a short CD (less than half the length of most CDs) priced right up there with much longer CDs? Surely there's a \\"real\\" FOTB soundtrack out there somewhere! This one should be called \\"Very, Very Short Tidbits from Father of the Bride\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Rest of the Music?","review":"The tracks on the CD are good, but I really wanted the entire soundtrack--all those songs from the past that made the movie so much fun. My fault; I should have read the cover more carefully, or at least have added the track times. You don't get much music for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKED IT","review":"Although it didn't have the other songs that some people want, that is why you look over the song titles BEFORE you buy. I think it is a great album and I highly recommend it. It takes you back to the movie and it is a beautiful score."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential reading","review":"Jane Powell's books are the gold standard for bungalow reference. This book was critical for making sure I got my 1911 master bath remodel done the right way. Still a work in progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bungalow for me","review":"This book is an accurate representation of bathroom styles in the first quarter of the last century. The purists will love it. If they ever plan to sell their home, I won't be interested.While my home dates back to 1931 and I intend to remodel its original first floor bath to fit within its modest style, the baths illustrated are simply out of date. I don't believe that today's home buyer appreciates such precise historical accuracy in a bathroom. People want comfort and style even in an 1800s victorian. You can do stylish with subway tile but pink accent tile and stained oak wood trim around a clawfoot tub do not fit my definition. A spa bath is not appropriate but a bland, uninteresting, and frankly sometimes just plain ugly bath is worse. This book is full of the latter.There are some good ideas on how to workaround the pitfalls of an older home's plumbing, electric layout and free-standing column radiators. My 19-year-old son also found the narrative very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too historically obsessive for my new Craftsman home","review":"If you want to be historically accurate, this book is for you. The author gives examples of \\"Obsessive Restoration\\" and a \\"Compromise Solution\\" for each element of restoring a bungalow bathroom. However, even the compromise was too obsessive for me. In addition, the author wasted way too many pages discussing the history of bathrooms, which is irrelevant to me. Her companion book, \\"Bungalow Kitchens\\" is much of the same. I just built a new Craftsman home, and my goal was to build a new home with historic influences, so what I was hoping for were suggestions on how to incorporate modern materials and modern conveniences to achieve a bungalow look. Obviously that was not the author's goal -- she's all about keeping the historical accuracy. This book has lots of illustrative photos, but they all look dingy and stodgy to me. I was looking more for something to show me how to bring bungalow style to my home without it looking outdated and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this book is about how to _live_ with old stuff...","review":"... and that's what makes it so wonderful. If you're considering re-doing a bathroom in a 19th or early 20th century house---whether you'll be restoring an original room or destroying a 70's \\"renovation\\"---you need this book.The author has a comprehensive awareness of both the stylistic and the practical issues involved. She also has a sense of humor about it all.I was particularly impressed by the pictures. Several of the historical rooms are studied in careful detail, wth closeups of many features---not just the major plumbing fixtures. Also, all the photos were taken specifically for this book; so many bathroom-advice books feature mostly manufacturer-supplied photos that bear little relation to the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bungled bathrooms with Bungalow Bathrooms!","review":"This little book is a goldmine for anyone who wants to put together an early 1900's bathroom. Almost everyone has seen the beautiful tiled baths of the past, but when one is trying to recreate such a room it is often hard to recall exactly what it was that made it so special. This richly illustrated book leaves no doubt. I recently wanted to put together one of these baths in my home, and finding this book made it possible beyond my wildest expectations. Anyone who has a similar project, or just wants to learn more about this style of room, will find Jane Powell's book worth its price - many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DB ER book.","review":"While using this book in my Databases College course I noticed how easy it is to follow and learn from it. The diagrams are very well laid out and explained, and the examples actually work when you try them. The author keeps it simple and straightforward, as he should for a College level book. Of course, as technology advances SO FAST, you might this book a bot outdated, but it will still give you good fundamentals for your ongoing studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You've only HEARD the CD, you are missing half the experience!","review":"Both jazz fans and country fans will love the recent collaboration between trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and country music icon Willie Nelson. When their two performances at Jazz From Lincoln Center in January 2007 were recorded and released by Blue Note this summer, the album jumped to the top of the jazz, pop and country charts. Thanks to Eagle Eye Media, the \\"match made in heaven\\" is available to see, as well as to hear, on Willie and Wynton\\" Live From Lincoln Center. The 85-minute film (not video) contains extended solos and, on hot numbers like Louis Jordan's \\"Caldonia\\", Nelson plays his acoustic guitar as though he was always playing jazz. The camera moves very quickly and rarely spends more than five seconds on an image, which is the only defect I could find. This is an historic moment and the performances of old pop and jazz standards create a DVD I'll certainly watch again.Steve Ramm\\"Anything Phonographic\\"/In The Groove"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD","review":"THIS DVD WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY MONEY IT COST ME $15 FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE IT'S A RIP OFF"},{"rating":"2","title":"my fav movie","review":"this movie is my all time fav coming of age story, and gay stories. but it isn't classified 100% a gay movie, and it isn't. it is a story of a family with many different types of children. it realistically shows a family and how the really are with each other and how they all grow up together. the characters are so well written and the acting and chemistry on screen is phenomenal. and to add, the music in the movie is great. overall this movie shouldn't be viewed as only a gay film, but a movie about a family, about brothers, about life, no matter who or how your life is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern masterpiece","review":"Wow Canada is not known for world class cinema woever we musnt forget that Les Frainces amount to the millions in Quebec and their expertise in telling a story was not lost on CRAZY.

It is a story about a Quebec family (French) with the focus on the coming of age/coming out story of one of 5 boys. Well done and sensitive, it follows the boy from birth to middle age providing a real insight into what it was like for this person discovering his homosexuality. While the story focuses on his relationship with his father, his mother's role is priceless and the music was exceptional.A French Canadian masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of heart, imagination and depth","review":"It's a coming out story and some people will complain about that, but saying that coming out stories have been done before is kind of like saying that love stories have been done before. The real story is about human love, despair and triumph. One of the great things about this film is that the main characters have depth. Even when there is conflict, you understand everyone's backgrounds and motivations. This is so much like a real family, rather than a movie or TV family, it can give you chills.

I am a bit puzzled by the connection of sex with diseases, and pregnancy with details, a surgeon should tell the woman, IF she is pregnant. This book is definetily for adults, who have no bondage with their children. Over all, my teenage boys thought this should rather be handed out in the US by some of their religious people, who try to tell everyone how to live.

The smartass humor is there, along with the eccentric oddly named characters, but the result seems labored and seems to recycle elements from past books (names, plot devices); there are even footnoted entries that direct you to other books in the series that explain why he has a Mondrian, etc.I'd hoped that the long drought since the last \\"Burglar\\" book was a good sign, particularly because Block seems to have revived the Scudder series after a series of clinkers.

When you see characters in front of the screen reacting as if they are there at the moment of creation of some great music, and you hear something that is worse than forgettable, it just fails miserably. As this movie did. So the bottom line...listen to the music first. If it works for you, then perhaps you will like the otherwise trite and not terribly believable fairy tale of a story. And if it doesn't, save your time and money and watch Disney's \\"Snow White\\" instead--it's a lot more credible and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog of a movie in need of a leash.","review":"I don't get it. How on earth could anyone give this stale slice of mediocrity a favorable review?The acting was so banal it made the second-rate, cheese-ball story line seem Shakespearean. And let me go on record and say the screenplay came across as having been cobbled from every sappy \`boy meets girl' endeavor to flop on the wide screen.The music was touted as being so powerful its contribution to the movie may well make it the \\"best musical film of our generation\\". Puleeze!! I noticed a poster of Leonard Cohen's 1973 'Live Songs' on one of the walls in the boy's bedroom . Do yourself a favor and buy the Leonard Cohen album. It's a thing of beauty and will sustain your soul for the rest of your life. Avoid this trite affair at all costs.

Nevertheless, a good DVD rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once is not enough","review":"Well, there is not much left to be said after reading all the reviews.

Just be warned - this is not your average Hollywood tearjerker by any means - which is really good :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guy Gets Girl, Sort of","review":"The only thing that didn't convince me about Once was the music, which I found more serviceable than great. Otherwise, Once is one of the best movies of 2007. Its entire too-short length is a romance, but not in the end the romance expected at the beginning. Even more than the romance, it is about Dublin, about carrying on in fragile circumstances, and about giving oneself and others a second chance. Those are, of course, themes more universal than individual, so it's entirely appropriate that the two protagonists are never named beyond Guy and Girl. Even in that anonymity, however, they are finely drawn and portrayed individuals. Once is a movie to see more often than its title. And each viewing will yield scenes that become stuck in memory -- the father's faith in his son, the brightly colored vacuum cleaner being pulled through gray Dublin streets, and Girl's lunkish adolescent neighbors who pile on to her sofa to watch TV soaps to improve their English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful movie. Extraordinary music and characters.

Once is too raggedy in every which way. The music was totally uninteresting (except just one song in the studio scene in 5/5 time, that one was near to just okay). Self endulgent documentary/home type movie (there are better home movie youtubes then this flick. I can't believe folks like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all nuts?","review":"What an awful, amateurish, unwatchable video. Aside from the bad singing, bad songs and unintelligible accents, there were the uninteresting characters and the jerky hand-held camera used throughout.I frequently buy books and movies that seem interesting and have good user reviews. As I like musicals and this is five-star rated, it seemed like a no-brainer. What a mistake! Maybe the film makers have nothing better to do with their time than to post fake reviews. From now on I'm going to be more suspicious of high ratings that don't correspond to box-office success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis was terrible","review":"I wish I had opportunity to view this movie before purchasing - never would've bought it. I rely on user reviews. I was stung this time. I didn't see any story line and the music is not that good. Chalk this up to a lesson learned. I'll be lucky if I can give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Wow - what a disappointment! I bought this based on all of the positive reviews - I hate to be the pundit, but the film came across as a very amateur concoction both from the filming and dialog perspectives. It failed to garner our interest or attention. After 30 minutes of dribble we finally shut it off and watched a real movie. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once is enough","review":"I bought this movie after falling in love with the song and seeing the video. I was not impressed with the movie though. I enjoyed most of the music, but I expected to see a movie NOT a musical. The copy that I bought froze, which hopefully was just the copy that I purchased. The movie seemed to drag out and left the viewer waiting for something to happen. I also found myself changing the volume throughout the film because of the inconsistency in the recording. Once was enough for me and I LOVE independant films especially when they center around the UK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must See\\" Movie","review":"I originally rented this DVD from my local video store and after watching it twice and watching it again with the director's comments I knew I had to own this movie.

What more could you want? The music is great, too. Loved it and gave it to others for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketa Irglova","review":"I'm gonna be honest and say that I;m giving this movie 4 stars because of the performance of Marketa Irglova. Take this novice actress away and replace her with someone else, and the movie will be worth less than half a star.I didn't think the music was that great. I only find Falling Away and Marketa's piano piece about her husband passable. All the songs have too much angst to interest me much. Music aside, Irglova pretty much stole the movie with the scenes she was in. Her sincerity and occasional goofiness makes her shine through her dull male co-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching to say the least","review":"this movie is fantastic. it truly touches the heart and is particularly appealing to music aficionados. it is a great film to watch with your boyfriend or girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music...","review":"Dublin guitarist/singer-songwriter who makes a living by fixing vacuum cleaners with his Dad in a repair shop and singing and playing for money on the Dublin streets by night.

Enjoy great music weaved into a plot (which was fully expected to be predictable but turned out not to be exactly so). Movie beautifully portrays simple, at times awkward, but warm relationships between Father and Son, between Czech girl and mother/daughter and of course between boy and girl.

I found that at the end, I was slightly upset that it didn't end in the hollywood fashion, but that is just selfish. It ends perfectly not following the usual horrible basic rubric of high-budget movies. This is a film not a movie.Normally, I find that when there is no tripod used, that the cameraman better keep still, but in this, I found that it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. This is an amazing film. there are no flowered parts, no \\"that only happens in the movies\\" feel. This is like watching real lives play out. This is how it should be.Everyone should see this, if not for the film, for the music. I am a sucker for duets, and a sucker for great, original muscianship. They are perfect musically, they synch together just right.See this film and you will have a new favorite in your list....it's just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, lovely, delightful -- not the way I would usually describe a movie but","review":"this movie is exactly that! It's been said more than a dozen times already in these comments but yes, the best movie I've seen in years.

Some movies exaggerate it, and some are just bland. Once is movie that portrays that blend to excellence, if not perfection!!!

There's so much depth, so emotional, contrast, everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful Film","review":"If you love music, simple storytelling, have a heart and a soul, you will love this film. So incredibly moving and stirring. The people in this film touched me so deeply...I can't even call them characters because I felt as though I was watching real people having an experience in their lives. A standing ovation to the two singer/song writers/ musicians and director. An absolute gem of a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Smooth Transaction","review":"It takes a few minutes to get used to the rather heavy brogue. I look forward to the Broadway version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Blu-ray picture is clear and beautiful, much better than the theatre print I saw in 2007. Despite the improvement, film has not lost any of its naturalness; like we are evesdropping on real people. John Carney's decision to ask his musical talent, unproven as actors, to be the movie; that was a great call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Love this movie. Cute story line that doesn't have some fake hollywood taint to it. Not one sex scene. Poor hollywood is shaking it head with it's tried and true methods. However, it still portrays, passion for life, struggle, awkward human emotions, survival, and accomplishment. Last, the end doesn't leave life in a pretty bow tied package. There are still struggles going on through the successes. This felt refreshing.It also feels so honest from a musical perspective because they aren't \\"real\\" actors. They are \\"real\\" musicians. It makes the movie more authentic. (I always hate watching an actor pretend to play an instrument with bad technique. It becomes so distracting that I can't even hear the music.) The music written for the movie is nice too!Woo-hoo independent film makers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film for those who prefer \\"Juno\\" over \\"Enchanted\\"","review":"If you are in the mood for a gentle, endearing movie, then \\"Once\\" is a gem. Realistic dialog, believable situations, acting that is entirely natural (likely to happen when the leads aren't actors but actual musicians!) in a story that isn't forced. If you want a Hollywood fairy tale, this is not for you. It is a modern musical in that songs are used in their entirety and to advance the story rather than just being relegated to the background soundtrack; the music and lyrics depict the emotions of the leads and are the heart and soul of their relationship.Thank God for Sundance which lets independent films like this find the audience they deserve. While $20 seems a lot to pay for a DVD these days, given that the entire budget of the film was $160 K, I can't begrudge anyone associated with \\"Once\\" a bit of profit if it will help them make another film like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once","review":"This movie is just outstanding. It, and Across the Universe are the two must watch movies of the year in my book. And it's not just me, one song in it is up for an Academy Award. Well deserved too. Didn't realize at first that Glen Hansard was in the Commitments. He was a minor member of the band, but boy, has he grown into a talent. And the girl, with that weird little Eastern European accent just charmed me. Quite a piano playertoo. You absolutely HAVE to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that sings...","review":"A great description of this movie is \\"A movie that sings.\\" It is very rare that a film speaks to me as this one has. As an aspiring film maker I can only close my eyes and pray that I could ever make something as beautiful as this movie. I am going to make it a personal goal of mine to make sure everyone close to me gets to see this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish watching","review":"I had heard good things about this movie from friends and seen some good reviews. I just finished watching it as a rental, and the only good thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't spend another $10 to see this in the theatre or buy a DVD. I felt incredibly bored through the entire movie. I also found the songs completely unappealing, and in fact irritating to sit through. There were parts where I couldn't make out the dialogue due to the accents, so that didn't help. I forced myself to finish watching to see if it got better in the end, since so many people seem to like this movie. It didn't get any better. This was just a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real bad musical","review":"If you want to hear some bad singing that seems to go on for ever then this is the movie for you.

I did enjoy a few of the original songs, but in no way thought they were Oscar worthy. The movie itself is boring and goes absolutely nowhere.

If you don't then this is a tedious movie with too much music and singing and too little action. I think most kids would find this boring (mine did). I was glad when it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best story, music, actors, ...","review":"I watched this movie by chance on TV (in Germany) and bought the DVD the day after because I loved it so much. I think I have seen it a million times. Now I gave it as a present to a friend and she also loved it. Also my friends who were forced to watch it with me liked it.Once is the cutest love story without even a kiss. It seems all so real and not acted out (probably because from my knowledge the characters are no actors and they became a real couple after the movie was made). I also really liked the music - I also bought the soundtrack ;) - and the Oscar for that is well deserved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies on music","review":"This is one realistic yet very fanatastic taleThe music is beautiful and the actors so genuine.Dont this miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Once\\" you see it, you'll want to own it!","review":"I had to see the film after hearing \\"Falling Slowly\\" on AI. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are unspoiled musicians who make amazing music both separately and together. I love the simple style in which the film was shot, spotlighting the sweet honesty of life for these two characters - named \\"girl\\" and \\"guy\\". Don't be put off by the F-word in the beginning. In other countries it's more of a typical vocabulary word than in the states. If you love music and good story lines, you should really see this. At least ONCE. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for my wife, we love the movie and the music","review":"Great songs and a fun story that has romance, but isn't overly so.

I felt so moved by the pure, deep, complicated friendship between the two main characters, Glen and Mar--a friendship born of musical passion, but restrained by integrity and virtue. And the music! I bought both the CD and the DVD, and even wrote my own song, prompted by the movie! Don't miss this movie, fine for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romantic independent film.","review":"This is one of those small low-budget films that can stand on its own without fancy effects or scenery. It is a beautiful relationship story with a fantastic soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the scene with the vacuum--you just have to see it for yourself. The true-to-life relationship reminded me of another great indie film,Time and Tide. The two actors have phenomenal voices so if you need another reason to see this movie, the music should be it.

This disk collection is a piece of junk!!!! Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy since I will be returning (for a refund) the second set of blank disks. I was so looking forward to this library on my computer. I Can NOT UNDERSTAND why one of the greatest publications would put a product out in the marketplace that has so many bugs and problems.

Have another half day to get it to load? Have an eagle's eyesight to read faint gray text? Then this is the product for you. If you don't have any of these things, then forget this misbegotten item. I can't understand how a publication so careful of its quality in print would foist a low quality item like this on the public. In the end, I guess I've made a charitable donation to the New Yorker, which I wouldn't have minded doing if this were presented as a PBS-type fund-raising tool. But I really believed I'd be able to browse decades worth of magazines, based on how the New Yorker sold this. Instead, all I got was the urge to put my fist through my computer screen because of this \\"complete\\" piece of junk's time-consuming balkiness. Hey New Yorker: how about putting your archives online and charging a fee for access. If it really worked - unlike this junk - I'd gladly pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software a Pain","review":"If it weren't for the softwre, I would still be celebrating the release of this archive. In the nearly two weeks I have owned it, I have given up radio, TV, shopping, showering and my now decamped SO to browse 80 years of stellar American writing.Too bad 40% of that time was waiting for the next article to appear, for the search engine to stop, or for a hang-up to clear that often never would.The comment about the Abstracts was dead-on. I sense they off-shored this task to bright but over worked foreigners whose English skills often aren't broad enough to get the joke. Or the subtlety. Or the wit. Worse, they spell only as well as I do...So, one star off for these disappointments, but if you love The New Yorker, you will find a way around every problem you encounter, including the puzzling disappearence of the February 20, 1989 issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a dream on my Mac","review":"I installed The Complete New Yorker on my Mac with no trouble at all.

As many of the customer reviews indicate, it is crippled with technical problems and flaws. I have succeeded in getting it to work on my computer only in limited, extremely frustrating episodes. Mostly, it produces error messages, crashes, and failures. Quite simply, getting this product to function properly will be beyond the technological expertise (and indeed patience) of most potential buyers. I do not say this with an attitude, as I fully include myself within that group. It is a travesty that The New Yorker would unleash such a faulty product on the trusting public.

I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. I own an HP NC6000 notebook with 512 mb of RAM, and I can navigate through my NewYorker DVD set with relative ease at an impressive speed - certainly much faster than manually looking for it, and about on par with other software search tools. I disagree with comments on how intuitive the search mechanism is. For this particular magazine, I find it brilliant ! I can search for award winners, or for a particular category, or by author, keyword, etc - and thats great for anyone whose familiar with the New Yorker and it's writers. It's also great to go back and read articles written at various historic moments in the 20th century to understand the national sentiment and the fashions of various decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop complaining.","review":"Some people have complained about the archive including all advertisements from the original issues. This is because of copyright issues, and without copying each and every page exactly as they were in the original issues, they wouldn't have been able to reprint the articles, or would have at least taken decades to get all the necessary permissions.As for the search engine being clunky, big deal. There is a large volume of magazine indexes available at any library where keywords, topics, and other useful information can be searched for in exhaustion. I have not looked, but I am sure this is available online, and as indexing and cataloging information is their business, I'm guessing The New Yorker saved lots of money (and, thus, the buyer lots of money) by offering a simpler search tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware !!!","review":"I cannot believe anyone would buy this idiotic version of the New Yorker, one of my favorite magazines. It is made up of a database of page images so searching is slow and cumbersome. If they had done it right they would have digitized the text so you could assemble the text of articles and copy them to your hard drive.

I was really excited when the DVD set came out, ordered it right away and boy wasn't I in for a rude awakening. The interface is really hard to figure out, each article takes an eon to load, and don't bother with the search function, it just doesn't work. The bug-infested, awkwardly designed original DVD set got unanimous bad reviews, just do a search.Against my best judgement, I bought the v1.3 update disk this year hoping for a redemption. It arrived after a MONTH I ordered it, and it simply WON'T install. I'm no computer genius but I'll say I'm reasonably tech savvy, but I just simply can't get the installation to work.

I understand that the Complete New Yorker is available on an external hard drive, and this might be a good option, but I purchased the 8 DVD package, and found it to be pretty hopeless in its design and execution. For starters, the DVDs do not use a standard reader (like Adobe, say) and come with one of their own. The installation process is unwieldy and ridiculous, and the reader itself is riddled with bugs (I haven't yet been able to access any of the content). In addition to this, under the terms and conditions, the user must agree to a spyware-like program, giving permission for web browsing information to be logged, and personal information sold on to third parties.

He not only knows and shares the roots of romantic comedy, he discusses the common elements af all successful movies in the genre.This book is invaluable for someone working in this genre, but it's also relevant for all aspiring (or actively working) screenwriters. Don't be afraid to get this book if you are working in another genre.

Furthermore, his articulation is limited to swinging his arms at the shoulders and nodding his head. His trailer is like Optimus's trailer after it's been chopped up and rebuilt smaller. Sure, there are some big guns inside but they don't seem that special. There are some shields on the sides of the trailer guns, which only look strong enough to stop a low-powered medical laser. Rodimus also carries a long rifle, which is like his old Hot Rod guns but stretched.

I have not been disappointed. The plates are large enough to hold a full meal, the cups hold a decent amount of beverage, and the fact that it all packs up into a nice little mesh bag is just a bonus. The dishes are not flimsy in the least; constructed of a nice sturdy plastic. I would use nylon utensils if possible, to prevent scratches in the future and keep the set looking nice.

Originally, the game was known as Reversi. Two rival Englishmen each claimed to have invented the game late 19th century. Hasegawa modified the rules slightly and his father, a Shakespearean scholar game it the name Othello, because the reversals in the game reminded him of the plot of the play. This book is the only widely distributed manual of Othello strategy. Although it may have some value for the collector, unfortunately most Othello players regard the strategies discussed in the book as being obsolete and even misleading. Readers who are interested in the game should look for resources on the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners would do well to avoid it...","review":"Othello, devised by Hasegawa-san in the 1970s, is an improved version of the century-old English game, reversi. [What is called reversi on-line is almost always Othello rather than reversi].This book was written soon after Othello was devised, before anyone understood much about the game. Unfortunately it shows, and beginners would do well to avoid it - at least as a source of ideas on strategy and tactics - because it will lead them down a deceptively appealing blind alley.Because of its many diagrams, however, it may be of use to those who know enough to recognise where it goes wrong but otherwise I recommend it for historical interest only.Better resources can be found free on the Web, in the form of strategy guides, illustrative applets and programs that can beat even the best humans. A printed alternative is Othello: Brief & Basic by Ted Landau, which is old but still excellent (as far as it goes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"I liked this book alot.

For the first 44 pages, I tried to find a character in this book that was likable enough for me to forge the bond that would make me care about whether they triumphed over whatever troubles the author threw at them. I couldn't find one worth the emotional investment.So, I gave up, closed the cover, and left this book for someone else to care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory, but good","review":"For her debut novel, Karin Slaughter has produced an excellent mystery, featuring an interesting story, good suspense, and gore galore. The two main characters are both interesting: a female pediatrician (who also serves as the town's coroner) and her ex-husband, the Chief of Police. (Less interesting is a thirld character, a police detective, who features prominently in parts of the story.)The case is a tough one: someone in their small Georgia town is committing a series of horrible assaults on women. At times the story is more graphic than is good for the digestion, but it is effective. Slaughter is definitely off to a fast start. I think fans (and ex-fans) of Patricia Cornwell will like this one.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid and terrifying.....","review":"Karin Slaughter thrusts the reader into her story from the very beginning!! Her writing comes at you fast and hard and you are propelled into the world of Sara Linton, a pediatrician and also the town coroner.When Sara discovers a college professor in a diner who has been brutally raped and mutilated, moments from death, the horrifying story begins. Is this a random act, will there be others and who can be behind the cold, precise tortuous murder? Sara must deal with the facts in her job as coroner and the feeling that somehow it is her responsibility to find the missing fragments to a perplexing, horrendous murder.Events from Sara's past surface, affecting the way she looks at everything in her life and coloring her perspective.This is a compelling, fast paced, psychological thriller that is both vivid and terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blindsighted","review":"I am not in the habit of reviewing books that I read.

Thoughts with other"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"If you enjoy books where every female character is raped (brutally and horrifically) and the reader is told what makes the crime worse is THEY ENJOYED IT, then this is a book for you. Victims are nailed to the floor (yes, nails through hands and feet) and \\"made love to.\\" The rapist is obvious from the very beginning and the entire book just fails on every level. I cannot believe the high rating for this complete piece of garbage.Because of the high ratings for this series I decided to give this horrible author another chance and started the second book in the Grant County series. If the first rape-fest book in the series wasn't enough, the characters relive the horror of the first book endlessly. Page after page of a woman reliving the horrific rape from the first book, and saying she is dead because the worst thing was she enjoyed it. This author is looking for an excuse to publish rape pornography and this series seems to fit the genre perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindsighted review","review":"while it is graphic, i loved it. have read her books before. more Karin Slaughter books on Book Bub, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I have read several Karin Slaughter books. These books can be heartbreaking and inspiring. I have enjoyed them very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Something","review":"This book was good, I'll give it that. However, it was missing something. What happened with Jeffery getting shot, and the brick thrown through the window? Slaughter sends us cryptic messages that it's someone from the force, however that story line sort of just keps swept under the rug and we hear nothing about it afterwards. I don't like to be left wondering.For those that complain about the rape scenes, and accuse Slaughter of \\"slapping rape victims in the face\\" - perhaps you should re-read the book. It clearly explains to the reader that the drug, Belladona, CAUSES the victims to hallucinate things and react differently than they normally would. In no way is Slaughter implying that victims of rape enjoy what's done to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Karin's writing","review":"I have never read any of Karin Slaughters books. I am now hooked. I am going through this series like it is a hot fudge sundae."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great read - but a mile-wide plot hole (spoiler alert !)","review":"Yes, this is a great read, provided you're prepared not to think too much about it. Pretty graphic, shocking and fast-paced. BUT (spoiler-alert) we find out at the end that the very first rape scene is almost identical to what happened to Sara, and ... she doesn't happen to mention that at the time ? Would you not think someone as intelligent as her might have gone \\"whoa - perhaps there's a connection ?\\". But I guess that would have made for a much shorter book ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bindsighted","review":"Painfully predictable, there is nothing original here. The surprise identity of the killer is no surprise as its fairly obvious from the moment they appear that they're the killer. Character wise, these people are really difficult to warm to. Everyone is so angsty and shouty, the relationship between Linton and her ex grated. Are we supposed to root for them to get back together? They're just idiots and the conversations between them never ring true. Slaughter has some decent ideas but desperately needs a decent editor to sort them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely violent sexual crimes. Unjustified abuse of shocking value","review":"The extreme violence and perversion of the sexual crimes depicted in this book are disturbing and, in my opinion, highly critizable. Please read other reviews to find examples that could help you make up your mind about whether you want to read it or not as I can't bring it upon myself to repeat this books' grossest rape details. The author is undeniably a good writer. Her talent makes this book even more dangerous. I wonder whether the author and her publisher have deliberately chosen to increase the book's box office chances by raising the stakes in shocking value. This was completely unnecessary given that the book's plot and characters are well enough strong without the escalated violence and obscenity of the crimes. Such an escalation of violence could inspire weak-minded people and contribute to trivializing \\"ordinary\\" sexual crime. I better not think of the effect it could have on young readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eroticizing Rape","review":"I've read my share of serial killer stories, so I know the conventions. This looked to be good . . . it has a really strong female central character and appealing investigators. But I have rarely seen an author eroticize rape the way this author does. The killer tells the women he drugs and assaults that he is \\"making love\\" to them, which I know is supposed to be a part of the horror, but there's a way this writer constructs the scenes of violence that I find truly disgusting. These serial killer stories are a dime a dozen anymore, and few do more than present disgusting scenes and allow you to see the investigators become increasingly distressed. For books that go outside the genre, read something like Peter Robinson's Aftermath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre & often annoying","review":"After all the advance hype, I expected this book to be much better than it is. The three main characters are irritating and hard to like. The author apparently couldn't decide whether to make them warmly sympathetic or coldly off-putting and ended up trying to give both qualities to all three, with the result that their behavior is sometimes jarringly inconsistent. The writing is pedestrian and often clumsy. (Example: Slaughter uses the word \\"mumbled\\" so many times -- often more than once on a single page -- that it became funny after a while, and the image of all these people walking around mumbling constantly was very distracting.) Long stretches of the book are flat and boring. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new crime series","review":"Ms. Slaughter has captured the essence of the small southern town in her first book, \\"Blindsighter\\". I was quite impressed; well developed and interesting characters, scary and intriguing plot and a really horrible bad guy. I like her style and really got hooked on the story which I finished in a couple of days. It is one of those that is very difficult to put down. It is a bit graphic at times, but so is life. I look forward to reading the rest of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disagree with the Violence Criticisms","review":"I won't rehash the the storyline as it has been already fully described by other readers. I just want to respectfully voice my disagreement with the many reviews here and other venues that criticize the violence in the book. I've had this book for over a year and kept putting off reading because of those opinions. Yes, there was violence and rape, but other than the autopsy description of the first murder I didn't think the author went overboard in a gorefest. I don't want to give anything away, but as the rapist drugged his victims, the description of the rape and violence came from this drugged state and was somewhat softened. Okay, yeah, I know - rape is rape, but I wasnt' cringing from the description. All in all, I thought the book was well paced, had good characterizations and plan on reading Kisscut and Karin's newest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review","review":"A little slowNot very exciting enough to keep me interestedwould not recommend to anyone who likes excitement and or adventure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it - can't put it down","review":"This is the first book in the Grant Country Series, which got me hooked. Karin Slaughter does an excellent job drawing you into the story and wondering what is going to happen next. I've found all her books suspenseful and terrifying. Some of it disturbing but I couldn't put it down. I love that she has written more books with the same characters in this series, Kisscut, A Faint Cold Fear, Indelible, Faithless, and Beyond Reach. I also enjoyed the Will Trent/Atlanta series but find that I really enjoy the character Sara in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as all the others","review":"I was not disappointed!

The perfect book for all the readers of slasher serial-killer trash novels. After all the good things I'd heard about this book, I can't believe how poorly written and executed it turned out to be. And there's two more coming? Well at least I can take them off my 'want' list. Too bad Ms. Slaughter couldn't include some of the better aspects of the female crime-writers and their characters and leave the 'made-for-TV' movie stuff out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trilogy?!","review":"Please no! No more of this adjective laden, heavy-handed, gruesome and gratuitously violent writing for me. The plotting is tedious, trite and full of coincidences that would be individually hard to believe, but taken together they inevitably ask for too much suspension of disbelief on the reader's part.Dr. Sara Linton should be a strong female character--one that this genre lacks all too often. But she just ends up being a whiny and unbelievably drawn caricature of a woman we've seen all too often and none too flatteringly before. Her relationships and interactions with and reactions to the other characters lack the depth and realness that a better writer could convey.The only positive I could find would be in the author's ability to describe the small town feel of her part of the deep South along with its prejudices and secrecy. Ultimately a disappointment, considering the hype and protracted release fanfare, but perhaps some will take a chance on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"As an avid reader, I can state with assurance that this books sucks. I only made it to page 17 before I had to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence, and a hum drum, cliche ending","review":"This was clearly written to feed off the public's seeming desire for gore. It reads like a how-to manual for serial killers, and the ending is straight out of a Lifetime Originals Movie. It's that cheesy. Save your money and buy something else from a writer who can do more than coat countless pages with blood to hide a thin plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blindsighted Comments","review":"I had heard good things about Karin Slaughter's writing. This was my first of her books. But for me it was nearly impossible to get through. I quit reading several times but each time felt I should keep going and give the author a chance. The story is gross and disgusting. The characters are mostly unlikeable. The book is not clever or suspenseful. On the positive side, her writing skill is good. I love a good mystery, this is not one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindsided","review":"I would give this book five stars. But then I love any thing she writes. She's the best. I really enjoy reading her books. I am now reading BEYOND REACH, AND CAN'T SEEM TO PUT IT DOWN.jO mILLER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Fan","review":"The first book in the Grant County series. And what an opener. A particularly disturbing murder involving a blind woman explodes at you like a whiplash. Clearly KS doesn't go easy on any of her characters. Everyone's fair game. Coroner Sara Linton and her chief of police ex-husband Jeffery Tolliver must work together to solve the case, something Sara is not too happy about. There is certainly still love there, but also deep wounds that are still too fresh. I smell a rekindle. Another main character is Lena, a young police officer and the first female cop to be hired in Grant County. She is constantly trying to prove herself, which results in her being rash and unpredictable. She is my least favourite character but I'll cut her some slack as her character has a pretty hard time in this book. The final scenes are disturbing and sick - tread with care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book--","review":"Even though this is not Karin's first book, it is the first one published.

Characters were fairly two dimensional, plot was fairly plodding. Not awful, but nothing out of the ordinary either. Doesn't even come close to Kathy Reichs or Patricia Cornwell. No substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"This book was not an unpleasant read but to review it like it's great literature or even a great Whodunit is ridiculous. The writing wasn't bad but every now and then it had a jarring note. The characters were not well drawn, the ending was horribly predictable and weak. The murderer was neither scary or believable, although I did like the outlines of the pediatrician/coroner. I don't think the book lives up to its marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The obvious suspect","review":"The book started off at a great pace--very tight and intense. However, I thought that many of the characters were cliches. The female detective with something to prove, the beautiful but coldly efficient Dr. Sara Linton, her hunky ex-husband the chief of police (who only cheated on her because she was coldly efficient and he needed attention from her). However, the biggest disappointment was that I figured out the killer early on. He was a cliche too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapfest","review":"I found this book bothersome because it relies on sensationalized violence to grip its readers over smart plotting or interesting characters. Do we really need to read about a killer raping wounds or knocking out the front teeth of his victims to enhance his sexual gratification? This level of detail would be acceptable if it were an integral part of the plot or characters. While it's predictable who the killer is and how he is going to die, his motivations come out of left field, rendering all the detective work of the protagonists moot.I'm not a prude, but it just seems that Slaughter had an agenda to out-gruesome Thomas Harris. She succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and Powerful Writing","review":"Karin Slaughter has written a real page-turner here. It's got blood and gore and violence that keeps the pulse pounding without hitting the stomach with nausea. There's action and suspense right from the start. But more than this, there's a realism and a humanity to the writing and characters that lifts this book above the usual run of the genre -- and that's something rare indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing, but....","review":"I am afraid that this very talented writer is appealing to the most vile of human qualities in her graphic descriptions of the sex and violence in this book. Frankly it greatly detracted from what could have been a P. Cornwall level novel. I will not be looking for any more K. Slaughter books until I hear that she has enough faith in the reading public and her own skills to feel that she can sell a novel without such sensationalism. Give me Grafton, Kellerman (either) or Hillerman anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing -- horrible plot","review":"Although she writes well, the subject matter is less than desirable. There is by far too much violence deplicted towards women, and just the overall treatment of women, although the characters are srong, the sadness is that Slaughter puts down everything women have overcome with all of her women characters -- the men are generally flawless, the women, inperfect.

While the first album was a nice hard rock (probably heavy metal at the time) with nice hooks, and the 2nd was an ok hard rock album with few hooks, 3.v is Zebra reborn as a hard rocking pop outfit.The album went absolutely nowhere, but after 16 years, the album holds up very nicely.Given the price of this set, it's well worth the purchase, though you might want to rip it, and remove some of NTL's weaker tracks.4.5 stars for 3.v2.5 stars for NTL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Classic Zebra Albums On One CD","review":"NO TELLIN' LIES/3V features two classic Zebra albums on one CD. 3V is better than NO TELLIN' LIES, but both are great examples of progressive metal that make you wonder why the band didn't make it as big as such antisocial artists as Twisted Sister.

Nonetheless, I found the book to be insightful and helpful. I've read other relationship books and this book added a different \\"twist\\" which made a lot of sense to me. The book offered different perspectives to common problems and was geared towards self-empowering solutions. I definitely recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor quality critique of charismatic fakes.","review":"This book lists some of the religious phonies the author has seen/heard of. He argues that Christians should not give up on supernatural manifestations because of phonies, but should become more discerning of scams while embracing true manifestations of the Holy Spirit. His style of argument is very illogical, even though his conclusions are usually correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for '06 GT","review":"The installation was relatively easy, but required some way of raising the car in order to reach the undercarriage. Unbolting the stock shifter and bolting in the new shifter was a matter of unscrewing 3 nuts and 1 bolt. Changing out the shifter itself wasn't as difficult as reaching certain parts underneath the car. The Hurst shifter produced a noticeably shorter throw, and I thought it made the shifting motion much more precise. The only way I can compare it to the stock shifter is that with the Hurst, the 1st to 2nd throw is about as short as 3rd to Neutral with the stock shifter. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. It looks great, drives great, and was delivered in one day to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh!","review":"Micheal Ventura's THE DEATH OF FRANK SINATRA is the kind of book I cannot stand: drowned in a sea of screaching, \\"Look at Me I Want a National Book Award!\\" bilious prose, too pretentious for the planet earth, filled with characters who spout non sequiters like they're trapped in a French New Wave film with fouled-up subtitles, and a plot like a hastily assembled balsa wood outhouse. I felt especially cheated by the Kennedy assassination hook that lead absolutely nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake/phony/fraud","review":"I was intrigued -- I thought it was an investigative report on Mr. Sinatra's final days (the tackiness of the title notwithstanding), but then I noted from the reviews quoted that this title came out *before* May 14, 1998 (the day of Old Blue Eyes' death) -- meaning this was just a work of fiction.

I'm going to blame the editor instead. This book has so many loose strings and plot holes and ridiculous dialogue. I think bookstores better slip this book in the game section because it became a Where's Waldo task for me to find the errors in every chapter. At first it made me mad. Then it made me laugh. Every author has their writers block moments and this one must be Ms Michaels. A bitter heroine who might be stronger than her weak charactered brothers but is just as spiteful as her horrid father isn't what I look for in a romance novel. Save your money and your time and skip this one. She has better novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money","review":"This book is terrible. I bought it to read over Derby weekend. Obviously Fern Michaels has never been to Kentucky or she wouldn't have written such an inaccurate book. Absolutely nothing happens in the first 300 pages. The book is predictable, boring and has no character development. There is no one in the novel that you care about. Why would you want to read any more about these shallow people? Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this trilogy, but...","review":"I have read the Texas saga, the Vegas trilogy, and the Kentucky trilogy, as well as a few other books written by Fern Michael. For some reason, the Kentucky trilogy is the only one that I really loved. I love Nealy, her 'rags to riches' story and some of the people that come into her life.I do love the horse breeding/racing storyline too. But something that I've noticed, and the main reason why I stopped reading Fern Michael's books, is the continuity in her storyline from book to book. Sometimes even from events at the beginning of a book not quite matching up with the twists she puts in at the end. It's like she decides what she wants to throw into the story as she's going along and then doesn't even remember that the details differ from what she's already written. For this reason, I could only give these books 4 stars. As long as you can overlook that flaw in the writting, I would recommend these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading","review":"This book series kept me reading, could hardly put the kindle down..

You just know everyone is going to live happily ever after... not like real life..Terri Glass"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated","review":"After hearing about what a great author Fern Michaels was I read Kentucky Rich and was VERY dissapointed. The characters are one dimensional and even though a lot of things happen in the book there is no real plot to speak of. Characters she has introduced in such a way as to make them seem important are killed off randomly and the book jumps around so much that you never really settle in to the story. Also, the book clearly leans on her earlier books. If you are like me and haven't read them you realize this book cannot stand alone. The only reason to read it is if you are so attached to her earlier books that you can't bear to let go of the characters. I'll skip any further books by Fern Michaels after this disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family reunion of all time's Colemans and Thorntons","review":"The Family Reunion! This book has it all Sallies Vegas and Billy's Class of Texas and Nealy's Diamonds.I loved how Fern brings all the love and grander of two families in to one book ,and the one thing that touched my hart in this book is how she uses Grit in all the books but the one thing that still stay's in my mind is how Nealy said to the family at the door \\"Im nealy Coleman and you are?\\"Nealy Coleman is to me like having Emilia Coleman,Fanny thornton,Billy Coleman and Maggie coleman wraped into one strong woman and she is what do you exspect from a Derby winner and a triple crown .Kenticky Rich is everything you would exspect money, power ,love and tears !

The plot is quite cliched and I thought way too much of the plot was carried off in conversations. Overall, there wasn't much fluency and the writing wasn't that good. I thought it was a bit unbelievable from being able to adopt Nealy and Emmie right down to winning the races. I guess that's what you calll fiction. Anyway, I have read better books. I can safely say it was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Pure fantasy...for anyone who knows anything about horses or horse racing will be rolling their eyes with disbelief.

Please, when will this book come out in paperback?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay story, but...","review":"...not for those who have not read the previous series -- the Texas and Vegas series. I haven't read those books, and I suddenly felt that there were all these unknown characters thrown in the mix more than half-way through. It was very confusing!The other problem I had with this book was the multiple plots and climaxes. Nealy's young, the Kentucky Derby is a big deal, that whole story line climaxes and is resolved in a few pages. On to the next, and the next, and the next. All the characters end up being underdeveloped and shallow, sometimes doing things you wouldn't expect (would her daughter REALLY have hidden out for a week after the problem on the cruise? It just doesn't fit the character!).The story was interesting, but there were just too many flaws. I won't be returning for the rest of this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Story about a Sweet Sheltie","review":"Excellent story for families who don't have a pet, YET!

The perserverance of these 5 person teams is unbelievable. Watching them raft, run, ride and climb is inspiring. The arrival of the storm almost made it seem to be Hollywood scripted.

This is the blueprint for heavy metal, and even if you're just a hard rock fan, this cd will become important to you.

The fact that the songs aren't short mainstream soundbites is even more impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their last truly heavy album","review":"\\"Justice\\" is the second best album by Metallica and last before going commercial.

Just listen to Shortest Straw, Blackened or Frayed ends of Sanity. They sll rule. The best song on the CD is \\"One\\". It changes from dark and melodic to loud and fast. Another reason why it is great is it is like an orchestra of guitars. They don't play traditional metal, they turn it into something totally different and that is what MADE Metallica. If people say it is too long then they don't have any patience. No song is shorter than 5 minutes but get it anyway.

Every song on here is perfect with none sounding repetitive. This is for sure Metallica's most complete album and there crowning achivement. This unfortunately IMO would be there last great album.

In fact I only listen to 3 songs, \\"Blackened\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Shortest Straw\\". The good thing is that these are really good songs. I can like two or three songs that are awesome and still call it a good CD. But if there are two half-good songs that I don't really enjoy I give it away.

In a sense I think that is true, they just went through a major change in the band and even the success of \\"One\\" probably did not prepare them for what would come with their next record. Also seen here is even heavier sounding music, the speed metal is all but gone. Also important to note is the drum work.

One is the most musical metal song I have ever heard. The sound quality in the album was that way because they wanted to do something different. Lars's drumming sucks rocks. He doesn't know what a musical phrase is. His beat consists of the basic standard rock beat. Nothing more, unless he changes it in another one of his misinterpretations of the melody. He misinterpreted 90% of the melody in the album, he doesn't know how to make music on the drums. He figures the note played on guitar should have the corresponding note played on drums, so he plays exactly with 2nd guitar, as if he was playing guitar. It sucks. You may think it's a cool idea but it destroyed at least half the melody in the album and if he wasn't there the album would have better ratings.He should have stayed a tennis player, he has no musical blood.4 stars for the music, minus a star because of Lars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice for all","review":"If your a metal fan then this is a must for your collection.

On suggestion to metal fan's reading this is to point out that while I'm collecting a large quantity of Metal from the 80's and 90's I recommend getting remasters whenever possible.

It's awesome: a metal album where you can hardly listen to the bass guitar!!That put aside, Jason himself says this album is terribly bad and that he would prefer to record Elvis songs than something like this.

It has two flaws though; \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\" and \\"Harvester Of Sorrow\\" aren't that good, but the rest of the songs rock! I have only listened to two other Metallica c.d.'s besides this one; \\"Master Of Puppets\\" and \\"Metallica\\". They are both very good too. I can't wait to listen to other Metallica c.d.'s. I highly recommend this c.d. if you like hard rock music! ROCK ON METALLICA!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EPIC ALBUM","review":"Never before have I heard so many good, powerfull, songs on one CD. This is indeed one of, if not the, best Metallica albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Bass?","review":"If this were mixed like MOP, this would get a 5/5.

Also, some of the songs, like Frayed Ends of Sanity seemed long just for the sake of being long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kills South Of Heaven","review":"Now, before I am Lynched for writing that this Kills South of Heaven, let me just say, that compared to everything else out of the time, MetallicA were just light years ahead.

This was MetallicA's last great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Much To Say...Simply Masterful","review":"Dang, too bad I can't give this a million stars!I don't have as much that I can say about this album compared to other people. What I can say, though, is that this is the greatest album Metallica has ever recorded. But don't get me wrong, I loved Puppets as much as anyone else. Justice was just better, and I'll even say by quite a bit. When I listen to the album, I try to forget about the bad recording quality that it present on it, and I just listen to the MUSIC. When I do this, the true musicians that Hetfield and Ulrich were really jumps out at me. Two best songs on the album are, and I had to really think about this, The Frayed Ends of Sanity, and ...And Justice For All. I'm not a die-hard, Kill-'Em-All-and-that's-all-I-like Metallica fan, but people, I know my music, I know my Metallica, AND IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic album.","review":"Need something to spice up your workouts?

This is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time! I kid you not. If you heard songs like \\"blackened\\", \\"and justice for all\\", \\"one\\", or \\"harvester of sorrow\\", you would definitley agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's 2nd best album","review":"Metallica was one of the bands that got me listening to rock and roll as a young black kid in the late 80's and early 90's. During this time I would watch Yo MTV Raps and Headbanger's Ball on the same day and see Public Enemy, Slick Rick, Guns N Roses and Metallica. By far the best band of the 1980's, this album is the fourth(and unfoutunately the last) of their masterpiece albums; their political stances and superb musicianship drew me into them and got me wanting to play guitar and drums. I love Jamed Hetfield's voice and great penchant for writing lyrics that mean something. Even though they have fallen off HARD, listening to this brings back memories. Go get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"This isn't one of Metallica's better discs... when Cliff Burton died after they produced the magnificent \\"Master of Puppets\\", their prog-rock leanings became pronounced to the point of self-parody. I've got nothing against prog-rock, but the songs on Justice are dispersed, ineffective, repetitive, and directionless. Also, the production is incredibly shoddy; Jason Newsted's bass is completely inaudible, providing a lack of harmony and coherency. Only for die-hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not quite their best","review":"This is a good CD but I fail to see how it's Metallica's best. A few songs on this album can be considered in the same league as the songs on Lightning and Puppets. These are \\"Blackened\\" (the best song on the disc & one of the band's best), \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\". The others are good, but substandard compared to the likes of \\"Creeping Death\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\". Overall, the sound of this album suffers, probably from the production. There's something about the sound of the guitars that doesn't sit right with me; they're a bit muddy sounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely their Best!","review":"This CD is Metallica's best work. It has more feeling than the earlier albums, and more energy than the later, slower albums. This CD has some of their best songs, even if the recording isn't that great. (Also, James doesn't do that \\"Yeah-heh\\" thing at the end of every line- a definite plus!) If you want a doog Metallica CD, I suggest that you buy \\". . .And Justice for All.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, BUT NOT THE BEST","review":"This album is very good in its old-style, angry way, but it just doesn't quite meet the standards set by Ride the Lightning and Master Of Puppets. \\"Justice\\" is the last of Metallica's true-metal albums, before they converted to suit a more mainstream audience with \\"Metallica\\". The Black Album's songs are written and arranged better than their old releases and show more musical maturity, but Justice was recorded when Metallica still retained that invaluable, previously mentioned \\"anger\\". I also believe that \\"...And Justice For All\\" is one of Metallica's greatest songs ever, up there with \\"Fade to Black,\\" \\"Master Of Puppets,\\" and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". All in all, \\"Justice\\" is completely worth the money I paid for it, though perhaps I should have bought \\"Ride the Lightning\\" or \\"Master Of Puppets\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"this CD is the best of them all!","review":"This cd is the best because of the musc learics. the song ONE is the best of the whole cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's masterpiece...Track 4","review":"WOW!

They were able to produce 1 more good album before committing career suicide by switching styles.So this is Metallica's greatest album ever. They really knew what they were doing on this one, and cranked out song after killer-f#@%ing song, with a mixture of thrash, metal, progression, and even some rock.+Hammet blows us all away with his solos, really putting our ears over the top!+Hetfields lyrics just flat out suck!+Ulrich kills everyone with his rhythms!If you have this album already you know what I mean. If you don't, what the hell is wrong with you??"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect thrash album","review":"This is possibly my all time favorite album of heavy metal music of any kind. It has a unique sound of its own, the bass is rather quiet on this album, but actually I think this very sound is a part of why this album is so good, the unique sound grows on you. It sounds kind of like everything unnecessary is stripped away, and I think this sound fits perfectly with the general feeling of this album and the themes in its lyrics. I don't think it could have been mixed any other way without sacrificing some of this album's uniqueness. When you compare the sound to the Black Album, of course the latter has a more well-rounded sound but in some way it also lacks the edge of this album. I like both but I prefer this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song on this album is heavy metal perfection","review":"Not even one song sucks. This album is the best that metallica has ever come up with. They need to go back to the 'justice' days and stop hanging out with garth brooks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Riffs, Very Epic, but where's the Bass?","review":"And Justice for All is on the whole an outstanding metal album, with songs like \\"And Justice for All\\", \\"Blackened\\" and \\"One\\" demonstrating the epic scale MetallicA brought to their songwriting and lyrics before the dark days of LOAD and RE-LOAD(of crap.) A major shortcoming of AJFA, however, is its complete lack of bass in the sound mix. There is nothing to add depth to the inspired guitar work of Hammett and Hetfield or to augment the ferocious percussion of Ulrich. It's a real shocker to hear MetallicA w/o great basswork, as Cliff Burton was as talented with a 4 string as anyone, I challenge somebody to say he was not an EXTREMELY gifted bass player. Anyway, Newsted's sound is utterly lost in the mix and it leaves many of the tracks, especially \\"Blackened\\", sounding like they are unfinished. Overall, an outstanding work on the whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metal- METALLICA","review":"AWESOME METAL CD! Necessary addition to any metal collection! ONE OF THE BEST METAL CDS EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAy Over Rated","review":"Besides One and Blackened, this cd was a total disappointment. All the songs sound the exact same after a short while. I'm glad my mom actually bought this cd for me(so it's not my money that was wasted) and I'm glad I sold it too. Metallica is one of the most over hyped and over rated bands in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I just don't get it. How could Metallica, one of the best metal bands ever, release this as a follow up to Master of Puppets? I absolutely love this band, but the songs on this album really do sound like noise and a lot of yelling.On a side note-I have an IQ WAY above 70 (156), and I still love Metallica.I also happen to like Led Zeppelin, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"A great deal of Metallica fans consider this to be their last great work. I disagree. This has to be one of the flatest sounding albums I've ever heard. Most of the album sounds uninspired. The drums have absolutely no punch at all, the riffs are flat, the solos sound miniscule, and as pointed out by many other reviewers, Jason's bass is completely inaudible. He should have stayed with Flotsam and Jetsam. The only songs that I like are \\"To live is to die\\" and \\"Dyer's eve\\". Those two songs and the lyrics are, in my opinion, the only good aspects about this album. Well, at least it's light years ahead of \\"St. Anger\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"my god it's dull","review":"Did you ever hear Tales Of Topographic Oceans by Yes ? They were known for having \\"chops\\" but holy cow they didn't know when to end a song either.At least Metallica followed this turkey with something as wonderful as \\"The Black Album\\" to help erase the pain.They sure didn't serve any \\"Justice\\" on these 2 LONG records.It's more like they were dishing out the punishment.They committed the crime.I just don't know what the big deal is about this particular album,not Metallica in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I loved this music when I was 14, but now I don't get what all the hype is about. It is really boring music, they play the same riff all through every song. It isn't really fast at all just a lot electronics to it that the 80s had, not much content to the songs either, but they are a bit catchy. Probably from DOS or FORTRAN.2 thumbs down, I gave these albums away glad I did. Shows what a joke 80s band were."},{"rating":"1","title":"just noise","review":"This band, as well as its members (Hammett and Hetfield) are as overrated as I've ever seen. All the reviewers citing this album as great rock music need to go back a couple of decades to the true masters - Led Zepplin. In comparison, Metallica pales. Period, no discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sell-Out Begins","review":"This has to be one of the most disappointing CDs I've ever bought. I'm a Metallica fan from back in the early days of Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning. I also really like Master Of Puppets. This release, however, adopts a grunge approach that Metallica would see on through with the remainder of their releases, with some exceptions in the S/T release. The songs on this release are uninspired, dragging, and hard to follow pieces of pure agony to the ears. Metallica has abandoned what made them famous for the up and coming modern sound and they fail, miserably. I originally bought this release when it came out, gave it the benefit of several listens, and promptly threw it out. I again got it in 2001 to give it another shot. Bad mistake. I hate it now more than then. If you're a fan of older Metallica, this is NOT for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica a great band? thats a laugh!","review":"Metallica has no class. If you call Metallica legends then please Metallica, Get a good song and then i will not be writing bad about you when you get a song worth listening to. But, Metallica's lead singer still has a good...3-4 years left before he tottaly go's down the shoot. Metallica is a laugh and Metallica will always be a laugh in my mind and anybody with comman sence and an I.Q. over 70."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica at its best","review":"For Pete's (or anybody else's) sake, don't take the lyrics seriously, but if you have some steam to blow off, or are into lifting weights, then the unrelenting noise, the driving riffs, the screecing guitar solos, the screeming voice, and the superhuman drumming are nearly impossible to beat. Metallica has always produced music that you can listen to on two levels. You could sit and head bang, or you can analyze the lyrics (with a dose of a sense of humor), and then head bang. And really, there has never been a better song title than \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\". Come on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a turn from what Metallica was...","review":"Metallica's speed trash metal ended with Cliff Burton's death. In this album they changed to a more proffesional style. At first, I didn't like it; afterwards it still was kind of different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice Is Served","review":"This is my favorite Metallica album, which is odd because this album has so many tracks that I faithfully skip over. It's my opinion that Metallica has great songs but terrible albums. On this disc the tracks that I skip outnumber the songs that rock hard. Still, the numbers that do rock hard will leave you pumped and psyched. I love the hard sounding guitars, the pounding drums, and the thumping bass that dominate the best tracks on this disc. Best tracks: #1, 2, 4, and 5. The rest is for diehard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Metallica Masterpiece","review":"From the starting of Blackened through Dyers Eve, this was the last great Metallica release. This release is raw, energy driven and uncompromising. As with there three albums with Cliff, there isn't a bad song among them. My personal favorites are Blackened (total energy), Harvester of Sorrow (What balls it took to write a song about baby killing), and Frayed Ends Of Sanity. This album came out in 1988, a year in which rock giants such as Van Halen, Scorpions, and Judas Priest released the worst albums of their career. This is true Metallica. Nothing but down and dirty metal. After this release, Metallica lost it's edge and became Metallica 1991 LTD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice Reigns","review":"\\"And Justice for All\\" marks the end of the old school Metallica. This record is one of their heaviest and most profound. The lyrics dip into more political themes while maintaining their hard edge bitterness that makes them such an outspoken band. Often referred to as the last album before they sold out, there are no songs here to sell pop records. If you love the hard edge of Master of Puppets, this record picks up where they left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"YET ANOTHER MASTERPIECE","review":"This is another masterpiece by Metallica, more awesome metal, another album you must own, this is bassist Jason Newsted's first album with Metallica after taking Cliff Burton's place, but don't let that fool you, the music here is just as awesome as it always was, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the greatest metal/rockalbum of all time","review":"i purchased and justice for all in 1991 when i was 10 years old. since then i have had to purchase it 3 times due to wear and tear on the disc. i dont really care that the bass is hardly audible you cannot find a greater group of songs on one record. the lyrics, riffs, solos ,and drumwork are awe inspiring. my personal fave is to live is to die. i have never heard a more emotional beautiful song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, it's Metallica!","review":"\\"...And Justice for All\\" is a great album, but that's no surprise when it comes to Metallica.

My personal favorite is the almost ten minute long \\"...And Justice For All\\".Every song on the album is great, including a ten minute instrumental, \\"To Live Is To Die\\".

The thing is, I wonder why they even bothered to find a new bassist. Throughout the entire album, the bass has been meticulously and entirely eradicated from every single track. Hetfield has even said himself that the reasoning for this was to show the 'Newkid' that he was no Cliff Burton, put him in his place, so to speak - which leads me to the question, why bother hiring him to play bass for an album where he is virtually inaudible? With that being said, I still enjoy the album, which the bulk of tracks was written by Burton. Best bits? The unforgettable, 'One', 'Harvester of Sorrow' and the beautifully composed (by Burton) 'To Live is to Die'."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet ...","review":"dude if you dont like this cd you must be high some guy from tx said that this isnt metallica. now ill admit it isnt no puppets or lightning but its still extremely extreme.

This album is great! A phenomanal opening song. If you want thrash, buy this album! If you like more melow songs, buy this album. An all around, must have CD. This album brought Metallicas first music video, One. The song and video are based on an early 30s novel Johnny Got His Gun. Probabally the best song on the album is Harvester of Sorrow. A metal song that no other band could ever quite duplicate. The song Frayed Ends of Sanity begins with an old Slave Chant that really puts feeling into the song. Another great song is Shortest Straw. A real thrash song thatll have your neck hurting for a month. Unfortunately it is not performed live very often. I dont usually give albums 5 star but this one DAMN WELL deserves it.

For a half speed master, this sounds absolutely horrible! The signal of the recording is so low, I have to crank my phono preamp so much, that the surface noise of the vinyl is noticeable. This should never happen, ESPECIALLY on a heavy metal record, where the music should be so loud it drowns out any lp noise. Do yourself a favor, spend your money on an older original pressing, this one is horrible. I have a UK pressing of this album from vertigo from the early 90s that BLOWs this pressing out of the water, half speed mastered or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO GIVES A ...IF THEY MADE A VIDEO!?","review":"metallica might have lost a few fans on this cd, simply because they made their first video...for \\"one\\".

It has good solid guitar work, the drumming is good, there are good solos, and the vocals aren't drowned out or too dominating. I also find it good music when i'm working, and i can just play it in the background, and that's not an insult. But i find that i didnt enjoy anything after this album by this band. Maybe \\"fuel\\" ocasionally or \\"shoot me again\\" but i beleave this is a great effort, and a killer album, and the last of the band's kind.So if you like metallica and you like metal, don't miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And Another Masterpiece","review":"Metallica, the greatest heavy metal band of all time, writes their 4th album thats is like all their others, A CLASSIC.

Although the songs in this album are just a bit slower than the previous albums, you know that Metallica was very picky about what they put on this album. Many people think that this is their last descent album, and others say that it is the beginning of a bad era for Metallica's music, but for me, this is just another album that im proud of owning and listening too.

[I]... continued to play them and eventually my prejudice faded and my appreciation for the musicianship of these guys grew and changed my whole musical outlook forever. I ended up wearing out this album and several tapes. But enough about the history lesson... this is the album that made Metallica the success they are today. Which is plenty of reason for anybody who loved Master of Puppets and previous albums to have ample reason to [notlike] it. It's a great album though and important to anybody who likes Metallica OR Alternica. Either as the end of a great band or the beginning of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one that doesn't get it?","review":"What was the big deal with this album?... One is good, yeah, it's the one Metallica song everyone knows, I don't care who you are, where you live or how old you are. Yeah, it's great. Everybody knows that guitar part in the middle, I don't have to describe it, you know what I mean... Didn't this win some kind of Grammy or something, for what, worst album of the year? Buy the single of One, excellently inspired by Johnny Go HIs Gun (movie/book) and the video is great, one of the most groundbreaking and memorable.

I'm not a huge fan anymore, although I'll never part with their GREAT recordings in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bass","review":"This is simply the worse Metallica album ever. Contrary to what someone else wrote the bass is down for the WHOLE record. Why? Just to mess with Jason Newsted. As a bassist/guitarist, this album is weak, weak, weak.

While not as good as Master of puppets, this is better than Ride the lightning. You need a little getting used to for this album though.

He begged permission from the General officer in charge, Luftwaffe General Kurt Student, to go along in one of the gliders for the ride, then forced his way into the 2-seat little plane carrying Mussolini to safety and claimed all the credit for the mission when it landed. Skorzeny was not the \\"most dangerous man in Europe,\\" but he was certainly its biggest liar. Mors, Student, Berlepsch, and a dozen other participants tried for years after the war to set the record straight, but the Skorzeny myth is written in stone.

The Arabic script is so reduced in size that one strains to discern the diacritics (the vowelizations and 'dots'). Size is most important in Arabic printed script, since the diacritics are crucial for error-free understanding. I have better than 20/20 visual acuity but have to use a magnifying glass to ascertain the details of the Arabic script --- and even then not very comfortably.I am sorry that I spent money on this decidedly 'unfriendly' opus.

I justified the cost because I knew we would have the best garden ever and all that it produced would be worth it. Nothing could grow. I talked with our local nursery and he said the soil is way too hot. As I have visited with experienced gardners I have learned you cannot put that much compost in your soil. It burns the plants. This is my second year using my garden boxes. I purchased some regular top soil for about $14 and mixed it half and half with Mel's soil.

It turns out that he's not trying to sell anything other than the method he devised and is so enthusiastic about, but the book could have been a lot shorter and accomplished the same thing. Although he goes on and on about how little work it is and how much space you save and how much better it is than row gardening, he falls short on his descriptions of the protective structures for the individual squares, on starting seeds early and other such details. Another annoying thing is when he tells the reader that he won't explain some things since with his method the reader/gardener simply doesn't need to know. With all that said, I still plan on trying the basic method since it seems sound and indeed easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this book in the Spring of 2010 after having a weak vegetable garden in 2009.

During 80 degree days, I had to water every day or plants would start to shrivel up and die. Lesson learned: Soil is the only medium plants thrive in.

This method makes it so much easier to grow so much more in less space and have home grown food all spring, summer and fall. I never knew how rewarding it is to go to your back yard to get dinner. Also a great family activity for young families. Each child gets their own little garden box. I'll bet they eat more veggies if they grew them themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"SF Gardening","review":"This is a interesting little book. Its pretty much written at a beginner level and is oriented toward hobbyists versus larger self-sufficiency or market gardeners. A decent addition to the garden library largely because of its stick to the basics simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight forward gardening!!","review":"We purchased this book because of a recommendation from a friend and because we were looking for a simple straight forward gardening method for two people that don't have green thumbs or a great deal of time to devote. We now have a plan including a great layout that will fit in the space we have to devote, will utilize our existing sprinkler system for automatic watering (with a minor valve addition) and will be an attractive addition to our yard. We'll see what next summer's harvest brings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great!","review":"This book tells you everything you need to know about gardening. It specifies exactly what products to use, the dimensions, and it even tells you when to plant and what to plant! It is exactly what I was looking for as a brand new gardener. I am so excited to get started (too bad it is winter now so I will have to wait a few months)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Simple, easy to follow, and full of good info about gardening in a small 4x4 space.

The book will provide projects for my nephew and brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I have gardened for years and decided to try this. I already had 8 raised beds so I added a 9th using this method. Everything I planted in it did terrible. The other 8 beds in regular compost and topsoil thrived. In the square foot bed, the transplants never grew any larger than when I planted them and the seeds, very few came up. I ended up ripping everything out after 2 months of hoping it would improve and added regular soil to the mix and replanted new seeds. I spent too much money on this one bed, what a waste. I do like the charts in the back of the book but I won't use this method again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated classic","review":"I remember watching the PBS series on Square Foot Gardening many years ago, so when I started planting my first vegetable garden in years, I purchased this book. It is still an inviting way to lay out the garden, and Mel has some new methods to make it even more foolproof. Attractively illustrated and written in a friendly, engaging style."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I followed the Mel's Mix recipe to the letter, and couldn't be more disappointed. Everything we planted is yellow and spindly, if it is growing at all. I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews on here. I was looking forward to seeing if Mel's easy and inexpensive trellis was really going to be able to hold up my pumpkins and watermelons, but sadly I don't think the plants are going to make it. All that driving to get ingredients and all that work... what a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-illustrated guide for all walks of life.","review":"We bought this book because it promises to get us outside for a healthy summer activity.

She was right. I live in a rural area and only get sun on my deck and this system is perfect. The soil mix is the best I have ever used. It is low maintence. The book is easy to read with some great reference tables. There are lots of great photos and diagrams for the visual learner. Throughout the book you will even find tips for including your children. I have since purchased 2 more books as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to get started","review":"The book is informative and easy to follow. I have not started my garden but I have aquired the materials for the boxes and I have scouted out the soil components. One complaint I have read in other reviews was the vermilicite was hard to find. Home Depot carries the big bags of it here locally so that was not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"All New Square Foot Gardening","review":"This book gives great suggestions and they make so much sense.

Made container gardening easier and I will continue to do more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to own","review":"I bought a copy of All New Square Foot Gardening over a year ago. But, we recently had many couples from our neighborhood visit our backyard, where we've installed & used our square foot garden since last summer. They were amazed at the veggies we had growing there that we'd planted in mid-February & how easy they were to plant & harvest. So, we decided to buy copies of this wonderful book & gave them to our neighbors so they could learn about & do their own gardens this summer. It was pure joy to see the looks on their faces when I gave them a copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mel!","review":"This is the second square foot gardening book I have purchased written by Mel. I LOVE the fact you don't have to dig before you put the beds in. I have a builder's lot full of clay. I purchase plastic raised beds from SAMS two years ago and haven't been able to install all of them. Mostly because of the prior ground prep work.I am not 100% sold on the grids, mostly because I believe in crop rotation. But I found garden staples that will easily fit over the slats so I can more them after the growing season is over.Now to figure out how to grow tomatoes from seed without spending a fortune doing it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I was pleasantly suprised to get the \\"All New\\" Square Foot Gardening. I love square-foot gardening and this one is updated with all Mel's more current strategy. It arrived in lovely condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Honestly, if you can get past the bragging and boasting about how great Mel thinks he is, and how the SFG method TAKES! UP! LESS! SPACE! and how it's revolutionary and how everyone else is doing it wrong, it might be an okay book. But gosh, I think on every page of the forty I read, he mentioned something about how this garden takes up less space. WE GET IT, MEL, it's why we picked up the book! I couldn't take it anymore. I just wanted to read about gardening. You can learn all you need to know from this book by reading the back of seed packets and a few free online resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds me of infomercials","review":"I did find a couple of good ideas in this book, thus 2 stars. Some people say this would be good for beginners, but I don't think someone learning should be so restricted by the limits imposed by Mel. Gardening is presented like a mathematical equation. I also realized it's not just Mel sharing his ideas in a book and website, but it's all about sales. His book/forum just promotes the sale of Mel's products. I don't object to someone making a buck, but gardening is more artistic than this book allows. Read the forum on their website before purchasing, you'll quickly see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel's best work.","review":"The original Square Foot Garden was a best seller, and for a reason. I bought the revised version and found it to be even better. More photos and more detail than the original. Well worth the money for those who garden and have limited space. I would recommend this book for all gardeners, but especially for beginning gardeners or those who get overwhelmed with their gardens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-organized new spin on an old practice.","review":"Although the practices that are espoused in this book are not new, I liked the way they were presented. It's a very user-friendly book, with some good illustrations and some great ideas on trellises, box-building, etc. The book would be valuable for someone with a tiny yard, perhaps a rooftop, or other space that requires intense management of resources. The author has made the book very readable and kind of fun. For the new gardener who wants to make the most of available space, it's a good source book. This isn't a horticultural book, more of a practical guide to space and plant management. Good all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is great!","review":"The book arrived in good condition as noted at time of purchase. Shipping time was within the allowable time frame. I had hoped for faster shipping, but it was okay.

The copy I got was printed on coarse newsprint type paper; the book was smaller by an inch or more than the one I had looked at in the house of a friend; and all the photographs were in washed-out black and white rather than color as they should have been. I am not a happy customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Square Foot Gardening","review":"This soft-back book has helped get me out in the garden. It is well-organized, gives tables of how many seeds go in each square, and has a certain humorous approach that makes the reading far from dry. Following these directions, we spent about $200 to put two frames in (32 squares), planted according to directions, and I've got 2-inch tall seedlings of beans, peas, corn, watermelon and some herbs. Quite satisfied with the book and the price of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative! I can't wait to try it!","review":"I found this to be a very informative book about the history of \\"Square Foot Gardening\\" as well as a nice comparison of the old and new methods.It also is a great \\"How To\\" book because every step of the process is carefully described and illustrated with both photographs and drawings. Mel takes you every step of the way including determining how large an area is needed, the actual building of the square foot garden, and many great options for your completed garden. Mel even tells you how and when to plant to extend your growing season.I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks gardening has to be hard work, or if you just want to try something new. I can't wait to see mine growing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Visuals","review":"I love this book! I have been growing in containers semi-successfully until I bought this book. The pictures and planting suggestions are fantastic. I am visual, so it helped me to see his ideas on paper. The text is written in a very straight forward and easy to understand language. I reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in eating from their own garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gardening with LESS work","review":"This was a new concept for me. Mel makes gardening sound easy. The chapter for vertical gardening sounds like tomatoes, beans, watermelon and other vines would no longer require bending. Start planning for spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetitive on the issues that you are tempted to ignore or skip","review":"Lost track of the times the author repeated such points as; \\"do NOT use the native soil\\"; \\"use only the magic mix i/3, 1/3 and 1/3; do NOT use native soil\\"; \\"use organic compost to top up any squares\\"; \\"do NOT over plant\\" and \\"one four by four raised bed with a permanent grid per person in household\\" to name just a few. Though a shorter book could be written, the repetition should keep the both the novice and beginner on track, if they keep rereading the pertinent section [the whole thing] and happy gardening."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Improved!!","review":"I have been a fan of SFG for many years but this new book is just wonderful. The idea is simple and work is easy. Thanks Mel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Gardening Easier and more Fun","review":"Having owned the first version of this book, and having been frustrated with the work involved in improving our incredibly poor soil, the new technique of building above the soil has been a blessing. While working one full time job, one part time job, and raising two grade school children, the ease of the new box technique outlined in this book has allowed me to enjoy gardening again. Mel does a wonderful job explaining the reasons behind everything described in the book: from why the ingredients for Mel's mix are what they are, to how to start and grow almost everything you could want to grow, and how to extend your growing season if you are so inclined. Whether you are frustrated at your old way of gardening and want to learn a simpler easier way, or if you have never gardened at all and would like to try, I could not recommend \\"All New Square Foot Gardening\\" more."},{"rating":"2","title":"All New Square Foot Garden","review":"I will enjoy building a garden from this book.

We put in our square foot gardens last season with great success. We especially liked the open mesh trellis idea for growing tomatoes. We had a ton of 'em! The only minor criticism is that there could be information on controlling pests. Being a city boy I figured I only had to worry about insects.

If you can get past his bragging and self-promotion, the book has some good ideas and helpful information. I like this book (the author can be inspiring and has obviously given a lot of thought to his ideas), but I like Gaia's Garden and Food Not Lawns better.One idea the author doesn't mention is the use of free wood chips as a ground cover. Here in Portland, you can call most arborists and they will deliver free ground trees. It's better for the arborists than paying to dispose of the ground trees at a recycling center and they will schedule the delivery when they're in your area to minimize their delivery distance. You can minimize weeds by laying down a thick layer of newspapers or cardboard, and then covering them with wood chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"good info, too proud","review":"i appreciated the author's gardening experience and am looking forward to trying the method. however, it was tough to wade through his self congratulatory tone and repetitive self praise for developing the concept. i found the charts very useful for spacing and planting dates. his website is also full of testimonials without any balanced critique of his book and method. if you can stomach the arrogant tone of the book, there is some good garden wisdom to be gained."},{"rating":"1","title":"8-page pamphlet expanded into a \\"book\\"","review":"Square-foot gardening is a simple concept - to grow veggies in 4'x4' raised beds, with wood dividers on top of the soil creating square-foot blocks. The chart on page 109 is helpful. Put this chart together with the first sentence of my review, and you have the square-foot gardening concept. Expand this concept to fill over 250 pages of fluff from the author tooting his own horn, and you have this book. I'm glad I didn't buy it but only checked it out at the library. I won't be buying it, either. If you are a very beginning gardener, you may like this book.

The phone is compact and light, but has terrible reception and voice quality. Web reviews also reveal it breaks very easily. My cousin's broke after a week and she had to get a replacement. She could also barely hear on the phone. AT&T's service is really lacking, and coverage is sporadic even in big cities like DC and NY.

So trust me this is the worst piece of junk phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"an overlooked gem","review":"Though known to most as a premier power metal act on Keeper of the Seven Keys, Helloween was, on this first album, a raw thrashy speed metal act, somewhere between Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fierce and brutal but also optimistic and sometimes even humorous, this album features tight playing, melodic harmonized guitars, blistering tempos and shrieking falsetto vocals. The songs themselves are quite well-written as well, reaching beyond then-typical thrash cliches with tongue-in-cheek trash culture odes like \\"Reptile\\" and \\"Gorgor\\", life-affirming athems like \\"Ride the Sky\\" and \\"Heavy Metal (is the law)\\" and more ambitious, complex compositions like \\"Phantom of Death\\" and \\"How Many Tears\\". They may have gone onto bigger and better things, but this album still sounds different from anything in their catalog, and most anything else at the time. This album is what metal is truly about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first, but not the least","review":"This is nearly the first thing Heloween did. Personnally I don't like it as well as some other albums (the 3 ones after...). But this is a good album. For what i heard, it sounds more like metallica than like the following albums of Helloween..That is just my opinion, but I really prefer Michael Kiske voice. Of course, if you're searching some standard metal, this is nearer from what you search, but if you are closer to the speed or melodic metal, the folowing albums of Helloween... are a little bit greater...I think..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic masterpiece!!","review":"This album is sure to blow you away! Kai Hansens vocals are amazing, mixed with the pounding drum and bass and the beautifull guitars, this is defenetly one of Helloweens better albums, they were still more of a Speed/Thrash band at this stage but one listen to songs like \\"Ride the Sky\\" and \\"Reptile\\" and youll realise that this band was one of the best in that category. A must for any serious metal collector!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away if you are coming from the Keepers","review":"If you bought the Keepers 1 and 2 and going for this one, then stay away as this one is nothing like the masterpiece Keepers.

This album is only useful as evidence that music groups can indeed improve dramatically: Helloween simply wasn't ready yet. \\"Keeper Pt. I\\" was the next album, and boy was it fantastic! Listening to the two \\"Keeper\\" albums today, though, makes me feel kind of sad when I think about what ultimately happened to the group after their heyday.

Once Around is not one of them. Firstly, there are only 4 cues of his music on this cd, running less than 20 minutes. Much of this is made up of the big band sound that listeners of Horner's Cocoon:The Return might find familiar. However there are some restrained, melancholy tracks to be found particularly the final track \\"A passage of time\\". James Horner is a musical genius and in my opinion, is one of the finest composers of film music in the world. He is capable of much better than this and has proven it with Legends Of The Fall, Titanic, Apollo 13, Glory and many more. Check those scores out instead and buy Once Around only if you are a die hard Horner fan (like me!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school","review":"This is not an \\"how to\\" book but an insightful investigation into the medium of drawing.

The lamps I received are black with white plastic shades edged in gold.For the price, I wasn't expecting high quality, but they should, at the very least, match the given product description.So, unless you are looking for a black lamp with a gold edged white plastic \\"shade\\" (not a bronze & ivory lamp) this is NOT the product you want to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS LAMP!!!!!","review":"THIS IS THE WORST LAMP!!! It also states it's in a brass finish and the one I received was black. It was also so poorly put together that instead of opting to go through the return hassle for the $10.00, I decided to place this lamp where it really needed to be....in the trash!!!! This lamp is no deal and I would not feel safe having it anywhere in my home!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of jank, broke on arrival.","review":"It's piece of junk. Hard to get it out of the box and broke on arrival. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap quality","review":"Very flimsy plastic quality. I guess you get what you pay for, but I had never seen a lamp with this type of bendable, cheap plastic.

I was pleasantly surprised when I had it all set up and turned it on. It gives the appearance of a more expensive lamp. I just ordered a second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice light for the price","review":"I wasn't sure about this lamp but I really like it. Its easy to put together. Its great for the living room and dining room. If you just need a cute lamp that's not expensive, i would get this lamp"},{"rating":"2","title":"great lamp","review":"I love the lamp. Very nice looking and the price was great. It puts out a lot of light. I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"This is a cheap product in more than one way. Lights up a room just great and looks fine as long as you don't inspect it. If you're looking for a cheap lamp to get the job done and not look like complete crap, this is the product for you. Completely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working on the first day","review":"I brought this lamp with not much expectation as the price is not much. When I opened the box I was happy to see the heavy body of the Lamp. The Lamp also looks good, but when I tried to fit a bulb in the Lamp, the switch broke down and the Lamp is no more working. I wish the internals of the Lamp were as durable as the body appears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, ugly lamps.","review":"I ordered 2 of these lamps because there were 3 reviews that were all very positive. No one who has seen this lamp could honetly say that it doesn't look cheap. It's very short for a floor lamp. I can see down into the lamp when I stand up. They looked so bad that I threw them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ariante Torchiere Lamp.","review":"This is my second unit.

Looks nothing like the picture. Wasn't as tall as I though it to be. It is heavy, the lamp bowl was wider and more round, which does not show in the picture. Price was great, but other than that...I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for cheap","review":"This lamp is cheap and you'll know it when it refuses to stand up straight, preferring to wobble threateningly whenever you touch it. It works, though, and looks okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lamp for the price.","review":"You can't beat the price here. Though the quality of materials & workmanship is not top shelf, you definately get your money's worth with this lamp. It works well & looks good enough for what it is.

A very absurd and beautiful story about the relativity of perception: maybe the one that Hermann thought that was very similar to him, was completely different. Have you ever seen a man that somebody tells you that is very similar to another person, and then you see that it's completely different, or vice versa?Haven't you ever thought about killing your own personality in order to be someone else in another place? Haven't you ever truly loved somebody because of its nice characteristics, but truly hating its defects? Haven't you ever used somebody?A very despairing novel, with Nabokov's mastery to make you feel as the protagonist, mocking at common human interrogations and desires, but in the very human contradictory way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hermann's trouble.","review":"It is a short novel with one main conceit; Hermann cannot recognize himself. It is a good point, succinctly and stylishy put."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature and Entertainment!!!!!","review":"This book possesses something very rare: the ability to entertain as well as just about any Agathe Christie book along with a wildly rich variety of diction, intrigue, and (though the author denies it in his prologue) meaning. I have read it three times and each time I chuckle over some droll detail I missed on my last reading. Moreover, a great introduction to Nabokov: Ada and Pale Fire require much more cerebral work, and unlike Despair, don't lend themselves as easily to being happily re-read - something pretty much required if Nabokov can begin to be truly appreciated, as his stylings are difficult. A wild romp that will particularly be appreciated by worshippers of Dostoevsky and Pushkin, as critical extensions of some of their work are oddly offered (and strangely juxtaposed)as well. A solid, muscular masterpiece that makes much of Lolita look tame."},{"rating":"2","title":"great children's book with lovely illustrations","review":"\\"Henry's Wrong Turn\\" is a great children's book about a whale lost in NY harbor. It is based on a true story. The book's lovely illustrations show many of NY harbors famous views like the Statue of liberty and the Staten Island ferry - and includes a map. A good book for young children to learn about NY and maps. Reading it to the class was always a big hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please note this is not the amazing music used in the film!!","review":"This album is very misleading online and take into account that this is not the same music that the movie K2 offers. It has a brief intro with the same solos but it doesn't even hold a candle to the film. Instead of heart stopping guitar, it's filled with goofy keyboard music that niether flows nor keeps the listeners intrest. It's no wonder that this album wasn't used for the actual film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"The original soundtrack (if you listen to the movie with your eyes closed) well, some of the mtn ascent scene music was as mesmerizing as Pink Floyd's epic Dark Side of the Moon. Really deep. Really cool.This is like another band got slipped into the Jewel case...The similarity between the movie and this? Both had guitars. That's about it. Save your money.PS I like Hans other stuff, particularly Gladiator and Lion King among others, so this is not against him."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE MUSIC FOR THE SOUL","review":"If you have not experienced the magic of Hans Zimmer, than I erge you to buy K2. Even though it's not his best, It's still one of my favorite CD's. (Next to The Rock)!Hans Zimmer's music is simply beautiful. Yet at the same time, Powerful. His music can take you to wherever your mind will let you go. It can take you any where from a tiny stream to a gigantic waterfall!K2 is a soundtrack for those who like great music. I hope you will enjoy this CD as much as I did.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"As long as this CD is in print, rock and roll cannot die.","review":"Classic rock to the bone. Don't buy it for the hits -- buy it for the B-siders you might not have heard. It has all the benefits of Morrison's soul and blues influences. But, the main oomph comes from the classic garage-band rock feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAM, BAM, BAM!","review":"D*mn! This is a great record; it's like punk-soul or something.

It was exactly as described. I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Movie","review":"Dead Silence, while not as good as Saw, is a great horror film in it's own right. I really think that the movie will get more popular as time goes on and is definitely something that should develope a cult following. With all of the mediocre horror movies being released recently, I really do think that this does stand out among them. It won't win any Oscars but should appeal to most horror fans. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does have it's moments when you know that something is going to happen and want to cover your ears. Overall, it is an enjoyable movie that I have seen twice and will probably see again. I recommended this to a friend and she loved it, so maybe rent it first. It's a cult film, so I wouldn't say that everyone will like it. But, when you do like it, you love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"dead silence","review":"This movie was really good, kind of reminescent of S.

I wont go into what its about cause the movie is that bad. It was slow, the main character is forgettable,and the monster of the movie was uncreative.

Think twice when buying from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saw series rock-I don't quite know what this is--waste of theater air??","review":"Dead Silence is a creaky gothic horror by the writers who introduced us to the dubious pleasures of the Saw franchise. James Wan and Leigh Whannell use those potent props the ventriloquist's puppet and an old nursery rhyme to piece together a gruesome tale of supernatural revenge. (How stupid..) Unfortunately the cast are so supernaturally dim that it's impossible to care about any of them.This is admirably surreal stuff. And the sensual pleasure in watching this kind of horror movie depends entirely on your tolerance for ear-splitting jolts of shock. In the end, though, I wanted my money back.BILLY WAS THE BEST ACTOR--THAT SAYS A LOT SINCE HE IS A FREAKING DOLL.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"This movie was terrible. The special effects were the worst part. It wasn't salvageable, even with some really high quality actors. It wasn't mysterious or scary at all. It wasn't even cult classic comical. I did laugh, however, because it was so incredibly stupid I couldn't believe someone paid to make it. I'm sad I bought the DVD before seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dummy please","review":"I almost turned this off a few times due the lame actors and leaps in logic. But staying with it paid off a little. I still would have to say thumbs down. There are some good parts, the lady villain is way creepy and the doll itself is too. The death scenes are probably the most disappointing and how they arrive to these scenes only enforces the characters stupidity. The main good guy believes this dummy doll killed his wife (horrifically) so then why is the idiot driving the doll around town not in the trunk!! And propping the creeped out doll by his bed before sleeping? SORRY! First order of business is to send the that freaky doll down the river.The ending almost saves this movie but by then I hardly cared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw this at its Theatrical release and had forgotten that","review":"To be quite frank this is not a very good movie at all. Never have been a fan of haunted doll movies much less haunted puppet movies. The only decent one I have ever seen was the now quite old \\"Magic\\" featuring Anthony Hopkins...made sometime in the mid to late 1970's. Ann Margaret was also in that movie and it is old enough that she still looked pretty darned good!This movie is simply poorly done. Mr. Wahlburg does a pretty good job but the movie itself simply doesn't cut it for me.....didn't like it at all. Not suspenseful, not scary....just rather poor in just about every respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO TO ANOTHER MOVIE INSTEAD!","review":"DEAD SILENCE WAS A VERY SLOW AND BORING MOVIE WHICH WASTES THE TALENTS OF ALL INVOLVED!

They should have shown more of that old creepy looking lady when she was doing her little vaudeville act with her dummy. She was the scariest looking thing in this movie. Forget the dummy. Very boring story. We were laughing and clowning this movie while we sat in the near empty theater. I was more dissapointed from the aspect of I love horror movies and this was a waste of what cold have been pretty cool. When I can't appreciate the movie and when the movie turns its back on me I start the jokes and the comedy. Making fun of this crappy movie was the only thing that got us through this flick.All I know is Puppet Master would wear his little wooden a#% out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever to the bad reviews. This movie delivers!","review":"This movie, although many hard reviews, is a one of a kind. It has an original story line (a great one at that) and the movie creates a mysterious atmosphere throughout the whole piece. I love it that the writers from saw decided to step out and create a piece of their own. It was a pretty great movie. The movie isn't all blood and gore. But there's alot in it. The one thing I didn't like about this movie, was the ending. It made sence in a way, but not in a 100% clear way. I'd say rent this, since there are so many mixed feelings on it. Rent it before you buy it, but it's a really really good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty decent..","review":"I realize movies are very subjective....I liked this movie..not giving it 5 stars because there is room for improvement but I found the premise a bit spooky..and dolls always freaked me out as a child and so did dummies...(and clowns LOL).. I thought this was a good movie...(I also liked House of Wax..which I find similiar in the weirdness category..)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"This movie is irritating as soon as it begins. The tacky post-production looks like something a highschool student who just learned how to use filters would do to make their movie look \\"cool.\\" The stop-motion and excessive use of very unrealistic \\"old-movie\\" grain overlays in the introductory credits and in transition scenes throughout the movie draws attention to itself in a way that completely distracts from anything they're actually showing on screen, and makes the images themselves more abstract and much less scary. The fifteen-year-old who edited this REALLY needs to learn some restraint.Aside from that, the plot really isn't worth commenting on. It's filled with holes, and the ending defies the little logic that was there.A few of the scenes of the dummies, particularly the ones set in the past, are genuinely creepy. That's pretty much the extent to which this movie is any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really do worry about the future of horror films. I grow more disappointed with every new one I rent out and Dead Silence is the same.Although this looks like a chilling movie it falls flat in its delivery nonetheless. It does have its creepy moments, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat. Matter of fact this movie really did not hold my interest for long. It was a lazy and overall very safe horror film. 13 years olds will love it- but us older horror fans will find this yet another story that sounds promising yet in the end feel once again that we have wasted both our time and money. I do not recommend it.2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is DEAD. Zero star.","review":"This movie is DEAD. It contains no suspense or horror at all.The first 10 minutes stirred up my curiosity a little bit. After that, there's nothing worth seeing left.The special effects are worse than those of tv shows. Here are some examples: Walls crumbling, wooden floors broken and fell to ground, big doll rolling its eyes. Do you think they're scary? I don't!The detective acted as a child not as a trained professional.Pet Sematary, 28 days later, Slither, Cabin Fever, and the Grudge are still the only ones on my list of Best Horror movies of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEOW","review":"very good movie gives me the chills everytime i watch iti wish they would make another movie like this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I mean, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't special either in any way.

It kept me up for the most of the night when I first watched it. This film is not for fans of the late Edgar Bergen and Jeff Dunham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I found this movie to be a confusing mix between Darkness Falls and The Blair Witch Project, although nowhere near as entertaining. A creepy premise that has been done a million times and an ending that will leave you saying \\"What the?\\" and then going back to see if you missed something in the plot. The ending made no sense and seemed to be what the writers decided to do after they had written themselves into a corner. If you watch the alternative ending, then the theatrical ending made much more sense, so why the editors decided to cut it is beyond me.Skip this one. It was not scary and the characters were stupid. I will give this movie one star though, because the actress who played mary shaw was very creepy and her eyes still haunt my dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"it isn't good movie...","review":"I saw this movie on DVD and then this movie isn't good. This movie was horrible and disgusting. I really hate the couple of scenes. I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here today, forgotten tomorrow","review":"The premise of the movie is interesting, but that's about all. In the last several years, there have been so many horror films, and very few have been able to distinguish themselves. \\"Dead Silence\\" is no different. We have the photography that makes everything in a blue wash, the barely coherent plot (in this case, a grudge that begins because a boy can see a ventriloquist's lips moving. Yes, really.), the chorus of celestial voices, the fast motion action. It's as though the director went down a checklist of cliches. Yes, the movie looks good but it doesn't look original; it's just more of the same horror shtick we've been getting.Fault also lies with the plot: there is a big reveal at the end, as there almost always is, but it would have been much more interesting had it been developed. As it is, the reveal left me wanting more, to finally have the movie make sense, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.Nothing more than a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie !","review":"Boring, bad acting, not scary at all and stupid scenario.Don't even rent it, save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for?","review":"I gave this one star only because O is not a given choice. Thank you for pointing out that this DVD is only playable on an HD DVD. I would run right out a buy one if only you had included a synopsis of the movie.
