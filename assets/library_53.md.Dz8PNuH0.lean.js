If a studio is going to re-release a movie on DVD and charge over $...for it, there should be plenty of extras. How about the original music videos, or even interviews with cast/crew on the making of the film and the hype after its release?

They then go and offer some ridiculous solution on ways to do things like get girls, or \\"Be More Chill\\". Isn't that what parents are for?

He finds a pill called squip which allows him to do just that, with some circumstances.This book not only shows that Ned Vizzini can write, but that he can write good. The fun really begins when Jeremy gets his squip. With plot twists and turns and an excellent, yet fitting ending this novel proves that good literature can be made today. Pushing away cliche's and having fun at the same time, Be More Chill is not just a \\"ha ha\\" novel. It involves deep thought and although its funny it has deeper meaning.Ned Vizzini is an excellent up and coming writer, and I am looking forward to all of his books. Be More Chill has been officially optioned by Miramax, and the guys who made American Pie are signed up.

There's a remarkable consistency here, but I'd have to tag 'The Blue Side' as a stand-out track.The album also benefited from superb production (by James Newton Howard) and is an absorbing listen - it's warm, mellow and compelling, and has retained these qualities in the transition from vinyl to CD.I love this album, and play it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful, Classic Voice from the '70's . . .","review":"\\"Change in Luck.\\" For a young, relatively unknown studio background vocalist (in her early 20's) at the time, this was quite a breakthrough because of her 'different' range.

It's a love triangle involving a man/woman couple and another man who is captivated by the woman. That woman is Fernanda Garcia Castaneda. She is not your classic beauty but she has tremendous sex appeal and it shows well on screen.There is very little dialogue but you really don't need to understand their Spanish language because it's obvious what the actors are talking about. The English sub-titles came in handy with the music lyrics. You'll be hearing music throughout the film. I thought it was well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a \\"must read\\" for math students","review":"This inexpensive book covers material not easily found elsewhere but key in understanding complex functions.

I really like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these pans","review":"Not only do they appear splotchy after you use them once, but the skillet is horrible as everything sticks to it no matter how low the heat is. If you oil it or use butter you have to use so much that the food is ruined. My husband and I paid $400 for these pans and we wish that we paid $150 for a cheap set as they seem to work better. The lids are another issue as they are hard to store because of the handles. The pans look nice when you first buy them but after a couple of uses that too goes away. we have owned these pans for a year now and this weekend we are going out to buy another set of skillet pans to replace the Calphalon onessince we argue about these pans so much. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"These are truly the worst cookware I have ever used. It doesn't matter how low of heat used when cooking, everything sticks to the cooking surfaces. I think cooking an egg on my cement driveway would stick less than on these pans.

I feel embarrassed, since I purchased these pans as a family Christmas present...save your money and buy a cheaper set of cookware!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on Calphalon Contemporary Stainless","review":"I bought the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless cookware 13 pieces set three months ago and wanted to give my thoughts. First of all I am a beginner cook and have only done simple things with the pans.I did my homework; I read various web sites on stainless cookware and how to care for it. I read all of the instructions that came with the pans. I checked out Calphalons web page as well.I have had no issues with sticking, none. First I warm up the pan slowly, and then I put a light layer of heart friendly oil in the pan.Clean up is a breeze, the trick BAR KEEPERS FRIEND.The pans still look as good as new. Use plastic and wood utensils with the pans, no metal. Mine came with a set of utensils, which I use every time.One reviewer damaged the pans by hitting a ladle against the rim, I have been careful not to \\"BANG\\" the ladle against the rim.And yes, the lid handles do get hot.Nothing negative to say, buy these.

The thinking, along with the related book The Sacred Canopy, greatly challenged my religious beliefs, as the man-made quality all such beliefs and doctrines becomes apparent.

Story is this: I've had the printer ONLY A WEEK and have hardly printed anything at all. Now, I'm getting messages that the color ink is low and to buy a new cartridge soon.It also doesn't print a nice true black, kind of a greenish-black.

Nope.","review":"I just finished two westerns. This book and an audiobook by Elmore Leonard written in 1953. Leonard's book is a good listen but it is just pulp. The Searchers is a real good book. I can't say at this time if the Indian history is correct. I just don't know and haven't researched it. I think it is though. Learning something while I read is a big plus. The other facet of this book I really liked was Le May's skill in getting what was in Mart's head into mine.Forget that this takes place in the old west and just read it as a book. If your are a fan of great reads this will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast-paced, good read","review":"Be careful when you read some of these reviews. A couple of these reviewers are writing about the movie, and don't appear to have read the book. No matter. I saw the film first, and--except for the pretty awful theme song that comes in at the otherwise memorable ending--it's as good as it's cracked up to be. Probably John Wayne's best film, and maybe even John Ford's as well. The book, however, is considerably different from the film. Ford and his screenwriters made many different choices, and I think this helps the reader who's seen the film. The story and characters are different enough to keep fans of the film in suspense. And for those who haven't seen the film I recommend it as a good, suspenseful, gripping read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Searchers","review":"I'm not usually a western reader; however, this is a great read.

Both have the unique distinction of being known and recognized as truly outstanding in their mediums.Mr Lemay, in the Searchers tells a story that touches everyone at different levels. How far with Ethan (Amos) Edwards go to rescue his neice from Martin Pauley? Will his rascism and hate for the Comanche overpower his love of kin? What makes him so powerful a character that he has drawn in readers for over 55 years?I am pleased to re-read the Searchers one more time.

The book is bound with cloth and pasteboard end pieces which is okay, however, there was no dust cover. Even a used book would have had a dust cover.

That said, the book is much better. The characters are much more believable, especially Charlie MacCorry. The movie suffers from John Ford's lapse in judgement, forcing Ken Curtis to play Charlie as a clown. The ending of the book is also much more realistic from a human standpoint as Marty and Amos come to the end of their long quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting adventure from the first page through last.","review":"Providing even more excitement than the motion picture, Le May creates characters that provide insight into the culture and mindset of American settlers on the frontier. Those readers who look beyond the cowboys vs. indians action, which is first rate, will find more explanation of the motivations of the characters than the movie could provide. It does not suffer from the political correctness that compelled the screenwriters to change Amos Edwards' name to Ethan Edwards, but rather is a true reflection of the best and worst among America's frontier culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"I like this toy but I do get very tired of having to put it back together.

His imagination at age 3.11 is much better than mine, or maybe not as worn out. When he plays Bob the Builder and we pull out \\"the team\\" as he calls it, this workshop is a necessary back drop. I am sure Nicholas would say this toy is definately worth more than double of the price. If you child loves Bob the Builder and has other accessories, this is perfect for helping them \\"set the stag.\\" I add some Play-doh bricks, and some dried beans on a cookie sheet and he sits at the kitchen table and plays for about 30 to 45 minutes after the show is off, every morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun","review":"this toy is simple, but lots of fun.

If my computer doesn't accept my password, I hit the num lock key and try it again. If it isn't the num lock key, its a typing mistake because I can't feel the F and J keys. The track ball's movement is terrible. Its movement reminds me of the old days when a mechanical mouse ball got dirty. It eats batteries! I have to remove one of the batteries when I am not using it.

When it arrived I was very disappointed. The fabric was very stiff. I washed it on delicate, cold water & it got black splotches on it.Not only that, but it did not soften up with my Tide with Downy laundry detergent.

What a relief!I offered this book to him to read, too, and he had a similar reaction. What is very interesting and a testament to Blaine Smith's ability to clearly address the topic is that while my fiance and I are seniors and have been both widowed, the advice and information was as relevant to us as to the \\"first-timers\\".Gentle though it's approach, this book can bring a dose of realism to your choice to marry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"when i was given this cd, i didn't know who it was, or what the music was like but listening to it proved that it is a great album. lively and unusual, it is great to listen to whenever, especially when you need a pick-me-up. i love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, yet very enjoyable","review":"Although the author doesn't show much imagination when it comes to alien races, this remains a highly enjoyable adventure story. The indigenous life-forms of Genellan are basically direct analogues of Earth creatures. The sentient aliens are so recognizably human in their psychology that the only significant barrier to understanding between the species is the lack of a common language. Nevertheless, the depiction of stranded humans struggling to survive is compelling and, despite the abovementioned misgivings, I found myself moved at times by the struggle to find common cause among the various species."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable adventure tale","review":"The book starts with an exploration fleet looking for a new home. When they enter the star system they are planning to explore, hostile aliens attack them. The fleet escapes. But one corvette is badly damaged and leaves a small portion of its crew and a small detachment of marines stranded on a wilderness planet. This planet, Genellan, just happens to be the home to another species.The book is well written and is the story of the human's attempts to survive and make a home. And the interactions between the three species are told from their own perspective. Giving us good insight. The characters are likable and Gier's story flows. I did not want to put the book down. I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Don't Miss This Series***","review":"The book covers don't do justice to the content.

The series starts with a mystery and crash landing in the first book. It develops into lots of great characters, politics, seemingly genocidal ET's and successful first contacts and alliances against a common threat. Fans of David Weber, Heinlein, Sharon Lee & Steve Miller, John Ringo, Lois McMaster Bujold and Anne MacCafrey--to name a very few favorite authors-- will like these books. The themes are well thought out, the characters all deal with the choices, sacrifice, and agony of war in a realistic manner; and sometimes with a little humor and romance thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, with some interesting novel ideas.","review":"An excellent series, this the first of three books, I look forward to the fourth! Maybe not totally new in some of the plot - but how many books nowadays are? But, it contains enough new ideas, strong well written characters, and adventure to make it a good read.

I haven't had any leak issues, there are no marks on my face after an hour swim, and my vision range is excellent.

Bad decision. In 2011 I first ordered the full rise briefs and the pouch was too saggy. So then I ordered the mid rise briefs and the opening to the pouch was miniscule. The size was correct, but the utility of the briefs was abysmal. Good luck if you buy these.Jan 2013, an addendum: The full rise Munsingwear briefs are the best briefs I have discovered for wearing with long underwear. Their saggy fit actually works well with the additional layers that long underwear creates. This benefit is not enough for me to change my rating to 2 stars, but I would now give them 1 1/2, maybe more if you live in a climate where long underwear is necessary for long periods of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality?

Four had the elastic stretch out within minutes like I was wearing bloomers. A couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest.Apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality. Needless to say I won't be purchasing these again. I guess I'll have to go back to buying Fruit of the Loom. I don't throw as many of those out and they are much cheaper.

Then, several years later, it was made in Canada. I never had any trouble with this underwear; it was just fine.

The stitching on the waistband came loose on five, the stitching on the label came loose on one, on four the hem on the inside flap of the fly is wide and well stitched, but on the other 14 it is thin and cheaply stitched, and the leg openings on some are fine, but on others are too tight.

The author has a fantastic sense of humour, and if you only read the chapter on Noahs Ark, you're in for a real treat. Other chapters are a little more hardgoing, but its worth it. Barnes takes myths, stories, paintings and so on as his inspiration and builds on them, adding a really human element to things which are otherwise hard to imagine.It makes you think, but not in an overly challenging way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"An almost iconoclastic work, from how Barnes questions the very essence of human life and living to his deepest and truest thoughts of love and passion. Certainly this books forces one to think and consider and most importantly question all that we take for granted, from Gopher wood to artistic works. A sometimes, cynical approach, but definitely a hugely entertaining and though provoking read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth, perspective, and woodworms","review":"Julian Barnes yet again finds a compelling way to taunt my confidences in the \\"facts\\" I am so certain of. Whether a woodworm on Noah's Ark, a painting of a shipwreck, or a dreamer's dream, he left me thinking that an individual's perspective of an event doesn't shape the story of \\"hard\\" facts but rather that the facts themselves are shaped by the perspective of the individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, entertaining and thought-provoking","review":"A \\"History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters\\" by Julian Barnes is a collection of ten and a half short stories or essays that are loosely connected.

The authors include many favorites for ice cream, sherbets, and sorbets. The color photos are a plus.

Salmonella is a real concern, especially for the young, elderly, and immune impaired individuals. The authors do not mention this potential hazard. They should offer a cooked egg alternative for those who are concerned.I received this book and an ice cream maker as gifts.

On-line it looked like an interesting design. And of course, I thought it was reasonably priced.However, when I received the frame, it was scratched. Amazon let me replace it - no problem. Since it was scratched, I didn't try to insert photos.The next frame that arrived did not have all of the grooves cut out (the grooves used by little sliders on the back to keep each photo in place. The top groove for the top landscape slot was missing! Another was cut crookedly. Making both photo slots unusable. The glass was also jagged, so if you buy this - be careful. Another comment - each frame was packed with bits of cardboard - just torn bits of cardboard - and the internal sides of the frame \\"shed\\" bits of paint and wood, which added to the cheap feel.Overall, I'd say that this frame was cheaply made without regard to quality control. This was a waste of money and time. My advice is to avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Animation Book","review":"Love this book!

A lot of the most celebrated works were satanic in nature (seriously) or otherwise too prepusbescent homoerotic. I feel, as a serious artist, the intentions spewing forth from their work was a mental block and I could not read another word. Still trying to blot the horrible imagery from my memory.Thank god I have seen other flash animation because if all I had to go on with what the authors have done, I think I would need to see a therapist.I wouldn't let these guys teach me to tie my shoes, I wouldn't trust them for fear that they'd be at least be thinking about molesting me, mentally.Besides, flash aint easy either.

Dobbs was an eyewitness to many events described in the book, and he writes accurately and convincingly. The beginning of the end of the Soviet Empire is traced to the final years of Brezhnev's rule, with its stagnation, over the hill, senile politicians, and the tragic decision to invade Afghanistan.Because this is a very rich journalistic account, the reder should be prepared to deal with a myriad of Eastern European proper names that occur throughout the book. Still, this is a very sophisticated, historically-informed journalism, and if you want to know about the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but missed a few points","review":"A very readable book; made some excellent points. One thing Dobbs ignores completely, though, was the actual breaking down of the Berlin Wall by people wielding hammers and other instruments. The Wall had already been opened, yes, but the sight of people demolishing it, flashed around the world on TV, was of immense symbolic significance and it accordingly accelerated the downfall of Communism. Also, here's some food for thought: Andropov wasn't picked to lead the USSR as a \\"caretaker\\"; his death was untimely. Everyone had expected him to live for decades. Likewise, John Paul I died an untimely death after only two weeks as Pope. How might the history Dobbs describes have unfolded differently with Andropov in the Kremlin and an Italian Pope in the Vatican throughout the 1980's? Without John Paul II's protective influence, could Solidarity have survived to lead Poland into the 1990s? Maybe not...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting insights, but not a narrative history","review":"The author witnessed and interviewed witnesses to a fascinating period.

This is great bumpin' dance music. \\"What's on Your Mind\\" and other songs of there's have been heavily sampled by DJs - - The only thing that bugs me about this group is engineering... It sounds too... early '80s pop radio, even though the band itself is majorly hitting.

Maybe if I read the manual which they didn't give me I would find it easier.The software CD insists on reinstalling Windows media player 10 on my computer even though it is already there. I can draw two conclusions from that: Either the programers are not very good at their job, or the software is installing extra spyware on my system. Either way I'm not interested.

However, as a consequence of assuming a Higher Power, he no longer interferes with the affairs of mortals, letting them instead make decisions (mistakes) on their own.For instance, you, foolish reader, have made a mistake coming to this page. Repent, and go read of the good book, The Alphabet of Manliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond comprehension!","review":"I'm still spiraling into despair, but would be less so if someone would just buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easter treat","review":"Interesting how many reviewers know this as a Christmas treat.

Read the label - it has all the brain boosting stuff (dha, etc.) as well as nearly identical vitamins, minerals, iron, etc. If you don't want the Kirkland brand, Costco also sells other major brands for similar prices.If for some reason you really want to pay more to get the Nestle brand, note as well that this 6-pack is at almost no financial advantage to buying a single can - the only benefit is that you get all 6 at once.By the way, we're big fans of Amazon.com in general - just not on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"You can buy the same formula at Wal-mart for the same price without paying shipping charges.

The chemistry between the hero and heroine is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The action of the hero trying to find out who deceived him will leave the reader guessing. Lucian blames Aveline's father. Her father hates him for getting his daughter pregnant and be not doing the right thing, but he wasn't even aware of it.Get ready to go on a ride to find out who is friend and who is foe.

Then he supposedly falls in love with her but keeps a mistress(he's only sleeping with her for the sake of his country...he doesn't enjoy it...what a load of garbage)and avoids Eleanor so that he won't hurt her by going from his mistress's bed to hers. Personally, I routed for Eleanor to run away with Lord Middleton. I mean I felt absolutely no sympathy for Nicholas..in fact I grew to seriously dislike him. I'm sure that England could have found some other way to get the information Nicholas was looking for without his mistress. In the end Eleanor just forgave him and took him back because of course he did it for his country and didn't mean to hurt Eleanor.

Nicholas was almost as bad. But Eleanor takes the cake for the most distasteful, idiotic, and annoying character ever created. I am disappointed in this aimless and pithy story. Where on earth is Rothgar's story? I am dying of impatience- I don't want anymore of these reproductions of lame old stories when the last Malloren story is not out there to make all of us happy. Hopefully Jo Beverley will not disappoint me again with another superficial attempt at romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, a definite keeper!","review":"I loved An \\"Arranged Marriage\\". The characters were very likable. Nicholas was so sweet, responsible, caring and brave. He was worth \\"hanging in there\\" for.

I mean, keeping her chin up and maintaining her dignity when she knew there was another woman in her husband's life.Lionel was detestable and deserved to be exterminated.

The characters are well drawn and memorable;the story will hold your interest. Nicholas and Eleanor are two of my favorite characters--especially Nicholas!

Great job, Jo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just awful","review":"I'm sorry, I usually love Jo Beverley's books but this one was just plain awful. The hero was such a wimp and went along with other people making her decisions way to easily. Her husband is such a jerk! He has a mistress, not for pleasure but for his country. Ok fine, but then, the wife finds out and she just accepts it. Please, that doesn't work. Then! when everything settles and he tells her he loves her, she makes a comment about her daughters eyes looking like his and he has the nerve to say \\"or Kit's\\" - implying that the baby may be his brother's. Of course, we never really know but does it matter?? No!! I didn't by this book at all! I felt no love in this book, and this is supposed to be a romance. I gave it one star as opposed to none because I actually like the Christopher character.

Geeze, this is what makes me feel warm inside!

Out of all her books, the only set I can recommend is the Mallorens. I have read and re-read that series and I'm desperately waiting for Rothgar's story.In her re-released book, An Arranged Marriage, how can anyone like the supposed hero. Poor Nicholas, he must sleep with a woman, other than his wife, to save his country. Sorry, I don't feel anything for Nicholas but disgust and pitty for Eleanor. Not my definition of a good romance book. They can be notorious rakes before they meet, but once married - hands off the rest. This book is going back to the second hand book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance between the hero and the \\"other\\" woman","review":"If you want the angst, the frustration and like doormat heroines, this book is for you. The hero must spend most of the book cheating on the poor, little wifey (heroine) with another woman (his mistress) for the sake of his country.Despite the tasteless, vomit inducing adultery theme, she might have been able to pull this off if the book was more focused on the 2 main characters. Unfortunately, this book's main focus was the hero and the other woman. The heroine's part seemed like a side story, part of his reward for sleeping with his mistress through out the book. I never felt like I knew the heroine and the \\"saint\\" hero was a one big (jack-arse) martyr. He saves the heroine by marrying her, then sleeps with the mistress to save his country. Oh puh-lease.... *rolls eyes* When did they have the time to fall in love, and what was there to love? Their HEA was completely unbelievable.This book should be categorized as a \\"romance novel for men\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unvelievable even for a Regency","review":"I agree with the reader who says the plot is not very believable.

She has issues she seems to work through in her novels involving violence, and that's important. This book isn't as disturbing as _An Unwilling Bride_; for one thing, the hero is far more likeable. But if it wants to deal with homophobia, then it should do so directly to help us address the horrid rape that opens the novel...and, most egregiously, closes the novel as well. The hero and heroine casually chatting about her rape as he has his hand inside her gown? What kind of demons are you exorcising, Ms. Beverley?If you want to read Beverley's novels, leap to _Hazard_ or _My Lady Notorious_. I wish I could now read her novels without having this mess and, even worse, _An Unwilling Bride_ forever in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have EVER read","review":"Well, someone \\"kindly\\" included this book with another I had purchased off of Amazon as a \\"gift\\"....and I wish I had never ever read it.

The rape, the adultery, I would have jumped off the bridge myelf and taken my unborn child with me. Ugh! I could MAYBE have gotten over the adultery, I mean he WAS ordered to do it after all....but the rape?? Forget it. No way no how. I wish I had never read this book, it honestly makes me want to cry (and not in a good way!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent regency","review":"While 'An Arranged Marriage' is not my favorite of the Rogues series (that would be the fabulous 'An Unwilling Bride), it is still head and shoulders over most of the romance offerings now. Eleanor and Nicholas face an impossible situation and deal with it in a realistic and moving fashion. Beverley has mentioned that she was very influenced by Dunnett in this novel, and that is apparent. I think the similarities between Nicholas and Francis Crawford merely strenghten the book. Nicholas is a complex hero, one that challenges the reader because he is not always likeable. Eleanor, while not my favorite heroine, manages to grow in a realistic fashion that remains true to the time period that the book was set in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I want sensuality and lots of sex in romances, but prefer to read about it between the hero and the heroine, not the hero and his mistress. This book might as well be about them! I realize most men did have mistresses back then, but find it hard to believe that a wife who loved her husband that much would swallow it so easily. Still, I like this writer very much and look forward to future books from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most disgusting Romance Novel I've ever read","review":"Since when rape, adultery, emotional abuse has become romantic?The evil genius behind the plot gets everything and so is the adulterer husband whom had the audacity of calling bedding and panting after the owner of a whorehouse while completely abandoning his pregnant wife a public service to his country.

I havent seen the movie yet, but I can sense the longing and depression in the lives of the characters. I might be possibly biased though because I love Sigur Ros and the last two tracks are done by them. The fifth track \\"Over the Bend\\" is worth the price of the CD alone. The first 15 tracks are mostly violin and guitar with some other ambiant sound in the back. The sigur ros songs are equally amazing, the second of which is inspired by the melody that is played at funerals in iceland.

Criminals in Ireland had much to fear from the relentless journalist, and despite their increasingly violent attempts to silence her, she refused to back down from their intimidation. I couldn't help but wonder if a public hungry for sensational stories contributed to her unfortunate demise. The cold-blooded murder in broad daylight of Ms Guerin caused a national outrage. The public outcry to the brazen crime brought about much-need reform to Ireland's drug trafficking laws, providing some solace and a reminder that triumph is often borne of tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I have no connection to Ireland or Veronica Guerin, but I was curious to read this book when the movie was announced a few years ago.

While most of us would prefer a sudden, painless death, a plane falling on us, Dr. Byock shows how an anticipated death brings the chance for reconciliation and growth. Some of his accounts are inspiring, some a little harder to get behind, but in each case, if he does nothing else, he reminds us of the support available to those in the final stage of life, and to their families.Dr. Byock briefly touches upon questions of the difference between a civilized, supported passing and purposeful euthanasia. He is quite clear in this regard. Above all, he assures us that no one has to die in pain or fear the final transition, that modern medicine and Hospice practice affords each of us who choose it a passing full of kindness, support and caring ministration."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"an absolute must read for families facing the dead of a loved one. even more so for the one who is facing their mortality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful introduction to the hospice movement.","review":"As a hospice volunteer I found this book \\"Dying Well\\" by Ira Byock MD to be inspiring and a work I can refer others to"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Question & Answer section at the end is worth the price of the book","review":"I was overwhelmed with the task of helping my dear friend in the last 11 months of her life.

The two tracks not included in my copy are \\"Something to Live for\\" and \\"I don't stand a ghost of a chance\\". The packaging is rudimentary but at this price who can complain. The inclusion of the dialogue makes this a quirky and easily listenable addition to any Torme collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"$$$ for ONE transcription!","review":"I've bought a lot of music books. This is one of the worst I have ever bought. Not the worst, because Broon's Bane was actually transcribed accurately. ALL the other songs were incorrectly transcribed. We are not talking a few booboos here, we are talking completely wrong. The songs have notation for what the vocals perform, not what the guitar performs, which I guess could come in handy if the guitar was often used to replace the singer in Rush cover bands.Stangely enough, this is the same company that brought out actually acurate Rush transcriptions.Let me just re-iterate [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS!!!!","review":"If you're thinking that anything in this book is better than the stuff on the internet, let me save you some money!!!!

The VHS print is excellent, the film itself is only slightly dated, and the actors don't ham too much (Ernest Torrence and J Warren Kerrigan are stand-outs). The direction by James Cruze is solid. His use of close-ups is sparing, but effective. The storyline began to wander a bit after the wagon-train had crossed the Platte, but the final 10 minutes puts things to right again.Together with \\"Tol'able David\\" and \\"the Iron horse\\", this is the start of the modern western-movie and as such important viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome series","review":"I've followed Fringe since its first episode and absolutely love it. It's funny at times but more than anything it keeps my interest always. Can't say enough about how much I admire Anna Torv. With her duel role of playing two different Olivia's she makes them both fun to watch. Walter is odd to say the least but he's funny also. All of the cast has been very good and my wife and I look forward to each new episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't watched fringe, you're in for a treat","review":"loved this episode - love all the episodes...love Fringe...Fringe rocks the scifi tv universe.

For some reason, I didn't discover it till Season 3, so I made myself watch from the beginning till I caught up. Very intelligent, sophisticated, take the X Files and ramp it up! Season 4 started slow, dare I say...boring, but it gained speed about 1/2 way through. I understand Season 5 will be the final, that's too bad....Overall, HIGHLY recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"I just watched Season 1-3 and I can't wait for the fourth season to be released! Great show; very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"You don't have to like science fiction to be pulled into \\"Fringe\\".

Blueays look great. Simple packaging. Alot of cool extras. Waitto get under $30."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fringe of Seat","review":"Amazon had the best price deal on the Fourth Season of Fringe. I received my package quickly and in good condition. The Fourth Season will not disappoint. The series keeps you guessing and wanting to watch the next episode immediately. The characters are being shown with more depth and twists in each story line. I recommend this dvd set to any Sci-Fi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"Though I enjoyed season three, I was almost relieved when I got into season four. I felt like took an almost imossible story line and made it, not only work, but enhance the overall story arc. I have enjoyed this show and I am thrilled that they will continue, and the future looks exciting. There were some hang-ups in this season, but they fade into the fantastic shroud wrapped around the Fringe storyline. If you haven't seen Fringe, get season one and watch them all...You won't be dissappointed. If you weren't happy with season three, don't worry, four is a better continuation of a great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"great set!","review":"I enjoy the Blu-ray version of the Fringe.

This show in my opinion continues to get better and better. I was unsure how they were going to end Season 4 and have it tie in nicely to the final season, but I was very happy with the result.

It is a Great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued greatness","review":"I don't usually write reviews for TV shows, but I started watching Fringe a few months ago and have been working my way through the seasons ever since. Amazon Prime has been an excellent viewing medium for the most part. I have encountered a few problems, but they were mainly problems with my apartment complex's Internet access point, not a problem on Amazon's end.In short, I highly recommend Fringe, but I suggest starting at the beginning. The whole experience now in the Fourth season is much richer because I understand how things \\"should\\" be, not how they \\"are\\" after season 3's big finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Very Cool! Can't wait to see Season 5. I will miss it when it is over. Walter is one of the great characters in TV history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I am enjoying this show so much.

I love the show, I love the characters, and I love the first two seasons on Blu-Ray. The third season was a little bit lacking. The fourth season is an utter disappointment.No behind-the-scenes featurettes from the production, only some people talking about the world mythos. No deleted scenes or expanded scenes, just a short gag reel. And no audio commentaries?! Come on! Fringe fans are among the most dedicated and most loyal to be found, and it's disappointing that WB couldn't be bothered to let the cast and crew record some tracks for them.An absolute disappointment. No reason to purchase this set when the episodes can be downloaded or streamed in HD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fringe is great but UltraViolet stinks","review":"I purchased this thinking that the Digital Copy would allow me to access via iTunes and allow me to catch up on the road. Ultraviolet is horrible and Flixster is worse. Half the time it downloads an unusable copy and the rest of the time it just doesn't recognize the titles in my library. I contacted customer service and was essentially told \\"too bad, so sad\\". They're trying to address the shortcomings. UV and Flixster create unnecessary obstacles to my enjoyment of what I thought that I had purchased. I already have an iTunes account that works great. Why make me sign up with two additional services that don't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu with a Fringe Case","review":"One of the things Fringe does really well is revisiting a case they worked but adding a new twist. In this episode, the plane crash caused by the man who was infected with a virus that turned him into a porcupine monster is now something completely different. Olivia is told to stay on the sidelines because her memories have been totally erased by the previous timeline, leaving Lincoln to take the lead on the case with Peter in tow. Naturally Olivia ignores her orders and her help keeps the Fringe and FBI teams from getting hurt or killed. The ending of the episode was a surprise twist that feeds into the arc of the finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun For the Lunatic Fringe","review":"Received promptly as expected and am quite pleased. Like all previous Fringe Blu-Rays, the picture and sound quality is excellent. This (as well as all the previous seasons) is a must for Fringe fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat","review":"I found this episode not very exciting, compared to all others up to this point. I am a big fan of the series, but this particular one was really flat.I think that when the show starting weaving between the two universes, it got pretty complex. But when they pulled characters out (Peter) and injected new ones (Lee), plus the characters had no memory of each other, it got too difficult to follow. This mess started toward the end of season 3 and continues in the first episodes of season 4. Hopefully it will get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This season has been disappointing, with weak writing and oddly timed breaks in the season...but, that aside, this episode was just irritating. The observers were always an interesting feature-but they were not the main antagonist as set up throughout the past seasons. Mr Jones had usurped that role, but suddenly a story line developed has been sidelined for some ridiculous story about the bullying, omniscient, corrupt Observers who've taken over the world. Why do they even bother with a plot at all when there seems to be no respect whatsoever for the concept of story anymore? How sad. I actually bought every season and now I feel like a very promising serial with great characters who had good chemistry has been watered down into a scifi channel piece of drivel...And I own it. Wow. Weak. Who pays the people who signed off on this? And why? Horrible. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season four leaves a lot to be desired- useful for a complete Fringe experience","review":"Amazing show! Gripping and keeps you interested throughout each episode. Season two and three are very good. It's a bit unclear about the purpose of the story lines in Season four but if you like the show it is good to watch it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loves it.","review":"Liked this product because our grandson had it on his list.

This show has been on a downward trajectory and has finally hit rock bottom. The plot holes keep widening, the acting is getting staler, and it's as if the writers are shlepping out story lines the day before shooting.

Looks very impressive until I tried to play it on my laptop. As it started, a box came up asking if I wanted to check for updates. Updates to what? From who?

Have had the set for a few days now & am still trying to watch the first episode. Will try later on my home Blu-ray player, but if it doesn't work there it's going back.

THAT IS ANOTHER SHOW THAT HAS GONE DOWN HILL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time and Time Again","review":"This episode tore my heart in two. Stephen Root and Romy Rosemont (who are actually married in real life) give stellar performances as a man desperate to help his wife beat the onset of dementia and Alzheimers. Like most of us who have a parent suffering the same disease, we would give anything to help them retain their memories, youth and vigor. For Stephen Root, he believes the only thing he can give his wife is time to complete a formula to keep them living in the year before the onset of her illness. The price of this gift comes at a high cost, causing carnage and inexplicable time anomolies and loops in the immediate area surrounding the couples home. Once the final answer to the formula is found, a heartbreaking decision must be made. This is an excellent entry into the Fringe episode library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Imagine being born without any color in your skin so that you are transparent - invisible to the naked eye. Then imagine from the time you are born you are used as a lab rat by the Government, and given no chance of a normal life. This heartbreaking episode was about the need for human connection - a chance to interconnect with humankind and the painful loneliness that results when this does not occur. The ending is incredibly bittersweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Best show on TV right now. Thoughtful, intriguing, and exciting. If you haven't checked out fringe yet do yourself a favor, start back from season 1 and watch through all the episodes. The storyline takes numerous twists and turns. Great acting and writing help take this series to another level."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 seasons later and still hooked.","review":"I've been watching this series since the beginning. Yes, it has had some rough spots on occasion, but since season three and going into season four, have really enjoyed the series. Even at this point, not quite sure where the overall story arc is going, which is a good thing. I remain both engaged and look forward to future episodes. Now the tough call, as to which universe I find more engaging. At this point, I'm leaning toward Fauxlivia's. It's just a bit more edgy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great show!","review":"This show is so interesting and addicting! I recommend it to any sci-fi lover!

It sounded different from everything that I had been listening in the past. A fan of hardcore diy, Ariel Pink creates an unique sound based on lo-fi and classic pop. Another reviewer says that it sounds \\"as if a pillow was pressed against the stereo\\", but I think that is an essential part of Ariel's style. You see sudden bursts of beauty but you can't take it or control it. It is like if the music came, distorted, from a neighbor party to which you are not invited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"I got this record because a recent SPIN review gave it an A. This record is the kind of music you'd listen to while painting or writing poetry. This is not happy dance music, but it is so unique and different.

As if a pillow was pressed against the stereo out on wich the original recording was being played, and the whole thing was rerecorded using a cassete deck. Or something like that. Anyway, it puts me off tremendously. Cause underneath that pillow there are some very beautiful songs. Ariel Pink has an ear for great melodies and his singing style (wich frequently switches to falsetto)works well. Most songs don't follow the classic song structure, but rather circle around a central melodie. The best moments on The Doldrums are however those songs wich sound like four radio stations being switched back and forth. Too bad the radio is underneath a pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book around on the Subject","review":"I first read this book a few years after I got out of high school. When my own daughter was in high school I tracked down a copy so that she would get the truth about US history, not the lies disseminated in public schools' \\"PC\\" texts. She took it to school one day, showed it to her teacher, and he had the class do some silent reading while he sat in the back of the classroom reading Harvey Wasserman and the truth. This book is a superb account of the truth of America's past, with all the lies and evils of capitalism and the genocide and war and corruption necessary to make obscene amounts of money for the filthy rich. Emphasis on the word filthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This book contains more mis-statements, or just plain lies, than anything I have read in a long, long time. Poorly written, full of nonsense and boorish. Wasserman was definitely smoking something when he tried to write this! I am amazed this was ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the US!","review":"This guide is written for the UK market only & contains chapters on the UK M test, MOT, Road Tax and insurance, none of which have any relevance to a non-UK rider.

Actually, not a bad effort - as I thoroughly enjoyed songs this CD pressing has to offer like \\"Child\\", the well-written \\"Unspoken Love\\", \\"Thank You For Your Kindness\\", the smooth sounding \\"Suzanne Marie\\" and \\"Forty Second River\\".

Musically it is quite simple and the production isn't sweet and fat like some of the a fore mentioned groups however the synth sounds are appealing and the lyrics are interesting. I especially like the Spanish songs Oye and Quien Lo Sabia? though their signature sound comes undoubtedly from tracks like Situations and Southern Lands.

She is in opera mode and there is a harshness to her voice not found elsewhere. Worst of all is the echo-hall acoustic. The SACD version seems to have made it worse. Really annoying for me.

They also couldn't offer free shipping for the new order although the mistake was on their end.Guess what, I got the SAME product again.I have been a faithful customer for years and I am very disappointed with the seller - Think fast toys or Kites Tails & Toys, Inc. and with Amazon as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bib!","review":"It has little sleeves but my son doesn't mind that at all.

I was psyched when I saw this bib . . . maybe I could keep this one on her? It works! Those arms go in and the velcro is fastened and its darn hard for her to get it off. I told her it was her \\"special\\" bib and how special she was to wear it! She tried very hard at first and now actually kind of likes it. I think she could probably get it off if she wanted to, but she doesn't even try anymore. Plus it wipes up very easily, it covers her entirely, and its a cute print. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"saves on laundry!","review":"I bought two of these bibs for my twin sons and I love the coverage they offer.

We definitely need the sleeve area of protected from food stains for our little one but it's just too much of a hassle putting the arms in. Besides that, this is the best bib i've used, and I've bought a lot of different bibs. Save your money, buy this one from the beginning. I bought cheap ones which would be hard to clean, would get stinky, the plastic would tear and scratch the baby and his clothes would still get dirty. Also, because this bib is not made of harder plastic, i can quickly slip it on my little guy before he has a chance to protest. And the patterns are so trendy! Just beware, these things are quite long. They come to my son's knees (he's 16 months old)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold, mold, mold","review":"I'm giving Bumkin bibs one star because their \\"proprietary\\" material just isn't what it should be. I have used seven of these bibs in rotation over the past year, and really wanted to like them. But all have eventually become embedded with black mold, despite nightly soaking in soapy water, scrubbing and hang drying, machine washing, and bleach soaks. My daughter eats at her grandmother's house wearing a Bumkin bib for four meals a week-- that Bumkin bib didn't mold, perhaps because it was used less frequently-- but because it was dried in front of a sunny window, all the plastic coating peeled off in tiny bits, getting plastic bits all over my daughter (and potentially into her food).Why can't they make a soft plastic bib with thicker plastic that is truly impermeable, period? Why have fabric edges and tags that retain water?For the price, these bibs should stay clean longer than a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE Bumpkins Bibs","review":"We own a few other bibs that are different bibs, but almost all of ours are the Bumpkin brand (we own at least 8-9 of them). When I saw this print, I just had to have it. It's gender neutral, but we purchased it for our sons. This is a very large bib, and although it says 1-3 years, my 4 year old likes to wear it sometimes when he is eating something super messy (he's picky like that)! It is very sturdy, but soft. It washes easily by hand or in the washing machine, and I usually hang them to dry, but you can throw them in the dryer sometimes and they come out fine (just watch the velcro attaching to other items). I love that you can fold these up very tiny and throw them in the diaper bag without taking up too much room. Seriously, these are great for the price and will last you a very long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use at Daycare","review":"This was perfect for our son, especially for use at daycare where they paint, eat, do little crafts, etc. and often require full covering.

The pocket is especially helpful so that peas and carrots do not go on the floor or down into the highchair seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"These are very large bibs, which are good for my almost 3 year old who makes a total mess when he eats still. They seem to clean a lot easier than my previous bibs, and it is great that they can go in the washing machine. My only complaint is that the section for catching food is sewn in the middle so it is a little harder to clean, but overall I am very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"good coverage, wide","review":"Good bib but a little too wide for my son, who is 12 months/9 kilo, so it bunches at the neck and creates a bit of a gap. For a larger toddler with a better fit, this would be a great bib. I'll keep it until then. The arm holes help protect shoulders and keep the bib on kids who pull them off. I don't like how the pocket is stitched together in the middle because it can't be turned inside-out to clean. I bought some of the regular super bibs to use until he grows into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"This bib is a bit large for my 15 month old, but is going to be just perfect in a few more months.

It does have the ability to support small/light equipment such as the Symbio but out side of that, I simply wouldn't trust it to handle much weight.

His sense of humor shows up in some of his song titles--here, for instance, the funky, bend-alicious \\"Hamster Wheel (Slight Return).\\" A true master of the Telecaster, Campilongo can play fluid, melodic lines--and he can also devise twisting near-cacophonies: tones from some truly unusual heaven. Some of the music, such as the title song, here, sounds like it could be a soundtrack to a particularly funny David Lynch film.And for fans of Norah Jones: you really should buy this CD, if only to hear her backed by one of the great guitarists of our time.

I have checked the temp of brew and find mine consistent at 197 degrees - very good for a home brewer - impressive.* Coffee remains hot in the thermal (my wife and I do drink a fair bit of coffee - so, I haven't brewed a pot and 'waited' hours to see if it is still hot.

If the filter mechanism or the lid are not seated properly, you will end up with coffee spilling continously from the machine. You would think this is a relatively simple process, but as you can see from the negative reviews - it is not. Our first coffee maker burned out because we got smart and seated it in a tray with a lip - so that if it leaked it wouldn't end up all over the cabinet. Too many of these incidents caused the machine to not turn on. We used a cheapie Mr. Coffee in the interim, but missed the carafe, and so decided to try it again when we found one on sale. As I write this, I'm shopping for a new and different brand. The carafe has been nice, but lately the coffee maker has been spilling over more than normal. Very very frustrating for such an expensive machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Met my expectations. A few people complained about the lid which if not properly seated can cause an overflow. It is very easy to attach properly, a child could do it.

As usual, Amazon is the place to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too soon to know for sure","review":"We have only had this a month but to date it is working very well.

The top on the carafe seems to work smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 cup coffee maker","review":"It is supposed to be a 12 cup coffee maker but after spilling several cups of coffee all over the counter and floor, I realized that the special patented lid prevents the carafe from filling all the way. So don't fill the coffee maker to the 12 cup mark, keep the max at 10 cups and you'll be ok. It does a good job making those 10 cups of coffee though. The spilled coffee did a great job leaving stains on the wall from spilling over the sides of the counter. I've never had a coffee maker overfill by bad design; of course, we only bought Mr. Coffee brand makers before. Cuisenart needs to wake up and fix this issue before someone sues them for property damage. Just make it a 10 cup coffee maker and everything else is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful to wake with","review":"This is a wonderful coffee maker. The coffee stays hot for hours. The programable features are easy and I love to wake up with the fresh smell of coffee in the house. Why did I wait so long? We use a recycleble filter which fits nicely as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was replacing my Krupps wanting to get a larger carafe size and thought this one looked good. I brewed several pots of coffee wondering if it was just me. The coffee tasted dreadful. I gave some to my husband and he thought I was joking. We returned the coffee maker and bought another Krups. Back to wonderful tasting coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recieved a different coffemaker","review":"While I ordered the stainless steel coffemaker, I recieved another model with a glass carafe and returned it.

I really wish I could send this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant clogging and overflowing! A real disaster.","review":"We were very excited when we first purchased this item, and it took quite a long time to get as it was back ordered. There is not much competition for this sized coffeemaker with the thermal carafe. The coffee is good tasting and it stays hot, but the trouble with the clogging and overflowing makes it extremely time-consuming and nervous-making! We have two of these pots and they are both lemons. We tediously clean each part, daily, in order to minimize the overflowing--but it still does flood. I would like to return these, and get my money back if I could! If you value your time and money, I would not buy this product! Cuisinart customer service is also very difficult to reach, and not very helpful or responsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"metal carafe leaks water all over while brewing","review":"I didn't listen to the other reviews after I read them and went ahead and purchased this coffee pot as I have had couple Cuisinartcoffee makers with glass carafes. The reviews were all correct when they said the coffee pot leaks water all over. I tried itseveral different times and followed directions exactly and halfway through brew water started running off top of carafe & all over counter. What good is having a programmable pot if you have to stand and watch it all through the brew process, so you can stop it.Cuisinart really needs to sit up and listen and change this carafe lid as they will miss so many sales and have more & more returns. Ithink it is forming a vacuum halfway through the brewing process. Shouldn't be that difficult to get resolved. I had to buy different brand to get the stainless carafe, so they missed another sale or actually another one returned to them. Wake up Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"found the clock did not work, but the replacement does","review":"I received this product, and found that I could not set the clock, I have sent it back, and the replacement is working very well. I'm very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT.","review":"Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Programmable Automatic Brew-and-Serve 12-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker, BlackBesides heeding all the other 1 star reviews, you need to be aware that there is a very limited warranty on this product -- three short months. Do you really want to spend the same amount of money to get another one or go through the hassle of researching again?When ours quit working, we tried unplugging for an hour and then restarting, as suggested by Cuisinart. The red light would come on briefly, go off, and you'd hear a little beep. That's it, folks. Cusinart won't listen to you if it's one day past the three months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big caraffe and keeps warm","review":"This is our third one of these. The writing wears off really quickly, but we have it memorized. If you over fill the grounds, it will leak all over and make a giant mess. Otherwise, this works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"15% failure rate means I'd give this zero stars if I could","review":"I bought my first one of these ten years ago, and it was great - worked liked a charm every time without fail. When it finally died this year, we replaced it with another one. This one overflows once or twice every two weeks and makes a HUGE mess. I started brewing with he entire apparatus in the sink, but still after every failure, I have to rinse coffee grounds out of every tiny hole in every tiny part. I've tried gold filters, paper filters, using less coffee, using less water, aligning it this way, aligning it that way... I don't know what it is about this new one, but it is just bad/wrong/unusable, and I am here on Amazon today looking for something similar that will work reliably. It makes me sad, because I really loved the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad taste","review":"From the first cup the coffee had a strange taste. I described it as a strong plastic taste while my wife and a neighbor both described it is a strong metalic taste. We cleaned the coffee maker twice as recommended by the manufacturer but it did not change the taste of the coffee. We use Starbucks fresh ground coffee and had no problem with the taste with our previous coffee maker. We were able to return the coffeemaker for a full refund and purchased a Capresso MT600 which we are extremely satisfied with ... It makes great tasting coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It","review":"I had a read a number of cautions in this space about coffee overflowing, so when I tried the coffee maker this morning for the first time, I read the instructions and took special care to ensure I didn't add too much water and that I sealed everything properly. Nevertheless, I ended up with coffee and grinds all over the counter. I cleaned everything up and tried again. But for a second time, I ended up with coffee and grinds all over the counter (but not as much since I was quick to hit the off button). Suffice it to say, I'm returning the coffee maker ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like guessing?","review":"I was looking for a new coffeemaker after the Cuisinart with a glass carafe had its warming unit boiling my coffee in the carafe. That frightened me as it could have started a fire. I read all the reviews and decided a coffeemaker that didn't use a warming unit would be better. Plus, the stainless carafe looked so good.I have used this for two months and am going to get a different brand that doesn't use a carafe at all. The reason being is the stainless steel carafe doesn't have any cup measurements on it so you have to guess how much water you are filling it with nor does it indicate how much coffee is left in it. It, like many of the previously stated comments, also is difficult to get the cap on correctly so the pour opening is where it should be. I think it pours too slowly besides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee maker I have ever owned.","review":"I have had this coffee maker for 2 years now and absolutely love it. It works great and keeps the coffee hot for hours. I have owned several other brands with a thermal carafe and they always ended up overflowing and didn't keep the coffee very hot. In two years of daily use. I have not had one overflow with this unit. I always use premium filters, keep the coffeemaker clean, and run a vinegar solution through it every couple of months. I would buy another one without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the negatives","review":"This coffeemaker does do a lovely job of keeping the beverage warm (not as hot as I'd like, but still acceptable). But it's not worth the money, not when the coffee pours down the sides of the carafe and all over your counter and floor. I do my darndest to make sure the carafe is placed just so and the basket is in tight, but there seems to be no guarantee that the coffee will go into the pot and not onto the floor. Cuisinart, you can do better than this. And coffee lover, so can you. (I've been a loyal Amazon customer for 20 years, and this is the first review I ever posted. So when I tell you this thing is annoying, please believe it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee ever.","review":"If you are a coffee lover then you must use a thermal carafe for your coffee. I searched long and hard for a 12 cup carafe and only found it here on Amazon. This carafe keeps coffee hot, signals you when the brewing is complete, and is easy to care for. I highly recommend this coffeemaker and it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"We threw out the machine this morning.","review":"Hello fellow coffee drinkers - This is the second time we are editing our original review for the Cuisinart coffee maker, because we threw out the damned machine this morning. Despite carefully prepping the machine, it overflowed TWICE this morning. It now sits in the garbage where it belongs. Too bad... it made good coffee when it felt like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems after 60 days","review":"I purchased a DCT-975BNK and 60 days later started having problems. The coffee maker would turn on without being programmed and you can smell and hear the heater core cooking away on its own. Also problems brewing, would only brew one cup at a time, beep 5 times and turn off, and you have to keep pushing ON to get a full pot. I called Cuisinart customer service their solution was \\"unplug it for an hour and if it turns on again call back\\". If it still turns on, I have to pay $10 processing and the return shipping. Said it was unplugged all night after it turned on by its self the first time. Weary about the response from customer service as I believe having a heater core run on its own could potentially be a hazard, not to mention not thrilled having to pay the return shipping. Not too comfortable with a \\"let's see how it goes approach\\" on a home appliance with a heating element malfunctioning, and makes me question their level of commitment to their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart vs. Zojirushi","review":"As I received both this unit and theZojirushi EC-BD15BAFresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Makerfor Christmas gifts, I have what is probably the rare opportunity to compare them side-by-side. Cut to the chase: The Cuisinart is by far the better coffee maker.Both make a fine cup of coffee. But if you're looking at this unit, you probably are interested in getting away from the hot plate and keeping your coffee hot in the thermal carafe. This is where the Zojirushi really falls down. The carafe is very light weight and doesn't appear to be more than a single wall. It really feels very cheap and does not keep coffee hot for very long at all.The Cuisinart keeps coffee hot for four hours, no problem, and warm for another 2-3. The carafe is obviously heavier weight and much more substantial than the Zojirusi.So my advice is to skip the Zojirusi and get the Cuisinart. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I had this model for several years and loved it. It finally gave out and I bought another one. This one lasted about six months and stopped working. I figured I just got a lemon and replaced it with the 10 cup model. It overflows about every 4th or 5th pot. I'm really getting tired of getting up to coffee all over the counters and floor. Maybe I just have bad luck with Cuisinart but two out of three is enough to keep me from ever buying their products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite pleased with my purchase","review":"I researched coffee pots when my last one died. I had owned a standard carafe Cuisinart and I had owned a Bunn. Reviews continued to point me back to Cuisinart for flavor of coffee. And I have to agree; our coffee tasted better from the Cuisinart, and I wanted the thermal carafe so the coffee would stay fresher; longer. And so far, it's been great. There are no hitches or glitches in the operation..pretty straight forward and always gives us great tasting coffee! I would recommend this to anyone looking for thermal type coffee makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product at a great price!","review":"My wife and I spent a lot of time looking for a RELIABLE coffeemaker that would make 12 cups, stay hot and work well. We also didn't want to spend a fortune. This new model Cuisinart has more than met our expectations. We choose the black model, but white is an option. The pot is BIG, easy to clean, stainless steel and keeps coffee HOT. The lid doesn't have to be turned to pour, and it pours into the cup without any drips. The water fill area is nice and wide. It uses #4 cone filters, not one of those stupid metal filters that never work right. My only complaint is that when you set it for autobrew there is no indicator light, just a little LED display (very small). It also has a fairly loud beeper that sounds when brewing is done. If you are using the autobrew feature it will serve as an alarm clock! Other than that, we love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$99.00 piece of junk","review":"We purchase this coffeemaker a few months ago because of the 12 cup thermal pot. The lid is hard to screw on straight and usually takes several attempts (I'm a mechanic and work with nuts and bolts all day). After the first few days it overflowed coffee and grounds all over the counter and floor. It will work fine for a few days and then overflow again. We have tried all different types of filters. Even the Melitta perforated filters do not stop this problem. I thought it may be the brew stop mechanism so I removed it and still have the same problem. When it overflows coffee grounds go everywhere and it is hard to take the basket carrier off the machine to clean. The water level indicator is hard to read and the machine must be turned sideways on the counter to see it at all. This coffee maker is not worth the money or aggravation. After we contact the manufacturer it will be going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to a coffee pot that I could take outside with me, and have fresh hot coffee all morning without going back for refills. Unfortunately, this coffee pot pours coffee all over the counter, it overflows, and generally makes a big mess that I have to clean up. Since I had already thrown the box away, I wasn't sure if I could return it, so I have been using my old coffee pot to brew, then pour it into the caraf. Does anyone know of a cure for this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I owned the previous model and it lasted for 3 years. The coffee is perfect every time. The only thing that I don't like is that the auto function stays on. (I don't have to set it every day)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read the reviews before purchasing and discounted the warnings about overflow. But sure enough I have already come into the kitchen 2 mornings to find coffee everywhere. It is not just getting the top on right, it is also making sure the pot is not tilting in the slightest and no coffee grounds go into the drip valve causing it to stick (not open all the way).Also, it just seems to be made cheep. It doesn't even have a light to show when auto brew is on - just a microscopic icon on LCD. We had another Cuisinart for 11 years used it to brew literally thousands of pots of coffee and I should have just purchased another one of those. Come to think of it, I think that is what I will do.Sure the carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"On the 3rd day, this machine kept shutting off before it finished brewing. On the 4th day, it wouldn't brew at all. I would give this 0 stars if there was the option."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly designed","review":"Very fussy lid....you struggle to get the \\"thread\\" correct. Then, when you pour, coffee dribbles from the top of the lid (where the doo-dad thru which the coffee enters the carafe as it is brewed is) while it gushes messily from the spout. And that's becuase the caraffe isn't designed properly...you have to tilt it up at such an extreme angle in order to get the coffee out of it that the coffee then gushes out of the spout (while it dribbles from the top contraption). It's really a mess of a coffee maker. I even gave up coffee for a few months because I found it so miserable.I should have just returned it but I kept thinking it was me. Now that family and friends have all used it and feel the same way, I realize it is a mess of a machine. I'll never buy another Cuisinart after this experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt bitter coffee.","review":"This coffee maker gives me nice hot coffee that tastes bad. I buy Kona coffee blends and my friends $20 Mr. Coffee makes a perfect brew, compared to my $100 coffee maker. I called Cuisinart because I thought... there is no way I am the only one...... all the rep asked was \\"is anything broken?\\" I would have liked the rep to act like they cared; by trouble shooting, or something. If there is another great Cuisinart product-- I am not buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"third home run","review":"This is the third of these exact coffee makers I've had. I guess I wear them out and then search for another. This time, I found it on Amazon when local stores were out of this model. I have had no problems with any of these thermal carafe coffee makers and would recommend it to anyone who loves good coffee that doesn't have to be reheated as the carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours. Another plus:turns off automatically when coffee is done. No worries! Just sip and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee","review":"The only reasons for four stars is the top to the coffee maker - does not pour well without lining it up precisely with the 'pour' mark that disappears after first couple of uses (its is a tiny black line on a black lid and you cannot find it).

The drip component does not work half of the time so coffee leaks all over the counter and coffee remains in the filter and does not drip through. I spent a lot of time researching what coffee maker to get, read all of the reviews on Amazon, went to consumer reports and I am very sorry that I purchased this one! I had an Krupps Aromatic and loved it and wish that I could find something as good to replace it. This was not it!Update on the leaking - it turns out that there is a rubber stopper on the inside of the filter cup that was in upside down. Once I fixed this, the spring action that controls the drip started to work. I have found that the key is to clean this stopper out after every use and to use a coarse grain coffee. Still not loving this machine but it is not leaking all over the place now and it does keep the coffee warm for a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work properly","review":"Will not turn on and brew.

However, this one makes coffee every bit as good (I just needed a 12 cup thermal). So why only 4 stars? Two reasons:1) It needs a removable water reservoir to avoid spills and easily fill it at the sink, not the counter.2) The whole brew/pour system should be as simple as the Barrista's. My biggest gripe is that the removable container for the filter/coffee can't stand up by itself for ease of filling it...you need 1 hand to hold it upright and the other to scoop the coffee...a not so easy task to avoid spilling the grounds.This unit is complex in a way, but after you get aquainted with prepping it, your reward is a great cup of freshly brewed coffee in the thermos carafe anytime. I would highly recommend it to technically savvy friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea (coffee!)","review":"About a week or two after receiving this coffee pot it stopped working. Amazon promptly replaced it - thank you Amazon!! I do not care for this overall. To me it is not user friendly. I know it just a coffee pot. But where I have it placed on my counter I need to pull it out and turn it sideways to fill it with water. Also it states you can interrupt the brew cycle to pour a cup of coffee. You can't with the one I have. He keeps dripping. Also it has a lid that allows you to pour without twisting the lid. It pours to slow for my liking. My next coffee pot will not be a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG LET DOWN","review":"We've had good experiences with Cuisinart 12 cup thermal coffee makers. The one before this, easily lasted more than 10 years. But this one, a little over a month. Suddenly it just wouldn't empty the water from the reserve into the basket.Also, count me among those who are unsatisfied with the new steel lined caraffes. The glass ones kept the coffee warmer,longer. It is possible to get semi-warm coffee; if you first run very hot water through the caraffe before brewing.Right now we're at a loss as to what to try next that will make hot coffee for a crowd. Any ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spills coffee half the time....Some of these are defective some are not.","review":"LEAKING/SPILLING:I purchased one of these several years ago, had no problems with it but it stopped working. I bought another one from Amazon, despite many reviews the complained that it overflows and spills coffee everywhere. Since i had no problems with the first one, I assumed others were setting it up wrong. I was incorrect, the new one leaked (coffee and grounds) all over the counter about 1/2 the time. I tried switching back to paper vs metal filter, no success. I tried switching the hopper (from the old unit) which has the shutoff value, that did not work either. Next I tried switching in the old coffee pot lid, which fixed the problem. I cannot see any difference between the two but one works and one causes the coffee to spill everywhere half the time.Dont buy this unless you already have one that does not leak.If you have one and are trying to fix it: THE PROBLEM IS THE POT NOT THE VALUE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hassle-free hot fresh coffee","review":"I almost didn't buy this product based on past reviews - frequent complaints about coffee leaks. I am not sure how this could happen unless you don't follow the instructions when placing the lid on the pot. I have used for two weeks without incident and continue to be pleased by the hotness and freshness of the coffee three hours after it was brewed (and I am obsessed about freshly brewed coffee). I love the automatic programming feature and the fact that there is no heating pad, so I never have to worry about forgetting to turn it off. The lid is clearly marked so you can be sure you have placed it on properly for brewing your next pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE the coffeemaker!","review":"This is one of the BEST coffeemakers I have ever owned! It's stylish and it keeps the coffee hot for hours. Some days I have had coffee 12 or more hours after it has brewed and it's still warm! If I had one complaint, it would be that the coffee pot, itself, is difficult to clean. I've tried putting it in the dishwasher, but it still doesn't get the inside bottom of the pot clean. I bought a baby bottle brush and it does work very well to clean all the way to the bottom of the pot, but, the inside bottom is still coffee-stained. I've tried every expert-recommended cleaning solution, but the stains haven't come clean. Other than this issue, I think it's a GREAT coffee maker. It would have been better is the display was backlit, but it's really not that big of an issue for me. The brewing cycle is very fast and the coffee tastes great, even hours later. I would definitely buy this coffee maker again and would recommend it to others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the 1st yr, ok for the next 6 mo and then gone","review":"Liked the styling and the thermal carafe. Button labels are just painted on and wear off rather quickly for the buttons you use most. This maker made coffee fine for the 1st 9 to 12 mo's. It started having intermittent failures over the past 6 mo's or so. Sometimes it just would not operate. I have no idea why. Today it seems it has died. It came on but wouldn't heat the water to start the brewing process.This is a fine product if you're ok with disposable $100 appliances, but in general I wouldn't recommend this. Appliances should last more than 18 mo's. The quality just isn't here with this maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective design","review":"This was our third try with this programmable coffee maker. Cuisinart DTC-975BKN. We like the coffee , the thermos and the 12 cup size. However it has now failed 3 times. An essential part of the brewing cycle \\"burns out\\" so rather than brewing when turned on it simple shows the red brewing light for about a minute and then turns off with no coffee brewed . This failure mode is known to the manufacturer and you can read about in user blogs. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL A FIX IS ANNOUNCED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived Quickly & Works Like My Others","review":"I've had many of these over the years and even though they only last 18-24 months, they make coffee at a higher temperature than cheaper brands so it tastes better.

Coffee stays hot well into the afternoon when brewed around 6:00 AM. The unit itself is a little tall and must be pulled out from under the wall cabinet to pour in the water. Coffee tastes fine, though I haven't made anything other than Folgers yet. It's also nice that the caraffe holds 12 cups. There's finally enough coffee for my wife and I in the morning. The pour spout spatters a little if you're not careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker","review":"I LOVE my new coffee maker! It makes coffee fast and keeps the coffee hot for hours. With coffee makers in the past, I frequently found myself reluctant to drink coffee that had been sitting around for more than an hour because it tasted burnt and was generally cold. That's not an issue with this coffeemaker because the brewed coffee doesn't just sit there and fry on the burner; rather the carafe holds the heat made from when the coffee was brewing. You really can't tell the difference in taste or temperature of coffee made 5 minutes ago versus coffee made 4 hours ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mess","review":"First, decide on an alterenate location for the dispensing of your coffee as it won't flow into the carafe. I've been using a number of coffee makers over the years without a problem but this product has never....once.. worked properly.The upside is that you can be assured of having sparkling countertops as the Cuisinart dtc-975bkn creates such a mess, you're stuck wiping the counters and surrounding areas after each use.Judging by the other writers complaints about customer service, I'll be sure to avoid anything produced by Cuisinart in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"This replaced an identical one of about 5-6 years old. Good coffee maker although my wife does not particularly like it because it pours slowly through the top. That, I believe, is simply a function of it being a thermal top sealing in the heat which it does very well. Coffee stays hot for a very long time. Last 1/2 cup will still be pretty warm 8-10 hours later if still left in. I remove top to pour.Plastic does not hold up that well to the heat & acidity of the coffee, that's why replace. Better materials = greater expense and they obviously have to hit a price point.Good coffee, stays hot.If you forget to push the filter basket back into place, and the timer starts the coffee in the AM (as I have done multiple times) then yes, water on the counter. I do not blame the machine for my spaciness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and Follow Directions!","review":"I read from other reviews on Amazon that, if I followed directions for the Cuisinart thermal carafe 12-cup coffee maker, there would be no problems of ovwe filling or spilling.

I put “L�?part of the lid facing the pour lip and this seems to help to put it on straight. I always check its straightness. After a while the threads get worn which help. I am always careful to put both the pot and the filter basket in very carefully. I have never had an overflow as to date.Secondly: it is a left handed coffee maker. The fill gauge is on the left hand side, which makes filling the water hard for a right handed person.Third: the shut off valve for the basket to allow pouring when brewing leaks from the get go. Not much but it does leak. I now wait for the alarm for end of brewing to sound. No problems then.Fourth: cleaning the pot is hard, because there is a very small opening.Bottom line: brews excellent coffee, using my Kitchen Aide Conical Burr Coffee Grinder, but hard to use, thus the rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot coffee","review":"We have had this coffee pot for about a year and have been very satisfied.

I wanted this coffee maker to work for us, but I feel like you have to watch the entire process to make sure you don't end up with a huge mess all over the place. 30 minute cleanup and a burned finger is not worth the price of this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not reccomend this coffee maker.","review":"I liked the styling of this cofee maker but have given it a low rating due to the consistency of the coffee it brews. A couple of times when I have programmed a time to brew automatically it seems not to heat the water hot enough and it ends up brewing weak coffee.

My husband wants to throw it out and start over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated Coffee Maker","review":"The pros: coffee is always hot, and is not sitting on a hot plate.The cons: very difficult to pour, because it also drips out of the lid. Extremely difficult to clean the lid. Some coffee seems to stay in the lid, and takes too long to drain out. This product is not very consumer friendly, if you want to keep it clean.We always used a Braun 560 and loved it, but is not available anymore. We are very disappointed in the Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to those who knew...","review":"We too were lulled into a sense of superiority about being smarter than the machine. Unfortunately, our kitchen floor now has to pay for our hubris. For the third time, our expensive coffee maker has created a java-hued Paradise Falls off our counter. Off to the recycler with you, and a return to the inexpensive unit that served us so well.If you decide to tempt fate, know the following:- You will try several times each morning to align the poorly-designed screw top lid- It takes this unit longer to brew and pour than most. Only you can evaluate your morning patience level- Overflow is a very real possibility, whether it be because you were too sleepy to remember if you emptied the pot before brewing, because a stray ground clogged the spout, or because the unit just wants to have a bad day- When if overflows, it will do so over the electronic controls, which are inexplicably located at the base of the unit, or the head of the Falls.Best of luck to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never another Cruisinart product","review":"Lasted from Christmas 2010 until yesterday April 5, 2012.

It makes great coffee - always tastes wonderful.

My old Cuisinart gave up the ghost after two years, but overall it was much better designed. This one seems carelessly put together: (1) the mouth of the thermal carafe is so small, a bottle brush inserted for cleaning sprays water over you when you pull it out. (2) The auto turn-on feature has no light; the only way you can tell if it's set is to stand next to the machine and read the display screen, which is VERY dim. (3) I've had it for only four months, but already the auto shutoff feature isn't working. Take the pot out during brewing to pour an early cup, and the coffee just keeps running. I won't buy from Cuisinart again, since their design/quality control departments appear to be on snooze function."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I read the reviews and went back and forth about whether to go with this one or a Bunn for about a week. I think I made the right choice. This is an un-fussy coffee maker, with a carafe that won't break if you drop it. That's what I need. I also wanted one I could program and that would keep my coffee hot without burning it. There have been no incidents of spillage or overflow and the machine is about as straightforward as it gets. We've been using it for about 2 weeks now, but having read all the reviews, particularly the one by the person who disassembled the lid and cleared and enlarged the hole where the air escapes I am confident that if anything goes wrong with it we can fix it fairly easily.

Yes, it DOES occasionally spill coffee all over the counter if you're not careful. I think in my case it is because some of the grounds have gotten trapped inside the plastic filter housing, under the gold permanent filter that I use. I find that I have to take the plastic pieces apart on occasion and clean them out and invariably there seems to be a ground stuck in there which interferes somehow with the spring mechanism. This coffeemaker brews a great pot of coffee and keeps it warm for hours, the auto programming is excellent when you want to wake up or grab a cup of coffee before work, and the electronics are still going strong.I am ready to replace it with something different, just because I want something new... and I think I'll stick with Cuisinart because I have had great luck with this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I felt compelled to share my horrible experience with this coffeemaker. I've owned a Mr Coffee for years, and wanted to try a thermal carafe model, figured Cuisinart was a good name to go by. Anyway, this machine was a BIG disappointment. The coffee tasted terrible (same kind I used in the other machine that always tasted good), the machine requires more than twice the amount of coffee grounds as my Mr Coffee Accel did, to produce an even halfway-palatable cup of coffee. But the worst part, was that the coffee didn't even brew hot. It was on the border of lukewarm, every single pot I brewed. I will never buy another Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"this coffee maker stinks","review":"This is by far the worst purchase I ever made, it will work great for a week, then boom, for some unknown reason the filter compartment overflows and the mess is unbelievable, you then have to clean the whole coffee maker because everything is filled with grounds.

Had it for four months before I gave up on it just this morning, took a baseball bat to it, and ran it over with my car. You have to set up the filter and set the pot exactly right, or else the coffee spills out of the filter area and not into the pot, making a horrible mess. After this last happened nearly six weeks ago, I vowed to watch the coffeemaker every morning to see what was happening and it worked fine... until this morning. I left for just a few minutes and came back to another no coffee in the pot... just in the filter area, and spillage over onto the counter and the floor.

Once the beep happens to tell you that it's done, there are no lights or timer to show that there is hot coffee in the pot, and it's so nicely thermal that feeling the outside of the pot gives you nothing, you have to open it up and let the heat out to know that there WAS hot coffee inside.

Would definitely recommend.We had it overflow on us several times too... get the lid on and shut the filter compartment. Our first one did just stop working... no explanation... just done.I want a different one, but can't find one out there with better reviews than this one.

In that 6 months, it's only seen very light usage. Recently, both the siphon nozzle and the carafe lid became clogged causing major messes. Hot coffee starts overflowing from the top of the carafe and hot coffee AND grounds start spewing from the top of the filter. If you try to remove the carafe, you will find the brew/pause feature doesn't work and it sprays hot coffee on your hand. That's quite a feature!!! I've tried cleaning the pot and machine throughly but was not successful in stopping it from making a mess. This machine has made it's last pot of coffee and it's last mess. By the way, it's also VERY slow to make a pot of coffee. You can run to the local Starbucks and back before a pot is ready. I've opted to get a Bunn BTX which is what we have in our primary home. I won't consider buying another Cuisinart product after this disaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this coffee maker!","review":"I researched online reviews and shopped around for a new coffee maker.

The only thing I had a problem with is that the height is too tall to fit under my cabinets.

I was better, smarter than those who sent out dire warnings. It was a challenge.I failed.This coffee pot is a monster hiding on my counter. Just when I am sure that I have mastered it, I am again brought to my knees. Literally, I am on the floor wiping up my last failure. The counter, the insides of my drawers, the cabinet fronts lay drenched in brown sludge. I wake up at 3:00 AM for work. This is not a pleasant thing.I have owned this coffee pot since September 2009.

While it does keep your coffee hot, I have had it overflow coffee grounds all over my kitchen too many times too count. The only thing I like about it is how long the coffee stays hot. The other thing I find frustrating is how it leaks when you pull the pot out to pour a cup of coffee before it is totally done dripping into the pot. At times it works, most mostly it leaks. I hate it and we are putting it in the trash. It has leaked even when we have double and triple checked that the lid has been screwed on correctly.

When I asked Cuisinart for a new lid, they told me it was out of warranty and I'd have to buy one. So, apparently Cuisinart and Amazon had let my unit sit on the shelf for a couple years before shipping it off to me, and it's MY FAULT?

When I called the company, they happily replaced the part that causes the problem, with no questions asked, but that one malfunctions as well, so it must be the design.

Yes, we have had overflow problems in the past, but finally figured out why. If a coffee ground gets caught in the drip mechanism, it will plug it up....hence the overflow. Here is what we now do: (1) completely rinse the cone (make sure that no grounds are caught in the drip mechanism if you've just had a problem) and put it back into the holder, so that it is properly seated, (2) put in a fresh filter and pat the filter to the sides of the wet cone, (3) carefully fill the filter so that no grounds get between the filter and the cone, (4) make sure the coffeepot is properly seated on the stand.

Since we live in California, there was no charge to ship it back; if you live in another state they charge you $10.The unit comes with a one year factory warranty, and I am curious to see if this third unit makes it to a year; I kept the box for the purpose of returning it when/if that becomes necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking But Hard to Manipulate and Use","review":"Hard to open up the coffee filter area and the spout on the thermos was difficult to open when you wanted to pour it.Would not recommend this coffeemaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little pot!","review":"This is my second Cuisinart 12 cup thermal pot and I love it! The only reason its my second is the first one got destroyed in Hurricane Sandy :( This was the first thing I replaced after the storm! It keeps your coffee hot for hours without burning it. The pot can go right onto the table and there were times I forgot to clean it out and it was still pretty hot the next day! Would buy again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"First let me say that Cuisinart customer service has been terrific. Purchase in November 2011 and had a problem with spring in August 2012 and they sent a replacement part out quickly. I was hoping that this pot would be the answer to all my coffee needs...love the fact that I never have to worry about leaving the coffee pot on. However, I find that the pot does not keep coffee hot long enough. I know they reccommend warming the pot with water, but really??? what a waste to run all that water to get it hot, etc. Then just a few weeks ago I was wiping the coffee maker down and the white writing came off!!! How crazy is that? So now I have no ideas what the buttons mean. They have nicely offered to replace, but I really don't like the pot...bummer is I missed the 1 year deadline by weeks to just return it. Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Coffee EVERYWHERE","review":"It would be a great coffeemaker IF the coffee would go into the thermos where it is supposed to go. My husband and I purchased a Cuisinart DTC-975BKN coffee maker a year ago. During the past year, on occasion, it has sent coffee all over the counter, into the cabinet drawers and onto the floor. But, we moaned and mopped up and took responsibility for not settng it up properly. However, in the past 4 days this has happen twice. Coffee, coffee everywhere. It is not an alinement problem like in the past; it appears to be some problem with the cap to the thermos. I no longer trust this over-priced, made-in-China coffee pot, which is why I'm on Amazon looking for something to replace it.Sharon Fletcher-Iltis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This is the first time I've left a negative review for any product, but I'm so frustrated with this coffee maker, I felt I needed to warn people to stay away. There is a spring valve at the bottom of the filter that is supposed to open and close depending on whether or not the carafe is underneath. In ours, this will jam and water will overflow over the top of the filter and all over the counter. Other times, it will remain open when you pull the carafe out to pour before its done brewing and coffee drips all over the machine. Contrary to some of the positive reviews telling you to ignore bad reviews, this has nothing to do overfilling, just a poorly designed mechanism. Apparently some people get lucky and get a good version, but we weren't lucky. Ours is crap and its time for us to replace this expensive and frustrating coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puddles on the counter","review":"Boo. Ever since the first time we created a coffee puddle (more like a lake) all over the counter we have been incredibly diligent in putting the carafe lid in the correct position. The lid or filter must be incredibly sensitive and it is MUCH easier to make coffee puddles all over the counter than in the pot. Making coffee shouldn't be this hard. Thank God we still have the original packaging- this is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow, frequent overflows","review":"When this thing works, it makes good coffee and keeps it warm for hours. However, at least once a week it inexplicably jams and overflows if I make the mistake of walking away while it's brewing. This is in a high-tech company office. People here are more than smart enough to operate a coffee maker, but even if everything is assembled and aligned correctly, and even if it *starts* fine, it still sometimes just backs up and spills coffee and grounds everywhere.Plus, it's unimaginably slow, so when I wait 10+ minutes for the coffee to finish brewing, then come back into the kitchen to see it erupted again, I'm not real excited to have to spend 5-10 minutes cleaning the counter and floor before I go through the whole process again. Instead I usually take the elevator down 29 flights, walk a block, buy a cup of coffee, then reverse the trip and I'm still way ahead on time. Plus no cleanup!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Coffee Action","review":"I bought this coffee maker based on the other reviews a few months ago, and they are right on! This is the finest, best designed coffee maker I have had in years. The carafe keeps the coffee much hotter than other makers...(and I have gone through at least two thermals in as many years)...I can think of no outstanding flaw. The lid which was bad-rapped in one of the reviews is head and shoulders above some real pieces of crap I've had to suffer through, (Mr. Coffee designers, please take note!) The reviewer complaining about the glass in the carafe breaking...perhaps there is a glass insert within the walls of the carafe, but I have found no evidence, and they must have dropped the thing. As far as the beeping, well, I don't know why they threw that in there but it is not a deal breaker. (Why does everything have to beep these days?)

Like another person commented \\"PLEASE take to heart the comments about overflow\\". It is so so true!! I used it for about 1 1/2 weeks no problem. I had company on Memorial Day and went to make coffee in this BRAND NEW pot and to my amazement I turned around and there was the coffee and the coffe grinds all over my kitchen counter and floor. I tried it one more time thinking I must have done something wrong and ONCE AGAIN it overflowed coffee and coffee grinds again.At which point I unplugged it, and my search continues again. There goes $100.00 over my kitchen counter with coffee and coffee grinds. I didn't save the box to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved overflow problem","review":"I had several overflows with my first coffee maker (DTC-975BKN). What I mean about an overflow, is when the grounds float up and over top of the filter and then plug the top of the carafe. This inturn causes the coffee to go all over the counter and floor. I contacted Cuisinart and they sent me a replacement. I had several overflows with the replacement unit. My wife finally tried using bottled water and we have not had an overflow problem since. Once in a while we have tried regular tap water and it will float the grounds up to the top of the filter and some grounds will go into the pot. We go back to the bottled water and no problem. The grounds will be down about 1 1/2 inches from the top of the filter. I hope this helps some of unhappy owners. We now love our coffee.I wish someone would explain why the bottled water does not cause a overflow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this coffee pot!","review":"When I read the review by the guy who said his pot dumped his coffee all over the counter, I thought it must have been a fluke, he just got a defective pot. Well, unless you enjoy cleaning up 12 cups of coffee and mushy grounds out of your cabinets, countertop and floors, I would say, stay clear from this product. I repeat, unless you have OCD and love to clean, DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE POT! It has happened to us so many times, I think my cabinet drawers are starting to warp from being drenched in coffee so many times.Not only will you have a mess that will cause the most mild-mannered person to begin cussing like a sailor (as you are cleaning up the horrendous mess!) but your coffee pot probably won't work for several days due to the front button controls being dipped into a coffee bath.The good thing about this pot is that on those lucky days the coffee actually makes it into the pot, it makes good coffee that stays hot for several hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy among limited choice","review":"This coffer maker is to replace the one I have been using for over 10 years made by Krups. The design of the Krups coffer maker worked very well for me and my kitchen. After 10 years, It's time to replace it but to find one has the similar design and function is difficult. I came across the Cuisinart DTC-975BKN that looks almost the same like the Krups I had, without reading in detail, I ordered it right away. After I opened the box, I found out it stands about an inch taller than my old one so makes it a little harder to store on a specific counter space in my kitchen that has a wall-mount cabinet. One flaw is the opening of the thermal pot is very narrow; it is not designed for a human adult hand to clean the inside and I need to clean with a bottle brush. I just don't feel the brush cleans the same way as my hand. Other than that, the coffee tastes good, it brews quietly, the construction is sturdy. I would recommend it to people that likes the specific design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this coffeemaker","review":"Large pot [12 cups] blends in beautifully with my kitchen decor, very easy to use and set at night for automatic morning brewing!

It keeps coffee drinkably hot for several hours. The timer, which is almost standard on coffee makers now, works well.Minor negatives: It pours very slowly, as part of the heat-retention characteristics. The lid can be tricky to align. If you get it cross-threaded, it will not seal correctly and will probably cause leaks. It is very tall, and if your kitchen cabinets are low you might have a conflict.None of the negatives outweigh the positives. It is the best coffee maker I've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very long","review":"Having had problems with Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffee makers failing within a few years we thought a simple version would hold up better.

I will not buy another Cuisinart product. So far all have failed far too soon considering the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... when it worked","review":"When it worked, this was a great coffee maker.

Downside - like many other reviewers, I have had coffee streaming out the top of the carafe during brewing. It isn't that difficult to screw the top on the carafe before brewing, but apparently there is a good way and bad way. Haven't figured that out yet...even after having coffee coming out all over the kitchen counter twice. Advice is to watch this coffee maker until it starts brewing into the carafe to make sure the top of the carafe is on correctly, otherwise it will give you a messy surprise upon occasion. Not a great investment on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This coffee maker is nice WHEN it works. The problem is that it's durability is questionable.

Just like others warned previously... the machine failed within three months of purchase. Not to be outdone, the wife could not believe it (because she loved it otherwise) and so she went out and bought a SECOND one locally. Sure enough, with three months that one FAILED as well...

It kept the coffee really warm, not burnt tasting, and we had no other complaints, until the coffee started spewing over the carafe, much like the other reports here. After numerous phone calls to Cuisinart, with very long wait times, we cleaned out the unit as instructed but the problem continued. We attributed this problem to the fact that the coffee maker was dropped during our kitchen renovation, and that it was probably our fault. Bought another one, and about 4 months later had the same problem. I agree with the other reviewers - it doesn't take a rocket scientist to screw a cap on correctly, and make sure the filter and all of its parts are in the right place. However, we had no trouble operating it for a few months, and for what we paid, it should practically run to Starbucks for me and buy me a latte, which is what I have to do until my new, non Cuisinart model arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"You must be very careful with this machine. If the basket isn't snugly in place, and often times it feels like it is, but it truly isn't, your coffee will leak all over. Even after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. It leaked all over my counter, floor, inside my lazy susan cabinet and was a complete mess in the morning before work when all I wanted was my cup of coffee. Then, it will NOT stop brewing mid-stream for you to fill your cup like the manual states. It keeps on dripping.

In my opinion, if one grind makes it through your filter or if the planets don't line up in a million other ways it just spits coffee and grinds out all over your counter.

That's about a cup and a half of coffee for the full 12 cup run. That's double what any other drip machine recommends. I can't imagine that much coffee even fitting in the basket. What they know about their coffee maker is that it makes WEAK coffee. Either the water doesn't get hot enough, or the water doesn't get spread over the grounds evenly enough, but the upshot is it comes out like tea. That would be enough to recommend against this coffee maker. However, the worst part is that the coffee this machine makes also has a horrible metallic taste. This machine makes horrible, undrinkable not-coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of Junk","review":"The design of this thing is horrible.

So after 3 months of the Zojirushi here's what I've found:It seems to make weaker coffee than my old cheap maker.To mitigate this, I found that if I add warm water instead of cold, it tastes better/stronger.The carafe keeps coffee hot for a couple hours...after 8 hours, it's warm/cold.I had one flow-over because I ground the coffee too fine and it clogged the filter...my fault.It makes exactly 6 Measuring Cups, which is enough for me and my wife in the morning.I think if Cuisinart were smart, they'd disable that alarm. I probably would have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest piece of crap.","review":"I had my last coffee maker for 10 YEARS. This one broke in less than 5 months. It's nice that the carafe keeps the coffee warm, but the rest is chintzy. There is a hole in the back leaks water if you even try and make a full pot, so it doesnt make as much coffee as it advertises. On top of that it is very easy to end up with a kitchen full of grounds and muddy water, if the lid is the slightest bid off or not in proper alignment. While all of that sucks, I was willing to put up with it until my coffee maker stopped telling me how much water i had put in. This is kind of important if you are making CUPS of coffee.

I don't think you need to spend up to $100 for a unit with that feature and the programmable brew, which we do not use. It is tall, barely fitting between our cupboard and counter top.

On the other hand, I was not impressed with the performance of the thermal carafe in keeping the coffee hot. Perhaps that is related to the design change. We usually brew 4 mugs (7 cups) and drink 2 right away and the other 2 an hour or two later. The first 2 are plenty hot, but the remaining 2 mugs need to be reheated in the microwave. With my old glass carafe machine, I'd just turn it off after the first mugs, and reheat the rest in the microwave. Given you have to preheat the thermal carafe with hot tap water before you brew coffee into it and the fact that its harder to clean than the glass carafe, I don't think it's worth the hassle.

They said after the last replacement that they wouldn't be sending me any more. And, honestly?

Called Cuisinart, thinking I had a three year warranty, but my serial number indicated it was refurbished - news to me. Anyway, I'm out of luck.

I was really looking forwarded to a thermal carafe. Upon opening the package I discovered that this model did not come with a \\"gold\\" filter basket. It uses paper cone filters. For a $100 Cuisinart should include a filter basket as the do in their other models. Other than the thermal carafe it plastic and feels very cheaply made. I will be returning it and ordering another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee maker","review":"This coffeemaker is great, very economical as it shuts off after it is finished brewing and the coffee stays HOT for hours in the urn. No 'burner' to go bad after years of use. The only problem we have had is if the filter isn't sitting perfectly right in the basket and the water misses going through it, the water overflows onto the counter,etc. We will purchase a gold filter (if cuisinart makes one for this model). So far, all the specs I've seen for the gold filters do not include this model so I sent a message to the company.

The coffee is weak (brewing temp not high enough, I'm guessing) and the carafe lends a metallic taste to it. Also, it overflowed all over my countertop the only time I made a full pot of coffee--so I am now afraid to brew a full carafe. I SHOULD HAVE HEEDED the bad reviews I read before buying it.

We cleaned the cover and checked the mechanisms. I don't see anything obviously wrong with it.I also wish we had known before purchasing that the coffee is very weak and there is no way to control the strength.

As a mother of two young boys I know how hard it is to get one cup of coffee in the morning that is actually warm. I have a running joke with friends about how many times we heat our coffee up in the morning between feeding babies, changing diaper, etc. This pot is wonderful!! My husband has it set to brew at 5 am for his first cup. Then brace yourself, I pour mine around 9 am and its still HOT! The first couple days I tested this pot through out the day and the coffee stayed drinkably hot from 5 am to 1 pm! After that it still tasted great, just needed a little heating. I love the over all look of this item as well. I thought it would be too tall for our under cabinet space, but it fit well. If you have a knife block out on your cabinet, or a stand mixer, this coffee pot will fit under just fine! So happy I ignored the bad reviews and purchased this pot.

If the coffee filter/coffee ground compartment isn't clicked into place all the way, coffee will overflow and go everywhere. It takes 2-3 times to get the lid on the coffee pot correctly.

The carafe is REALLY nice. Kept coffee hot all that jazz. Then one day after 6 months it stopped working. We would turn it on and the unit would immediately act as if all the water had already passed through the system and shut off. We had a warranty on the device so we replaced it through the company.$10 processing fee + shipping and handlingThe new machine arrived, worked one month, then died in the exact same manner. Extermely unhappy with this unit and/or Cuisinart. To replace the machine again will be another $10 + shipping and handling.7 months of coffee is now going to cost my family around $150. Should have went to an overpriced coffee house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great brand, but lousy quality.","review":"While it makes good coffee, the stop and serve function rarely works, most of the time it just keeps pouring coffee out of the filter basket. At least with no heating plate it's not burning on that, but if you want a cup before it's finished better have a towel handy.Many have complained about the lid, and I even read the reviews with an eye toward skepticism, I mean surely if you take care to screw it on straight, it will go on all the way and seal right? Well, I've cross threaded this thing a dozen times, I've always seen it and removed the lid and started over, but the threads on this lid and container are not the easiest to get going correctly. But, then it could be a test of how addicted to coffee we are, can't do it maybe your really Jonesing too much for that first cup.It's the basic \\"defects\\" in either manufacturing quality or design quality and cause the low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee maker from Hell.","review":"We got this coffee maker because of its large capacity. When it works, it works quickly and well. However, either the little gold filter basket or the ball in the lid can malfunction and stop the flow of coffee into the pot. 12 cups of brown liquid mingled with grounds all over the counter and floor is not a pretty sight. Of course, it only strikes when you are in a hurry and don't carefully check that all the coffee is going in the right spot.

I just poured another cup, 12:25 pm, almost as hot and almost as fresh as the first cup. Outstanding.Now, word of warning. I almost did not buy this pot because of complaints on design, leaks, etc. READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. It is not the easiest coffee pot to understand. I read the directions several times until I could figure out what the heck they were talking about.So now, why not 5 stars? The cost. It just burns me to pay 80+ dollars for a coffee pot made almost entirely flimsy plastic with the exception of the stainless steel pot, but alas, it is 2011."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I've wanted a thermal coffeemaker for a long time, so when my old Gevalia coffeemaker stopped working I read all the reviews and picked this coffeemaker. At first it seemed ok but then I started having problems. The coffee doesn't come through the drip and sits in the top long after the signal goes off. Other times, the coffee doesn't go into the thermal pot at all and drips down the side. People said how hot the coffee is, but I don't think it's all that hot when it's first brewed. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design flaw, but occasionally great coffee","review":"This coffee maker makes terrific coffee and keeps it piping hot, but is too uneven to continue using. I can't tell you how many times I, or someone else at work, has had to mop up gallons of coffee because the machine didn't work right. First off, the coffee does not drain properly through the filter--often leaving two cups of coffee just hanging there. We use the correct grind of coffee and it works about 70% of the time, so it's a design flaw. Also, the coffee inexplicably drains all over the counter instead of into the pot. Checking the pot reveals that the lid is on correctly and nothing is amiss--but still the malfunction.

Although he officially was part of Joseph Goebbels' organization, he reported directly to Hitler. This is one of many memoirs written after WWII. Other works include memoirs by Admiral Horthy, Keitel, Alfieri, etc. It is important to go to the original sources to really understand history. Dietrich was with Hitler virtually every day during some of the most momentus events in history. Although the reader is forewarned that all memoirs reflect the bias and agenda of the author, they provide the reader with an intimate perspective of what really happened. Dietrich's portrait of Hitler, his generalship, his relationships with the Party, his personality trait, etc. are fascinating. The translation is excellent.

Campbell manages a rare trick for a liberal writer -- he maintains a respect for his own politics and ideologies while not shoving them in the faces of his readers. His self-awareness and his dry sense of humor are spot on, and his story-line is funny, bizarre, tender, and oddly suspenseful. Just as interestingly, this is one of the most tightly structured memoirs I've ever read.

Well, I got something well-acted and British, but I also got exposed to one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. It still haunts me. At the end my husband and I just looked at each other and said...\\"Surely not...\\" We went back and watched the end again hoping we had missed something and it had caused us to misinterpret the end. Only Alan Rickman could have made me feel sorry for an incestuous cad and Hugh Grant as a bad guy is never a good idea.

This particular book retells some of the more gruesome tales for younger readers, leaving out a lot of the gorey details of the original stories. A word of caution, though: once your kids read this one, they will invariably seek out the others!

In September of 2010, Steve Haskin wrote a blog on Bloodhorse about \\"The Life and Death of Seattle Slew\\". That wonderful blog captured the essence of Slew and was so emotional that even Mickey Taylor, Slew's owner, posted a grateful comment.

You'll love this album too if you're into pop ballads like those of Celine Dion. The lyrics are so beautiful, but even if you don't speak French, the music alone is worth buying the album.

JAK's attention to detail of the off-the-beaten-path island of Orleana and the emotional reality of murder and blackmail on the main characters is potent.Amelia - Amy - is strong for a female character written at this time, though she does have bouts of feminine temper that remind me of the books where it was OK for a male character to threaten to beat the female.Still, this work is a good read - and one of JAKs greatest early works.

There were too many characters, and the plot took too long. I made myself complete the book just to see how it ended. The characters were too predictable and very transparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel. The plot was stupid and I think that Pearl Cleage is becoming predictable with her novels. This book reads more like urban fiction. Additionally, her recent novels seem to have the same plot, people, and theme. I would like a little stretching on her part. The only saving grace in this novel is Precious Hargove's committment to integrity. She did not have to think twice about whether she was going to be blackmailed or not. That was a great example for her son to witness and something all parents should do: Not uphold our children when they are wrong but be supportive while they walk through the consequences they have made for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I've read other books by the author and truly enjoyed them.

We can not question Blue's loyalties, though we must question those of some of your other colorful characters.

In this case, there was only a small handful of episodes that were decent. It was slow, less music, had a terrible plot, bad song selections, was trashy really, and overall almost unbearable. I did not buy this DVD for the first time. It isn't even worth 30 dollars in my opinion and that means a lot as such an earnest glee fan.

However, I found the book to be filled with just the right amount of intrigued and suspense, filled with turmoil and tempestuous feelings and attractions, that it kept the book alive and moving. I could feel the anquish of the woman whose husband left her for the conniving younger woman...especially as she destroys everything he treasured that he had left behind. You can feel for the daughter who feels betrayed by her father, but torn apart by her mother, and used by her sister who relies on her to handle it all.

If you look closely you will see the pre film credits just as they fade out which tells you pretty much from what this has been mastered. I doubt that it is a legal print. While this version is better then nothing it is a long way from doing justice to the beauty of the film. The sound is stereo but not the 5.1 surround that it should be.

In the EP mode, two EL CIDs could've fit on a single tape, so this is also a space-waster.Definitely thumbs down!Worst news of all: there isn't a good VHS version available of EL CID.

The rest of the film is included in its entirety (with intermezzo and exit music), and seems to be scanned from the Rank print being used worldwide. The picture quality is not up to par with the region-B European editions, of which, the Anchor Bay UK edition is the best. The English track can be played without subtitles in 5.1 DTS-HD, so if you want to get right into the story by pressing play, this could be the copy for you. There's a Portuguese dub for laughs in mono, with a complete re-edit of Rozsa's score."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites!","review":"I was so happy to find this movie brand new and reasonably priced!

No only is the print spoilt with blemishes it is not even in original screen ratio. A few years ago Martin Scorsese oversaw a restoration of this epic film bringing it back to original 182 minute running time with re-mastered sound and picture. This version was issued on Laserdisc and has been on sale in Hong Kong on a dubbed DVD for quite sometime now. Originally released by the Rank company I don't know who owns the rights now but surely SOME enterprising DVD company could make a killing by allowing fans of the film to purchase a full Special Edition of El Cid and how about Fall Of The Roman Empire which has also been treated badly on it's DVD release"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one that we have all been waiting for!","review":"The production is first class.

Anthony Mann would make two emblematic movies in this decade; this one and \\"The fall of the Empire Roman\\" with interesting results keeping in mind the arduous complexity of the narrative material.Charlton Heston once more, was required to star this highlight spectacle about the famous legend of the Cid. The saga is depicted with ravishing splendor, recreating admirable battle sequences. The presence of the alluring beauty of Sophie Loren was an additional hook to engage the great audiences, in her role of Gimena.Opulent and distinguished movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Cid - At last","review":"After such a long wait this is an excellent package. The quality of the remastering and the colour and sound are amazing. The extras worthwhile. It is good, at last, to have a complete copy of such a very fine film, arguably one of the better epics from the 60s. One minor quibble. It would have been good to have the entr'acte on disc 2 before the start of the second part rather than at the end of part one under the intermission card. However it is a very minor criticism of such a well presented package."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best","review":"So far I've only seen the restored EL CID at the cinema, so can only comment on the film generally. This is certainly a great epic. Not as perfect or inspiring as Ben-Hur, or as brilliant and intellectually daring as Spartacus, it nevertheless impresses in every department, from the intelligent script to the incredibly convincing sets and costumes to Miklos Rozsa's stunning score. Far from the rather camp \\"knights\\" films of the fifties (PRINCE VALIANT, KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE etc), this is one film that takes itself utterly seriously, and is all the better for it, despite the complaints of those critics who can't, or don't want to, take any historical film seriously. Indeed I've read so many negative or luke-warm reviews of this film I sometimes wonder if there aren't 2 EL CID's! Well, each to his own, but for my money EL CID runs BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS, in that order, a close third. As I said, one of the very best of its kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT WORK","review":"Will not operate. On screen it states that the DVD is \\"Incompatible Region Number\\".

You are better off purchasing one of the $7 -$12 DVD versions offered by others. The color in the Golden Classic Collectibles version is just about non-existent. We had to reset our TV color setting to maximum in order to see a modest color enhancement; which wasn't much. The sound is muffled at some points, and for those hard of hearing, the English captioning has mis-spelling, and omits random sentences and words.

A movie about honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness, and one that is definitely worth owning for one's personal DVD library. A little heralded film starring Charlton Heston and a very young Sophia Loren, about a great warrior and man of faith who unites Spain against the Moorish invasion. The extra DVD about John Bevere's discussion of integrity is an added plus to this wonderful and inspiring film.

Heston once again displays a full range of emotions - Sophia Loren complements the stage with her radiant beauty and turbulent emotional conflict which comes to a final resolution. The bigger the screen the better, folks, but I could never stop wondering if there was about an hours worth of the movie that never made it to the screen... Still worth watching, and I have, several times. Heston and Loren fans - you can't miss with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD/widescreen lovers take note","review":"While we all wait for the US/GB distributors to pull their fingers out with a top-notch DVD release, fanatics can get the best yet 'El Cid' from Amazon France's marketplace sellers.

With this new vehicle purchase I could not find Fosgate speakers at the size/price I wanted so I took a chance on these based on the decent reviews they were getting. I have to say I am blown away by how great these sound. These sound much better than the Fosgate speakers I had in my last vehicle. I haven't even replaced the factory head unit yet and they sound so amazing that I am no longer planning on doing so. I am not an audiophile; I just want crisp treble and a decent amount of bass with no distortion. These speakers have met this requirement with flying colors. I am officially done with Fosgate for the foreseeable future. Oh--and did I mention that the price on these is amazing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement speakers.","review":"My speakers were dying and starting to fuzz so i decided to invest in these, im glad i did. They are well made, and sound great, i would HIGHLY recommend upgrading your stereo in older vehicles (i bought aftermarket stereo for my 98 civic and the speakers sound a whole lot better!). Now it's important to note these are not very powerful speakers, they can play decently high, but when i crank them up really high i find myself lowering the volume because they start to get distorted. But overall, i am happy with these, perfect OEM replacement for the average music person. (I also bought the matching S95's for the front)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality sound, cheap hardware","review":"These speakers appear to have solid construction, and the Boston Acoustics brand garners fair reviews for the price, however my experience was very disappointing. I replaced the front factory Subaru paper-cone speakers with these. They were being powered by a couple-year-old Sony head unit with maybe 17 watts RMS. It may be that these require more power to produce adequate sound-quality, but I doubt it would make them shine. It has been a few months since I installed and demoed them in the car, but I remember them sounding worse than the factory speakers at any volume level I tried. Even my girlfriend knew something was very wrong and avoided listening to music in the car. The other problem I ran into was with the included hardware. The screws are made very cheaply. Even with the included bit and the clutch turned way down on the driver, I managed to strip the head of every screw.

Oddly enough the dental drill effect is at its raspiest on the softest vocals. Just try listening to the ear-shredding verses of \\"I Should Have Told You\\" at high volume--you'll be reaching for the volume knob before your eardrums give out. When he belts it out at high volume, he forgets to mimic Scallion and the rasp largely disappears. Too bad about the vocals because the song writing is actually better than on any album since Sunburn. In future albums maybe they'll just let him sing with his real voice, but it's too late for this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"In the past, Fuel has been among my favorite bands. I was very excited to hear \\"Angels and Devils\\", but was rather disappointed with their new lead singer's voice. This is not a deep melodious and sexy voice lending itself well to the metal underpinnings of the lead guitar (like Doughtry's would have). This voice is weak, pitchy and even somewhat whiny sounding. If they want to maintain their fan base, the band better keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This album reeks of generic radio rock. Fuel used to have a distinct sound, but this album sounds like all the other rock bands on the FM charts. Actually when the first song played I thought i accidentaly put in a Hinder album.

So boy was I in for a surprise when I started playing this album. First off, this new guy does his best to keep the band sounding like it used to, but it unfortunately doesn't pan out. His voice is pitchy, whiny, and doesn't hit the range Brett did. The album is pretty good with no bad songs, but none that really 'wowed' me either. It feels like generic radio music, because after I gave it 2 full listens, nothing really stuck in my head. I try pretending that this isn't Fuel and instead some new band, so I can give the new guy an honest listen. Its just not a very memorable album. Maybe good backround music when I play on x-box but I can't see myself actualyl looking for this album specifically"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty generic, check out Fozzy for a great CD","review":"Without Bret....the unique sound of fuel is gone.

No Brett, No dice.","review":"If you buy this album, you will find the classic Fuel guitar tracks and melodies. Green is a great vocalists and Carl has always been the writer. But ultimately, to succeed in rock n' roll today you have 2 choices. The first is to jump into a sub-genre stereotype and produce crap. A-la emo, pop punk, death metal..etc. The second is simply to match the right guitar sound with the right voice. Creed did it, Alter Bridge did not. Amy Lee and Ben Moody did it, the \\"new\\" evanescence can't cut it. But better than any of these was Carl and Brett. Now... it's just not right.

He doesn't shortchange history, but he also doesn't permit the pursuit of historical authenticity to interfere with clarity of exposition.I am grateful to the author for having written this book, and I think he deserves to be proud of his accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reebok Men's NFL Impact ST","review":"Stylish sneaker, with a look of a football shoe and casual sneaker at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy, good size patties","review":"Good construction for the price.

They simply don't make movies like this anymore. Forget about what can be done in 3 hours with $200 million dollars. This is about creating and sustaining real suspense and in this task, not a second is wasted. Even the credits move along.Nor are the actors wasted. Charles McGraw, who was about as good an actor as Ronald Reagan, is perfect for his no nonsense role. Unless you like boring movies (and some people undeniably, do) you will not be dissapointed.

This film is all of that BUT it has a simple and effective storyline that allows everything else to fall in line and create a riviting film. AT 70 minutes, there isn't a lot of time fluff - this movie gets with it and for a very few moments stays on track, figurativly and literally.The story is that cop has to escort a dame (lower case, of course) so she can make it to California and turn states evidence against her dead husbands \\"Business associates\\" Marie Windsor plays the broad as cheap as a bottle of Night Train, a regular charmer, but not too bright. The cop? He's got a job to do and wouldn't you know it: the train is lousy with hit men, an ice queen blonde and mouthy kid.

I recommend picking up both volumes if you enjoy and collect films of this period.Richard Fleischer's 1952 classic is a late entry in the genre however it has all the best elements of noir. Charles McGraw and the beautiful and sultry Marie Windsor, head-up a cast of capable B-movie actors. The b-w print transfer to dvd retains the rich darks and shadows that give noir films their visual appeal. The action and dialogue is taut and crisp. The plot twist and turns as the train winds its way from Chicago to LA will keep you glued throughout the film's economic 71 minute run time.

They have made the pegs shorter, so that they do not stay in place. My daughter (3) was so frustrated with it that I came to help her. Every time I (and I am 40 years old) put a peg in, several others fell out. If I had been by myself, I would have been swearing like a sailor! Do not waste your money!

This Lite-Brite Cube has smaller screens (6\\" x 6\\"), so would be better off for 2-6 yr olds, but then we have the peg issue. These new pegs are made smaller and don't fit as well as he old ones do, so that means they have a tendency to fall out. It is really frustrating trying to make one of these images without having to put half of the pegs back in while doing it. My kids played with it all of 15 minutes before they got discouraged and bored withe nuisance. Furthermore, the light comes a conventional light instead of using a Fluorescent or LED to help promote energy conservation and a longer lasting bulb.

No on/off switch so have to plug in/out of wall socket - very inconvenient and not something I want little kids messing with. 5. Cheap cord/bulb design - shorts out constantly so have to mess with cord position to keep light on.

There are too many characters, and they are all interchangeable. There is not one likeable person in the entire book. One knows to expect lots of sex in a Black Lace book, but it gets a little too strange in this book. For instance, there is one man who gets his jollies by making his wife live like a dog, including making her sleep in a dog basket, beg for food under the table, and use a tree instead of a powder room.If you're looking for a good Black Lace novel, skip the ones by Fleur Reynoldo, unless your taste runs to books featuring cruel, humilating sex scenes strung together by the flimsiest of plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche's take shape before your eyes!","review":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. There's the expected amount of sex in this book, of various permutations, but the character-development and dialog were just awful.

Highly underrated and coming from Switzarland (just like Iced Earth before, and possibly Red Sun Project in the future)Playing trash with noticable prog influences this is not usual death/trash metal. Vocals (done by bass player) are growls but the music is amazing all the time. Technically great with heavy riffs, a guitar player that can easily take on Darrel, and the 50lbs drummer who's pounding on double base non-stop is something that you do not want to miss. I personally prefer thier two last albums (Mental vortex, Grin), but there is nothing wrong with these before (Punshiment..., No more color). Too bad they've disbanded.Music should not be described with words, so I wont try to do that, just a friendly advice: get this as soon as possible, and listen to it.

I have just returned from hearing her read at the Getty Center in LA. What a marvelous experience. McHugh is a truly gifted manipulator of language, from its etemylogical roots, through its syntax, to its artful implimentation in finely wrought metaphors. She brazenly addresses plainly human issues -- sex, love, lust, pain, anger, joy, despair -- in terms that make them readily identifiable as the emotions you have felt but from a perspective slightly ajar to what you might have ever imagined. From hearing her speak, I can tell you she has an enviable mastery of the American language. My copy of \\"Hinge & Sign\\" is well worn from weeks of being my constant companion. I eagerly look forward to her new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Glasses Review","review":"I still haven't been able to get these glasses to work yet.

I suppose that is typical for an undertaking that continues to grow. But the best way to present information about this trail would be on the Internet. Yet the B.A.R.T. official site is is pretty sketchy. This review is not in any way a criticism of the author. She wrote the first major work on the trail. All her research was original. And in 2002, it was somewhat timely. And the Trail Council works with a very small budget. So someone who wants to find out current information about the B.A.R.T. will have do dig for it.

It was defective, so we returned it to the place of purchase, and picked up a new one. Much to our surprise, we got home and FoodSaver had actually replaced it with a letter saying that it was an 845 in the 825 box. Fine, great. We got an upgraded model for nothing. WRONG. We got a piece of junk for the cost of the 825. This thing has been a problem all along. Unfortunately, we were out of the 30 day return from the store we bought it in. The motor grinds sometimes like it going to just die - of course, everytime we call customer service, it doesn't happen. The sealer doesn't always work. It will start and just stop for no reason. Then tonight, the customer service rep told me you can't put fresh meat in it. You need to freeze the meat for two hours before food saving it....doesn't that defeat the purpose????? I am so fed up with the machine, I want to just toss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought the Z845 a few months ago and I think it's junk.","review":"If I could give this thing a negative number, I would. I just threw away 2 large bags of brown sugar because, after I had thrown away the bags the sugar came in, I could not get the Z845 to work. What a mess! I had brown sugar all over that part of my kitchen.On a couple of occasions the sealer has worked without creating a vacuum. This time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag, but the bag never sealed.I have watched the video several times and have read and re-read the instructions. At first I thought I was not operating it correctly, but now I believe the Foodsaver is the problem. The first time I used it, to seal a quantity of chicken for the freezer, it worked beautifully. It hasn't worked right since then.Another problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material. Is it possible this thing was invented for the purpose of selling refills, rather than to work as a sealer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not throw your money away!","review":"I bought the unit about 4 years ago and it did not work.

It's the same hand-held appliance as the $40 black WineSaver, only it's white.

I see absolutely NO reference to the oil reserves that supposedly lie in the Caspian Sea basin. Some have suggested reserves approaching those of Saudi Arabia. How can it be that this information is not incorporated into this book?I've also found the book a bit shallow and repetitive. It takes only few chapters to get the point. Much of the rest of the book simply states the same themes over and over in different ways. Someone could easily skim through this book for 15 minutes in the bookstore and walk away with all the knowlege it seeks to impart.The only saving grace to this book is the importance of the topic it discusses and, particularly for people ignorant of oil economics, for that reason it is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, But Misses One Largre Factor","review":"This was a great read and makes some compelling arguments on how oil prices will shape our economy over the next ten years. While I agree with the authors, they forget to mention the key role that outsourcing will have on our economy and inflation over the next ten years. In a global economy, where labor can be bought cheap, companies are able to offer products for lower prices since they are not paying as much for labor.With this said, I do highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Good book on investing using oil costs as a guide.A little pessimistic about the future, yet certainly plausible and possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"too wordy","review":"the author has a penchant for over describing EVERY phrase and it gets tedious and boring.

The characters, especially Alan, are interesting and compelling right from the beginning. It's clear that the author knows of what he writes, which lends a great air of reality to the whole story. I loved the ending...surprising, action-packed and lots of fun to read.If possible, I'd read this book before White's others just because many of the characters in this novel re-appear throughout the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Much Better","review":"Having read both Jonathan Kellerman's series on Alex Delaware and James Patterson's about Alex Cross I know that mysteries involving therapists and psychologists can be thrilling, entertaining and interesting. Stephen White manages to suck the life out his protagonist. The moral quandry had interesting ramifications, but it was discussed, debated and dissected ad nauseum. I wanted to scream, \\"Stop talking and do something, anything!\\" The love interest is annoying and the fate of his beloved Cicero is gratuitous and unnecessary. The last thirty pages of excitement did not make up for the other 200+ of boredom. I am assuming the books in this series get better, but I am not going to bother to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I really enjoyed reading this, the first in the Alan Gregory series.

If it weren't for the fact that I have a strange compulsion to finish a book once I've started it, I would not have lasted more than a chapter. Not only did I not empathize with the main character, I did not like him in the least. Plot is ridiculous, character development is clumsy and the love-less love interest with the DA made me thank God I am not a character in White's novel. I can't imagine what other people have seen in this novel but I warn anyone who reads this review to avoid starting something they are not going to want to finish.

This book is chock full of fascinating characters and a plot that will keep you guessing long into the night (or early morning!).White is especially effective at developing characters that are real and convincing, without the headliners being squeaky-clean perfect. All the characters have their flaws - like REAL people. I am tired of reading books where the \\"hero\\" has a picture perfect life. White's Alan Gregory character is superb.One note that I think is important about the White books: If possible, read them in order of publication. \\"Privileged Information\\" is the first in the Gregory series and the others follow a natural progression and reading out of order may cause some confusion. Actually, it's a tribute to the well-woven character development by a true master of the thriller - Stephen White."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brillant story well told","review":"I thought that this was an incredible story of a Russian agent Zeev Avni who penetrated the Mossad.His story read like a novel with the advantage that it was true.I found it stunning how easy it was to catch him. The Russians never coached him what to say maybe because to the Russians a caught spy had little value anyway so why bother. Still that costed them a valuable spy.Later I found it fascinating the way his outlook changed because of Khrushchev's speech against Stalin. I found it interesting the way he changed away from a communism. I see a likeness between his change from communism in jail and Arthur Koestler's who also in jail turned against communism.I do wish the book would have covered more what Zeev Avni's actually did both in WW2 in a Soviet espionage in Switzerland and later in the Mossad. Either would make a great sequel although I suspect the secrets he told the Russians are still marked not to be released in Israel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling story","review":"This book is quite short, so I feel it doesn't do many areas justice. In particular, considering the book is called \\"False Flag\\", it details very little about Zeev Avni's False Flag operations.But where the book works is the account of Zeev Avni's life. He's a very compelling character, and his warm writing style really allow you to get into his mind and understand what motivated him in his varied life. From becoming a communist spy so he could gain acceptance when he was young, to ending up working on computers, all the key actions are laid out in his interesting life.I read with sadness now, finishing the book, that Avni died two years ago. I think I feel loss because the book really does allow you to get to know this man and his motivations, and mourn his passing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"The first DVD is a taped lecture Dolf gives to people in New Zealand.

While, I am ok with the scanner so far I was extremely disappointed that it came with an outdated copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements v 4.0. This version is not supported by Vista requiring us to purchase an upgrade for $79.99. This raises the price of the scanner considerably. I am not one to purchase upgrades to software unless there is a compelling reason to do so and to have to purchase an upgrade right off the bat is galling to me.

I've been checking Amazon ever since last December when Marry Me first aired to see if it was released yet. I'm thrilled it's out.Watching it was a truly unexpected pleasure. Marry Me has the snappy, witty, rapid-fire dialogue in the tradition of the Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s. '('Okay, Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, if you've never seen Hepburn and Grant. I assume you've all seen Moonlighting.')' It was thoroughly enjoyable, never slowed down, and yes, she did make the right decision in the end.Now I can finally zap it from my DVR and not have to worry about accidentally deleting it.

These dive balls drop immediately to the bottom and are difficult to see underwater. You have to be swimming right on top of them to see. My seven year old daughter also has the dive rings, and these dive balls do not compare. You get twice as many rings for half the price of these dive balls. They're both easier to see underwater and easier to pick up.

Hence, a painting of a flower is only valuable in the way that it captures the essence of a flower, or the experience of viewing a flower. The viewing of a painting must also provide some of the experience of making that painting ( its process ).If you can manage to finish the book ( the style is a bit archaic ), the experience is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"This book is invaluable for artists and non-artists alike, and it is definitely a primer for all serious practitioners! From the first sentence of Chapter One, you know you about to take a journey through one of the most thought provoking and serious discussions of art to be published: \\"By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of an esthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY the F11, save your money and buy a cheaper model","review":"The reason I spent the extra money on the F11 was because of the ability to track and store you workouts on your computer. There is no stand alone software, you need to create an account on the Polar.fi website and upload your workouts. The way you upload is via a microphone connected to your computer, as a small speaker in the watch makes a buzzing noise. The Polar website is VERY poorly designed, and often doesn't work ( you can not log in). Even if you do log in, the usability is often not working. After spending an hour, and using a mic, and then trying a headset, I was unable to upload date.In short DO NOT BUY the F11, save your money and buy a cheaper model.On the positive side, the heart rate monitor seems to work fine, and there is a slightly more comfortable chest strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice HRM and Fitness Buddy","review":"I purchased this to get in better shape.

They all said \\"buy the Polar F11\\" so I did. In 18 months I replaced the battery in the watch three times and in the chest strap four times. I experienced eratic readings more than anything else -heart rates from 0 for most of a long run or 220+ when I was running easy. It would hop from low to extremely high to about right and then go to zero. When I sent it back to Polar along with a letter to tell them the problems I had with it, they sent me a bill for $50 and all they had done was replace the batteries... again. I was really disappointed with my experience especially after reading the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar F11 - it's super!...","review":"This is my second HRM and I am quite astonished with its features, especially the ability to create an exercise program to suit individual, based on his/her personal data.

I would have given 5 stars, if that would be the case..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are not allowed to enter the target heart rates directly","review":"You can't simply enter what heart rate targets you want - it only gives you ones it makes up on its own. You even must enter what DAY you were born, before you can use it - preventing others from using it without loads of set-up time.

I tried to contact customer service with no luck. The P-11 is useless to me. Some day I hope to find a real heart rate monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons are too sensitive and activate features when you don't want them!","review":"I've had this product for a couple of years now. I bought it after one of the plastic buttons on my old Polar watch broke.The problem with this watch is that the buttons on the side are too easy to press and there is no \\"lock\\" feature to keep them from being pressed. Because of this, whenever my wrist is cocked at an extreme angle, the back of my hand pushes in on one of the buttons on the right side of the watch or pushes the watch in such a way as to push a button on the left side.Because of this, it is always going into some mode that I don't want. And when I have tried to use the more advance functions, it often resets because of the way I moved my hand that causes a button to be pushed. So, I only get a full log of my workout about half the time.Based on this and the problem with my previous Polar HR watch, I won't be buying one of their watches in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"good little speakers","review":"These are perfect for travel and are very good to be so small (MUCH BETTER than the internal laptop speakers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally displeased with this item","review":"Being a longtime user of Logitech products and having used The V20 notebook speakers I thought the V10's would be a good set of speakers for my laptop.

I foolishly thought, \\"They just need to go into the control panel and change the settings. It can't be that bad. I never crank my music or videos so I'm sure it'll be fine.\\" I'm not an audio-phile either so I didn't think I would notice a big difference in the quality. Obviously I was wrong on both counts.

So, how will Kirk finally meet his fate? Hopefully we'll find out soon. And one other thing. Will there be some story out of all of this saying what happens to McCoy?

I must say though that I haven't read the book, only the abridged audio CD. The chase part of the book was hard to follow.If you read the other five, you have to read this one.

Clarke's 2001 Series even a non sci-fi fan would know that.Then you have the Perserver's from an alternate reality but still a copy of the second foundation see The Foundation Series.

Shatner can really tell a great story and this book provides a great deal of depth to Kirk's character. Like others I feel that if you have not read the first two installments in the series you may find the final installment difficult to follow. Also there are a lot of references to stories and characters from TOS and TNG (my favorite being Tryla Scott) that non-Trek fans may find confusing. Fans of Star Trek are in for a real treat because as I said earlier, Shartner is a great story teller. I hedge only because I found the end of the book to be very disappointing. The role of the Preservers is murky---the change is Tiberus is a bit hard to believe. But as a whole, Preserver is probably Shatner best work! So the ending may be weak but this book does do a pretty good job of wrapping up all the loose ends from the first two books.I look forward to the next installment---the adventure continues....."},{"rating":"2","title":"It brings Shatner to life.","review":"This audio adventure, filled with wonderful voices and sounds really brings Preserver to life, and makes Shatner's work much more memorable in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"toddler technicolor","review":"My two toddlers love this colorful rhyming boardbook and its companion masterpiece Hooray For Truckmice.

Don't be fooled - Bear Cub is, unfortunately, yet another sappy, underdeveloped, depressing gay-themed movie. The story felt extremely rushed & the character development was just plain weak. I do applaud the film for attempting to display a unique slice of life, but its delivery of the bear subculture (and of gay culture in general) was narrow, stereotypical, and borderline insulting. Similarly, the film's light treatment of the issue of AIDS was thinly explored and almost insensitive. Honestly, the only thing I enjoyed about the movie was the eye candy of the cast; there are good lookin' dudes crawling all over the place. But I need more than just good looks, beards, and flannel shirts to truly engage me in a movie. Bear Cub didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie but the dvd very dissapointing","review":"I saw the movie first on You tube and it last for 145 minutes ,this dvd only last for 95 minutes ,so I think I wasted my money ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is censored!","review":"I very much resent the MPAA telling me what I can watch and what I can't...look for the not rated version if you want the movie like it was made, and it is much better uncensored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart-wrenching, FABULOUS story for a first time author","review":"As the sister of a female police officer and the Mother of a 7-year old son, this story tugged at my heart as well as making me swell with pride and compassion for all police officers dealing with gang members.

I like Mary Monroe but this book wasn't \\"exciting\\". I wasn't into the \\"wives\\" theme and I got sick and tired of going from one character to the other. Then to top it off none of the characters had a good ending. I will say this IF you are interested in being a \\"call girl\\" then you need to read this book because it will show you how the street life leads to NOTHING. All the women had bad past and began nowhere and basically ended up right back at square one.

I know that characters must make some bad choices in order to cause some conflict, but in this tale, all of the characters make bad choice after bad choice - to the point that they were unbelievable. It seemed like Ms. Monroe wanted the reader to see a softer side to Clyde because of the way he felt about his daughter, but he, again, came off unbelievable. In addition, Helen's character, did not seem like a real person. It must have been difficult as an author to get inside the head of someone who was supposed to be mentally retarded. Instead, Helen came off, not as mentally challenged because her thought process was too organized. Instead, she came off as a very naive adolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Vintage Mary Monroe!","review":"Dull, dull, & duller!

Not definitive, but close enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"did anyone else actually read this??","review":"Yes, the art pictured in this book is fantastic. It shows some works that are nearly impossible to find in any other publication. However, the writing is simply horrible. The author's style is one of simple name-dropping without substance. If you are interested in reading a long-winded who's who list of artists, composers, choreographers, cinematographers, authors, and scenesters active in the early 20th century, this book is for you. If, however, you want to know more than names, read something else. ...but, again, the illustrations ARE great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be a bit greener.","review":"You have to look real close to see the green.

Characters were never in quite the same place as where I last left them (\\"Cheyney\\" floats through this story like \\"Tinkerbelle\\" -- what's up with that?), and personalities were virtually nonexistant.

I like the book for two reasons: First, the authors really explain sentence level grammar clearly. (Even I understood most of it, and the bulb burns not so brightly here.) Second, the book is fat with well-designed exercises and even comes with an answer key. If you are looking for a text for a developmental writing class or embarking on a self-paced study of the glory that is English, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creative compilation of several Springsteen songs","review":"Probably the best and most interesting of the bunch is \\"Thunder Road\\" by the Greg Kihn band.

However, I'm happy to report that THROUGH A CRIMSON VEIL is a great stand-alone book!I've read Ms. O'Shea's previous work, enjoyed it immensely and wanted to read this book. I resisted, however, thinking I needed to read the others in the series. So if that's what's holding you back - stop it! Get the book and read it!Through a Crimson Veil has a great \\"concept\\", interesting, sexy characters and a great story. I've enjoyed it so much, I'm ordering the first 2 in the series and will read whatever follows. I'm not going to restate the plot lines and re-explain the book to you, other reviewers have done a great job with that.

Let's see more (and more, and more) from this author!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful and intriguing book","review":"The authors try hard not to generalize, and use specific examples to illustrate cultural differences. I read this book while working for a company in the US that was jointly owned by a French company and a German company. Our 'bosses' were very much typical of that described in the book. I found this to be fascinating and used the information in the book to improve communications and information flow between the different groups. I would highly recommend this book to anyone working with any of these 3 cultures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for anybody dealing with one of these three cultures","review":"Anybody dealing with any of those three cultures in business should read this book. It is simple, handy and quite accurate. I am myself French and have been living and working in Germany for ten years now in an international environment. I also spent three years of my life in the US. The book - already ten years old - does need some up-dating as far as the political and economic situations in each of these three countries are concerned and I found a few inaccuracies in the French part (probably due to the fact that the French culture is more difficult to grasp for an American than the German one), but all in all it is a highly recommendable book. The key notions of \\"monochronic\\" and \\"polychronic\\", of \\"high context\\" and \\"low context\\" cultures are extremely useful. This is not only a book for Americans doing business with Europeans : as far as I am concerned it helped me understanding and being more patient with my American colleagues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding Cultural Differences: Germans, French, and Americans","review":"An interesting book, but poorly written. Observations were useful but the book is so repetitious and muddled, it was hard to stay focused on it. Most of the source material was self-referential and seemingly based on surveys done in the 1980s. Worth a read, but keep expectations in check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes written down","review":"After having read \\"The silent language\\" by Edward Hall I am very disappointed of \\"Understanding cultural differences\\". I would love to know where exactly the authors got their information from. They certainly haven't lived in any European country long enough to really get acquainted with cultural differences. The book contains so much negative information about Germany (my home country) and France (where I lived for a long time before moving to the U.S.) that has so little to do with reality that it's almost funny.Those stereotypes in a written form are rather dangerous and hardly offer adequate preparation for anyone who plans to travel to Germany or France on business or even live there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to travel to France and Germany","review":"This is an interesting book on cultural differences. The focus is on business and management, but still a worthwhile read for anyone interested in people and how they think. A family member loaned it to me and I read it over the span of several months, picking it up and working through a chapter whenever I needed a break from fiction.

Re-reading American Places, and recently re-reading other Wallace Stegner essay-collection books I have (Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs; The Sound of Mountain Water), I realize that there is just no better reading on history, land and travels in the West.

Since I only use it for draining boiling water out of pasta, I quickly rub it with a plastic scrubber under very hot running water to get rid of any pasta starch clinging to it, and stack it opened in the dish drainer to dry. When completely dry It packs away easily in a drawer, so it takes up very little storage area. It's paid for itself over and over again, in money, time, and enjoyment.

That way it would be more clear which results truly rely on results in Complex analysis and which rely only on the fact that the every n-degree polynomial over the complex numbers has n roots.

When the snow is over 4 inches you have to lift it up and blow about 2 inches of snow first then lower it and blow the rest. If the wind keeps changing you blow the snow back in your face, if you have a long sidewalk you blow the same snow over and over. Every time I started to use it, I stopped and used a regular shovel. It was great for clearing my 12'x12' deck but no good for the driveway or sidewalk.

If you run it a little without moving snow, the plastic scoop blade will gradually start to turn. It won't stand to any depth of snow. Well, maybe an inch or so of powder. If you need to move a few inches and have to pass over it a few times it becomes difficult to keep holding the unit and keep your hand on the control switch.

(This is Washington Dc where we don't get a lot of snow!) But the Toro made it easy! It took a little getting used to. it blows straight ahead so you have to angle it; and figuring out how to make it scrape right down to the driveway also took some practice; but after a half hour I had it down pat.

So I used the basic shovel to cut half of the snow off the pile then went back to use the power shovel.Well on the down note, the power shovel usually gets snow in my face. I haven't used a normal snow blower, and have seen people snow blow with those $700 blowers, but I don't see those people getting blown in the eyes by the snow. Maybe I need to tweak some of the gadgets.I haven't tried the leaf blower on this yet, but if my experience with the snow in my face, I wouldn't want sharp leafs on my face!So if you are on a budget, and live in a snowy area, you might want to consider this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny and then some.....","review":"I just used this for the first time in February when we got our first real snow in southeastern PA.

It's more likely to be in the 3-6\\" range. I bought this unit to clear just the sidewalk and walkways of light snow, which it does very well. The narrow 12-inch path it clears is not a handicap when used this way.If I have any complaint, it's that the extension cord has to be dragged behind the unit as you work and it gets stiff and hard to arrange as it moves through the snow. Be sure to buy a cord that stays supple and flexible in cold weather, the lower the temperature range the better.Other than that, I give it two thumbs up. It's reasonably light and easy to push and manuever, and if you angle the head just right, you can throw the snow off to the side and not have to clear it a second time. The next unit up in class is three times the price, so the cost of this one is very attractive for what it accomplishes. On balance, I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro Power Shovel","review":"This tool is simply one that should never have gone to market. It is probably designed as well as it can realistically be, but an electric shovel capable of lifting snow up and to the side can never be light enough for doing steps. It blows snow up and ahead, not to the side. Leaves a mess behind and the user looking like a ghost. I was willing to suffer the awkwardness of an electric cord if it would have helped my wife be able to handle walk clearing in my absence. But it doesn't. A real shovel is only slightly more work and slightly slower, and much less aggravation. Have tried this now on snow from depths of 1\\" to 8\\", wet and \\"dry\\".The OSHA-inspired button that can't be set to stay on without constant squeezing (in cold weather) makes this tool even more difficult to use by an elderly person.Forget this one.Paul McGuire, Ann Arbor, Michigan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Driveway Buddy","review":"This small but mighty shovel was my best buddy last winter.

I took it apart and the plastic rotor part that the belt rotates on was melted to the plastic the machine was made out of. I worked on it for an hour or so, used a scewdriver to separated the seized area and took it back outside and it did the same thing. I am very disappointed in Toro, for making a power shovel, that is anything but a POWER SHOVEL.

Next season we will be buying a regular snow blower. The cord gets in the way, you always have to move it around. It does such a small area at a time that it hardly saves time. It doesn't work well with wet, heavy snow. and because it throws the snow only directly in front, it limits how you can use it if you live where you aren't allowed to blow snow into the street. I usually use it for half the driveway and then hand shovel the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, save up for a blower","review":"First snow of the season 8-10\\".

If you are resident of Midwest or Northeast region (IL, WI, MN, NY, MA, NJ, CT, IN and many other states) then you must have experienced that often we get 'lots of snow in few hours' and this is not the equipment which can handle it. It also can not clean/unefficient cleaning wet and slushy snow higher than 3 inches. Which means that if snow advisory is more than 3 inches or more than 3 hours, you will be going out almost every hour to clean the snow, which obviously would not be possible if you are working full time and if you need to catch-up some sleep after working whole day.

I made it into about 30 pages of the book and just could not finish it no matter how hard I tried. The book consists of a series of short stories, not written by Michael Connelly, but edited by, which I found out after I had made my purchase. The writing is terrible, and am honestly surprised that Mr. Connelly would have put his name on something so far from his normal style and his own high expectation of literature. I usually do not leave reviews for most books, but felt that for this one, stay away and just hold out until Michael Connelly's actual book written by him is released in November.

Although the documents for R6RS are publicly available [...], this book is far more readable and understandable. Every concept is explained through small code samples (unlike the R6RS documents), which helps a lot in understanding how things work. Also, at the end of each chapter there are many interesting exercises (some not trivial at all).This Scheme book might not be as innovative as others, and textbooks likeStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Editionbetter explain how to properly use Scheme's unique features.

Please note: if you are really interested to learn Scheme, then this book is for you; if you are not really interested and/or you like to joke, this book is absolutely not for you. The book is accurate, complete, well written and cover all you need about the modern Scheme. I use Scheme for personal study about bioinformatics. Thanks to the Autor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction but sometimes lacks clarity.","review":"I purchased this book specifically with a view to learning the Scheme language. The text is easy to read, is pithy and to the point, and generally makes concepts clear and easy to understand. There are however, in my opinion, some sections where the author forgets that concepts are new to the reader and the examples that are used tend to obfuscate the point being made rather than elucidating it.I have never considered myself stupid, but after my 5th reading of the introduction to continuations I was beginning to worry. A quick reading of another text on the subject cleared up my concerns almost immediately which suggests to me that the explanations are not as clear as they could be. There are some other areas of the book where this sort of assumption makes grasping a new concept more difficult than it should be.Nonetheless, I still consider this a good introduction to the Scheme language and would gladly recommend it to the aspirant Schemer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great... even messier kids","review":"Food slides off of the bib because it's so slippery.

Now even uninstaling/reinstalling will not get it to function correctly. Fromt he web I see I am not the only person to have these issues. And Canon is not helpful.The second big issue with Cannons is that if you end up pressing down on the scanner, such as to flatten paper, it WILL break the machine. Thetr is next to zero tolerance for this, and I have had to toss 3 of them for that one reason alone. And I am very gentle with them!

Works well now.Software (at least on the Windows side) looks dated and feels a touch awkward, however the on-the-fly PDF creation is very useful for clearing out office paper clutter.

One would think that a true crime writer would have more of a grasp of the human psyche. Like his son the author ran away from problems and saw himself above other people, including his first two wives and his son's wife. How could you not express condolences to the family of a woman who who was part of your family for several years. How could you not protect her, because she was a stripper! I couldn't help but wonder if white privledge wasn't part of the picture but never mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disheartening...","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and although I found it hard at times to put it down, what struck me when I finished the book was that there is little to no mention of the other family that was affected by the author's son. I understand that the purpose of the book could have been to find out where the father went wrong, but what about some sort of consolation for the family of the murdered victim? Aside from that, the writing was engaging and I look forward to reading more of Carlton Stower's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"This ia a book written by Carlton Stowers about his own life, and his own son who turns into a murderer. It is SO well done. The book is interesting enough as a true-crime book, but Stowers obviously has the inside information about all of the characters in the book. He is quick to point out mistakes he made as a parent while also acknowledging that he was not at fault for what eventually happened, you can feel the pain he went through for years with his son, and he becomes an even more admirable man once you learn that he fought for his kids and raised them on his own once he was divorced from their mother. Any parent who has ever struggled with an out-of-control child will love this book, any true-crime fan will love this book. I did not want it to end. This one is a must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This book is all about nothing. He could have told this story in one sentence: \\"The boy went wrong and I don't know why.\\" The father's perspective is overtly self-serving; he mentions many times that he feels no blame & he can't think of anything he ever did wrong. Very little was researched or written about Anson's psyche - except to say \\"we are stumped\\". This is a great disappointment. Not one thing was learned or added to me after reading this book, except a distaste for self-exonerating parents. Also, the author mentioned little to nothing of the victim, her parents' grieving, or any of the dynamics involved in the crime itself. It was as if he didn't even know his daughter-in-law, and cared far more about absolving himself from blame than to dig for answers. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, honest look at family pain and triumph.","review":"You'll come away a better person for having read this gripping true story about a father's struggle to relate to a rebellious son and then his realization that the love he has had for the boy throughout the years is all that he can offer. And he gives that love to a young man behind bars for murder as he seeks to find even a tiny thread of the bond that lies between father and son. What rare courage to write, and what insight into the human condition"},{"rating":"2","title":"More like sins of the mother","review":"Since I enjoy dabbling in arm chair psychology, I will give my opinions towards this book. I feel that many of Anson's (Stower's son) problems stemmed directly from the fractured relationship he had with his mother, Jana. She was an immature teen who got pregnant and once her kids reached an age where they really needed to have a bond with her, she abandoned them to be raised by their father. She then continues on her selfish path of making and breaking promises to her children and forgetting holidays like some deadbeat dad. I am sure much of Anson's sociopathic personality traits were inherited from her. I don't think Carlton Stowers glosses over anything he feels he might have done wrong and I think he is too hard on himself. Criminals are not simply formed from negative childhood experiences. This book was gripping and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreplacable","review":"Awesome. For doing work on your own car, nothing beats the manufacturer's Service Manual.

While I actually recommend picking up their album \\"It Was All A Dream\\" if you like that song, this single has a little something different, a remix from HQ2 -- Hex Hector and Mac Quayle! Hex & Mac turn the catchy pop tune into a hot and steamy club anthem. That's really all that needs to be said. It's one of my favorite mixes from the duo, and that's saying something considering the great mixes they've created over the years. Also included on this single is the album version, an additional (inferior) club mix, a UK 2-Step dance mix, and a hip-hop flavored remix, which is the same remix tacked onto the end of the album, except this time with an added rent-a-rapper.Overall I recommend this single!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recomended","review":"The book covers two peoples (the persians and greeks)and a period (almost 200 years) where the changes in warfare, not to say in batlle dress, are very extensive.

Loved it's performance, however, we are not impressed regarding its durability after paying about $190 with only a year warranty....After using it sparingly 2-3 times per month, we just tried to seal and vacuum a few items today and a huge electrical spark came out of the left side of the unit, and it was dead--and in the garbage. Talk about planned obsolescence!!!!Cannot afford to buy a new one every year! Would NOT buy another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst FoodSaver Ever","review":"I recently upgraded from the Professional II to the Professional III Plus, and it has been a total disaster. The first one that I received would seal the bag but the lid then would not release. I had to unplug the unit, then plug it back in to release the sealed bag. I returned the machine and was sent a second. This one sealed the bags and released them, but would not vacuum. The motor came on, but no vacuum. I returned it and was sent a third. The bags on this unit sealed, but not even the vacuum motor worked. I am returning this machine tomorrow. I have owned FoodSaver machines for over ten years and never had a problem before. What has happened? Where is the quality control? I am astonished that 3 out of 3 of these Professional III Plus machines were defective. Now what? What can I buy that works?Very frustrated, Bob Glick, Plano, TX"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this a zero if possible","review":"When our old foodsaver died, we decided to go with the professional series since we buy meat in bulk and vacuum pack it. This lasted about a year when the lower gasket started falling apart and the sealer stopped working. When my husband called for a replacement foam gasket from the only company that sells parts for these machines, and he was specific about which one (the bottom gasket), they sent us the gasket for the top. When we called \\"the only parts company that carries foodsaver parts\\", they said they don't make gaskets for the bottom portion only the top. So, in short, if you want an expensive sealer that they don't even carry parts for, go ahead and buy this. Otherwise, go with a less expensive one that can be thrown out or go with another brand altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 5 uses","review":"This is our 2nd Foodsaver.

This record, her first release on Atco, is with a small combo. Barney Kessel's guitar work is excellent. Jack Sheldon's trumpet is very good, too. Red Callender's bass is solid. Ann shows off the \\"sexier\\" side of her voice, and a couple of the songs are very suggestive for 1960. The liner notes, referencing Ann's ill-advised appearance in Playboy magazine, is an indication of what they were trying to sell. They even give her weight and height in the liner notes. The tunes are largely standards. Her performance is competent but not spectacular. The recording is very left-right in almost an annoying way. Tons of reverb on her voice for most of the cuts. A nice curiousity, but far from the really exciting effort of \\"Two Much\\".

If your hard drive crashes, or you upgrade your computer, or something goes wrong with the activation, or even if you upgrade only part of your computer; bam, you need to reactivate. Do it enough, and you won't be able to play the game without calling EA's 1-800 number.Do we really want to live in a world where every time we upgrade our computer, we have to spend hours on hold calling up dozens of different companies to get our software reactivated?

Spore is NOT an operating system, and should not be treated as one. None of this limited number of installs junk - I have multiple computers (3 at the moment), and regularly upgrade all of them.

Completely unknown to me since it's not on the packaging or Amazom review (or any other review I've read), Spore uses SecuROM DRM which limits the number of times I can use the game. Upgrade a PC or change a major component and you'll have to reactivate the game... and you only get three times. Worse yet, SecuROM DRM installs an application on your PC that can not be removed short of reformatting your hard drive.Due to this, I'll be returning my copy before I even open the Amazon box.

PC games are always designed for the next generation of hardware.Spore is a new breed of video game that is designed primarily for consoles.

This is overdone; it's not even properly done, despite the fact that this genre and format of game has been created on a micro-scale (i.e. SimCity compared to space travel \\"Sims\\" in Spore).Do not buy this game - given the fact that EA included DRM and the fact that they ruined a great concept to produce a trash game.

Unfortunately, despite this, I will not buy this game, and I recommend no one else buy it either. Unless EA releases a version of the game without the horrible SecuROM DRM added to it, it will remain unplayed on my computer.I can't help but notice that the game is already available for download on the Pirate Bay, no doubt with all traces of SecuROM removed and thus, offering a purer gaming experience.Please do not buy this game, and maybe the publishers will finally realise that this overly aggressive rights protection scheme only strikes against legitimate customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh C,mon EA. 3 times and you're out?","review":"Friend of mine from work told me about this game so I decided to look into it and was almost getting ready to order when I saw the star rating.

Not much replay value. If you don't like some tedious aspects of real-time strategy games, then this game will have even less replay value.In summary - EA put their miserable stink on Spore: buyer beware.

You are allowed *one* login per cd-key. and once the game has been reinstalled 3 times. you have to call and plead to EA that you arent a criminal.

You get 3 installs. That's it. If you format, get a new PC, crash and have to reload, anything like that, you have 3 \\"activations.\\" After that, too bad you wasted your money. Your $50 goes into EA's pocket and you can't play YOUR GAME YOU BOUGHT. So in theory, when you buy this game, your renting it. That's the bottom line.Bottom line, do yourself a favor and spend your $50 elseware. Buy a Blizzard game. They get things right, and don't screw you over if you want to install it more than 3 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game, HOSED BY DRM.","review":"It's really too bad, it's a fun little game, and it might have been a huge success, but as released, it's going to really screw you over. You can install it THREE TIMES. EVER. NO EXCEPTIONS.Even uninstalling the game doesn't get you back that install.It's a RENTAL. You get to install it THREE TIMES. After that YOU BUY IT AGAIN! BULL!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of hype, and then a big let down..","review":"I'd planned on purchasing this, but not with the DRM. Yeah, some folks will say you're crazy, pony up and don't worry about it. But this game looked like it had legs and would stick around on a machine for a while. DRM never works in the long run. A laptop upgrade, or machine upgrade or reinstal, and you're SOL.Yes, you can call the company. But who really wants to spend a hour or two on the phone when you may or may not be successful for a game they may or may not support in the future. Games are supposed to be about fun. This is about creating obstacles. There are plenty of other things than can have my fifty bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first review of something I have not played or watched!","review":"I will not participate in consumerism of items that punish the innocent more than the guilty. Pirates are finding ways to download and play this game without DRM as we speak, while the honest are feeling the draconian DRM measures and suffering the consequences.I truly believe that if a high quality game release trusted the honest consumers enough to leave off DRM and its ilk, and just post a statement about game designers and how important it is for the future of game development for them to be reimbursed fairly for their efforts, more people would buy the game.Now, one of three things happen. One, we just don't buy the game. Two, we buy the game and experience frustration. Three, even the innocent will feel the temptation of piracy, thus increasing the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not a thief","review":"I've been waiting for this game for years and then they foul it with a hot steaming pile of DRM.If the morons at EA had a clue, they'd notice that the pirates have already cracked their customer punishment scheme and posted on dozens of torrent trackers.Nope, instead they elected to punish people like me who purchased the game and are happy to support game designers that don't churn out the same mind numbing garbage over and over again and call it a new game because they've altered the chrome or added the words 20xx to the box cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"$50 for what is essentially a long term rental thanks to \\"Piracy protection\\".Some might find that excusable but it gets much worse after that. It loads spyware onto your computer to snoop on you and it permanently takes up active memory as spyware does. But worse, the first three parts of the game are rather brief and can be gotten through in about a half hour each. This leaves the game being basically a very bad space strategy game. Do yourself a favor and get some cute Chibi anime flick and play Galactic Civizilations 2 rather than wasting your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software engineer - what gives you the right?","review":"I'm a software engineer by profession, and I have no choice to upgrade and reformat my computer several times a year, which means I'd hit my 3x install count in a few months easy.I'm curious what makes companies think they have the right to limit software installs. EULA? Fine. But from the looks of the review count this one is getting, I can only imagine they are losing a whole helluva lot more revenue from legitimate purchasers than the whole of the pirates out there.I do have a question for EA though - when your game disc becomes a coaster, are you going to limit the number of drinks the buyer can set on it before disabling that feature as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy, crashes, no autosave, boring repetitive gameplay","review":"So far, not impressed. Gameplay is very repetitive, I don't think it will be very replayable. I've also run into a game-stopping crash - I am unable to establish trade routes with other cities without the game crashing to desktop. This makes it impossible to advance. Some people have reported that the DRM (SecuRom) is causing this, but we'll see.I wouldn't buy this game now - wait for a patch or two, and see if the game becomes playable. Even then, with the boring gameplay, I'd wait to see it in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some-other-game Lite","review":"Spore is a collection of dumbed-down ideas poorly implemented with a very good Lego-like constructors.Stage 1: Flow copyStage 2: Can't really pinpoint another game hereStage 3: Age of Empires LiteStage 4: Civilization LiteStage 5: Galactic Civilizations LiteWhile it doesn't sound that bad the main problem is that each sub-stage is extremely dull and repetitive. You basically have to do the same action n times where n is the number of enemies.Rewards for such actions include parts for you creatures which have minimum impact on the creature's behavior. You can create limbless, eye-less slug with a horn located inside his body and he has the same chance of obliterating all enemies as a zergling. The pinnacle is of course the spaceship where parts have absolutely NO impact on the performance.Better keep away from this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is part of the overall experience","review":"this type of DRM is a showstopper for me - physically and philosophically.the only people inconvenienced by this harsh DRM is paying customers - the people it is meant to stop just go around it quite easily. so EA and Spore creator Will Wright consider all potential Spore consumers thieves until proven innocent.I *might* consider buying the game (I do like Will Wright despite this horrible decision and maybe even EA forced him) but if I do, I will use the crack to circumvent securom - making me a thief even though I paid for it fair and square! please someone explain to me how this makes any sense at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent game let down by DRM","review":"The DRM made me feel dirty buying the game, knowing that i might potentially lose something i rightfully bought just because of several reinstalls. But I wanted the game that badly. I waited for eons for it.And ultimately, it's a good game. Not great. Probably because of the overhype. I played simearth eons ago and this game comes closest to updating on that. Still, it feels like EA was trying to placate gamers from both casual and hardcore ends of the spectrum; and in the end the game feels shallow. It could have been so much more.It's not too late to save the game, maxis. release those expansions and make each phase deeper than what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA is disappointing....","review":"I have been watching this game in the web news for what seems ages... I found it interesting and had every intention of going down and purchasing it. Then one of my pals called me who knew I was going to buy and told me he is stuck with a copy he cannot activate. His calls to EA have gone unanswered and he can't get his money back for an opened product.As someone who reloads his PC twice a year whether it is needed or not... the limited activations are a sale stopper.I was a fan of EA a few years back... now I won't touch most of there products with a 10 foot pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Protection makes game unplayable.","review":"The game is actually quite fun to play, provided you can actually install it and activate it. If your install fails a few times you may have to re-purchase the game as the Terms state that only 3 installs are allowed (no matter if they succeed or fail) and no refunds will be given after those installs are used up. So you'd be much better of waiting to purchase when EA strips the game of it's copy protection down the road. By the way, those pirates got this game before it was released, so they don't have to deal with this like us legit gamers do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joining the party","review":"I havn't actually played the game but I'm just joining the anti-drm party because I wouldn't even consider buying it with this junk on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"EA has intentionally made this game as hard to run as possible, totally unacceptable in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA, are you reading this?","review":"EA, are you listening?I'm guessing not, since you're making your cash despite all the whining here. But for the record, now that I've bought the game, I will be heading off to the Warez sites this evening for the crack.Spore is cool and a lot of fun so far. Putting DRM on it is like finding a band-aid under your steak.Maybe I can put it into language that a bean counter can understand: you are paying a lot of money to the makers of SecuROM for \\"protection\\" that are you are not getting.Why not increase your margins by *not* throwing your money down a sinkhole?...Alternatively, pay me instead.

When the time comes for the crash - and those DO happen in Space Stage, you are likely to loose a lot of your game progress. For this fact, game developers included auto-save in games once the age of floppy-booted games had ended.

We've contacted the customer service and they are absolutely NO help. A huge disappointment.We've also looked everywhere online for tutorials and helps on how to get past the installation part so we can play the game and still no luck. Maybe it would've worked if we bought it brand new back in 2008 when it was first released and not in 2011?** If any Mac user have any luck with getting this brand-new game to install, PLEASE do contact us by commenting on this review and let us know how to get it install.

It only hurts legitimate customers, not pirates. Want to stop piracy? Make your game less money. Instead of charging too much and using the extra revenue for DRM programming algarythms, make less revenue and save your money on anti piracy attempts that only hurt those of us who purchased the game.

Words cannot describe how excited I was by the concept of this game. I've waiting years for its release but now it seems Electronic Arts has dropped the ball, big time.1) They have enforced a heavy-handed implementation of DRM which only allows the game to be installed three times and it must connect to the internet to verify your install.2) The game has been paired down from its original scope in order to milk players into buying multiple expansion packs.The DRM is a real shame because it only serves to inconvenience the honest. It seems that pirates have been enjoying the game without DRM while honest, paying gamers are suffering with the DRM taking over their system. What good is DRM if the game was pirated before it even was available for purchase?Pre-order canceled. This is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even mad about DRM . . .

All I can say is it should have become fun faster. The beginning of the game is so pointless, so slow. I couldn't make it to the rest of the game. It's more like lets play dress up instead of a real game. I don't even think the creature creator is that good. I get so frustrated trying to create the shape I want or the look I want. Overall, I think it is an interesting topic, but better left to the science books. Sorry Will, not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Brother is watching.","review":"Contrary to what the oh-so enlightened reviewer might think.

EA and it's draconian measures to hurt and damage the paying consumer, that's where.Frankly, when I purchase a DVD, I don't expect that it will fail after being played on 3 different DVD players. My music purchased in iTunes still works even though I've migrated my music to over 3 iterations of iPods and countless computers.So I say this to you EA, get off your lazy tukas and create a less restrictive DRM solution. honestly.For the rest of you, buy the game... but write Will and EA a similar nastygram so that a future version of your game doesn't contain built-in planned obsolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Look, even if this game DIDN'T have the securom and install limits which reduce your purchase to a mere rental, the fact is it isn't FUN.

I thought this would be on the verge of an MMO, with other people to interact with and the ability to create planets, and customize terrain, plants, animals, and the weather. Boy, was I wrong. You get 5 skimpy minigames that could have been put into separate flash web based games. Instead you rent them for 50 bucks! Absolutely horrible value, and without a doubt the biggest disappointment I have ever had with any purchase, ever. I plan on throwing it out as soon as I'm done grimacing with disgust at the packaging. EA said one thing and delivered another, and I'll never forget that.

Now I have this game that... I paid, but I don't own.To me it's very simple. If I download the movie, I don't have to sit trough anything annoying... and if I download a crack, simply, I don't have to worry about changing any hardware or machine and losing my game.

How wrong was I.Now, it does not matter how fun a game can be, for the casual gamer, or the adult gamer with little time to spare to play, all the fun factor goes down the drain the moment it takes up to 30 minutes or more just to try to make the damn thing work.And why? simpy because your settings/hardware/connection is not of the liking of this hideous program.This will probably be the last time I buy a game from Electronic Arts.

What was the catch? They were stuffed with DRM. Even though their legitimate customers bought the songs, Yahoo and Microsoft took down their servers for the DRM phone home. The Result? Next time you try and listen to a song from your collection, they will not be able to phone home and they will no longer play.Buying this game says that you will be able to play it for as long as EA wants you to and not a minute longer.There are many examples of better ways to copy protect things so that publishers protect their IP without being obtrusive. Is EA really trying to protect their revenue or are they doing something else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for mac version, no thanks for drm","review":"I love Maxis games, and have purchased quite a few in the far distant past for my various Macs as a kid.

After I heard about this game at least 4 years ago and a video of gameplay that Will Wright had done at a convention, I couldn't wait to purchase this game. Now, EA has lost my $50, plus a couple other million or so because of their decision to install this harsh DRM. It's ridiculous, unnecessary, and it's going to cost them a fortune.When will publishers ever learn, DRM doesn't work! Pirates find work-a-rounds anyway, no matter what you do.

It looks great and you can get some kicks out of creating some crazy creatures but you can get that thrill from the free creature creator demo.

There's no replay value if it cannot be installed as many times as necessary.

How long they'll support it in this manner is anyone's guess. Buyer beware, if you purchase this software while this is still in place, you will not be able to play it indefinately.

Spore is a game that I will want to play 3 years from now, and I own multiple computers. I will NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY it at that time, because of the hard limit on installs. This is not acceptable. My solution was to purchase the game, but not install it. Instead, I downloaded a hacked copy. I should not have to do this, and companies need to realize that it's not worth it.

That software can work in superuser space, meaning it can do whatever it wants on your system. And there is no uninstall for it. In other words, by installing Spore, you install a piggy back Big Brother.Please don't support this product. Great game.

Not bad, but not a earth shattering super cool brand new experience.

I'm passive-aggressive like that -- accuse me of cheating when I haven't cheated, and I no longer have anything to lose.So the ONE game that I ever thought was cool enough in concept to pony-up the money for and try to learn to play, will not be getting any of my filthy American lucre, all because EA preemptively decided that I was a criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.

I tried EVERYTHING I could think of to get it to work, including downloading an updated .dll file that would supposedly make the EA Downloader work properly. Nothing. Then a friend told me to uninstall Alchol 120% (CD Burning & Backup Software). I did and bingo, the game ran fine.This is why I'm not going to buy the game.

Not only that, but this insane copy protection scheme did NOTHING to prevent the game from being cracked before it was even released in this country. In other words, the only people this scheme is punishing are LEGITIMATE BUYERS while the pirates get to play the game hassle free.

The very little customization that has anything to do with game mechanics, is going to funnel all serious gamers into making virtually the same creature, which has zero appeal for the online portion.

Now Spore uses an even more aggressive DRM scheme meaning that the $60 you spent on a game is going to lead to obscene amounts of time with tech support.Many of you will argue that they have to have it to prevent piracy, and you would be entirely wrong. It takes no effort to find a user friendly DRM free, cost free download for the game (or any other software).

Why should I have to call in to 'prove' I purchased the game once I hit their arbitrary max?

I suspect that the game was 'minimized' and a lot of good content was saved for later release as an addon, like 'Galactic Adventures'. It seems that the addons have a lot of things that were hinted at prior to the games original release.Thanks a lot EA!! You turned an awesome vision into 2 weeks of disappointment. If you had just released it all as one game it would have been the greatest game of all time!!

I had forgotten about this game, but I logged on to buy this game for my wife this evening...thank goodness I read the reviews posted on Amazon. The game looks like a fantastic concept and lots of fun creating our own civilization of creatures, BUT the DRM was the deal killer. I am not a fan of a company (EA) installing programs on my computer which I cannot remove and if I do finally get to do it I lose an activation and download of the game (ONLY 3). To me this is extremely messed up that those who pay for the game are the ones who get the shaft in the end. I hope EA reads these reviews and the unhappiness of those who would have bought the game and see the amount of money they have indeed lost by having the DRM as part of the game. I guarantee the amount of money lost by the honest paying individuals is far greater than any amount they would have lost to piracy. Get the DRM out and the money is yours EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by DRM","review":"What the hell, EA? Why would you trash a game that so many people have been eagerly anticipating by forcing them to install a program which is practically spyware? I might have tried this game, but I'm not going to consent to be guilty until proven innocent in order to do so.There is nothing good about Digital Rights Management.

I don't know what exactly their DRM is doing but I'm going to have to reformat the drive and reinstall everything to get back to a stable box now.Thanks EA!

The discussions and reviews here have been very helpful in providing the truth about DRM and SecuROM, something that EA seems to be trying VERY hard to conceal from consumers despite their claims that is a positive addition to the game. How interesting.I hope these reviews help consumers make an INFORMED DECISION on whether they really want to purchase this game or not. Knowing the facts certainly helped me.Count me among your lost sales on this one, EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would EA do this to their users?","review":"I've been eagerly anticipating the release of Spore, only to find out at release that EA is assuming that if I buy the game, I'm a thief. Why would they decide to treat me like this? I was fully intending to pay for the game, and to recommend it to my friends. I'm an honorable person.Perhaps EA misinterpreted the huge anticipating for this game as criminal, rather than fan-based? If so, they read this user wrong. Or perhaps they allowed their marketing team to make the product decisions, rather than the game developers. The former are only interested in making money, rather than making the best user experience possible.In any case, I'm so disappointed that EA would treat me like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Later","review":"I play games on a desktop pc in my office, and on a laptop in the living room.

Don't think it can't happen. Fans of Major League Baseball, customers who purchased Circuit City's DIVX format, people who believed Microsoft's Plays For Sure campaign, and many others have all gotten the short end of the DRM stick before.What is DRM? Basically, DRM is a scheme that is designed to make things more difficult for paying customers in the misguided attempt to fight piracy. Ironically, the people who pirate these sorts of things often take the DRM out, so the pirates often end up with a BETTER product than the paying customers. I'm not suggesting you should pirate the game. There are a lot of entertainment choices out there though. I wouldn't \\"buy\\" this unless you wouldn't mind if it mysteriously stops working one day and you enjoy calling customer support hotlines to prove your innocence (assuming they're still taking your calls).Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to join the vote against Spore","review":"I'm very sorry to join the loud voices against the game and the publisher's decision to use such intense DRM.

I expected more, deeper gameplay. I expected my evolution to matter more. I expected the character, vehicle, and building designs to have a greater impact than simply choosing the fastest legs or biggest guns I could afford.When I got to space, I was almost instantly bored by the tediousness of zooming in, zooming out, clicking, zooming back, only to deliver 1 thing to some alien or annoyingly scan every single species on a planet. I got tired after about 4 pirate raids on my home world pulled me back from being on the edge of boredom while trying to find the one last critter I hadn't scanned yet on some planet for some mission that didn't get me anywhere near enough money to even buy anything fun anyway.Bah.And then there's the sucky DRM... Lame.Sigh. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Spore tries to combine many game types all into one game. The gameplay is too simplistic in the first four stages of creating your creature. All you do is move, eat, attack/charm. Until the space age, the game will be boring for anyone who has played a decent game before. The game also limits game owner's to one account and 3 installs. Other cons: Several big features were cut from Spores like the aquatic stage. Realistic humanoid creatures are not possible, all your creatures look like clones, no genders, no hair/fur, cities are the same shape, and graphics are ugly. Knowing EA, they will add 6+ expansions to Wright's game. Maybe it will be fun after the 5th one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for nothing!","review":"EA - What is wrong with you!??

It would be nice if creature designs mattered more outside of cosmetic appeal as well.1 just for the drm, I can't count how many times I've uninstalled/installed some of my favorite games.Want to play diablo2? load it up and go? Sick of it after a few months? Save the hard drive space. Reformat? There goes an install! New computer? there goes an install! 3 installs is laughable at best. The hassle to get new activation keys in not worth the hassle.I _like_ that I can still fire up my old games now.

But just do some basic research on SecuROM, a DRM strategy developed by Sony, who also brought us a rootkit that incapacitated many peoples' computers, and ask yourself, do you really want to spend $50 to install a game that comes with such malware as SecuROM?

The critical response has been largely good. However, each and every one of those reviewers now has EA sponsored spyware, a glorified virus, that they cannot remove, installed at super user level(In layman's terms, that means the DRM program outranks YOU in your computer hierarchy.). These draconian DRM measures are designed to prevent piracy, but hackers had DRM copies of Spore available on the internet within a day of release. Don't let EA treat you like a criminal.

What I don't get is, that the manufacturer KNOWS that people who want to pirate this are going to and already have - the people who legitimately are going to buy this are the ones getting stuck with the incredibly bad DRM.

Ever since the Battlefield 2142 fiasco I've refused to install any EA products on my computer. Spyware from a \\"trusted source\\" is still spyware. Judging from the sales of Spore, even just from pre-orders, EA won't be changing it's policies any time soon. Big releases like this just further enable them to do whatever they want with minimal financial backlash, despite receiving brutal scathing attacks like these on the internet. Imagine if Spore had been a Valve game, freely downloadable from your Steam account wherever you have a connection, open to actual community modding. Blinded by hype, I was willing to forgive EA this one time, it's not happening again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count another lost sale.

I'll just go buy another Stardock game, where they treat customers like customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated","review":"I'm a long time gamer, and I've been very excited to finally play Spore. I had lost track of the game, and excitedly purchased it last night when I saw it on the counter. Before installing the game at home I noticed all kinds of complaints on the DRM, which limits the game to 3 installs along with unknown backdoor anti-piracy processes. I've been planning on upgrading my desktop (which is very common for PC gamers), and my laptop is in need of a format.Now I'm stuck with a $50 game that I may not be able to play in the future, along with unwanted and unknown processes running on my PC. Why am I wishing I had pirated this game, despite the amazing amount of time and ambition from the developers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy with DRM","review":"I've bought every Sim game there is...SimCity, SimAnt, SimFarm, Sim...you name it.

I'm going to have to really consider buying any EA games anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"purchase EA product and LOSE. DRM FTW!!!","review":"Draconian DRM will make you repurchase or call EA to beg for another activation if you have to reinstall more then 3 times on your computer from your purchased retail disk. This means that if your windows installation needs to be reinstalled for any reason and you reinstall the game you will use one of your 3 reinstallations. After you have installed this game 3 times you will be unable to play the game until you beg EA for another activation. How many more times might you have to reinstall the game in a few years, 4 times 5 times, or more? Will EA give you more activation or will they treat you like a pirate and make it impossible for you to play the game that you paid $50 for? So what this means is that the pirates who download the game will be able to reinstall it as many times as they want forever.

They're going to continue stealing the game -- cracks are a fact of life.It's a shame that they included this feature, considering that I'd anticipated Spore for a long time.

After dealing with the headaches of the three installation only policy for Bioshock and other intrusive policies that SecurRom implements, I vowed never to buy a game with the SecurRom DRM again. Its honestly less of a headache just to pirate games now days then deal with abusive copy protection policies. Instead of buying games from EA which seems to only use SecurRom, buy games from Stardock which ceased using intrusive copy protection. SecurRom punishes legit customers, and encourages piracy. I want to own what I buy, not sign a rental contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM-Laden and underwhelming","review":"I've been waiting to buy this game for the better part of two years. Unfortunately, EA isn't going to give me that option. Instead of treating me like a paying customer, they are assuming that I'll never install this game more than three times. They are wrong. I am not going to trust EA to keep their activation servers up for as long as I might want to play this game.If I was offered a chance to actually *buy* the game, rather than paying $50 to do something much more similar to borrowing it for so long as they see fit, I might be convinced to do so.

However, I've moved away from anything with DRM. I won't even purchase a game anymore if it requires a CD or DVD to be in the drive in order to play, after a bad experience with a company who refused to replace a game disk accidently damaged by my daughter. It is about time people started standing up and refusing to purchase crippled games like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 activations makes this game a rental","review":"The DRM on this game is pathetic.

No. I played it for two days, hit the space level, and lost all interest in the game. It is a poorly developed series of mini-games. You can get rather creative with the appearance of things but that's about it. The first level is a simple eat the little fish avoid the big fish game. The second is find food, kill/befriend tribe. Wash rinse repeat. The civ stage had to be the most boring thing I have played in a long time. You have three vechicles to chose from. No matter what the type, if you send more than 4 at any given target, you win.I am really sorry I wasted my money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be.","review":"This game just does not live up to the hype.

I can't even run the game to give a review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy DRM, False advertisement in game manual","review":"DRM limits you to 3 installs over the lifetime of the product. You do not get credited for another install when you un-install the game. The Game manual also says that you can have multiple users per game but you are only allowed one. If you have several family members that would like you play you either have to pay up for multiple copies or all play under the same user. This is false advertisement but good luck on returning the software and getting your money back. Be aware that Amazon had almost 3 thousand negative reviews of this product before they deleted them. This is very shameful and should not be tolerated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DRM","review":"Game is okay. I would like to play it with my kids, but the terrible DRM makes it impossible to do.

I would be 50 bucks richer to spend on something we ALL can enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore disappoints","review":"Spore is ultimately a big disappointment. Instead of an actual simulacrum of evolution, where physical traits relate directly to surviving a particular environment, Spore is a superficial combination of five distinct game types which have nothing to do with the principles of adaptation and change.

This was hyped as 'Sim Everything', would do for evolution what The Sims did for social games, but the first four stages, while cute, are basically casual games with no depth of play whatsoever. Even a lover of casual games such as I am was expecting more. It seems that the designers spent way to much time on the 'Creators' within the game, and not nearly enough time on gameplay.The Space stage - the final stage and the most open-ended, is really just a version of other trade/piracy/empire building games such as Tradewinds or Port Royale, with only some minor wit. Not nearly enough to keep me amused, and considering other games like it can be had for considerably less, without the totally ridiculous DRM, I would highly recommend that you NOT buy this game.

It's utterly offensive that the online thieves are able to enjoy a better (DRM-free) product than I, a legitimate consumer, can purchase legally.With their excellent sales and non-crippled titles, rival company Stardock Entertainment should be praised as an example of how to make money while satisfying consumers.

However, the current state of Spore's DRM and the gaming industry's clear lack of respect for customers, paying or otherwise, is simply appalling.This is made clear by the fact that it is easier to download and play a pirated copy of almost any game than it is to install it 'legally'. It is disrespectful and detrimental to business to assume that customers are guilty of theft and punish them without any proof.When I saw the demo of spore a week ago at PAX, I was prepared to buy it, then and there.

The pirates don't have to put up with CD checks, online activation, or any other such hassles. Why? They simply remove the DRM features and distribute the game as freely as they like. Any software that punishes legitimate owners while letting the crooks enjoy it unrestricted is utterly worthless.This won't change until we convince game publishers that we won't put up with them treating us all like criminals. The only language they understand is money, so send them a message loud and clear: don't buy games, like Spore, that use DRM schemes that punish legitimate owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPORE ROCKS","review":"Got this game the first day it came out and haven't stopped playing since.

The other complaint is the 3 activation rule for the lifetime of the product, seems a bit excessive.I'd rate the game higher if it wasn't for the installation/activation issues and the on going problems of getting the computer's security software to play nice with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM prevented me from buying Spore...","review":"I was ready to make my purchase today.

Bad move Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh, so that's why it won't install","review":"I wrote a review on Amazon UK's site complaining that I couldn't install the game, but now I see from the other reviews that it's protection system is to blame. It's easier to get dodgy copies of games than to pay for it and install it. These protection systems only affect those who legitimately own a copy of the game, not those who pirate it.I had exactly the same problem with Sid Meyer's Pirates! It was a game I was really excited to see released as I played the old Pirates Gold game. Unfortunately my DVD drive spins too fast for it to run it's error checking thing with the copy protection on the disc which meant it always failed an install. I had to download software which would actually slow the drive down during install.These protection systems are more than useless, they damage the games industry and annoy people who pay for the games.

Sadly, Spore spreads itself so thin over these multiple styles that it loses all depth. The first hours are agonizingly boring. The user is forced to spend an excruciating amount of time performing simple, boring tasks repetatively while supposedly building towards a complex civilization. Finally reaching this point is anti-climactic and hardly worth the trouble.If that wasn't enough of a slap in the face, EA has decided to penalize legitimate users with ridiculous DRM.

Would the DRM in the update ruin the existing game or not? about half the time it did. Once in a while it even borked the OS. Countless hours re-installing and starting these games over was a nightmare. Now Spore, with even more draconian DRM.It is well past time to start treating your game users as customers!!

Stay far away from this game unless you enjoy wasting countless hours diagnosing and fixing game and operating system problems caused by DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Install Limit Unacceptable","review":"You just can't commit money to something that only lets you reinstall 3 times.

I too hate the DRM on the product. But that's not the reason for the low rating. I have two main issues with the game, first one being technical - the installer has consistently failed to set the game up properly. It does not create the Spore icon, I've had issues after a 'successful' installation where it does not run for some users on the system, etc. Really poor execution on that part. In terms of gameplay, I find that there are too many things which are not explained or shown properly in tutorials, and you find yourself wondering what you are exactly supposed to be considering while playing.

Spore is no different. After eventually backing out of FORCING US TO REREGISTER EVERY 10 DAYS (think about that) they still continue to treat PC gamers like thieves, not warning about installing malware (SecuRom) and going to a rent-your-game model.

I was worried that I would need to upgrade my computer in order to play it, but was pleasantly suprised to discover it has very forgiving minimal requirements. As such, I figured that I would purchase the game now, then upgrade my computer and bask in its wonders.Now, however, I discover that the DRM will only allow for 3 installs and creates hidden folders like malware. As I'm planning on upgrading, this would leave me 1 install for a future date. Even if EA were to increase the amount of installs, I can easily see myself surpassing ten installs if I upgrade in a piecemeal fashion.Additionally, I am saddened to discover that for all the promise of creative content creation, from creatures to clothes to crafts, it all amounts to completely cosmetic changes.DRM and shallow gameplay? I'll pass. If I were EA and Maxis, I'd start taking a hard look at Sims 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, but no thanks","review":"I was interested in this game the moment I heard about it.

I love how seamless the game meshes with the online aspect. It makes sharing creatures and puttting them on the web almost effortless. My only criticism is I wish the game play was deeper on every level except the last level.

But the showstopper is the 3-install limit. Think 3-installs/validations is plenty?1) you install the game on windows xp2) you upgrade to vista3) you upgrade your video card4) you upgrade when the new vista service pack comes out.BAM, 4 validations right there. Now you are on the phone praying for EA's mercy. Except they've already proven that they hate their own customers by having this system in first place.And the pirates?

I'm very disappointed in how it ended up.The game itself deserves 3 stars, but because of the draconian and user-hostile DRM it's bundled with, it deserves nothing more than 1 star.

The worst thing is that they never told anyone this was the case, and the game's user manual says you CAN have more than one account, but they changed their minds. On top of that, you can only install the game three times before it stops working. If you like to reinstall Windows now and then, then Spore will only work three times.

Games are cracked *before* release, so that is not something you can avoid. Stop screwing your customers under the guise of protecting your copyrights and you'll get my cash.

The game was overhyped, and with the amount of effort that EA Games put into it, it was a waste of their time. It wasn't what they claimed it to be.

Even if I only kept it on my desktop, I upgrade every other month, and format my harddrive every so often. This is a huge setback for me and no way I would buy a game that simply allows me 3 activations. How about they just sell the games in activations? EA is so lame sometimes!As for gameplay it is utterly horrible. I tried out the creature creator, and well I was hoping to play the game to get more of an insight, but then I read about how the mechanics work, simply they really missed on this game.

Limited installs, online activation and drm that is incompatible with many normal programs you may already have installed on your PC.It's such a shame that the distributor of the game treats its own customers as criminals and attempts to do their best to prevent you from actually playing the game.Not recommended unless you really want to play the game and have the help of someone very techie to help you get past the inevitable problems created by the copy protection mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore","review":"The game Spore brings oversimplification of good ideas to the table for the price of a modern work of art. 8 hours into the game and the audience has done nothing except click the left mouse button, or for the adventurous, dared to tilt the camera ever so slightly to get a look at some creature out of Dr. Seuss's imagination hiding beneath a tree.While procedural content generation is certainly an admirable development concept to bring to the table, it would seem that Maxis has a lot to learn about developing fun and thought provoking games, and EA has as much, if not more, to learn about advertising and the consequences of placing copyright protection above customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore promises a lot, but it gets boring rather quick","review":"The DRM issues aside, Spore is a fun game....for the first hour.After you have gotten through all there is to go through in one world the game gets rather repetitive. The choices aren't near as in depth as one would hope them to be either. The only real customizable thing in the game is the creatures, buildings, and vehicles. Actual game play is always the same...befriend or destroy other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Maxis Game Ever","review":"Even ignoring all the DRM issues, Spore is not a good game. Why? It simply isn't fun. All the customization options are basically cosmetic only. There is no thought needed to play; it's mindless in the worst sense of the term. It's a real shame, because the concept--of evolution--had great potential, but that potential has been lost. I don't recall ever being this disappointed by a game from Maxis or its remnants before. This is the most disappointing game since MOO3, and even that was patched to more fun than this drek."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAY NO TO DRM","review":"EA has pushed it too far with their DRM on this game, you never own this game its as if you are just renting it from them.I was really excited about this product, but refuse to buy it with their DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"The game is boring.","review":"Even if you don't care about or don't understand the awful DRM issues, there's one more thing you should know:This game is rather boring.It plays like a dumbed-down version of several other games all strung together.The game does look fantastic for it's graphics. The concept of playing in a universe populated by creations of other people playing the game is certainly unique, and what made me interested in the first place. All the different creature-creation tools are fun to play with. However, all these mean nothing if the game itself is dull.

Yup - main PC crashes - twice and could not reinstall Spore until I called \\"home\\". Now I hear that no further installs are possible. Hmmm ... good policy this.Gameplay - from sea to space is boring as heck after the first time round - only the space element is playable more than once. Even then, I struggle to see why this has obtained rave reviews; different playing strategies seem to result in little different outcomes.

It was fun... To a point...","review":"Ok, I'll start out saying that I didn't know about the DRM until after I'd even played the game. It bugs me, but I'll live with it.The game play itself is fun to a point. The first time through it's really cool learning all the different nuances to the different stages of evolution (my favorite being the creature stage). Play it again and you'll feel like an old hand at a decent game. The next time through... not so much. The lack of options (in a game hyped for unlimited options) is a real replay killer. That's how it goes for me. Every time I try it out, I find that it's lacking a great deal. The tribal and civilization games feel like they were thrown together too fast, or with an expensive expansion in mind.I'd say the game is alright, but it lacks replay-ability and has some horrible software consequences for the buyer.I suggest waiting for the price to drop, a new version, or buying at your own risk/annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game - Stupid DRM","review":"I almost never post reviews of my purchases, but felt obligated to support the general outcry against the DRM implementation associated with this game.Summary: Great game 4+ Stars - Stupid DRM -3 stars = 1 starI thing the game is terrific and have been having a blast. Moreover, I think it has huge potential. Sadly, the decision to use a form of DRM that limits the number of installations is unacceptable. I am a software developer and hardware junkie. I break, rebuild, and/or modify my machine on a monthly basis. To avoid (hopefully) DRM issues, I decided to install spore on an external drive in hopes of limiting the impact of my system tinkering. Still - stupid that I would need to go to such measures just so I can be sure to still have the game I paid $[...] for 3 rebuilds from now...If I do end up getting locked out and my game deactivated, I will likely grab a hacked copy which are everywhere. Sad since this was a game that I happily paid for and was eager to support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This game falls far short of expectations. The best part of the game is the creature creator, which you can download for free. The game is split into 5 stages. The first 4 stages are fun, but don't offer much challenge, don't take very long to complete, and don't offer much replayablility. The final stage (the spage stage) is obnoxious through and through. The final stage is very frustrating, and when its not frustrating, its repetitive and boring.I believed the hype. When the creator of The Sims says that they are coming out with a revolutionary Sim everything game, I believe it, but sadly it is not so. Compared to The Sims, this game doesn't rate well at all. I only wish their was a way to get my money back.I, personally, don't have an issue with the DRM. But I do have an issue with how this game was marketed. I feel duped and I wont be buying any EA titles or Will Wright games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the DRM protests -- I have a real problem to warn you about.","review":"First of all, let me start by saying this is a great, *great* game. Very fun and highly addictive. The game itself is everything you probably hoped it would be.Here's the warning, though: it better work right out of the box for you. Because if there's any technical problem or you can't connect to the vast online community through the game, you're screwed. EA's Technical Support team -- if you could call them that -- finally got back to me with a request for more information AFTER EIGHT DAYS!!!!!! At this point I may be able to start using online-created characters sometime in 2012.So if you want the game, buy it. If it works 100% for you out of the box, have a ball. If it doesn't, return the game *immediately* and save yourself the grief of having to work with EA to fix any issues.

Now it plays nothing.So EA gets the ultimate DRM. I don't have the game and need 0 activations.

Spores is NOT an MMO, it does have an online content aspect, but there is no interaction between players and no competition between players, so it is a single player game just with 'on the fly' content download.If multiple players are not allowed to play the game, it should state it clearly on the box so it is not purchased.

It's like a 10 year old made the game and then the EA staff put flashy graphics on it.

Their plot to prevent piracy backfired and now people are trying even harder to get it pirated and hacked to make themselves heroes to to those evil video game downloaders. Now that I see it, I should focus my attention in getting some other computer game or wait until EA gets smart and removes the DRM that's causing so many problems.

I even enjoy the game play in Spore, but...The extent to which the Digital Rights Management (DRM) was implemented make this the WORST GAME I have ever played.The game requires you to re-authenticate it EVERY ten days. That's bad enough, but they also decided to further cripple the game by allowing it to only be authenticated on up to three installations. That means that, should your computer crash or have the OS re-installed, you can only re-install it one last time.

It just isn't worth it.I did download the trial creature creator, and while I did enjoy playing with it, I got the impression that the final product has been watered down from the original vision.

For me, at least, it has turned out to be a huge letdown. Although the absolutely rediculous DRM restrictions are appalling, that is not why I'm rating it so low. The Mac Cider of this port is so horrible that I'm unable to play the game for more than 5 minutes on my Mac Pro without an unrecoverable system crash, and even when it does run the performance is unacceptable.Performance aside, the gameplay is not very engrossing and so simplified that I have trouble understanding how the game took so long to complete. The first three stages especially are unbelievably shallow. Each tries to embody a different genre of game, and each represents a very poor example of that genre.Maybe the game was overhyped, and was bound to be disappointing.

I was ready to run out and buy it on the day of release, until I found out about the DRM.

Also, what's up with renting the game? As soon as it's no longer profitable for EA to maintain license servers, it's their obligation to shareholders to shut them down. From that time forth, noone will ever be able to reinstall Spore legally.

And now their draconian DRM practices have been elevated to Orwellian levels with Spore. (that's a pity too.)I fully understand that game pirating is a big issue. But an online game can be controlled far easier than a standalone one. I mean, come on, Blizzard doesn't bury WoW with DRM. I have it installed on 3 computers and can only play on one at a time. DOH! Wow! I wonder how Blizzard achieves that?!I have no issues with the sign on, or even activation (but they should do away it,) but limit to 3 installs? Get lost EA.

Right before it came out, my expectations dropped a little. And that seems fair. The game is interesting, and fun, but it gets somewhat repetitive. The editors are good, but its too bad that only the stats of the creature really matter, and not the aesthetics. Its a fun game overall, but not that deep. I can see how it would be a great introduction to gaming though, for people that aren't gamers.I am worried about the DRM though. It seems more restrictive than it needs to be. Installing it only 3 times reduces its longevity, and means I won't likely be able to pick it up in a few years and install it on whatever computer I have then. I would give it another star if it didn't have this. I very much thought about not buying it.

That is ridiculous...especially since anyone can download a crack to get around it. The DRM does nothing...NOT A SINGLE THING...to hurt ANY form of piracy (including friends sharing the game, since it's so easy to get a crack for it). The only purpose is to hurt customers who play by the rules...treating them as if they were criminals. I am so glad this kind of anti-DRM push is finally going on.

My guess is they will release expansions for us to buy to flesh out those other areas.If you are a designer and have good imagination, you will love this game, otherwise, play at a friends house.The game is also filled with bugs. Installations, DRM, random crashes, Spore has them all. If this were released on a console it would have been laughed out of the market, but since its PC they seem to think its ok to release a game that is 80% or less.

Technologically, Spore is an amazing feat of programming, and it was made in such a way that content patches and expansions can be made relatively easily. The game isn't 100% perfect right now, but because Maxis made it so that they can put in the content that got put aside during production, it deserves a full score.

The game is tied to one login, and one login only. That's simply not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM Stopped the show","review":"I would have purchased this game, but after reading reviews and past bad experiences with DRM/EA I will be avoiding it. I would suggest that anyone else do the same. DRM methods like the one used here are wrong and the only way we can tell the companies this is with our dollars.In the past, my copies of EA games \\"Expired\\", meaning they were too cheap to keep the servers running or allow 3rd parties to run servers. In EA's line of thinking, we should only play our copy of the game until the next version comes out that costs more money.Again, no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draconian DRM, NO THANKS!","review":"I'm a video game collector. If I had limited activations on my favorite games I've had for years such as Fallout 1&1, Planescape Torment, or Baldur's Gate just to name a few, my collection would be useless 5 times over by now.

Hopefully a patch will be made available to remove this activation limit or increase it. I do like the fact that the CD isn't required to play, but Stardock also has this feature without using any copy protection whatsoever. My Sins of a Solar Empire requires a simple one-time activation with the provided CD-Key to receive updates and patches, otherwise it's still playable. This is the way companies should release their games. Stardock FTW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore does not want to be bought","review":"I believe the game was cracked and available for piracy a week before it was released in stores.

And a game that was originally titled \\"Sim Everything?\\" There was no way it could be bad. Until I tried to install it.Simply put, trying to install it on my PC (a normal Dell laptop) was a nightmare...I spent hours wrestling with it, calling tech support, and trying to figure out why I couldn't just install a game I had purchased on whatever machine I wanted to. (EA said something about licensing, but I have no idea what they were talking about.)Anyway, long story short, I never got it to work, and now I'm out $50 and several hours of my life.

I regularly install/uninstall software, games, and demos on my PC for various reasons. But shame on me if I want to uninstall Spore as a legitimate, paying, game owner. After 3 activations, you have to contact EA's abysmal customer service and plead for a new activation code to use the product you paid for honestly.

Bet you can't wait to fork over some more cash for the expansions now right? Don't you want the game to be fun? Pay up!A true revolution in gaming here folks, just not the kind they'd hoped for..The drm is the thing to be most concerned about, the endless buy new content to make it 'funner' scenario is secondary..Put out a complete game that people get to own and you will prosper.

For example, you can add as many legs to a creature as you want, but the multi-legged creature won't be any faster than a single-legged one with higher leg stats.

DRM isn't something that does anything to protect a product, it only causes honest paying customers problems while those who pirate the game play without the headaches and confines of PAYING customers.I can understand protecting your investment but using user registration and requiring accounts associated with cd key should be sufficient. They're more interested in making sure that both of your teenage kids have their own registered license and have given up on those who pay nothing for the product and use cracks.It's a shame that EA has chosen to shackle a promising game with draconian DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Even Get It To Install","review":"I've just spent the last 45 minutes using LogMeIn remote Control of my home computer from my office computer because my kids couldn't get the install of Spore to work.

Because the DRM is REALLY that bad! I thought we were in a day in age as to when you spend your HARD EARNED money on something it is actually yours?

I can understand such a DRM for software like photoshop, something that has a value (depending upon what exactly you buy) of upwards of $1000. Spore? $50. Is it worth alienating your most loyal customers?For an extra buck, you bet!I purchased this game. But I'm sharing it, and hell if I want to buy another copy just so I can play it on two different computers, neither of us playing all that extensively.EA!

But I believe the recent notice by EA that they were adding SecuROM to the MAC games that are ported over from PC includes Spore. Even if not, it seems like it will be polluting my OS with its who-knows-how-bad background activities for any future EA games.

It's quirky, cute, and the audio and visuals are beautiful, but the underlying game dynamics aren't all that interesting.The final stage seems fun until you realize that all the missions are the same type of thing (fly to a planet, zap yellow glowing creatures, find some artifact, abduct some lifeforms, kill some pirates, and that's about it).

My Windows partition exists to run Acrobat professional and 3D CAD programs. I formatted just before I installed this game, so I made the mistake of installing it first. Afterwards, none of my expensive and necessary professional software would install. I have since installed the game on Linux in wine, but it lacks online play now and I have to format my Windows partition again and scrub the remnants of SecuROM from the boot sectors.

Playing through on herbivore takes a significantly long time to accomplish the same tasks.Too Easy: There is no challenge to Spore at all. First, there is no death penalty. Second, each stage could be passed in as little as an hour. Third, there are no surprises.DRM: DRM bad. This kind of DRM is inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention!!","review":"Do not listen to other reviews! This game is very fun despite what anyone says. It has the greatest custimizing system out there. You do very fun arcade like gamplay in cell stage as a fish like creature. In creature stage you are in a 3D world inhabbited by built in creaturs and creatures made by other players. After you custimize your creature for the last time, you move on to tribal stage. Tribal stage is real time strategy where you control all of your creatures. Then you go to civilization phase where it's still real time stratedgy exept you command vehicles and fight your own creature since you divided up into cities. Last, you control a spaceship with a bunch of tools and weapons. You now go from planet to planet capturing and obducting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating it 5 just to annoy the hysterical anti-DRMers","review":"It's probable that the same people who are posting hysterical nonsense about Spore's DRM system (if you need to install the game more than 5 times in a row, then you need to fix your PC, not complain on a forum) are the same who lament the consolization and dumbing-down of games.

I have been following websites dedicated to bringing the masses information regarding its release, previews, et cetera for a while. I bought the Creature Creator when it was first released and have a small bestiary of my own. I had high hopes.That said, DRM is the reason why I have yet to legitimately purchase this game. I was lucky enough to get the leaked version which neither requires a disk in the drive nor has limited online activations.

But to be told that I can't even play the game that I purchased after a crash or an update of OS is down right thievery! So just like Mass Effect I will pass on this product once again published by EA, the DRM which limits you to 3 activations is the sole reason I will not be buying the game.

Of course, this wont stop it from selling out the wazoo like all Sims games, and it wont stop EA from trumpeting all of the extra copies that people are going to be inevitably buying just so they can play the game they already bought.Either way, this game will be joining Mass Effect and Bioshock on my \\"do not purchase\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta agree...","review":"I would have considered buying this, but after all the hype I've learned it's just not worth it.

Disappointing. It's so simple and mindless. You spend the first three stages eating other creatures. That's it. You run around and eat, then mate. And you repeat that over and over. Everything after that is just an uninspired, dull, uninvolved real time strategy game that even a strategy game from 10 years ago would've more depth and creativity.Don't get the game.

Not really as fun as I thought it would be.","review":"From the early reviews and game trailers, I was hopeful for this game. What I got was a really dumbed down strategy game. What I was hoping for was managing the evolution of your spore to facilitate overall success. However, the building of your spore only accounts for the very first stages of the game. After that, your evolution doesn't really impact the later stages. This game is very easy and simplistic. In my opinion, there are better options out there such as Civilization.If you really enjoy model editing and an extremely easy strategy game, then this game is for you.

The people who do buy the game will be turned off from future purchases \\"protected\\" by Securom.I admit that I was hyped for Spore before I learned about Securom.

I hate this crap. I'll have to look for a hack for the game that I legally purchased. Screw you EA for making my life more difficult when I want to play your games.I hope everyone gives this game a bad review. Let's send grass root opinions to these executives.

It's ironic that when I spent money buying command and conquer 3 that it didn't work for months until SIX patches had been released, the final one finally letting me play.As a result I swore never to purchase another EA title, and it looks like I made the right choice. If anything, such crappy DRM is going to stop people buying future EA games and just pirating them, since hey, they have to pirate them anyway for them to even work.This game is a waste of money because it won't even install properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and tired of DRM hurting paying public","review":"Why would EA think limiting me to only three installs on a game that I bought and own is a good idea? I'm glad I waited for consumer ratings before buying the game. Like always DRM is hurting the people who have bought the game legally. The pirates will have a perfectly working game and we will not. Wake up EA, learn from the music industry. I want to pay you for a fully functioning product that works for as long as I want it to work. You can't pretend to sell me something that you are really renting to me and hope I don't notice. I am not stupid!If you want to rent to game to me set it's price at $9.99 and call it a rental.

Come on EA, you can fix this with a patch and get your reputation back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Installs VIRUS in background, BEWARE!","review":"The DRM for the game utilizes securom which is essentially a virus that installs itself without warning when you install the game. There is no way to completely remove it without reformatting and it is constantly running in the background if not removed. Sucking up computer resources.It also is overpriced. This is actually a RENTAL, not a bought game because it only lets you install 3 times. If you install over 3 times then you must call EA customer support and beg them to let you play the game you bought. Did I mention the call is not free? If you live outside the U.S. it will be a very expensive call.DO NOT BUY THIS, and if you do buy it keep in mind that you are renting it. Not buying it. Whats really ironic about this is the DRM hasn't even stopped the pirates as it was pirated a few weeks ago. And the pirated version doesn't have Securom or install limits which makes it a better version. EA shouldn't treat its consumers like trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not purchase","review":"I've been eagerly anticipating this game, however I will not buy it due to the DRM and allowing only 3 installs.

Built a machine that could run it (for reasons other than running it). Played the Creature Creator demo, and was shocked by the fact that even the demo tried to infect my system with SecuROM.At least the demo didn't have limited activations.Three? No thanks. This is supposed to be for casual gamers, which I guess is what I am these days. Normally I install a game, play for a week, and uninstall it afterward, usually leaving my save files in case I decide to come back to it a few months later.

But since the DRM doesn't appear to like my CD-ROM drive, I can't even get the game on my computer.And with the knowledge that I'm really just borrowing the game from EA, the DRM situation is just going from bad to worse.Really, when will companies realize that draconian copy protection schemes just keep people from being able to enjoy your game who bought it, and keep people who haven't bought your game from buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game gave my PC cancer","review":"There I was, all excited to play this game after waiting years, then suddenly after installing this game, my pc has been diagnosed with cancer. It's terminally ill now. I can't remove the cancer that this game infected it with because the fine print says I legally have to let it kill my machine. It's really sad. I can't play this game, and now I can't use my computer for much longer before it dies. I wish I had never picked up the filthy habit of purchasing games with DRM on them. If I had only read the warning on the side of the box and believed it. I used to think it would never happen to me, I would never be the person suffering from DRM cancer. Now here I am with computer expenses coming at me left and right as I try to keep my machine alive and running, but why? Why do I do this.

Seems my fears weren't unfounded, because Securom is on the disc. This means I will be passing on this game. I cannot support a product with Securom on it. There are other ways to secure your product without inconveniencing your customers and treating them like criminals.Just look at Stardock for a successful example.I will never, ever purchase a product with Securom or any other draconian DRM framework included.

Listen, those who pirate this game are downloading it through bit-torrent. Those of us who would purchase the game deserve fair use! Heavy DRM with consumer hostile enforcement is not the answer. EA needs to support its paying customers, treating them with fair use, and we'll in turn support EA in sales. Until the DRM is fair, I'll keep my score at a 1 Star reflecting how desperately EA needs to remove DRM from this would-be fun game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Awful end product. The game itself allows for quite a bit of customization, but in a very limited way. The creature creator and first two stages are great, but from that point on the customization grows very dull. Incredible programming and great concept, but poorly pulled off. The gameplay is very shallow (basic, 2 dimensional) and quickly grows boring. I couldn't even play through the entire game once before sticking it on a shelf and forgetting it existed, I doubt I'll ever play it again either. My disappointment may be due to the large amount of hype before it's release, but the game truly did seem very dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why EA, why?","review":"Spore was suppose to be the most anticipated game in 5 year.

After almost 2 years of waiting I feel more work could have been put into the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat concept, but....","review":"To keep this short and sweet:Spore boils down to a cool idea that was poorly executed. The creature creator is pretty fun, and one can spend a fair amount of time on it. However, the overall gameplay feels shallow and repetitive -- the space exploration part of the game feels particularly lacking in this regard.Also, I absolutely despise SecuROM and all other invasive/draconian copy protection schemes. I was *not* happy to realize it had been installed on my computer (didn't find out about that until after the fact). If I'd known the game included SecuROM, I never would've purchased it in the first place.The game experience itself is marginally okay, but the SecuROM issue really drags it down for me. Spore isn't terrible, but it's definitely not all it could've been. Yet another tragic case of where the game developer's reach exceeded their grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"TPB has this game DRM free","review":"DRM is unacceptable on this game, I have more than 3 computers. Why pay for this lackluster game if you're going to be treated like a criminal from square 1. Pirate Bay has a copy for FREE where you can play no matter when or where, computers die, formats are necessary... 3 installs? give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM ruins it.","review":"You aren't buying a game. You're buying a license. One that they can pretty much revoke at any time for any reason. I have games that are 14+ years old that I still play fairly often. Unless someone hacks it, this game won't be playable in 12 years. I'd be surprised if they keep the registration servers running for 5 even. You _must_ register it online (so without an internet connection the game won't run at all), and you can only register it three times. If your computer crashes, if you get a new computer, if you simply get bored with it and uninstall - there goes a registration. So, because you just have bad luck with computers or don't have enough hard drive space to have just sitting there, EA assumes you're trying to 'steal' their game.I was thinking about checking this game out, because it seems like an interesting concept. But from what I hear, it's not that great anyways, and there's no way I'm giving my money to a company that assumes I'm a thief."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing game but one star because of the drm.","review":"Great game really, but once you pay for the game do you truly own it?The answer is no.

That includes limited install numbers (even if un-installing incremented the number, I can't be certain I'll remember to do that).I want to play it, and then my wife will want to play it, and I plan to reinstall my PC in the next month or so. There's my 3 installs right there.I'm not calling EA to beg to play a game I paid for.

It was all fine and well until my hubby decided he wanted to open a profile too. Then we realized we CAN'T. Well, we can if we want to spit out $50 more dollars for another game. I don't know about you guys, but in this economy, I could barely justify buying the first one. Way to kick down the little guy. The game as a whole is pretty cool. But the ethics of the company suck. Apparently, there is no such thing as a valued customer anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a while boring :(","review":"Well DRM is an issue. But the games playability is a lot more important.

Any PC gamer is constantly updating their system and using multiple logins for family members to protect against viruses and spyware. Now EA wants to punish their consumers and force them to install the virus which is called DRM. It's a shame innovation in the gaming industry is crippled with such poor business decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Support Draconian DRM Protection That Victimizes Customers","review":"I was among the many who were excited about this game.

DRM, dont really need to say more on that2. Basically a bunch of mini games based on really popular genres.None of the mini-games come close to any real games from the genres3. Although you can make your characters look different, you can easilymaximize every ability there is. The only way you can make your character \\"evolve\\" differently is by making him weaker.4. Your earlier actions in general dont have that much say what happens in the future. You in general get fit in 1 of 3 categories for each stage of the game.5. If you play a pacifist nation in the tribal stage, you evolve into a \\"religious\\" civilization (1 of 3 possilibilities), I find this personally very insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is a No-Go","review":"After all this anticipation, EA has singlehandedly dropped my interest in this game to nothing.

What makes it greater than the sum of it's parts is the sense of persistence. Your late-game, star-faring race can be traced all the way back to it's single-cell original creature and the choices you make all affect the final outcome. In addition the graphics and design are flawless and incredibly flexible, allowing millions of different creatures, flora, buildings and vehicles that make a seamless whole. A brilliant example of mixing of different genres and production value.Too bad the DRM turns it all to mud when after having used your 3 activations you must wait weeks for EA support to *maybe* let you play your game again. I would recommend using you money on a game without this critical limitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tech specs too high with too much DRM","review":"I'm disappointed that at game in development for ten years won't run on my one year old laptop.

This game went from one of the titles I anticipated most on PC to a title that I'm avoiding altogether. Why? Digital Rights Management aka DRM. Specifically the type of DRM that Electronic Arts has decided to include with this game.The DRM known as SecuROM will only punish actual customers by enforcing a totalitarian online verification. Why? Because this so called anti-piracy DRM was already 'cracked' days before the game even hit store shelves. Proof positive that enforcing this type of rigid DRM only affects legitimate customers.In addition to verifying your copy of the game every time you take it online you'll also be limited to 3 installs. That's 3 installations over the entire life of the game. Anything over that and you'll be on the phone calling EA begging for a new code. Thanks but no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's too bad.","review":"Well, you've all convinced me. It's a real shame. I was looking forward to this one. Who doesn't love SimCity and the Sims? But to bundle it with a virus-like DRM suite... ouch. Feels like I'm persecuted for doing nothing wrong. I'd rather wait and see if this little Amazon revolution helps convince the distributors that DRM's not the answer. I honestly was *THIS CLOSE* to buying this from the EA online store Sunday night... Glad I haven't yet. The problem is, your average joe consumer probably doesn't know what DRM is until it screws up their computer, so this game, thanks to its gratuitous marketing, will make a mint.

So wave good bye to my $50 EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is useless","review":"DRM is a useless annoyance for legitimate users of games. To be frank, it's like gun control. All gun control does is make it harder for people who want to buy and register guns legally. A criminal will buy a gun on the street from another criminal, completely bypassing the legal routes. DRM is same exact way. I don't pirate software, but I refuse to buy a game that installs spyware and other trojan-like software on my computer. Additionally, limiting the amount of times a game can be installed is stupid. Does anyone really think this will prevent piracy? The game was released yesterday. I guarantee that in less than a week, there will be a cracked version of the game on the net that people will be playing. I'm not buying this game until EA recognizes this and removes their DRM scheme.

Some of the parts of the game that I get to play from time to timeare amazing (I love the cut-scenes using the changing characteristics of my unique characters/tribesmen)However, the enjoyment of the early levels of the game is completely offset by the boring money management of the space exploration phase, the incompatibility of the game with my computer and OS, and the pain of the three strikes and you are out DRM.

It's like Quickbooks, which I do own, so I am aware of how sucky it can get. eg. I needed to reinstall my copy of Quickbooks 2004 cos of an OS corruption. Of course, the Quicken activation servers no longer do the 2004 version.

I don't understand why this game took more years than usual and yet is worse than most other releases out there.Perfect example: the game is supposed to be about evolution, but you spend more time customizing how your creature looks than how it performs. Why? Because while there are 100 different things you could put on your creature, and you COULD put 3 mouths and 5 legs, you get NO benefit over having 1 mouth and 1 leg.

You can only install the game three times - meaning if you swap hardware two more times over the life of you playing the game, you'll be hosed and unable to play. While the game doesnt have to call EA every ten day anymore, the SecuROM is more like malware or spyware than copy protection.And it doesnt even work - the copy protection, I mean.

No! EA would never do that.Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM ruines it","review":"Not even worth thinking about until the DRM is fixed. What a show stopper! You'd think after so much time, effort, hype and anticipation they would have released something playable.But no, EA forgot what it means to market a product.

But now with all this stuff about the DRM and limited to 3 installs of the game... No way!! I appreciate you want to protect the game from piracy but not at the expense of your loyal paying customers. I'm actually thorn by this as I was so eager to play Spore but I'd rather save my money instead of risking complete computer damage, data loss, and the eventual loss of Spore itself after 3 installs. If you ever cop on and release this game DRM free with unlimited installation counts, you'll get my custom back. Shame on you, EA!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EA Sucks","review":"You're only allowed to install the game 3 times, and after that you have to call EA for an extra install, and they treat you like a criminal.

It was much anticipated and showd great promise with the Creature Creator.It turns out that you can only install it three times over the lifetime of your copy. If you buy a new computer, that counts against you. If your hard drive crashes, that counts against you. If you uninstall and want to reinstall it later, you're out of luck if you've installed it 3 times ever.I've installed my copy of Diablo II no less than 7 times. I legitimately own it, but for various reasons I've needed to reinstall. With Spore, you're SOL. Don't waste your money on this until they fix it. What a stupid, stupid idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is terrible","review":"The DRM on this game is terrible. You can only install it three times, after which you have to call EA and beg them to be nice enough to let you install the game you paid for again. I have a separate copy of Windows that I use just for gaming, and I erase it several times a year to keep it clean and virus/malware free. So I'll get to play my $50 game for 9 months or so before I am forced to BEG for the PRIVILEGE of playing it some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy it till the DRM is removed","review":"I also was looking forward to this release, but won't buy it until (unless?) the DRM is removed.

Let me share a recent experience with you. I am a console gamer. I had played through (and really enjoyed) Mass Effect. I recommended the game to a friend at work. He is a PC gamer. The DRM on the Mass Effect disk caused MAJOR problems on his system. I really hadn't given this a second thought when recommending the game, but I have since learned my lesson. As long as the game publishers try to tamper with the systems their games are loaded on, they should not be rewarded. If you want Spore, wait for the console version. Until then, buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Installation","review":"If you upgrade your computer, have to replace Windows, anything else that requires this game to be reinstalled, you are in trouble. There are built-in rights restrictions that limit how many times you can install this, even though you paid for it. Software packages having this particular type of copy protection are risky purchases because once the vendor (Electronic Arts, in this case) turns you off, you are done. They can easily prevent you from ever using the software again even though you have forked over your money. If the artificial limitations preventing fair use in the hands of legitimate owners are removed, then this might be worthwhile. Otherwise, protect yourself and keep your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is a total show-stopper","review":"I usually change machines a couple of times per year (or more!) and this draconian DRM scheme will fail me miserably.

Although it had gotten bad reviews at its release, I still went ahead and got the game with an open mind.

Yes, being treated like I'm 12 sucks (and it's not stopping piracy -- this game has been cracked for days now), but I'm not going to let that ruin the game for me.Unfortunately, there's not much game to ruin. This game is about as shallow as it possibly can be. It's fun to mess around in the editors for 15 minutes, but the rest of the game can be completed in less than 6 hours, and unlike other open-ended games there's no reason to come back. Even during that 6-hour period, the game is tedious. Every stage involves doing the same thing over and over 5-40 times until you reach the next one. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM and 3 Install Feature","review":"Among the most brutal I have seen. I was pretty hyped over this game, ive been looking for something like this for years, only to have it thrown in my face with a 3 install limit (EA is as belligerent as Microsoft). Im more fired up with an install limit then over the DRM. DRM only provokes pirating, the more secure you try to make it, the harder and faster they work to exploit it. EA lost all credibility with me and I will no longer purchase a product that has an EA flag anywhere on it.Good Job EA! keep up the good work of ruining good games!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype! Don't listen to game review magazines.","review":"This game got a lot of hype. Game magazines gave it 5 out of 5 stars, but I believe those magazines never played the game.Spore is like a giant game of \\"Simon Says\\". (You know, the colorful blinking light game with sounds...?) The game is supposed to be open ended, but you'll be glad the game is over when you reach the space 'exploration' stage in less then a day.This game has a lot of neat technology behind it. Making a creature seems to be the most appealing part of the game. However, people can make their own creatures with the free creature creator; Or go buy a package of play-doe and you'll have just as much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draconian Restrictions Management outweighs the (few) positives","review":"Simplistic gameplay is already a handicap this game has to overcome. Draconian Restrictions Management eliminates any chance this game had.Imagine a man with a broken leg. That is Spore. Now, imagine that he doesn't have crutches, is barefoot without a cast, is drunk, is blind and deaf, and is trying to walk on a steep, icy slope. That is Spore in its current incarnation, hobbled by Draconian Restrictions Management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was going to buy... not now","review":"To be brief, I was looking forward to buying this game until I heard about the draconian (nay Dickensian) DRM and the technical problems associated with the game (some of which are probably a direct result of EA not being prepared to handle everybody trying to register their games at the same time). Better pissed off than pissed on, so I would say to EA: stop pissing on your customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bought it, wish I would have read this first.","review":"I have to say I concur with the thousands of others who do not agree with the DRM.

That's two. If you also have a laptop to play on the go, you're at three. If you get a new computer or have to reinstall the OS on any of them, you're out another $50 to buy this game again.That's unacceptable and you too should make it clear to EA by just saying NO to buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM -- CAN NOT INSTALL MORE THAN 3 TIMES","review":"I like this game... It's fun... It's kinda cool.. BUT I GAVE it 1 STAR.. WHY? because you cant actually buy the game.. you can only rent it.. You get a DVD that lets you install it 3 times... Only 1 Account can be linked to the game.. so if you have a sibling or father / son etc who might buy a copy, understand you'll need TWO copies...Once you've installed it 3 times you have to call EA to get it reactivated.. Perhaps I can give you some advice.. If you buy this game protest by learning how to crack or otherwise bypass the DRM (start by googling gamecopyworld )... Maybe if enough people turn to cracking to stop the protection they'll change.. So far they have yet to do so...Dont get me wrong.. spore is kinda fun...

I am not buying any other EA game either."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM? No thanks....","review":"Like others here I have had issue in the past with DRM - Thank you Adobe and Apple. DRM is fine for an average user - but think about it - this is a game. Many people who play games build new systems to have the latest and greatest, or have multiple machines. I know I do. Two regularly used ones in my office, a laptop for work and a personal Laptop - My wife also has a computer. So if we install it and reach our limit because we retire a machine that had it and replace it with a new one - We have to call EA? Screw that. I have returned the game and bought some BR movies instead. I will either wait until EA releases a version that isn't limited like this or download the version that doesn't have DRM - Thats right - pirate it - then I wont be limited anyway. DRM is a failed attempt at control and has become an annoyance for anyone over an average user (especially in this case when there are much better ways to ensure someone paid for your game)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid licensing key","review":"I bought this for my son, who was so excited to get it.

After finding out they were going to implement SECUrom, I loaded up an old copy of Fallout 2 and played that instead.

The priates are downloading it for free and they don't have any limits? Am I supposed to be happy that I am being punished for someone elses crime?

The game play is average at best. The creation is really dumbed down and everything is based off stats, not how many arms/legs your creature has so essentially there is no point in having more than one arm/leg/claw/horn.

Creating your creature is fairly pedestrian. The various options have little real effect on the ultimate gameplay and the difference between the options is rather sadly minor.The game is also short. By short I mean REALLY short. I finished the game in less than 5 hours. 5 hours?? That's including the tutorials! Ridiculous! Yes I can replay the game, and I have.Fact is that there is very little difference between playing through as a friendly herbivore or as mean old nasty carnivore. There's just no payoff.The creature creator was the best part of the game.And did I mention the DRM? WOW! I can install the game 3 times! I have installed it twice just to try and get it to work.Bottom line: This game needs about 5 times more content than it has right now to justify its cost.

There is a clear downside though: the DRM is VERY restrictive. you are only allowed to install the game 3 times, once you have installed it that many times you have to buy a new copy. Do NOT buy this game, not even as a gift to your enemies. (Seriously though: don't buy it).Also you have to install the EA download manager, a very shady program which is required to play online and download patches. Why you need an additional spyware-like program to do so is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but not worth dealing with the authorization headache","review":"I really really enjoyed playing this game. That said, I will probably never play it again. I upgraded my pc to windows 7 and apparently that isn't allowed by ea. I even used the de-authorization tool before I upgraded. I ran it twice to make sure and the second time it claimed that there were no authorized copies of spore on my pc. So how can my code possibly have been used too many times? This is clearly a serious flaw in the design.

Really NOT worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Kids; Adults? Not so much","review":"My 9 y.o. son got this game for Xmas & absolutely loves it. I played because I was curious and needed a new game. The game is simple and boring for adults. It's awesome for kids and I highly recommended it for children because of simplified strategy and game play.

I gave the game the rating I did based on my own experience with the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking everything but DRM","review":"The concept was amazing. The game is not.

The game is very creative and actually somewhat educational. It is one of the few games out there that can also be considered Art.Now for the extremely sad news. I wish I would have waited a few days and read these reviews on Amazon about the DRM. The game may stop working after a few years? Are you kidding me?! EA just bought its ticket to bankruptcy. It's very sad that a great work of art is going to be harmed by the corporate world's fear of piracy. And its pretty ironic that such an innovative game about evolution is going to be stifled by an obsolete way of thinking.I hope Will Wright has the balls to speak out about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"SecuROM is not ok.","review":"Put simply, the more negative press earned from secuROM (a totally consumer-abusing DRM system), the more publishers will be forced to remove it from their games.

Honostly, its almost as EA thinks that everyone that buys this game is pirating it. 3 install limits and online activation for a game mostly played OFFLINE! I update my computer quite a bit, and I reformat it every few months. That 3 limit activation screws over alot of people, and it practically encourages piracy. Why should somoene go through the hastle of activating the game when they can just download a version that has all the BS removed?I loved the sims and im enjoying spore, but after this ordeal and major headache, I regret giving EA my money, and it will be the last time I ever buy one of their games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DRM stops the show for an otherwise good game.","review":"EA came out with a great product here.

It is certainly polished, and the creature creature is fabulous, but the actual gameplay is lacking.

Creature design (vehicles and buildings also) is essentially cosmetic, aside from a few minor effects in one stage of the game. The game itself, rather than being a single, coherent experience, is divided into 5 mini games (stress on mini), each of which feels very incomplete. On the second or third time playing through, gameplay becomes very formulaic, like playing solitaire without shuffling. I never expect a game to live up to the hype (especially this much hype) but Spore doesn't even come close. Maybe Maxis plans to make us buy half a dozen expansions before the game is worth the base $50 price (see Sims)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster gameplay and EVIL DRM","review":"Through the first two stages of Spore I've been very disappointed and so far the game has not even come close to the hype. It's cute, for sure but overall I'm left with that same feeling I had after drinking the kool-aid prior to the release of Black & White and Fable.Add to this, EAs customer-hating 3 install DRM and you've got a real stinker of a product.

The graphics are a bit slow on a Macbook Pro. That is disappointing. I am a big fan of the Civ line and Sim line, and like building new worlds, and I have mixed feelings about the challenges of Spore.But if you like dumbed down games with lots of fun carnivorous activity for wasted hours of simple-minded rapture, then Spore is for you.That being said, I am opposed to the DRM in the game as DRM has gotten restrictive to the point where it is very inconvenient to the user.

I will not be buying it, as I am strictly opposed to DRM. Let's be clear about this; it does NOT prevent pirates from sharing/copying/downloading/etc your game. It only stops normal, law-abiding people from enjoying what could have been a great game. Stop treating your customers like criminals EA. You are losing more business from DRM, then from pirates.

It seemed interesting and I was looking forward to the full game. I really wanted to support PC gaming, which has fallen a lot lately(other than the MMO/WoW gaming sales).However, I will not be able to purchase the game. This review is like many of the others on Amazon now. I can't purchase a game that has DRM this extensive. It's not so much a matter of principle as it is a matter of ease of use. For all the consoles I can put my game in the drive tray and just play it. For pc games you must install them. This itself is no problem. But when installation becomes difficult due to DRM, when the company selling the game assumes I'm going to make copies and send them to all of the internet, I cannot support them.And since that DRM is indeed a part of the game experience, I see it as only fair that it be reviewed based on that experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM aside, the game is riddled with bugs","review":"The DRM is obviously evil and need not be further talked about.

Unfortunately, this game is nothing like the game that we had hoped for. Each of the different phases of the game are interesting, but none of them is worth playing more than one or two times.

The space stage is tedious as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM was a big mistake","review":"DRM will ruin your experience. DRM does not make a game safe. It is total BS to pay $50 for a game and then be told you can use it only a certain amount of times. I have to reinstall my OS at least once every six months, and I have to upgrade my HD or video or CPU at least once a year. So after 1 year I will have to call EA at my expense and ask if I can please play the game I paid for. What a waste of money.

It does not stop piracy at all and in fact seems to encourage it en mass. End result is it only tells legitimate consumers that you are sheep and we can fleece you. Moreover you will not resale the tile and get any money back. This is simply about control of a product after the initial sale and dont believe otherwise.You are a renter or a short term subscriber at best only. You did not think you really purchased anything did you?I loved SimCity and SimEarth but this title has been picked apart to be monetized as much as possible as well as dumbed down for casual and ADD people.

I spent $[...] to buy the \\"special\\" version that included bonus features, yet was unable to install the game because our ISP had accidentally disconnected our internet connection.DRM does not reduce piracy!

This is all for naught due to the fact that you can only install the game three times, also leaving you at the mercy of EA's activation servers. If those servers were to go down, you would be out of luck if you wanted to play the game.I installed this game on my PC, thats one install. I installed it on my laptop, that's another. That leaves me one install remaining.

The game is polished and certainly looks good, but seems unsure as to which audience it is targeting.In the end, I uninstalled the game and formatted the system. I'd taken an image of the hard drive just before installing the game knowing I'd likely end up needing to restore it at some point.I can't recommend any game (or any other product) that uses this type of DRM.

So until I reformat my hard drive I have to live with this malware running on my pc? There's enough security holes in Windows as is! BAD EA again!I'm giving the game 3 stars for fun. Would've been more, but knowing in the back of my mind all the luggage that came with the game, it drags the overall experience down.

I had some serious trouble with this DRM when I experienced it for the first time in BioShock. It had limited installs as well but you could get an install back if you uninstalled the game (correctly). I ran into some computer problems and ended up losing all my installs due to a flaky hard drive. It was such a headache to get it working again, calling support, proving I actually owned a copy, etc.The result is that SecurROM and I have ended our relationship permanently.

There was no mention on the packaging that I could only install it three times. Basically this is a rental, not a product.

I get the impression that the publisher doesn't give a hoot about their customers or the law.I'm very angry. I feel that I've been cheated out of the $100 it costs to buy the game here.

The 4th game is a simple and short world conquest game. The 5th game is a galactic lackey game. This is the big game and all you really get from the first 4 games are icons for the 5th game. You are the pilot of a space ship and you fly around doing all the work and earning all the money so the home world can have a empire.

The first 4 stages are over very quickly, and if you try to extend them by looking for all the things you can get, it just gets repetitive and boring. The space stage is just frustrating as heck...the game gives you very little instruction on what to do, and if you miss it, there seems to be no way to find out. It's very easy to tick off a hostile space empire and if you do, you'll be doing nothing but fending off attacks on your homeworld, and getting killed, over, and over, and over. Fighting those spaceships is a pain too, as they're constantly moving small targets that you have to hit with your mouse while also flying your ship.And, unless you're careful to save your game every time you leave a planet (you can't save while on one!), you're more likely than not to just have the whole game crash, taking your meagre progress with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All those years in development and still has serious bugs???","review":"I've been looking forward to this game for many years now, ever since hearing about it at GDC. I've played it now for 2 days and have run into three bugs, one is serious enough that I would have classified it as severity A. Upon starting the creature phase my nest spawned underwater. Every attempt to get onto land resulted in a big critter appearing out of nowhere and eating my creature. Had to restart to get around that. In addition to that I had an unhandled exception error when I closed it after playing the first session (this is on OS X). Finally, I've heard audio stuttering glitches. For a game that EA is touting as a franchise that will be a key part of their lineup for years to come you would have thought that they'd shaken all these out before shipping.

If customers refuse to purchase a product due to DRM then so be it, it is our right to do so. I pre-ordered the expanded version of Spore and was looking forward to it but cancelled due to the DRM flack (for the record, I read about the DRM saga elsewhere about a month ago and cancelled my pre-order). I wonder how many sales EA is missing out on due to this problem?

All it does is punish the paying customer. So I'll find my family a game that isn't so draconian with it's copyright protection software. The same goes for Sims 3.

I know I am not a pirate; I have scores of games that I've bought, over the years, including 4 full-copies of Diablo 2 (expansion and all) that I bought so that I could multiplayer a full party with my friends and family. As it is, DRM is killing video games. Frankly, there are other things I could do with my time.It really is sad too, because, as a biology student, I was really looking forward to playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real reason for DRM","review":"Do you all wanna know the real reason why companies use securom and have set install limits? it's not to stop piracy...it's to stop the secondary market....where (A.) a gamer finishes a game and is done with it...lends(or)gives it to a friend to play(instead of buying it themselves)....or (B.) To prevent gamers from returning or reselling games.....(EB/Gamestop stopped accepting PC games for Trade/Credit years ago)..... Game companies know they can't stop piracy.. if it's obvious to you it's obvious to them....so instead they stop the perfectly legal secondary market...which cost them millions.... Just look at the console market.....game companies lose millions to their games being sold used at gamestop and other retailers....also I only buy EA console games used.... gamestop deserves my money more than them...(lesser of the 2 evils)Spread the word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not believe the hype","review":"Here's a simple review without spoilers\\"Not as advertised\\"- Gameplay is limited. It's hard to change gameplay style (economic, military, religious) once the game picks it for you.- Evolving creature (multiple legs, etc) doesn't change the creature aside from the cool/cute value.- The space stage is repetitive. In-game automated preventative devices did not act without your intervention.- End game reward becomes useless after a point.- DRM is draconian. You are renting the game, not buying it.- Expansion packs will provide needed upgrades (more parts, enhanced gameplay) to improve playability.Despite same of the amusing aspects of the game, I returned it. It is not the game that was hyped over the last 2 years. It's a dumbed-down version of the hyped one.

In today's world hard drives crash, and we have to reformat and reinstall all the time. Well this is a game that won't come with you because after 3 times, you're done, no more spore unless you buy another copy of the game. It is not smart to force people to only be able to install the game 3 times. This is a betrayal of the customer in every way. I am very very angry and will NEVER buy another EA product again until I can install my copy of my game that I legitimately buy.

It's been in development for what, like 10 years? I thought it'd be epic. Like, super-scale. But since it tries to juggle 5 different types of gameplay, they all end up being too easy. Instead of going in-depth into something, it's more like a bunch of tutorials. The most fun you'll have is the creature creator, which can be bought separately for 10 bucks.

Sadly, it is no more than a revolution in dressing up magnetic dolls.Creatures do not adapt to their environment or situation. \\"Changes\\" are managed by snapping new pieces onto a creature. The user interface changes for each level. The game itself is a carpal tunnel inducing nightmare of clicking and trying to see around objects.Gameplay is simplistic and repetitive, and ultimately pointless, as the stats are all but meaningless at the last two \\"stages\\" of the game.The creation tools are fabulous, and are probably the best part of the entire game...which, ya know...kinda sad.The SecuROM DRM is absolutely unacceptable.

The game was already pirated days ago before it was released in the UK or America. They are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game. You will perpetually require an Activation Server to be running all the time if you want to install this game in a few years time. The DRM is also the beginnings of forcing games to become a RENTAL revenue model, as per the wishes of Electronic Arts own CEO, John Riccitiello, who wants us all to buy bare bones games in the future and pay for all the content as \\"extras\\".(see: [...]).SecuROM has already been prosecuted for using similar DRM technology in the music industry.

It is the ultimate \\"sandbox\\" game that draws you in with a stunningly simple interface. The game has befuddled me a few times, but on each occassion, it was because I literally couldn't believe how straightforward the game interface actually is and that I was actually getting it right on the first try. Now this simplicity may end up coming back to bite Spore -- I honestly don't know if I'll enjoy it as much on the 100th play-through. But I like what I see so far.(One digression: They're definitely going to need a patch. I have had zero crashes and no lag. But my graphics card, which exceeds the minimum specs by a wide margin, is adding lots of jagged points to the characters and simply failing to get colors correct every so often.

Worse yet, it counts off one of those installs if you ever upgrade any of your hardware? Just bought a new video card to make the most of the graphics in Spore? Well, you might have to buy the game again as a result. This is an utterly terrible way to treat the customer, and as excited about the game as I am, and as happy as I am with it, I'd recommend holding off on purchasing a copy unless they remove this DRM, as it probably won't be the last copy of it you have to buy if you want to keep playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game severly hampered by draconian DRM","review":"As others have explained, this is less of a purchase and more of a rental. If you often upgrade your OS and hardware components, you find that you have locked yourself out of another one of your activations. Again, you can call the company to plead to get a fourth activation, but what after that? If I want to play this game two years from now I must purchase a fresh lease because I've used up my legal activations?Of course, EA would like people to not illegally use their software; however, they have implemented anti-piracy measures in the worst way possible. Limited activations and uninstallable Securom is the least popular way to go. Given that EA wants Spore to be _the_ game of the year, or next year as well, they've failed greatly here.Of course, if you plan to install Spore just a couple times in the next few years (upgrading just once or twice) then perhaps you'll find this worth your money.Brilliant Wil Wright concepts remain."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM with activations?

I literally fell asleep at the computer.I also would not recomend this game for anyone that is a computer hobbyist, with the drm it makes it impossibl to do fresh installs.btw, those that say you don't actually own games according to the license, well that is bs, with games on consoles you can buy, sell , and trade the games you buy on ebay or ebworld, not this one. infuriating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Sim Games","review":"I've been an avid fan of sim games in general and was really looking forward to Spore but the included DRM \\"feature\\" just kills it for me. I've made the the mistake of thinking that since I didn't pirate the game the DRM wouldn't effect me one too many times (Neverwinter Nights 2 I'm looking at you). I just can't imagine purchasing a game with an installed DRM component or excessive limitations on use. I hope that EA reconsiders so that I can buy what looks like a truly wonderful game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre game behind a malicious publisher","review":"Firstly, this game didn't live up to its hype. It's just too simple. I enjoy games that involve depth and many different playstyles, but Spore just doesn't provide this for me.Secondly, after I was thoroughly disappointed by the game itself, I am left with the malicious DRM software that EA included with the game. If you install this game, you are installing spyware willingly. The copy protection involved in this game is so malicious that I regret installing it at all. Now I'm left worrying about my computer being slowed down by the paranoid DRM software left behind by a bad game that I wish I never tried.My advice?If you are less than ~10 years old: ask your parents to buy it for you, maybe you'll be entertained for a few hours. You're likely to trash your computer anyway, so the DRM spyware won't be a problem.If you are older than 10: Just don't bother. Walk away now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genereic RTS","review":"Skipping the horrible DRM issues (which are enough to warrant the game a score of zero) what we have here is a generic RTS game.Forget any ideas of evolution or discovery. Nothing you do in the cell and amazingly dull creature stages as ANY effect on the game, since you can totally redesign your creature at any point during these stages, and right before the Tribal stage.As soon as you get to the tribal stage, the first thing you are told is to drag the mouse to select multiple units, click on resources to star gathering them, then click on your town hall to start building things.... ah, so original... all hype, no substance.I was amazed seeing the review here on Amazon, I don't think any product has ever earned such a massively negative backlash. It is well deserved, on so many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"The game had potential, but once I found out it would have SecuROM, I decided I didn't want it. I've been a fan of the Sims since it first came out, but once The Sims 2 Bon Voyage (the first Sims game to have SecuROM) broke my DVD burner, I stopped buying all games with SecuROM on them. Hopefully EA will get a hint and switch back to their old anti-piracy protection, but until that day comes, I'm boycotting all EA computer games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't run on multi-GPU computers","review":"I was so excited to play this, but apparently it's not designed to run on the newer multi-GPU machines.

Not only are the limited activations annoying, but the game won't even run if you run the standard Microsoft utility Process Explorer, which I use all the time.It is only worth installing if you plan on installing it on a dedicated machine that will never need to be reinstalled or reactivated. In other words, don't mess with it.Hopefully this is the last SecuROM train-wreck that gets released. I really miss playing games on my PC. Maybe I can find a cracked version somewhere so I can get my money's worth. SecuROM makes pirates.

We had to go hunting to find the executable, and then created our own shortcut. (OS: Vista Home Premium, not SP1). The game has run okay so far.I'm incredibly irked to learn (after the fact) about the DRM -- neither the box, the documentation, nor the installer warned me that my box was going to be polluted with a root kit. That seems out of bounds and ethically indefensible.Now I have to invest substantial time in figuring out what's involved in removing it. My understanding is that uninstalling the game does not remove the rootkit -- sheesh. (I got the game for my son.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is ineffective","review":"This new DRM EA has started using on it's products (including Spore) only allows a maximum of 3 installs.If you pay $50 for a game, you deserve to actually OWN the game.

If anything, this has made more people illegally download Spore because they're tired of the horrible DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM + Excessive EULA = No thanks","review":"If you have already bought this game, read the EULA carefully.

For the time the graphics were not too shabby. The creature creator was not perfect but it was interesting. Before the release this game was said to be very ambitious. People talked of being able to follow a species from the lowest to greatest and I guess you can in a way. However each stage in your creatures evolution leaves much to be desired. They are overly simple and not much fun to play once you have beat them once. I would say I got maybe 5-6 hours out of this game when it was released. I was hoping it would be one of those games you come back to but I have not touched it since.Disappointing considering the potential this game had. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely dumbed down and cartoony","review":"Far far far from the original concept and vision of the game.

However, there are two major problems:1. DRM- I'm not a fan of this. I paid for the game, I should own the game. Stop treating paying customers like they're stealing.2. There is no auto save function. I hate it when I've been playing for an hour and the game crashes. There went an hour of work.If EA would fix these issues I'd give it a 5 star rating.

Wait for this one to hit the bargain bin, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on EA","review":"EA basically wants you to rent their game for $50. Frankly, the price is too high for a game that you can only install three times. EA showed no respect for the paying customer with this move.

But this game does have activation and DRM. Aside from not being able to play it while travelling (no CD drive in my MBA), I wonder why pirates can get a hassle free version for no pay where as I have to pay for the 'privilege' of coping with DRM.The company is sending the wrong signal...a very sad way of ruining a perfectly good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phat -- not!","review":"Children will love the graphics.

Each of the five phases are intriguing for the first few minutes but are not enough to get me to come back and play for hours on end. The only thing that might get addicting is the creature / vehicle / building creator which is brilliant. But there is the rub. Do I really want to spend the majority of my time trying to get a creature to look just right? I'd much rather spend my time implementing strategy-- which is sadly lacking. The rest of the game is very simplistic. On their own the 5 stages aren't deep enough to challenge. After the first run through (4 - 6 hours) I don't really have the desire to go back and try it all over again.What is really getting me down now is that after playing it and finding it undesirable, I can't sell it.

Certainly in the case of SPORE, DRM was a HUGE mistake - this is a fantastic product which I'm sure alot of people would have happily handed over their $$$ for - I WAS one of them till I found out about the DRM - I'm no market analyst but this is just common sense - who the hell is making these decisions!!??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game.","review":"I just wanted to add my two cents, and negative ratings, to the other 2000+ already here.If you buy this you are effectively letting EA walk all over you. You're paying them $50 so you can rent a game. As someone who has owned all the sims and the sims 2 games to date, trust me in saying those limited activations will be spent in no time and you'll be forced to either play with a bugged game, re-purchase the game, or not play at all.Securom I wouldn't touched with a ten foot pole. I suggest reading up on it and you'll be equally enraged that anyone, much less a company you gave your hard earned money to would dare to put such a thing on your PC.I was looking forward to spore and even the sims 3. I will purchase neither on principle. EA is doing a major disservice to it's customers, and they will hear you best if it effects their sales. So take a stand with your wallet, and don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please watch out","review":"Be careful. This game will not work if you have computer trouble.If you need to repair or replace your computer 3 times after buying this program, it will NOT allow you to play it.Wait till they fix this before you buy. Or buy another game for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good casual game, bad bad DRM","review":"Spore has taken four game types that are generally considered hardcore games and has made them successfully casual. I would have enjoyed much more game complexity at every stage, but I think they've made a good game for a casual audience who have never played Warcraft, Civilization, Master of Orion. For the rest of us, it's a beautiful building sandbox where you get to design wonderful things, then have them play Simon Says.Unfortunately it has been marred by EA's DRM, so that you can only activate the game 3 times, can't have multiple accounts on a single computer. It's also buggy (save often!), difficult to run on Vista, and installs EA's Download Manager which runs even after you exit the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you want to share with family","review":"My sister and I have been excited about this game for years. Pre-ordered it and installed on day one. Like other reviewers said, the DRM is a pain but I wasn't too worried about that. However, when it turns out only 1 account per game can be made I was furious. My sister would have to shell out another 50 bucks to have an account of her own. We use the same computer and thus can't even play at the same time. This is ridiculous.Also, as has also been mentioned, the game seems to be a shell of what was originially hyped to be. Very dissapointing. Give me Sim City 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible shame","review":"I have been looking forward to this game for years, and I would have bought it even with the mediocre gameplay simply because I understand how people can be disappointed in a game after hearing so much hype. However, like so many others, I will not submit to these asinine DRM schemes anymore. I'm done. I was done after trying to help a friend get Bioshock installed and running last year.I'm not going to go pirate Spore, but I can certainly understand why some people would - it's just less hassle. EA, and all other publishers that insist on these insane DRM schemes need to wake up and smell the coffee. People are just getting tired of dealing with it, and it is really starting to hurt the PC gaming scene. I don't mind having to have an original disc in the drive to play - that is the accepted standard in my mind. Why go any further than that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is a no go","review":"This game was just too lacking, I was expecting a lot of content in this game. Going a single cell, to being on land was just very awkward in terms of game play. Knowing EA they well be releasing tons of expansions of content that should have been in the game to begin with. I got to the last stage with in a day of play. So not worth the money.Plus I will not install any programs that have a DRM in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jzzzzz....get over the DRM thing","review":"The DRM does not ruin the experience of the game. The zero star is because people hate DRM so do I but you don't need to protest like a bunch of babies. My two kids absolutely love this game even I a father of two think it is really fun especially the space stage. The best part of this game is once you've played all stages you can start a new game at any stage. Plus the variety of creatures, buildings, vehicles, star ships is absolutely incredible. Don't let a bunch of screaming babies impact your decision....try the game if you can and then judge. Great job maxis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Apple gives you more leniency with your \\"purchase\\"","review":"I've been looking forward to this game, but after finding out how locked down this game is, I will certainly pass. Game producers need to realize that DRM hurts sales worse than piracy. At least piracy spreads exposure and can encourage people to buy the game. DRM gives media a bad rap and will only result in a backlash such as this. Many times I'll play a game for a while then get bored, so I uninstall it to save disk space. Later on I'll have the urge to play it again and reinstall it. I've also needed to reinstall OSs several times. Having to call EA for permission to play my own game is outrageous, they're stooping to Microsoft levels here. Drop the DRM, and I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA, Stop punishing honest customers","review":"After reading about this game for a couple years and following its progression I have to say that I am horribly disappointed in EAs decision to implement what amounts to a $50 game rental. I was excited and ready to buy it. Thanks to the reviews here, I'm going to pass it over.While people who illegally pirate the game are enjoying fully unrestricted gameplay, EA decides to punish their honest customers with a 3 installation limit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with DRM","review":"I would have purchased if it weren't for two things:1.) It does support macbooks that are more than seven or eight months old - it depends which graphics chipset model you have. GMA 950? Sorry, you're screwed.2.) I'd run it on my windows machine, but DRM! To hell with DRM. This is completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another DRM Complaint","review":"Honestly there isn't anything else to say that hasn't already been said in the many many other reviews complaining about the horrible DRM that has been put in place. Hopefully EA listens....."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM will ruin games","review":"DRM is a horrible idea for PC games and will ruin PC gaming for everyone. The idea of limited installs for a $50 price tag is crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA must think gamers are pretty stupid","review":"I've enjoyed the Sim City games in the past, and was looking forward to this one. I won't be buying unless / until the DRM malware is eliminated. It didn't stop the game from being pirated anyway, apparently, but EA still wants to treat its paying customers like idiots by imposing an overly restrictive install limit (on a $50 game? Seriously?) and putting some kind of mysterious software on their machines that does who knows what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get it to install","review":"I have a combo DVD-RAM/DVD+-RW reader/writer drive, and all it keeps saying is \\"unsupported drive\\"Why? I've never had a problem with it before. I searched the net and I have to assume it's the stupid copy protection. I finally had to return the game for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM-free please","review":"Looks like a very interesting game, but I just can't condone DRM that only gets in the way of legitimate users (case in point, a cracked version has been available online days before the actual release).When they take off the DRM, I'll take out my wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crippled by DRM","review":"This product would be great, if it wasnt for the fact it has the possibility of ruining your PC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre gameplay, hate the DRM","review":"I've played Spore for 30 hours now and I'm already looking to move on. Unfortunately this game doesn't have very much depth in it's game play. It's far too simplistic for the average gamer.It's a sad sad day when you have to consider the DRM used in a game before purchasing it. To be blunt the DRM in Spore sucks and only limits you to 3 installs. This wouldn't be so bad if I could uninstall the game and get a install back but I resent having to call EA support and prove to them I bought the game legally at sometime in the future when I purchase new hardware.With this disappointment I'm done pre-ordering games from EA. In the future I'll wait until the game is released and then see if it warrants purchase. One thing is for certain, if it has a ridiculous DRM scheme that basically only lets you to lease your purchase then I'll keep my money. Maybe if EA's revenues start slipping they might come to their senses."},{"rating":"1","title":"game got wasted with DRM","review":"If DRM was bad on music and movies. They are far worst on PC games. I was playing Commandos yesterday on my laptop I purchase that game over 7 years ago and have played it in more than 10 pc but with EA DRM on Spores that will never happen because when I upgrade or even update my system I won't be able to use it anymore. DRM SUCKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Support = Unplayable Game","review":"I purchased and installed the digital-only version of Spore (using EA Downloader), only to find out it consistently crashed my computer if I wanted to advance past the first \\"cell\\" stage.I tried their help hotline, which seemed permanently disconnected the first two weeks of the release. I went on EA's official forums, and it appears LOTS of other people are having the exact same problem. Needless to say, after countless hours of troubleshooting, the game is still DOA. Not to mention the DRM makes it very tricky to install on another computer to test the whole situation.I'm have a HUGE amount of trouble returning the game, so it looks like EA stole $50 from me. Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM not compatible with Microsoft File Monitor","review":"Just so you all know, the DRM in the game prevents it from running if you've run Microsoft File Monitor on your system previously. It doesn't matter if you've closed the program... Even if File Monitor is not running at the time you want to play the game, even if you uninstall file monitor.The only solution is to restart your computer every time you want to play Spore, and because of this EA refuses to give a refund because the \\"restart every time you want to play\\" is what they consider an adequate workaround.Brilliant.I'm giving away my copy to a friend so that they won't buy the game. If EA won't give me a refund, I'm definitely going to try to cut into their profits as much as I can. For everybody else who is as frustrated as I am, instead of stabbing knives through your Spore DVD, I'd recommend giving it to a friend who might be at risk of paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM does not work for WINDOWS 2000","review":"The game does not work with WINDOWS 2000 and I had to get a refund for the game. I'm very disappointed with the DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Don't buy this game if you actually upgrade or repair your computer, because you get 3 times and then you can't play anymore - even on your legally purchased and owned account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creature creation doesn't really matter","review":"Creature creation and variation only seems to matter to a point. Adding on an extra set of legs doesn't seem to add speed. More feet/hands doesn't seem to stack their effects. More eyes, doesn't allow you to see farther. etc etc etc...Only seems to matter on appearance. No gameplay difference. Nothing stacks.I haven't seen the point to adding ears to my creature. Does it do anything?Doesn't seem to be much point to replaying, either. Once you do a stage, there are only 2 other paths you can take and it basically boils down to whether you made the other tribes/civs your allies, destroyed them, or did a combination of both. Not much replay value.Avoid this game. Why can't games live up to the original vision?"},{"rating":"1","title":"they got me","review":"I bought this game the day it came out not knowing about the DRM issue, I regret my purchase now so much. I should have just torrented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is bad for you","review":"You can only install this game 3 times. I have 2 computers and have had to reformat one of them in the past year. This means I would have to live in constant fear of one of my computers dying again (or go through the rigamarole of trying to convince the all-holy EA that I do in fact need to install their game again).I don't want to rent this game until I happen to hit an arbitrary number of installs.And for all you \\"cheap\\" shoppers out there. Do NOT buy this game used. Who knows if it even has any installs left?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the AAA title we have been expecting.","review":"This is so sad. I can't believe what all those years of design & programming have ultimately yielded. It seems obvious that Will Wright was 'guided' in his design of this game, as it is not the same game that has been previewed for several years.The copy-protection schemes are ridiculous for a game released in 2008. For years, the accepted belief has been that copy protection only hassles the purchaser. Why dont publishers understand this? The pirates will copy the game, remove the protection, then enjoy an EASIER TO USE product than the one that is sold in stores. The way to publish a game that gets SOLD, not copied, is to provide a reasonably bug-free game from day one, top-notch support, and an an excellent online community. CHeck out StarDock games for examples of the right way to do things."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM no way!","review":"I was ready and set to purchase this game till i found out about the DRM. I build computers and am constantly upgrading my system. There is no way i am going to be begging EA for a new activation code every time i put more RAM in or upgrade my graphics card. I was really excited for this game too but now i'm just a little depressed i'll never get to play it. There is no way i'll ever put that DRM on my computer! I hope everyone else i know will join me in banning EA till the DRMs are lifted. Till then i guess i'll be buying games from other gaming companies sorry EA but other companies don't treat their customers like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick to Steam","review":"EA, please wake up and listen. I'm glad for all the 1-star reviews, because the last thing I want on my computer after much pain-staking work to reformat and carefully monitor what I install and what processes get installed with the programs I need to make sure that my desktop runs cleanly and smoothly, is some useless background process(es) installed that eat up my computer resources (that I so painstakingly freed up) just because I did the right thing and purchased a game instead of pirating it.EA, you need to look in the mirror and ask yourself this one question:Why do pirates enjoy a better version of your game than the legitimate customers?It is a decent game, it's unfortunate that EA has to ruin it for EVERYONE, including EA itself. EA is not the only producer that does this type of DRM, and the other producers would be wise to listen up.There is another way. And it's here now. Please refer to Steam, take notes, and mimic. Easy. And everyone is happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM denies me ownership","review":"Because of the copy protection scheme Electronic Arts has placed on this game, which requires online activation before the purchased product will begin to work, there is no guarantee that a piece of software I have honestly purchased will ever work for me. EA does not have to maintain the activation servers for any particular length of time. Should they ever go out of business or simply decide it is no longer profitable for them to maintain said servers, ever single purchased copy of the game will become instantly and irrevocably broken.I cannot support a company which will not recognize that my purchase of their product should transfer ownership. I want to own games I purchase, and I do not want the publisher to intentionally install ways for the games to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was going to buy until I found out about DRM.Another $50.00 bites the dust EA.Enjoy your game"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM Nightmare","review":"I like the ideas behind spore.The implementation is decentThe DRM is TERRIBLE.

But I'm not gonna spend any of my hard earned money to this product until the moment EA removes their STUPID DRM practices. Very good way to lose.

I had been reading about this for over a year now. I had seen the preview videos and thought that this looked like a fun, engaging game to play. And once again....corporate greed and mismanagement have ruined the day! I refuse to buy a a game that I do not have the right to install or uninstall as many times as I feel is necessary on MY OWN PC!!! I understand copy protection....I do not understand this 1984-esque interference in my product ownership. Using SecuRom beyond that was one of the worst ideas EA ever thought up. This is like buying a car and being told I can only make three modifications to it before contacting the manufacturer and asking permission to add new rims or something. Total garbage. Anyway....thats my two cents. EA....you wont recieve my $50 until you change your copyrighting schema."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy any more of these.","review":"I will not buy games with DRM any longer. I have well over $7000 invested in my PC hardware AND software..so I am not scared to spend $.

My windows is genuine, as are all my games...and I am genuinely pissed about this. EA better start listening, or my customers and I will not be purchasing their wares.Other than the DRM being evil, I am hearing about people finishing the game in one day.
