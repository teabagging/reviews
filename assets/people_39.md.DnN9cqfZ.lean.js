The script is perhaps the worst offender(if you don't count the cliched camera work and rancid score), giving decent actors nothing better to do than spout off terrible one-liners and smirk. If no one in the cast can take the giant croc serious then how can the audience? This film is by-the-numbers cinema of the worst kind. Cynical, condescending and just plain annoying, LAKE PLACID is a the cinematic equivalent of a pile of garbage. See ALLIGATOR instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This is the worst film of last year. There is nothing positive to say about it. The script is a joke, the actors are irritating, especially Bridget Fonda and the dialouge is not at all funny. If you wanna flushyour money down the toilet then go right ahead.

And Betty White is a delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shocking Surprise","review":"I had been avoiding this movie because I love good horror films and this movie looked stupid. One boring afternoon, while channel surfing, I tuned to this movie and was shocked to discover that this movie was a riot.

I immediatly bought the DVD and now my friends love this silly movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jaws but........","review":"Lake Placid will never be Jaws, but then what can top an original?

Very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has it's moments, but bad all around.","review":"Let's first say that these movies always seem to pair up the male/female protagonists. Here it's Bridget Fonda and Bill Pullman. Also you know with the rules of moviedom, unless they are happily married, they will end up together. Well, if it's inevitable, how come they have no chemistry?And why is Oliver Platt's character so deliberately annoying? The only redeeming character in the movie is Betty White, who seemed to have taken a few lessons at the Gary Oldman school of overdoing things. However, I relished her damned wit and the writers gave her all the best one liners.The movie is not scary and we are left with only a few false scares to cling to. Even when the alligator shows itself, are we experiencing a greater heart rate of that of a person sleeping peacefully. This movie is just sooooo boring.Rating: C-"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Campy Horror flick!","review":"This is a great film. I just purchased it today.

I have no idea why money was spent on a thriller no different than a 50s monster movie, but it's reasonably entertaining and any movie with Bridget Fonda is a worth checking out. Betty White is kind of amusing as a foul-mouthed local, and there's a pretty cool gore scene in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was that?","review":"I watched this movie on Pay Perview last night and boy am I glad I didn't buy it. This movie is neither fish nor meat. A sorry attempt to be a spoof maybe? Poor dialogue throughout. Not remotely funny, not scary...it's just nothing trying to be something. I am not even talking about the unlikelyhood of an aligator ending up in Maine, I could live with that improbability, I am not proud :-). The two stars I am giving are for Betty White and the gator. The effects are pretty good and there were one or two scenes that made me jump but that is all I got out of it. Rent it...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The giant crocodile should eat this movie","review":"This movie is total garbage. It is so bad that it is comical. A giant crocodile in Maine eating people? Betty White trying to say quirky lines in an Ally McBeal-like fashion? (\\"I'm pulling for the crocodiles\\") Cows getting eaten by the giant alligator? Lines that aren't funny? B Movies have deeper meaning. The plot could have been written by a 10 year old.I think that the problem with some movies that are put out is that there is absolutely no thought put into them. Senseless movies like this are put out to make money. You throw a couple of names out there and hope to that it lures people into watching it. In this case, it is Brigette Fonda and Bill Pullman leading the movie. I realize that some of the dialogue is for comic effect, but really, this is not funny at all.If movies had an IQ, then this movie's would be about 10. As for rating, I give this a 1 because zero is not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"This really could have been a lot of fun.","review":"A giant crocodile is inhabiting an idyllic lake in Maine and its up to Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, and Brendan Gleeson to stop it. Written by David E. Kelly, this mixture of horror and comedy has a few good laughs, but it's ultimately Ally Macbeal with a crocodile. Too bad 60% of the movie focuses more on trying to create \\"quirky\\" characters (Oliver Platt is immensely annoying) than actually dealing with the crocodile situation. This could have been a lot of fun, especially since the creature effects are terrific, but almost all thrill potential is wasted. Not awful, but certainly not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS A MOVIE?","review":"After seeing this movie advertised on tv, I thought that I just had to get it on DVD. This would have to be one of the poorest made movies that I have ever seen. Its very predictable, the acting is sub standard,there is very little action, the story line is weak and cheesy, and its a very short movie. It was hard to stay awake while watching this 1 hour long movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest Crocodile to ever to walk the planet","review":"I thought this guy was an enormus Crocodile I have ever seen. This movie said to me I am never going to the lake again... This movie had laungage in it, and blood & gore violince. But still a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stupid to be entertaining...","review":"The problem with this film is that it doesn't know when to quit. If it's supposed to be a comedy then it should be funny, not stupid...and I love Oliver Platt, but his charactor was so retarded that he made the film almost unwatchable. The premise was neat and I love these 'huge animals take over and eat people' type films, and the croc looks awsome, but theres so much corny dialog that the film suffers becasue of it...and Bridget Fonda's charactor is so unbelievable annoying I was praying that the croc would just eat her! The ending was cool, but getting there was exasperating. I also found it humourus that they name the movie 'Lake Placid' when Lake Placid is in Florida and they were in Maine on a lake called 'Black Lake'...so why not name the movie 'Black Lake'? It just adds to the stupidity of the film. One reviewer said that this was parady...well then it should have been funny, not stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's boring.","review":"If not for Brendan Gleeson and Stan Winston's astonishing and sorely underused crocodile effects, Lake Placid would be even more of a disaster. It's boring, and at 82 minutes, felt like almost 2 hours. It should have have been more fun, action-packed, tense, and less all Ally McBeal-type humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Placid Allright!","review":"Stereotypical monster horror movie directed by David E. Kelley about a giant crocodile eating unwary visitors in a Maine lake resort(Maine? Why not Antarctica while they're at it?) starring Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, and Brendan Gleeson.Completely unoriginal and boring to add to that. There aren't even any of the sort of monster attacks one would expect to see in this type of film. After several minutes of just watching scenes of the lake, I thought I was watching a documentary on fishing. I wanted to yawn after the first 15 minutes. The movie has an absurd script made even worse by a lot of bad acting. The only credit I give to the movie is that it lives up to its title: it's placid allright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that the movie had great potential. Also, like some of the other reviewers, it fell far short of its potential. I regret having wasted my money on it. As at least one other reviewer put it, much of the movie seemed to be missing. It was too short and underdeveloped -- I felt cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was made in my home town!","review":"This movie has everything, comedy, horror, love story, special effects...what more can you ask for? Only problem with the movie was that it was way too short. I thought it ended really quick, well...maybe I was the only one. But still a great film to watch with a group of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much to sink your teeth into","review":"I was hoping for a juicy thriller, but instead got a real yawner. I like Bridget Fonda (as the pretty paleontologist investigating a mysterious death on an uninhabited Lake in Maine), Bill Pullman (as the debonair fish & wildlife hero) & Oliver Platt (as the rich & eccentric crocodile-worshipper), but even talent of this magnitude cannot make-up for a very weak plot & awful dialogue! One shinning star is Brendan Gleason who portrays the corpulent sheriff-with-a-heart-of-gold with alot of humor. I was most shocked by Betty White as the trash-mouthed granny who lovingly feeds the 30-foot menace her livestock! There are some funny parts and the special effects are quite good, but overall a rather silly movie that never quite delivers even one good scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Potential","review":"Great actors in a weak script. It's entertaining enough for the genre with the help of a short running time. The treatment of animals is upsetting, and Betty White's eccentric character comes off totally annoying. There is wonderful chemistry between the always excellent Oliver Platt and the deputy Sharon played by Meredith Salanger. One wishes that it could have been developed more, but that's another script. David Kelley (of the excellent \\"Picket Fences\\" and \\"The Practice,\\" as well as the awful creep-fest \\"Ally McBeal\\") doesn't come through on this script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good movie","review":"OK, I wasn't expecting anything either, but what I got was one of the funniest movies I've seen in months! Everyone involved in this film knew it was ridiculous, so they went the extra mile to make it worth seeing. Excellent character interaction saves the day. (and a foul-mouthed Betty White is worth the movie alone!) Corman-esque ? yes. But a refreshing surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of your seat....full of laughter","review":"This movie wasn't what I had expected it to be... I expected a typical horror film with a typical plot. During the course of the movie I was at the edge of my seat laughing, tense, and sometimes screaming at the characters in the movie. The main point of the movie in my point of view wasn't the horror, but the hilarious wise-cracks and interaction amongst the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I really found this film boring. The actors try too hard, the special effects look fake as, the direction is absolutely awful and the screenplay is even worse. So all of you who saw it is a masterpeice of work and a great comedy, I think you should look more carefully at the film's quality. I mean, more time is spent on land than in the sea and you get scared from the actors not the crocodile.I think you should see 'Deep Blue Sea' - it is seriously sooo much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!","review":"This movie is one of the worst! The plot is extrimly stuped! Basicly; it's about a giant crocodile, that lives in this lake, and eats people. And this is the dumbest part: an old lady takes care of the monster by feeding it cows! It is sooooooo dumb! I don't know why they rated it R...it's not scary, and has just a little language. The reason i gave it two stars is because i did like the special effects, i thought the crocodile was cool, but the plot was just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the May issue of IRS.theroadlesstraveled.org","review":"This one is so marginally tolerable you could ALMOST give in - wait for it to show up on cable, blundered upon by channel surfing, and stand it for whatever length you deem worthy.

Although there was some humour in the film and some nice gore scenes I would recomend you rent the film first before purchasing it. The biggest disappointment about the film was the ending, it was so slow and so tame that I was considering switching over to the Terry Wogan show. On the good side some of the C.G was really nice and there was some good humour in the film but overall I would buy Deep Rising instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"Really bad movie.

It is not even scary. Even the dumbest people could realize that! I hope I have told you how bad the movie is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but stupid","review":"This movie is abosultely pointless. There was a good plot, a very good plot, but they didn't carry it out. The movie is only 80 minutes long. Disney movies are longer than that. In my opnion, the filmakers just stopped trying. The movie had a some funny jokes. Betty White as Mrs. Bickerman was hilarious as the mean old lady on the lake. And, the special effects were very good. It almost seemed life like. And all of the actors were good, too. But what made this movie horrible was the ending. It was horrible! The movie like just ended. But, there may be a sequel on the way because at the end, Mrs. Bickerman was feeding baby crocs. So yes, if you want a few good laughs, rent this movie. If you want scares, rent something else.If I may suggest something, if you want to buy this movie, please rent it before you buy it. I am glad I made that decision because I was about to buy it until I rented it. I am glad I did that because there would go $15.00 I'll never see again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me","review":"I have thought about this movie long and hard, and I have got to say the only movie I can say was as bad as this was is CopLand. I had once been under the impression that any movie with a giant lizard tearing things up would be absolutely gold. (Godzilla gets 5 stars easily) However, this movie has destroyed my faith in my scaly friends. Please take my word on this and don't see this movie. It made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Oliver Platt & Brendan Gleeson Movie\\"","review":"This movie is a hoot. Not all the special effects are winners, true. Although, the bit where the 'gator comes up and bites the guys head off is primo! Very well done.... It was the by-play between Platt and Gleeson that makes this movie. You find yourself ignoring everyone else and just waiting for those two to get together again. Beautiful! Enough suspense to keep you interested, special effects not awsome, but not terrible either, acting (except for White) is adequate, and some delightful humor. Some of the reviewer's compare it to DEEP BLUE SEA which was untentionally laughable. Nope, this is way better. I own it, I like it, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enjoy it!","review":"I don't see why people are giving this movie such a hard time. Impressive special effects, witty humor, excitement, and a fairly good plot make this movie something to see, very entertaining. So a crocodile couldn't really survive in Maine's cold waters, who cares, it's just a movie, stop being so nit picky. Who cares if the simple minded audience can't accept the fact that a crocodile can grow so big (even though at last three species are reported to have acquired a length of nine meters)?Just enjoy it, and before you badmouth it, compare it to other recent reptile movies like Anaconda, Komodo, and Python. It's the best by far! Just watch the movie and enjoy it, that's pretty much what I'm trying to say. signed, World reclaimed volderfreak reviews incorporated."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding","review":"Having just read reviews of this movie which use the words, \\"brilliant\\", and \\"funny\\", I felt that I must comment. This is an apallingly movie. It is brilliant if you enjoy movies with no plot or substance. Do you like to know about twenty minutes in advance exactly what is going to happen in a film? Great! Buy it! It is funny if you are a fan of hearing the same stupid jokes that have been used again and again in other terrible movies. Do you like to see extremely fake looking reptiles swimming around biting off heads? How about second rate actors who have three facial expressions that they seem to feel work for all occaisons? If so, then this one's for you. Sorry to be so vehement but I would hate for anyone to waste their money based on the comments presented here.

And the copy on this DVD is fine, with one minor problem. This was produced with no enhancement so you have to set your player to send the signal at 480p to get the correct aspect ratio. Other than that it's a great thrill ride.The acting is fine but the real draw for me from day one was Betty White. She shows the bent sense of humor she is so repected for now. Remember this was 1999. And when I saw Kingdom of Heaven, I was surprised to learn that one of the nastiest charactors was played by Brendon Gleason, who I mistook for a down-Mainer.This is a great representative of its genre and should be a film enjoyed for what it is, no more, no less.(I expect this next section to be edited out. That's fine. I started watching the movie and the disc is damaged. I can find no way to contact someone about this. The returns page won't give me a reason for the return so I can't contact anyone.

But this movie does carry with it a high degree of suspense, though most of it is predictable. What carries the movie and keeps it from being a failure is the humor in it. If anyone has ever accused you of being sarcastic, or a smart-aleck, you will appreciate this film. Unlike the rest of the reviewers, I thought it was a great film, and have seen it many times.This movie would probably be suitable for people who don't like \\"traditional\\" horror movies. It isn't gory, for those with squemish stomachs. I strongly recommend this film.TJG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until this one is 50 years old before seeing it","review":"This is a B movie, reminiscent of those black and white '50s flicks where a giant octopus sprawled all over the Embarcadaro in San Francisco, a huge praying mantis crawled up the Empire State Building, or gigantic ants spewed out of the Los Angeles sewer system. This flick has a gigantic crocodile in a Maine lake. But unlike the recent \\"Anaconda,\\" this film has some good special effects, and at least is more entertaining than the pathetic \\"Anaconda.\\" Maybe someday we'll look back on \\"Lake Placid\\" too with relish and nostalgic glee, but for now it is ... just ho-hum.But Betty White is worth watching this one for. She has two very funny lines in this sorry movie. And it was a bit of genius, casting her in the role which she plays. She's somewhat of an animal rights activist in real-life, I believe, and what she does in this movie, in hind-sight, is quite humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Creature Features of the 90s!","review":"It's not too often you see those great creature features anymore, and when you do...they are usually a disappointment. So, I was pleasantly surprised to see the new Steve Miner film \\"Lake Placid\\". The work of David E. Kelly (writer, Ally McBeal) is very evident with the witty comebacks by Betty White (who adds the laughs to the film). And who could forget the scene where Bridget Fonda complains about all the heads flying at her! If you like dark comedies, this if for you. And if you like horror films, this is also for you. There is plenty of gore, plenty of laughs, and enough suspense to keep you interested. This is a great film that combines the comedy from David E. Kelly and the scary stuff from Steve Miner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one flaccid monster movie","review":"I saw Lake Placid opening night at the movie theater and was very, very disappointed. I was not expecting much, I mean it was from the director of Friday the 13th Parts 2 and 3. But the select scenes I had seen on television plugs got me over it and I went. Truth be told, Lake Placid is an excellent made for television movie, that is all. You can see where the commercial breaks would fit in, and Steve Miner lived down to his expectations, delivering a soulless commerical product of a movie. Bridget Fonda sleepwalks through a role that is clearly modeled after Ally McBeal and the humor runs the same shallow level. You want a great killer reptile movie, see Alligator, its place as the greatest one ever made is assured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Uneven!","review":"This film tries to be suspenseful, especially in the beginning sequence, but never gives you one good scare or makes your adrenaline rush. The performances are nothing out of the ordinary, Bridget Fonda has some funny dialogue, but at times it is badly-written forced humor. Some plot elements are added to the film only to make it longer and more interesting (since they only started with the idea of a crocodile in Maine) but it makes the movie ridiculous and campy. Examples of those plot elements are the hostile old lady and the eccentricity of Oliver Platt's character. The ending lacks intensity. Could of been a cult hit or a campy experience but it never gets anywhere. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun!","review":"This is a great tongue-in-cheek horror flick. A lot of chemistry between Bridget, Bill, Betty & Brendan.

It has all the makings of another trivial monster from the lagoon film but saves itself with sufficient fun to make it worth watching.....if you have nothing better to do. Another element to its credit is the sketch of a romantic comedy which sort of weaves through the film, not taking the spotlight but adding a note of gaiety. Bridget Fonda and Bill Pullman handle that part of it about as well as its throwaway role in the picture allows. The other players do a good job with the stereotypes they are playing and the creators of the monster are to be congratulated for the credible threat and camera-suitable appearance of their invention. Betty White is a happy addition to the cast in a small role.All in all, not a film to search out and pay much for; but one that can be enjoyable when you are in the mood for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper of a Keeper","review":"I found this in a video store and was attracted by the promotional line, \\"You'll laugh as often as you scream.\\" I liked this film so much that I *rented* it three times in two months, and since the only letter-box release is on DVD, this is the film that made me break down and get a DVD player so that I could own a copy.

Perhaps it is significant that I can't remember any of the characters' names. This movie was truly horrible. I mean, these people are supposed to be worried that a giant crocodile is going to eat them. They seemed more worried about the mosquitoes. And the whole \\"Save the man-eating crocodile!\\" thing... come on! Hand me a gun, I'll take the thing out if they won't. But for the most part, I was with the old lady.

The storyline is about group of so called experts who try find and eliminate an alligator that finds its way into a lake in Maine. I think it was supposed to be a comic/horror movie. I enjoy humor but the oneliners in this movie were so bad they made me wince at first and then eventually became annoying. I enjoy Betty White's acting and she is extremely funny (not in this movie) but I did not find her foul language amusing.This movie was poorly written. I think an elementary student could have written a better one. My favorite character was the alligator and I found myself hoping he would devour these idiots and end it all sooner than the 90 minute length. My advice: SKIP THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go the crock!","review":"Go the Crock! By that I mean I wish the crock had eaten David E. Kelly before he had had the chance to write this rubbish. Or better still, before he created Ally McCrap. The big question to ask about this film is why? Why was it made? Even more pertinent, what was the point? I love films like Alligator, Razorback, Grizzly, Piranha, but this film was just a shocker, in which I mean, it was bad. B.A.D. And that final shot! God almighty, how many times? I saw this film on a double bill with Deep Blue Sea and it made Mr Harlin' factory fed turkey seem fairly appetizing. Instead of the lame and boring ending that this (can I call it a film?) offered, I would have liked to have seen Calista Flockhart do a guest appearance as Ally, do her poxy pucker and end up as the crock's first big mac. Or skinny mac to be precise. Now that would have been worth the rental. Only redeeming features: Bridget Fonda and good effects. <...>"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an Imperturbable 'Lake'","review":"This is movie is one of the worst.

That huge crocodile should've taken care of that senile woman by the lake. All of the characters are acrimon-ious, all deserving of a 'biting' surprise from the mutated creature.

Then watch Hard Rain to see her as a crazy old broad out to kill looters. Then burn both films.Let's be serious here. The psuedo-religious crocodile worshiping stuff by Oliver Platt was not needed. The idea of a crocodile living as far north as Maine is utterly laughable (damn, if they'd set it in SC or NC, I MIGHT have been able to suspend my disbelief)and the strategies used to catch it are even worse (dangle a live cow from a helicopter anyone?). Have the people involved with this film EVER seen Reptile Wild or any other program on National Geographic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Deep Blue Sea instead","review":"Words to describe Lake Placid: Bad Acting, Very Bad Special Effects, Boreing Story, and Dump Actors. A total of 3 people die in this movie. And you only see the gator for a brief moment when he does appear.At the end, they don't even kill this monster, they decide to keep him for a museum/circus exhibit!!!There is no comic relief like in most other horror movies. The guy who trys to be the funny one is just plain stupid. The other actors are also untalented. Another recommendation instead of this garbage is the old Aligator movie from 1985. That was much better than Lake Placid."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an Okay Book","review":"It has a lot of interesting stuff about China. It's kind of boring.

Jack and Annie saw a huge map of the castle where the emporer lived and they used it to help them find the library. In the end, Jack and Annie saved the library and were heroes again.I liked this book because of the Terra Cotta soldiers (we have one of these at home !), the Chinese hats that Jack and Annie wore, and the dragon kings clothes.

It starts off with an elite Los Angeles police unit attempting to catch a brutal killer. A rookie member of the group ends up chasing the murderer to Europe and finally catching up with him. The plot is centered around an attempt to bring back the monarchy to Russia. Plenty of thrills along the way thru some 690 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious. I stopped reading","review":"I remember the Day after Tomorrow as an interesting thriller. This book is not a good follow up. The characters are wooden, the plot is silly. The reason why this writer is not mentioned with Dan Brown is because he's not that good. Just one example of the ridiculousness that appears on nearly every page: The bad guy is caught and hancuffed and is on an elevator guarded by two marshalls. He slips off the hancuffs at will (no mention of how he is able do this)and grabs one guard's gun and shoots both guards. Just one of many ill staged scenes. Don't waste your time look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages for too little reading","review":"The book has a splendid beginning, but then the writer bogs himself down in poor writing, unbelievable action, and a predictable ending.

So can any competent English major. I padded through 400 of the 700+ pages before deciding it was too dirty and implausible to continue further. Moreover, because of his Clintonian descriptions of sex I will not pass this on to my wife and certainly not my adult daughters.

Suspend your belief a little and settle into this thick book that reads very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but thrilling","review":"Allan Folsom's \\"The Exile\\" is a hefty tome but well worth the read. The intermingled tales of John Barron and Raymond Thorne take us from the streets of LA to the museums of St. Petersburg, from a special squad of the LAPD which tries, convicts and assassinates killers, to murder and mayhem around the world by an heir to the throne unwillingly vacated by the Tsars of Russia. Although seemingly implausible, Folsom weaves the multiple plots and subplots together in a convincing manner which maintains the reader's interest. The writing is taut and the author maintains the pace until the last page. One false note: the last three paragraphs detract from the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me again how Barron and Ford got into this mess.","review":"Allan Folsom may be regarded in some circles as a gifted and compelling writer of action-packed suspense thrillers, but if one is asked to agree with that assessment, that agreement will have to be based on some OTHER work; The Exile is NOT an example of the characteristics asserted by those who might so regard Folsom.All fiction asks the reader to suspend his disbelief.Folsom, however, pleads with the reader to suspend his or her own intelligence.A more implausible set of conditions and resolutions has NEVER been more repeatedly shoved up my consciousness than when I read \\"The Exile\\".I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"this book was not only 300 pages too long, the plot was ridulous. i kept reading it until the last 75 pages thinking it had to get to the end, but it never does. i gave up. the scenes of alexander/raymond dying/ not dying, john/nicholas dying/not dying were too much. the drive to davos in the storm with the russian detective and the car going almost over the cliff was typical of folsom adding pages that were not needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boorrring","review":"This book is poorly written, predictable, and, in general, a very weak story.

I unfortunately agree with the negative reviews. The first segment of the book is wonderful. Without giving away any plot the train ride and the scenes in LA are riveting. If the book had ended there I would have given it a 5 star.The remaining portion of the epic is not convincing, wordy and boring at times. I continued to read this portion because of the momentum of the first portion. Also it was interesting to try to figure out exactly what was happening. This was resolved mid way through the second portion. From about 450 onwards the story dragged. I found the end unsatisfying.The question that is touched on better never really explored is the moral dilema that was faced. In the 700 pages more should have spent on this issue and less driving in a never ending snow storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out so good...","review":"I know I'm reading this 9 years late but I'm a patron of thrift stores. Anyway, I read the cop/train part and was excited. I then glanced at the contents again, Los Angeles, Europe, Russia? I had to read the last few pages. OMG! What a messed up ending.

Cut out about half the words and get things MOVING, and this would have been a decent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just finished this book and found it disappointing. The first part of the book was very interesting, fast-paced, with a lot of coincidences but intelligent action sequences. I should have stopped there.The remaining two thirds of the book required far too many leaps of faith. The writer dismisses a large section of time with little detail, when it should have been one of the emotionally interesting of the book. Then its nothing but more and more coincidences. It became so far removed from reality that I didn't really have a strong reaction when key characters were killed; I just wanted to be done with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!!","review":"The plot of this book is so far fetched that I can't believe it was published!!His first book was good- I don't know what he was trying for here, but it really defied belief- I can't believe I read the whole thing hoping it would get better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much anticipated but ultimately dissapointed","review":"Having read the first two novels in one sweeping breathtake, I found myself again having a sleepless night going on to the rollercoasterride I anticipated. How disappointing that after the first 200 (very readable) pages the novel stalls becoming more and more predictable and I am very sorry to say this, by times utterly stupid. I'm prepared to wait another few years to give Folsom another go, but after having read the last line I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turning story","review":"This is a lengthy book but well worth the time spent to read it.

From page one, you are taken on a wild ride as LAPD Det. John Barron hunts down the elusive and secretive killer, Raymond Thorne.The story is epic in nature, and by the time you finish, you really feel like you have been on an adventure yourself.There are lots of secrets to learn, and lots of twists and turns and hidden identities. If you have ever read Folsom before, then you know how entertaining he can be.On the negative side, the characters are stereotypical though entertaining, and at times I felt like I was reading a screenplay more than a book. (And this would make a terrific movie.)On the plus side, this book ends with a stunning last page...but you can't cheat and have to read the entire book to appreciate it. It's that good.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"See storyline above (Booklist's).I was not at all disappointed in Folsom's latest international thriller.The action, as well as the depth, will draw you in from page one.

Granted there are some funny moments, but there are also many moments where Josh and Nate are doing nothing but playing for the camera, trying and failing at being funny.

The band was playing & the groups rap over it mostly live rapping. Listen to the song \\"Watch Dog\\" & after that listen then \\"Rhymin and Rappin\\" then you know wath I mean.

I was enrapt with the haunting and frail melodies of \\"Always Remember to Respect Your Mother pt.1\\". If you really want to compare Dusted with Rollo's main baby Faithless (one of my all time favorite bands), Dusted's music lays more into ambient than trip hop (like Faithless). But to be fair, Dusted and Faithless are totally different in their own right and should not be compared. If Dusted was to be compared to anyone it would be Delerium. Their music is more in tune with each other as far as haunting ambient music goes. The cd artwork is wonderful, reminds me of the children's story of \\"Where the Wild Things Roam\\" (or something similiar to that title). All in all, \\"When We Were Young\\" makes for an excellent appetizer for the ears while waiting for Faithless's third studio album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best - Need DVD","review":"Perfectly depicts the state of modern surfing around the world.

The hooked areas look like they're supposed to be sharp, but are far from it.When you hook a nail you have to beat on the tool with a heavy hammer to bend and rip the nail out of the wall.What I think it's supposed to do is just slice through the nail.Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.I give it more than one star simply because it IS better than nothing, even though I don't think it works correctly.I guess I can try to sharpen mine, but in all honesty I wish I had just spent the extra 20 - 30 bucks for a real one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can Watch This Movie Over and Over","review":"This a great children-friendly account of the Anastasia Romanov situation.

I will tell you, however, that Rasputin did not do magic, No one actully stormed the castil, and Anasasia's grandmother was NOT there at the time!

The dates are all wrong, the bloody revolution is \\"glossed over\\" and Rasputin is \\"evil incarnate.\\" If children want to learn more about Anastasia then it would be better to give them Hugh Brewster's book Anastasia's Album, and let them read about her. Only a few references are made to real life facts such as Anastasia was born at Peterhof, and the drawing \\"little Anastasia\\" makes for Marie, her grandmother, is identical to the one \\"the real Anastasia\\" drew for her father in 1914. I do admit that the music was nice. And the film was a wonderful fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving the Wrong Infomation...","review":"This was, I have to admit, a cute movie... but that's it. It is mostly incorrect when it comes to historical facts. First of all, Demitri (the guy that \\"Anastasia\\" falls in love with) in real life was her cousin who lived in the palace with the family... ok, so now we're teaching kids that it's ok to date family members? Secondly, though Rasputin was a pretty shady guy, he was generally liked by the Romonof family because he helped relieve their son's, Alexis's, haemophilia. Well, those are just a few things that I can think of off the top of my head, but seroiusly, if you're going to make a historical film for kids, the least you can do is try to make it just a bit more correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall good movie","review":"The graphics and animation were really awesome and I liked the songs from the movie.

But anyway, though this movie is false, not like the real details of what really happened in the early 19 hundreds, this is a kids movie. I know the kids would probably question of the movie and compare or disagree with what really happen as they get older...that is the point.

Even though it has not been proven that Anastasia was still alive... and even though the movie never mentioned that Aleixi's body was also missing not just Anastasia... it was still a great movie, with fabulous songs.

Disney, watch out!","review":"This film succeeds on a number of levels: it has a gripping story, it has great animation, it has great characters, and it is technically wonderful. Though some may quibble at liberties taken with actual history (after all, Rasputin as an historical character differs most markedly with the film's character \\"Rasputin\\"), the movie DOES grippingly and unflinchingly cover the assassinations of the Romanovs; things are not \\"prettied up\\" beyond recognition.

I have always been fascinated by the Romanovs, and I LOVE this movie, but be forewarned: this movie is not historical in any way. The Rasputin who was really a creeper who used dark magic has been turned into an even bigger creeper who sells his soul and has a bunch of singing minions. Did I mention his body parts keep falling off throughout the show? Yeah, they take the whole Rasputin thing a little too far, so I wouldn't recommend this for kids under 7 or 8. Oh, and the ending is happy...while the real Anastasia died at the end of her story. I was really disappointed when I found out the truth. All that being said, this is a great fairy-tale movie that you're sure to enjoy...and the DVD version is amazing.

Excellent score and story, good secondary characters, impressive but impersonal computer generated backgrounds, poor villain (including the white bat) and an antipathic heroine.

Worth a second look."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best animated movies ever","review":"While the cover of this DVD is one of the worst that I have ever seen, you may think that this is just another princess movies but the film inside I couldn't recomend more. The story is mostly fictonal and won't give you much history about the real story; but who needs history anyway...the story is about a girl near St. Pettersberg who is the only surviving child of the Russian Royal Family hooks up with two con men while the undead Rasputin seeks her death.This movie is very Romantic and yet keeps the kid friendly vibe, everyone in the family will enjoy it.What comes along with the dvd set is a 1-hour long movie which stars the bat in the main movie.The set also includes commentary in the movies which is very interesting and is worth watching at least once maybe on the second time you watch the movie.I own this dvd set and gave it 5/5 stars, the only thing that could possibly make it better is a better cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"change the box please","review":"I got this since I'm a big don bluth fan, although the princess - looking box is kind of embarrassing. The movie itself is more of an adventure story so i think the cover is also misleading. This film has good animation, although all the human characters are rotoscoped, and you can definitely tell. I prefer free hand animation since I think it allows the animators to express a lot more imagination and emotion. Still, this is a good movie and a must buy if you are a Don Bluth fan. It has an extensive array of special features, my favorite of which was \\"how to draw the Anastasia characters with don Bluth\\". He does an approximately ten-minute drawing for each of Anastasia, Rasputin, Dmitri, and Bartok. Needless to say, that was riveting viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray Cheaper At Walmart","review":"I just got this Blu ray of this movie today at Walmart much cheaper then what Amazon has it for.

The whole story seems to be made up of the most common elements of a typical kid's cartoon, compiled together to make a uniformily miserable cinematic experience. The caricatural representations of Russia and France are downright distasteful and offensive.

This movie was entertaining. Anya is a spunky heroine; Dimitri is a scrappy hero; they have a sweet and surprisingly adult romance and the plot is more realistic (except for the ridiculous villain Rasputin) than expected. There is a lovely, melancholy song called \\"Once Upon a December\\" that the amnesiac Anya sings in the empty palace as ghosts come out of paintings to dance with her.

This was not the case though as I found his book to be of little merit from a \\"sailor's point of view\\" and falters to nothing more than a glorified log-book by a rookie sailor who quite frankly is lucky his inexperience on such an ambitious trip didn't kill him.This book is defintely NOT to be used as a reference guide for dinghy cruisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could do better","review":"This book was very interesting and amusing - inspiring even at times - but very badly let down by the lack of proper maps showing where exactly the author sailed.

(Contains Spoilers)","review":"That fact that Lee Hughes buys a boat owned and adventured by one of the most competent and legendary dinghy sailors of our time stands in sharp contrast with his complete lack of skill and is likely the only reason it was published or purchased. Hughes can thank his stars that he could not afford a blue water vessel as it likely would have ended him. His dialogue-logbook-esque style of writing was interwoven with college grade introspection about persons and subjects which likely interest nobody aside from his immediate circle, and made for an excruciating read. I pushed thru to the end, hoping for some kind of payoff as I had seen it sold in major book stores everywhere and assumed that a publishers investment on this scale was for some reason, but was sorely disappointed to find he wussed out half way thru the plan because he got cold, missed his girlfriend, and maxed out his credit card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Big Spender check out this Sailing Cruiser","review":"You don't need a mega-yacht to chave fun cruising the East Coast of the US.

It takes a little while to get used to, but it really works. I not only use it while sleeping, I use it while exercising too.It's not the most flattering to wear, looks a bit like a bull with a nose ring, but breathing is more important, right?

I use the small case to help flatten them back out after a night of wear.Cons:- It does fall out occasionally, but I don't see an easy way to change that.- Unlike the breathe rite strips, sneezing requires you to take out Nozovent.

The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. \\"Far From Home\\" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole \\"romance\\" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued.

Anthony Hicks has written very informative and well-written liner-notes. The lyrics are available in French, German and English. Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"I bought this MP3 player and found that I could not be without it! Love it!

But if you need something durable that will last, look elsewhere. I really like the menu layout of this player, and for now it works great. But the scrolling button is very cheap plastic and seems like it won't last long. Sometimes it catches. I've already broken the dust cover where the usb cable is inserted.

I use my big Creative Zen player (30 gig) most of the time, and I'm very happy with it. I joined a gym and wanted a smaller player to listen to while excercising, thus the Creative Zen Nano Plus. Originally I had no problems. However, recently I unplugged the device after syncing it to my computer. Since then the Nano will not turn on. Changing the battery hasn't made a difference. No screen display at all.I haven't been able to find a reset button, and the manual doesn't mention one.Darn it anyway.

I suggest you visit the creative interactive support site as see for your self the number of people having problems with this particular mp3 player.I returned mine to Amazon and went and purchased another MuVo TX FM. Plugged it in and it works fine.Maybe Creative will fix the bugs with this thing but until they do its hit or miss. Some people have no problems and other have problems that can be fixed with good support (another hit or miss) and still others like myself have players that just will not work.Good luck, D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little player for the price","review":"I did a lot of online research before I purchased an MP3 player. I was initially going to buy a SanDisk e200, but the store didn't stock it. The salesman convinced me this little Zen Nano for 1/3 the price of the SanDisk would be very user friendly. He was so right! I was ripping songs from my CD's in no time after loading the software. I only want some music (FM radio on here is great, too!) and don't want to carry around a big CD player. Don't care that there's no color LCD screen with pictures. Highly recommended if you're just looking for something small to hold lots of music. Sound is great, but might buy different eye buds...these are a little large. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a player with with features I don't really need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Sure I know there are fancier mp3 players out there, but I think this one is ideal for the price. I have had no problems loading the songs or using the device at all. I have only had it for a few months, but can find no fault with it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the memory could only store about 200 songs as opposed to the 500 songs advertised. The ear buds also did not fit my ears too well, but this probably would be a problem with any ear buds as they all seem to be the same size. This was easily solved with a different kind of head phone set that I purchased for under $20. In conclusion, this is a good mp3 player to buy as long as you don't have a need to download too many cd's. I am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried two--both failed","review":"This is (was) a great player. Then I let the battery go dead (fell asleep on the train), then it would not turn back on with a new battery. So I had Amazon replace it (they did so very promptly) and this one again worked great. After several batteries (which I didn't let go dead) I got curious and thought I would try letting one go all the way flat. Sure enough, it won't turn back on. I found that if I \\"upgrade\\" the firmware, I can get it back to working, but I am returning it.Too bad, as I was in love with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!!","review":"My 12 yr old was asking for an ipod and a friend told me to check out the mp3 players, which were similar and cost less. I checked around and found this one. I chose this one because my daughter has alot of cd's and this player allows recording of music directly from the cd's through the computer. The downloading feature is also easy to use. My daughter no longer has to carry her cd walkman and cd case everywhere, just this small mp3 player in her pocket. Also she enjoys the radio feature as her cd walkman did not have this feature. The downside is the batteries don't last long, so we invested in rechargable AAA batteries. Other than that she no longer thought about the ipod after getting this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little MP3....","review":"This little gizmo is pretty great for the price.

This only issue I have with it is the shuffle mode. I loaded a bunch of music folders into the player and after a while I noticed it was not playing some of the songs before repeating other songs. I have also noticed that it does take a long time to load the player. However, if you are like me and leave the same playlists on the player for a few weeks at a time this isn't a big deal.

Unlike two of my earlier players, this has the 'plays for sure' tag on it which ensures that purchased music will play correctly. The 1gb memeory I thought was hugely big, but I've got about 240 songs on it and it's pretty full....now maybe I should have gone to 2gb?! Battery life is great. It says 17 hours or so, and it may be that or better. The small size is great and the exercise strap is key for a runner.

Our public library offers downloadable audio books and I needed a portable device that would play locked WMA files. Through browsing the web I thought I would pay $200 - $300 for such a player until someone at the library recommended this one. WOW! Hard to believe such a tiny device can put out such crystal clear CD-quality sound! I'm hooked! The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I can't bookmark my place in the audio book (Solution is to pause your book, turn the player OFF. If you return to it within 24 hours it will pick up where you left off). Otherwise, I can't say enough about this tiny powerhouse of any MP3 / WMA player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, poor condition!","review":"Good book series, love Joan Johnston.

I was glad to return that to Best Buy! The Peerless kit has the hardware for various threads, so you will have everything you need. It was easy to install and is quite sturdy. The tilt and articulation are smooth and easy. It is also easy to unlock the two halves of the mount and lift off the TV when you need to do so. Invite a friend for lifting the TV and setting it on the mount! When I saw this deal, I purchased three of them and it was well worth the money- the price was shock to me (not sure if we are allowed to share prices, but they were less than fifty each). At double that, it is still a mount worth buying over the stuff sold at b&m stores. Good luck with your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peerless mount fits the bill","review":"I have purchased multiple mounts from Peerless and am satisfied with each one.

Windows Media Player had put an XML file named WMPInfo on my player that held information about it. My player got confused and starting calling my songs WMPInfo. When I tried to play them, it said \\"invalid format\\" or something like that. Also, it took forever to load the UI once it turned on.Then it started getting crappy. Windows Media Player was trying to sync songs onto it - and failing!Then something even worse happened: my songs started randomly stopping and skipping to different parts of the song.

The sides of the canopy's structure has no lateral strength, this caused the small vertical area of the canopy to fold inwards at the slightest amount of wind.

I did talk to Kett customer service, and frankly they were nice enough. To be fair, I am not a professional, and have used this only on one, (but a full house) Hardie Board siding project. I used the shear almost exclusively for cutting the boards, the trim, (thicker stuff) and the soffit matterial. I suspect that since I did not have a timetable to meet, maybe I was a bit easier on this tool than the \\"pros\\" might have been. But it held up fine. You don't want to force it thru the siding, just let it cut, and it works fine. Still works fine. Not super fast, but pretty darn accurate and I sure can't imagine doing that job without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kett is Krap","review":"This piece of garbage broke after 2 days of light use.

I bought it at a discount book store ($5 wasted) and thought I could find something in it that others couldn't. Wrong. By page 30 the author had said the word \\"brilliant\\" about 18 times and indeed rattled on incessantly about insignificant, painstaking details.The movie version (Calendar Girls) of this book, however, was charming and highly recommended. First time I've ever said that the book sucked but the movie was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calendar Girl","review":"If you enjoy listening to one side of a telephone conversation, or to someone who talks a mile a minute about people and places you don't know, you might enjoy this book.Try to get beyond the British slang, and you will find a story about fairly shallow women who had one good idea.This is almost all direct characterization; the author tells everything. The reader discovers little."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont recommend this product for the Lexus rx300","review":"I would not recommend this product because with the style of Lexus the windows are automatic so when it senses something is close to the top of the window it automatically stops and goes back down. It also does not fit inside the windows very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for sleeping","review":"This product would be great for swimming, but for sleeping with it's horrible. Noise is barely blocked out, and your hands and ears are left sticky after touching these waxy earplugs. I was hoping for something moldable because regular earplugs usually hurt my ears. I would much rather deal with an annoying pain than deal with the messy wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Snoring is just one of those things you wish never existed. Especially when you are the one desperate for peace and quiet to sleep! I have used multiple earplugs all foam in the past and paid particular attention in the sound rating before I buy. Followed the instructions and tested the plugs before going to bed. Unfortunately, snoring was so loud, it was as if the plugs didn't even exist. Right now best I can do is apply my foam plugs dangerously tight against my eardrums and at times wake up the culprit to adjust his position. Still looking and tired. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"My mom used these when I was little and I have always preferred them. I like that they mold to the ear but do not get oily and hot like others. The cotton keeps them nice and cool. I have trouble using foamies-they just never seal in my little ear canals so I need a form fitting kind like these. I sometimes tear one piece apart and make 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ear plugs","review":"I decided to go on-line to find ear plugs that fit comfortably, block noise and don't hurt when you sleep on your side. I have an obnoxious dog next door that barks sometimes early on weekend mornings. These ear plugs are just like the reviews I read, they are comfortable, form to your ear, block noise better than any I have tried. Thanks to these I can sleep in on weekends now. They are a great product and I will definately buy more again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all!!!","review":"I was so disappointed in this product after such great reviews! I needed something to block out my husbands window rattling snoring! These did nothing in that regard. Also, they were so difficult to handle. The cotton left a mess on my hands and the plugs were greasy. Too bad. I was excited about these working. I ordered Flent contours instead. Lucky, I was able to return to Amazon for a full refund. This is the biggest reason I shop Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really work","review":"I have found that wax and silicone earplugs do not really work.

If you break the seal, the sound gets in..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cut out noise, gross to handle","review":"Needing a good pair of ear plugs, I ordered these based on the good reviews. I was sorely disappointed. After rolling them into a ball shape as instructed, there was greasy wax residue all over my hands. After inserting them in my ears, following the directions, they did not sufficiently cut out noise. I could hear my fiance snoring loud and clear, along with any other noises. I also found it a little off-putting to have to wash my hands after inserting them, and they left my ears greasy as well. Overall I do not like these at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Worst earplugs I have ever tried. Normally I've purchased the larger uncovered solid wax kinds and have been very happy with those. These ones are truly worthless. You do not get a good airtight/soundproof seal due to the soft fabric surrounding the plug. So you try and try to refit it to your ear, and then the fabric breaks and you get a sticky, gooey ball of disgusting wax in your ear... not a pleasant experience at all. I tried 3 of these, all failed. Moving back to the tried and true solid wax versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no","review":"they sux. i took them on a 16hour flight. not comortable at all! all sticky like and i duno i expected more based of the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I've worn foam ear plugs for years but i decided to try these wax ear plugs and i have to say that I didn't have a good experience.

I've been using them for about a month on a daily basis and am still on the first set of them. They last a long time and do a wonderful job of keeping out noise. As long as they are inserted correctly into your ear, there is no pain or discomfort when sleeping in any position. It blocks out the noise from my pug who snores loudly, as well as the neighbors in the apartment complex I live in. Since I work the night shift, I have even been able to block out the sound from the neighbors cutting down trees! I love the ear plugs and will buy them again when I run out.One small thing is that they do get sticky when you soften them up but you can easily wipe off that stickiness with a towel before going to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you hear me now?","review":"\\"Can you hear me now?\\" I didn't think so. And that's about all you'll hear when you're using Ohropax Wax Ear Plugs!Seriously, I could really Wax poetic about Ohropax, which I've since learned means \\"earplugs\\" in German. But, of course!They are so easy to use; far easier than trying to get a sponge to fit and stay put in your ear canal. I've reused one pair a dozen times or more and they've never hurt like the spongy ones do after four or more hours.Yes, they're a little sticky but that's a small price to pay for the peace and quiet you'll enjoy when using these. Well folks, that's my review and I'm sticking to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohropax Wax Ear Plugs","review":"You just about have to wash hands after inserting them. They left my ears greasy,and sticky. I used them while riding my motorcycle, but half the time once I put my helmet on at least one of them would work itself loose. Had to remove helmet jam them back in and hope it would stay in for the ride home. If they stayed in great ear plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best earplug out there","review":"I have tried at least 15 different kinds of earplugs. For the most part, they all hurt my ears or were uncomfortable. Maybe I have small ears, but most just don't work for me! I can't use the kind that cover the ear canal rather than going inside, because I have both of my ears pierced on the little triangle part, whatever that's called. That could be the root of my problem. These earplugs are extremely comfortable. I can sleep all night and not notice them in. They do not completely block out sound, but definitely enough to keep me asleep with my 2 cats running around. The only issue I have with them is that they leave a greasy feeling in my ear after I take them out. Still well worth it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a good nights sleep.","review":"I've tried every ear plug I could find over several years, from foam to silcone to beeswax composite, all ending in disappointment. They either hurt my ears or they didn't hold their seal, allowing sound to penetrate. My last try with Ohropax ear plugs was a charm! I can sleep on my side without ear pain and they block out all the city noises that have been disturbing my sleep for years. I'm soooo thankfull for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace and quiet","review":"My wife only watches awful shows like glee and the voice.

Only about a third of the DVDs we tried played in this player. All of my DVDs are regular, store-bought, quality DVDs that play fine in multiple other players. In the Audiovox, they didn't do a thing. I don't remember the exact indication on the screen, but the bottom line is that they didn't play - at all.I returned the item for refund and will replace it some day with a more expensive, higher-quality player. I was pleased with the Amazon return process - this was my first return with them.One more thing, we bought this for our child to use while travelling, as I suspect is often the case with buyers of portable DVD players. The problem is that the included headphones don't size down small enough for a toddler's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a piece of crap","review":"Really, what a piece of crap. I just received this item, placed the DVD in the player, and watched it say \\"loading\\" for minutes. It never did play the movie. Tried a different DVD, same thing. I am currently on hold (and have been for a LONG time) with the Audiovox customer service line. What a hassle. Very disappointing.

Unfortunately, the carrying strap for the bag was broken (the plastic clip cracked) so I called Audiovox customer service and asked them for a replacement. After being disconnected three times, transferred to their trade show department voicemail twice, and speaking to two different customer service representatives, Audiovox told me I had to pay for the replacement part, and the problem was Amazon's, not theirs. Clearly a defective product issue is theirs under their warranty, but with dreadful customer service like that I decided to return the product.

She was afraid to ride in the car after a recent accident. This took that fear right away! It keeps her mind busy on the movie instead of on the road. The included travel bag is easy to install We switch it from car to car all the time. The fact that it comes with two sets of headphones is great for when she has friends along.

I thought I would find out for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver for European Trip","review":"We took this DVD player to Italy with us for an 18-day family vacation. It was a lifesaver for our 7 & 9 year-old children. After a day of sightseeing, they would watch a movie back at the hotel prior to dinner. Also, it was good for long train rides.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiovox 7\\" portable dvd player","review":"7\\" is small but it gives the illusion of HD and is fine for travelling children.

It seemed to work fine as long as you place it on a flat surface and don't wiggle it too much.*hard to do in the car* In the car we had nothing but trouble. Unit wouldn't load, wouldn't recognize the discs or plain did nothing. They did manage to watch 1 movie during a 2 day, 14 hour car trip.

Whenever I place any dvd or cd (even those that had worked fine previously), I keep getting a message that says \\"no disc\\".

It only comes with a 90-day warranty so we were out of luck there. I was unsuccessful in finding a local shop that felt the cost to repair would be much lower than purchasing a new system. I would not recommend this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"This dvd player does the trick","review":"My wife and I wanted to find a portable DVD player for long trips to occupy our 2 1/2 year old daughter who loves to watch her DVDs. I researched different players online and this one was within our budget. Plus, the reviews were mostly favorable. I liked the fact that it was available with the bonus pack, and the setup in the vehicle was very easy. Some reviewers said the sound was not loud enough inside a vehicle. I don't know what vehicles these people were driving but inside our vehicle the sound was more than adequate. The viewing screen was easy to watch, and the buttons were easy to use. We still haven't used all the features associated with the player but I'm sure they won't be difficult to use. All in all, I would highly recommend this player for anyone, especially families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiovox D1708PK 7\\" Ultra Slim Line Portable DVD Player with Bonus Pack","review":"The player works very well. However on the one I bought, the fast forward/fast reverse buttons are switched with the channel/track forward/reverse buttons. No big deal to me and this could be why they are selling this model so cheap. Easier to sell at a discount than fix this minor problem that, as I said, could be just my player. Other than that, for the money and with all that it comes with, it's a nice little player. Nice quality case and head phones. I feel I got my moneys worth or bang for my buck and recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love this Rosewater...can be used as a after bath body splash,or a hair rinse.

Not a good idea, as they both work on the same frequency and can not in fact use them in the same place at the same time independently. Additionally, they don't charge simply and they lose their charges quickly. This was NOT a solid purchase and we were all quite disappointed. In hindsight, I can't believe this toy won awards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid for new price but got a used one","review":"this was a great deal when I placed the order but received a used one from amazon. I can clearly see scratches and dirt all over the toy. I been a loyal customer for 5 years and couldn't believe what I got then. Anyway I didn't get a chance to play it because it was too dirty, returned it next day after unboxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly stops","review":"Fun toy but after running about 5 minutes it constantly stops responding. I have to turn the system off and turn it back on to get it to respond. It is fun to drive and my 4 year old son has a great time with it but he is constantly having to turn it off and back on to get it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad!","review":"I purchased 5 of these for my grandchildren so they could race on our pond behind our house. They could not race because all of them worked on the same remote! So now I have 5 Komodo Dragons that have to be used 1 at a time. Also the battery is very hard to install."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This car has a working range of about 12 feet max. Anything past that and it will not reverse, which means it cannot turn either (given the controls for turning). Really past 8 feet the car starts to lurch even going forward, on a fully charged battery. A full charge lasts about 20 minutes. Others have complained about the battery compartment, its not that bad but I did have to find a consistent system to get the batterry in/out without a flathead screwdriver (you'll already need a phillips to open the case). You'll definitely need that since you'll be charging every 20 minutes and a charge takes 4 hours. Also, its undercarriage is so low to the ground, the big, rutty tire have an actual clearance of about an inch. Seriously. It cannot climb over small thresholds, sticks, pinecones, etc. I have not tried it in water. I might do a video scathing video review if the company does not offer some type of refund. I think that if I showed you how UNfun this is, sales would be zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Ride","review":"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. The tires are rubber and rugged allowing the car to go over many surfaces without loosing any speed. The design is awesome. It is very much worth its value. The lights look very cool (LED). It turns on a dime unlike a lot of other remote vehicles in this price range. The battery pack is way too tight in the alloted space. The wireless range could be a little bigger. I give it a 9/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy, fun but...","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old. Overall the this RC car is a lot of fun for outdoors driving and is virtually unbreakable.The negative is that the rechargeable battery has to taken in and out every time it has to be charged. This would not be such a problem but you have to unscrew the top and wiggle the battery in and out of a very cramped space. For a 7 year old this is a problem and I have to be around for this. Which leads to another problem; the battery has to be charged 4 hours for 20 minutes of play time. This is very cumbersome and my son has slowly lost interest due to the short playing time and the difficulty of charging the battery.Next time I would buy a 30 dollar RC car that can be charged directly with the power cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less durable, poor battery life","review":"I bought this car for my 4 year old son thinking that it would be great fun for him to play. It is fun only if the battery life lasts long. The battery life is very very short. There is no point in charging for hours together for few minutes of play. The battery compartment is very difficult to deal with and it is quite hard to fix the battery into the compartment. Iam sure it will get damaged after few times of operating. Overall it is not user friendly. The car is quite heavy but the plastic with which the car is made is not that durable. My son used to get disappointed when the car won't work as the battery charging was done. And finally I had to return it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dad and son love it","review":"I wanted a responsive and powerful rc car that wasn't very costly. This fit the bill perfectly. It was bigger than i thought.My 3 yr old son simply loves it (he sits on my lap and uses it under my supervision). We both love it. I just got it and have tried it indoors thus far. It has real rubber tires that provide good traction on hard wood floors. Installing the battery is bit of a hassle as somebody else rightly noted. But otherwise its a lot of fun to use. It has been a satisfying purchase thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnest remote control car I've ever purchased","review":"I have around 10 different remote control cars (price ranges $[...])and this one is by far the best. It stops quick and my 4 year old has no problem controlling it. It can handle most terrains. Excellent I would highly recommend it. Great company to buy from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable for the money","review":"My son is five and loves this toy. It does the best in dirt and over rocks. It also goes well in the swimming pool. It floats and plows through the water. My son has a lot of remote control things and really enjoys this one. The battery is a little difficult to put in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This is a fun car. The only problem is the short battery life. It does everything it says it does, but does not work for very long. We were careful to follow the initial charging instructions carefully, and still, the car only runs about 10 minutes. They are 10 fun minutes though."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old loves it","review":"After nearly a week of daily use, nothing on the car is broken! The remote antenna is a bit shorter. The range on this toy is a joke (even before the end of the controller's antenna broke off.) You can't be more than 15 feet behind this car before you can't reliably control it. The ground clearance is tiny. It could not clear a pencil laying on the ground. Those things don't seem to reduce the fun my son has with it though. The 4 wheel drive has the power and grip to climb lots of surfaces. It is controlled like a tank where the left wheels can go backwards and the right can go forwards causing an in place turn. This makes the car unique to drive (but not difficult for even young kids.) We have not tired it in water yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great When It Works","review":"We bought one of these for our kids for Christmas. It's a great toy that they had a lot of fun with. By February, it stopped working, after not a lot of use. The lights would come on but the unit wouldn't move. I contacted the company and they sent a new unit, which we received in March. Again, after not much use, the unit has become paralyzed...lights on but nobody's home. This would be fantastic if it would just keep working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy","review":"Good toy overall. The battery life is a little short especially in grass. Mine turns better to the left than to the right. I think it has a slightly better motor on the right side. Also the battery could be easier to get out. Otherwise my son likes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and poorly designed","review":"After researching many different entry level RC cars I decided on this one and it was a big mistake. This car is poorly designed and cheaply built. Low ground clearance and weak motors cause this thing to get constantly stuck. Watch the video closely and you'll notice it's going downhill on relatively smooth terrain. The amphibious part works great as long as the water is calm because the top of the car is not sealed and water will get into the electronics. Battery life is extremely short (5-10 mins. max)The battery is also a pain to change. You don't even get full use of the battery power as once it starts getting low the remote will just stop working. I purchased this for my 5yo son who now won't play with it due to these issues. I see the price has come down(I paid $90 w/shipping).If you are looking to buy an RC car for your child spend a little more money and buy something of better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: NOT FIT FOR WATER","review":"This is a fun little toy for land use only! I do not recommend for water use. I bought this for my son for Christmas and within three days of mixed land and water use the unit started acting erratically and ultimately just quit working. I sent it back for a replacement. Again, within days the unit lost power in one of its two motors and only works intermittently. This time I returned the unit for a refund. When it comes to water, this product is not ready for prime-time. Until Morphibians find a way to make this toy truly amphibious, I strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor batteries","review":"Toy is fun when batteries work; battery life is very short. I have 2 of these (one for each of my boys) and the battery life is horrible on both cars. Also, fitting the battery pack into the compartment is very difficult. Similarly, putting the battery in the remote is very difficult and may result in breaking the compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working out of the box","review":"The one star rating comes from the fact that my son and I have not been able to play with the car yet. I may update this review once a new car arrives, but for now, right out of the box, the vehicle does nothing. Battery is fully charged or at least I think it is; there is no indication on the charger that it is actually charging other than it gets warm. So, you have to charge the battery, per the instructions, for 5.5 hrs before first use. Not a big deal because that is typical of these types of electrical systems, however, when we plugged the battery in to the car for the first time after initial charge, the vehicle's lights came on but no movement whatsoever when the control levers were operated. Hopefully this one is a fluke and the next one will not have the same issues. One interesting thing to note is that these vehicles are no longer on the kid galaxy website, I will be asking why when I talk to customer service today to get a replacement vehicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"fredw","review":"I enjoy all Sigurdsson's books and this movie is a good translation on to the screen.

Even die-hard field-sequential 3D fans should avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Indie Classic","review":"I disagree this movie was ahead of its time. It was actually a little late. Sarcastic, campy, crude, trashy, and smart enough to play dumb. This probably should have been a Christian Slater movie in the ilk of Heathers, Gleaming the Cube, and Pump up the Volume. It also hearkens to the ultimate of all 80's teen angst cult classics: Suburbia. It basically took the 80's teen angst alt/punk flick and brought it to the mid-90's. It's a fun movie with a great sense of humor to those who get it, and completely vile and trashy to those who don't. Sadly, looking back, this was the last of it's kind. The era of the low budget smartass punk kid indie flick has been gone a long time, replaced by sparkling vampires, Hot Topic fashion, and soundtracks featuring top 40 music. To me, this movie is a time capsule of early to mid-90's alt culture, and a fun bit of nostalgia for those of us who were teenagers at the time, but other than the 30-40 age group, I have no idea who else it would appeal to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Mess!","review":"I've seen this movie three times and I still don't understand it. This film is incredibly boring ( and I love Stephen Dorff! ), you'd have to to even sit through this for one minute. I like Reese too but they couldn't save this film. It flashes back and forth which is sickening. The movie itself is stifling. The flashbacks were the best part which had me wondering why the filmmakers didn't just show the hostage situation instead of making the film on the \\" aftermath \\" of it. Cliff Spab has to be the most boring character I've seen. He goes on and on about nothing. This character didn't showcase Stephen's true talents. All Spab did was smoke, have sex and complain about his little pathetic life yet you saw no true emotions from the guy. This movie is full of bad words, lackluster acting and nothing to show for it. Contrary to popular belief this is not Stephen's best work. If you think this you must not have seen Blade, Backbeat or The Power of One. S.F.W. sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one.","review":"Save your money. This is a terrible movie. I don't know what else to say about it.

As a Betta book it is so vague that it offers very little help or knowledge about Bettas' specific needs. The breeding and rearing the young section is a so vague & generalised that I really wonder if the authors have ever bred any Bettas at all. The food & feeding section is so full of errors & again vagueness that its best to ignore it. The disease treatments are mainly things that even your pet shop doesn't carry. Go to the numerous Betta sites on the web and the many Betta groups on yahoo! & you'll be far better off. Dr. Goldstein's book is light years better than this as is Walt Maurus'.

Madredeus, already the \\"voice of Portugal\\", are becoming one of the voices of the world. The purity of Teresa's cristal voice is able to stop the greatest wind storms, can make a rose flourish, can turn a rock into a diamond. Some of the tracks in this work have become the symbol of much in Portugal: \\"Haja o que houver\\" (4) was the theme song of Expo '98; Teresa Salgueiro sang it with Jose Carreras. Tracks number 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17 are the essence of Lisbon: a magic white city by the sea, with glinting tile's on the buildings and the smell of flowers everywhere. This antology is a Pearl among Portuguese music. And as some musics show a bit of the tipical portuguese melancholy they are a portrait of this small, but very intense and emotional country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have been a fan of traditional Fado, the portuguese music of the ladys of the night. But in Madredeus the put a modern spin on an old art form making it a breath takingly beautiful mix. you still get the essence of classic Fado in Guitarra and can still feel the longing, heartbreaking passion combined with simplistic modern meldoy in Ao Longe O Mar. Wonderful.

I again give a five star rating to a title in the Behind the Wheel Series. Behind the Wheel German makes this complex language easy to learn. Annagret (the native speaker) is wonderful in her slow pronunciation of German. Another true strength of this course is the sentence building technique which allows you to create and use your own sentences in German. Just fast enough to learn to speak the language, but not so fast that you get lost in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful piece to reference for couples or singles searching","review":"This book gives great advice & insight to the differences between the way men & women communicate & relate to each other.

The recipes however, are quite bad. Really bad sometimes. I personally think that it is really hard to ruin a nice salmon fillet, but this book achieves this in 2 of their 3-4 salmon recipes - the Xmas salmon and the one right before that (haven't tried the other two). Then there are all these other recipes that are just plain weird.I am not going to burn this book as another reviewer suggested, but I will certainly keep it as a prime example of when a picture IS NOT worth a 1000 words.

It seems the director may have forgotten this small detail as he had one of the vampire sisters spitting out all the blood she drank while showering (Why didnt she just swallow it instead of sensually bathing and letting it drip out of her mouth?) which was obviously cough syrup. This is not a serious movie. In fact, its a fine line between b porn and c movies.

I generally agree with her premise--that women have been taught not to show their anger, to stuff their feelings, to accept the \\"glass ceiling,\\" and all these stuffed emotions can lead to depression. But I think she fails to see the chemical component of depression. Why do some women deal with these issues and not get depressed, and some do? Still, medication alone doesn't \\"cure\\" depression, any more than therapy alone, and certainly giving women permission to express their anger will help them deal with their depression. After all, what is depression but anger turned inward?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Impressed","review":"I thought far too much of the book was used discussing how male dominated the work force is.

I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 star because there were some useful parts of the book unrelated to favoring white males. I learned some ways to better stand up for myself and reword my requests so I sound stronger. Although there were some good points, overall the book was too feminist for me (even though of course I'm for women's rights, that's just not the problem I'm dealing with right now), and a little too anti white male (my white husband is currently my best support system).

It starts with a bang with four horsemen dressed like Templars crashing a major display of artifacts from the Vatican at a museum in New York.The novel then flashes back and forth between the past and the present. The past is the last days of the templars as they flee from Jerusalam with precious secrets of the Order. The present has a detective and an archeologist collaborating in a search for the modern Templar look-a-likes and for the lost treasure that was taken by the fleeing Templars and hidden-where?

First of all, much of the writing is poorly edited and wooden (excepting action scenes, which sizzle even though they might smell of unliklihood).

It started off decently but quickly went downhill, the problem is that I'd invested too much time to just stop reading it so I thought I'd just breeze through it. Wish I had just stopped while I was ahead. The characters are all flat and annoying with no depth. The plot was the most elementary one in the book. The mid section was pretty atrocious, it turned into nothing more than a dull history textbook, the author didn't even bother to craft his history lessons in uniquely.

I wanted my red pencil as I was reading it - poorly constructed sentences, large expository sections that seemed inserted solely to show the writer's research, characters so illogical they could never have had the careers assigned them. There are so many points in the book where the suspension of disbelief is simply impossible. Oh, the next piece of the puzzle is under this man-made lake? Let's just put on these handy wetsuits and retrieve it. Oh, it looks like we need to visit Turkey - no passport, no problem, just hop on the plane. The archeologist has some cognitive dissonance about the contents of her 2000 year old find - let's just get rid of it. Each of the final few chapters ends with a ridiculous cliff-hanger. Maybe it works for TV but it only had me guffawing. Absolutely not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"Don't you just hate wasting money and more importantly time?

I think that people would have scored it a lot better had there been no such thing as Dan Brown or The DaVinci Code. It just felt like Khoury was biting off Brown's style... and not writing as well as Brown either. I didn't like the ending either; as others have said, it was quite disappointing. However, the chase was fun. I found it a little bit lame that Khoury insisted on scattering Armenian links all over the place, but didn't really follow through with that. It seemed a little forced. I'm 99% he is Armenian (Khouryan?)... If that was the route he wanted to take, he could have just made the main character Armenian. It was just vague references to Mt.

After investing the time to read the entire book I was really let down by the actions of the main characters. The only way that the end could have been more disrespectful to the readers was if Tess and Sean had sex on top of a pile of science books. I was honestly wishing that Tess had thrown herself off of the cliff instead of the journal. She was an annoying character throughout the book, but especially so at the very end.

I turned the pages hoping to find some real literary imagination, only to find hackneyed and predictable plot lines and adolescent dialogue.

The museum raid was enjoyable high concept. However, this is one of those rare books that I just could not finish. The characters simply did not act rationally -- it was a case of plot necessities all-too-obviously driving actions the characters took, rather than the characters' actions empowering the plot. Any story can be written when the characters' actions make no sense, but such stories do not necessarily deserve to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not as good as I had hoped","review":"While I loved the beginning chapter and the imagery of Knights in Armor robbing the Metropolitan Museum it soon became trite. There was the obligatory Catholic Priest who assassinates all those who might present a threat to the Church. Then we have the troubled FBI Agent who has his faith tested, and of course the beautiful, highly intelligent, archaeologist who captures his attention. The whole premise of a Gospel of Jesus shows a lack of knowledge of the time period of Christ's life. Very few people could even read in those days, and everything was written by hand using very expensive materials.

The motivation of each characters were flimsy, none of the character do anything that makes sense. I don't feel any thrill, any rush, or any sense of mystery when reading through. Upon arriving at the conclusion, you sort of felt empty, there's really no sense of satisfaction.Don't expect a page-turner. There are better book worthy of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not even rate one star","review":"One of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read. It would have been interesting story, however, it ended up being contrived, predictable and utterly horrible. I had such high hopes for this book and kept hoping that it would get better. It got worse. I rarely ever get rid of any book and I could not get this one out of my house fast enough. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another DaVinci Code-wanna-be","review":"Mr. Khoury obviously tried hard, but the end result was a definite bust. I finished the book only because I was on a trans-atlantic flight and needed to read. Some characters he develops well - others not. Some aspects of the plot are good - some so shallow it's inconceivable. Seems to be another DaVinci wannabe to me - one that I cannot recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Despite a great beginning, the book soon becomes a run of the mill novel on grand conspiracy theories and the \\"evil\\" church. The plot has potential and could have been great in the hands of a better writer. Even Clive Custler could have made this one a rip snorter Dirk Pitt adventure. Khoury fails. I skimmed the last 50 pages just to get it over with. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"Structured like a Clive Cussler novel, with its repeated flashbacks, and a thinly veiled homage to Nelson DeMille's normal cast of characters -- tough New York FBI agent/cop; stunning, divorced damsel and daughter; colorful background characters who offer history lessons -- this turned out to be a book that I found just too easy to put down. Predictable, capitalizing on the Da Vinci code genre, unengaging, and cardboard characters. Some action but little suspense or ability to identify with the characters. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"The only redeeming quality would have been if the author had shown courage at the end. While plowing through the bad characterization (people who were good and then bad and then good again, or bad again), the unromantic love affair, the dubious research (chestnut horse with black tail and mane!)I hoped for a courageous ending, but feared the worst. Cop out. Outrageous cop out.Sorry, I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"...but not the last novel","review":"\\"The Last Templar\\" is pleasant as a police novel, but with an expected plot and end: there are, as usual, the clever girl, the good and the bad guys. If we take out the Templar touch, it becomes just a novel (well-written, but obviously according to a technique). Let's add some interesting historical information and we are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religion Explained on a High School Level","review":"The book is a light and airy read, with enough action to keep one going to the end, and the Templar passages are intriguing. But just for once it would be nice to read an author who has a better grasp on religion than your average precocious high school senior. Please, the Enlightenment took place 300 years ago - could someone let Mr. Khoury know that there is a whole world of theology out there that fills the void between blind faith and blind science. The book would be immensely better without its poor attempts to insert religious philosophies - well, except that then it would not have much of a plot at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping on the bandwagon","review":"Such a dissapointing book!!! The plot seemed transparant from the off and the characters just seemed unbelivable. The book seemed to want to cause controvesy without actually offending anybody it was just weak. The story, plot and writing were like a secondary school essay not something that I expect in a bestseller. It read like the author was just wanting a large pay cheque when the film rights come through. Just dont read it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot Boiler","review":"Hmmpf! A waste of good reading time. A plot like many others. Written for the movies, witness a chase scene early in the book that is gripping. But very strange, with a Monsignor from Rome who is an assassin and in league with the CIA. And the de rigeur love scene between the pretty but smart archeologist, and the steely-eyed FBI man. But as disturbing as anything is the jacket blurb, in quotes \\"It has served us well, this myth of Christ\\", attributed to Pope Leo X. Important to say, those who have researched this say he never said that. It is one of the \\"urban myths\\". The Publisher and Khoury present this as an actual quote of the Pope. The book is rife with anti-religious sentiment. The author takes an aside in one chapter for an interesting review of the history of the templars, but that can be gotten elsewhere. If you want to read it get it from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I agree with a few of the other reviews. The first few chapters are very promising. The last few are a complete bore. This is the \\"poor man's\\" Da Vinci Code. Very uninteresting. One of the worst. At sometimes it was completely predictable. Other times I knew more than the characters did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author shows little imagination in developing the plot and the characters. The story starts off quick and exciting and then it tailspins into a black hole. Do everyone a favor, collect all these books and destroy them, so nobody has to be tortured by reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the Greek Tragedy is saved by the Chariots of the Gods....","review":"At least the Greeks invented a way to whisk in and save face for the Author, when the basket ball during playoffs begins to deflate. This book started off with so much mystery, intrique, and on and on. And that carried for quite awhile until it comes down to...believer vs. nonbeliever with so many of the same o same o. Arguments basically of 'can you see it' or 'is it faith'. At one point I also became confused as to which original Templars were the focus of the historical view, and down hill from there. And the Coup de Grace'....leave the evidence alone. Don't peek. I was disappointed, and for the first time in a long time I wanted to fling the book. Weak. Wasn't worth my effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Templar: A Great Read.","review":"How do you define a great read? Is it the readability of the prose; the strength and depth of the charactors; a hint of realisim and reality interwinded with imagination and the grandest of scale; the locations; the interaction of all the aforementioned? I you are looking for any or all these attributes, pick-up this work by Raymond Khoury. The story is absorbing from the first chapter, with tight cohesion and a steady and consistent flow. Easily a weekend read, with a \\"can't-put-it-down\\" quality that maintain one's attention without pretension or overzelousness. This is worth the cover price ... here's to the value and love of a fine work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"Don't waste your money like I did! Where to start? ...how about all of the Catholic-bashing that goes on, the author is not a religion hater, this we know b/c he actually seems to legitimize the Muslim prophet, while bashing everything that Christianity is based on. Plausability is lacking in everything from the \\"CIA-cleric\\" to the absurd romance between Tess & the FBI guy, who can't bring himself to date anyone because he is the product of a Dad who committed suicide...(I guess I missed the psychological link here!) The author figures he doesn't have to give a plausible story...any old story will do. People survive unsurvivable situations without the least bit of modern medical assistance. I would never buy anything from this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Templar","review":"This book was obviously written to capitalize on the Templar craze that followed the release of The DaVinci Code, and it fails mightily. The reader experiences no connection to the characters, and the prose is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't put it down","review":"The Last Templar was an exciting, page turner. I didn't get much done at home until I finished reading it. Riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code Pt. 2","review":"Initially I found this book interesting and a decent read at first, but as the book wore on, it became apparent that its not much beyond a cheap Da Vinci Code knockoff. The characters are weak, feel a littl forced, and the plot feels like a Choose Your Own Adventure fill in the blanks device. Its like having deja vu; I kept asking myself 'Haven't I read this before?' Additionally, the ending is a huge, lame disappointment that sacrifaces the search for truth for a willful delusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why Hollywood makes such terrible movies!!","review":"As many of the Amazon reviewers noted -- the book starts out well then goes into stock characters, juvenile logic, improbable dialogue, and clich��d action. Examples abound: FBI agent with issues, female \\"hero\\" with newly found James Bond agility and strength, \\"hero\\" who won't confide in police/FBI because of a daughter, villain turning to crime because of Catholic tenets, etc. Bought it thinking it would break new ground on the Templars, but it just became a rework of DaVinci Code.Two thoughts crossed my mind as I threw this book away. First, I now understand why Hollywood uses hackneyed scripts -- the screenwriters have very few fresh ideas. Second, I guess this \\"novel\\" received good reviews because the story aligns with the elite critics' worldview.One of only a few books I have quit reading, and thrown in the garbage can. This \\"novel\\" would make a great send-up parody in the Airplane-line of comedy. Stay clear of this \\"novel\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In spite of the well-written first half of the book, this novel becomes predictable and agenda-driven, rather than developing an exciting climax - although the author did try to do so. I was not engaged in the last quarter of the book and simply scanned to get to the end, especially the preachy parts concerning Christianity. It has all been done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Potential to Bad","review":"I have never written a review of a book, game or movie but I feel compelled to write this. I must loudly echo the majority of reviews of this book. The Last Templar had a great deal of potential at the beginning of the book. It was exciting, good premise and potentially strong characters. However, after the first strong 74 pages or so, it progressively began its downward spiral into c*&p. Please, be careful when deciding what book to read next as I do not recommend this book. P.S. - the 2 stars are for the beginning of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"It is a great opening scene, with four horsemen, dressed as Templars, riding their horses up the stairs of the MoMa. But from there the fast paced action rather leaves you hungry for more substance. An archaeologist joins forces with an FBI agent, they go traipsing around the globe searching for the reason \\"why\\" and of course it all ties in with the Catholic Church and its history... In a similar vein to all those Da Vinci Code wannabes Raymond Khoury managed to keep the pace fast enough that I finished the book before realizing there was something missing. In a review I noticed that Raymond Khoury is a screenwriter and it definitely shows... this is one book where I would probably prefer the on-screen version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I expected a strong characters in this book. I expected a plausible plot based on history. I was grossly disappointed. The author used a weak minded, easily swayed FBI agent, and and Atheist girlfriend in an attempt to disassemble Christianity and the entire bible. It is very anti-Christ, and subtly pro-Muslim. The FBI agent lacks the character to maintain his own lifelong held beliefs and in the ending, the girlfriend/anthropologist does the world a favor by not exposing an ancient autobiography, showing Christ was not the son of God but simply a carpenter who could read and write. In her unlikely quests, you'd think she at least could have found Obama's birth certificate. A weak book that simply reflects the authors personal frustrations. I don't think I want to read any more of his books and I understand why they are discounted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely reads like a straight-to-video movie","review":"This certainly isn't the worst novel I've read recently (I read another supposed historical thriller before this one that takes that title) but it's not very good.The plot is interesting. It had the potential to be a decent genre novel, but from the start I was troubled by the just plain basic lack of writing skill of the author. The characters are all pretty shallow and clich�� and the dialog is pretty mediocre.I kind of had to force myself to finish the novel, but I'll admit by the very end, I was actually drawn in enough to enjoy it.From this novel, I would surmise that plot is Khoury's strength, but he needs to work on the many other aspects of the craft of writing. If he can do this, I think he could become an enjoyable writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Not worth reading! This book starts off amazingly exciting but then takes a turn for the worse by spending more time explain the plot, which is driven by historical myths, than actually having characters interact. Most of all, it presents Biblical rumors as fact which I fear may cause people to actually believe the stuff in this book is indeed true to life. The ending was very poorly written, no surpise ending or exciting conclusion to the unveiling plot. Definitely wasted my time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I wish I could give negative stars to this dribble.I'm a crusade junkie so that's why I bought the book. I know it's fiction but at least get your facts straight before you write! Too may \\"truths\\" and \\"facts\\" are just the opposite and can be easily disproved by just a little investigation. The 4 gospels were false? PULEEEAZE! I'll not spoil it for the \\"Christian haters\\" but as far as I'm concerned, from my hand to the trashcan. Don't waste time or money on this claptrap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Non stop action along with some interesting history made for an entertaing read. Not since Da Vinci which I could not put down over two years ago, this was a page turner.Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but didn't like the tirade.","review":"The story is good if you can tolerate the anti-Christian tirade he goes into in the book. He goes on and on. Enough already, we get it, you don't believe in God. Any way I liked the story except for the bashing and the ending which was not believable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Found this text to be poorly contrived and written. Holes throughout the book. Example (spoiler alert)... 2 protagonists reach a remote damn in Turkey, miraculously find and don some diving gear and dive to the bottom of a murky lake. They recover hidden artifacts burried deep in a sealed grave in ruins of a medieval church under (guessing) 100 feet of water. All this is done in a little over a couple of hours. Believable? Nope. A lot of anti-Christian overtones. Uses story line to dismiss cannon Gospels through allusion to the gnostic Gospels without ever discussing the Pauline portion of the New Testament. Glad I listened to it via audiobook while mowing my lawn. Did not miss much because even with the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD...","review":"I got this book based on the premise and was initially engaged. Early on, the action moved briskly enough that I was willing to overlook its faults: The prose was flowery and cliched, the characters a little one-dimensional. Think of the genre featuring the 'brilliant, beautiful headstrong ' and you've got it down pat.Not surprisingly, there's also the 'gifted-but-haunted-by-past-demons' FBI agent' and the associated cast of stock characters.Of course, nobody acts remotely like a real person and a series of unrealistic actions mixed with coincidences keep them all moving toward the inevitable conclusion.That said, I initially enjoyed it in spite of it faults and found it well paced. Eventually, though, it bogs down in a love story and its need to connect the dots with lengthy historical backstory.I wish I'd liked it better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Believable","review":"I won't rehash the plot or the lack of depth of the characters as those have been discussed in other reviews more than satisfactorily. I could get through all of that if the plot lines, and the actions of the characters, are believable. In this book, they are not. I don't have the book in front of me (I tossed it) but there is one scene midway through the book where one of the main characters abandons the other while in mortal danger - completely implausible. What is even more unbelievable is that, later on, the two characters reconcile in spite of that - ridiculous. Save your money and spend it on a different book - there are many other great ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hacking away......","review":"I bought the CD collection for a friend, who then gave it back to me. I listened to 1+ CD and then gave up, realizing I had wasted my money. It is hack writing with hero's who get out of an endless stream of impossible situations when they long ago should have been dead or at least maimed, somewhat like the old TV show, \\"The A Team\\". This is \\"gimme a break\\" intrigue and adventure. My advice is to not bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest common denominator","review":"This book starts off interesting but quickly devolves into a horrid mess. The characters are very one dimensional and the plot leaves you with too many \\"Ya, right..\\" moments. It really looks like a \\"written for TV\\" type book with it's plot and way too predictable ending. Save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting Error & Weak Storyline","review":"Purchased this book a few months ago and just picked it up to read. Big mistake because now I can't return it. The formatting is jacked up. Chapters are out of order and the pages are bind upside down. So now I'm flipping trying to find the next page and when I do, I have to turn the book upside down to read it. I've never had to work so hard to read a book!FBI agent Reilly is incompentant and should be thrown out of the bureau. As for the storyline, I guess if I was of the catholic faith, I would be pretty upset. The catholic church did a lot for preserving early Christian history and writings but it also was a major player in polluting the faith for personal gain. My opinion, choose another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to be disappointed","review":"Very interesting beginning, decent, if somewhat formulaic middle, and a complete disaster of an ending. The ending left me frustrated and angry by his complete cop out. Angry enough that I can't bring myself to read anything else of his to see if his writing has improved. Even if it has, I don't think I can forgive him for the ending of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations, quiet results","review":"The Last Templar: I had high expectations when I started listening to this unabridged audio book by Raymond Khoury. The book opens with a set of events set in the days of the Templar knights. Then jumps to modern day New York. As the story evolves, it weaves the historical story with the modern day search for a stolen Templar artifact. The search for the artifact is mostly a detective story with a serious bad-guy having stolen the artifact.The characters are well developed and interesting. The historical story line is interesting, but, the today's story line is a typical detective novel. I would say the ending was a bit disappointing; a quiet ending rather than a bolder result.Yes, the book is interesting, but, I would suggest there are other books that are more powerful and interesting. You can skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I kept reading hoping that the book would somehow make a \\"turn\\" for the better, and become worth reading. Never happened, and I am upset I wasted the time with it. Clearly, a knock-off. It is a shallow love/action story with a dash of \\"holy grail\\" lore thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Ain't No Justice","review":"I haven't read other reviews so I may be repeating what others have said. This book was by far one of the worst-written I have ever read. It absolutely fries me that it became a best-seller. I can only credit this to the author's success at capitalizing on Da Vinci Code Fever. The plot is hackneyed and the resolution infantile. The characters are of the sort one daydreams about when imagining writing a book. But the writing itself is this book's most amateurish feature. The passive voice is used throughout. Almost all the action takes place in the recent past, tied to a character's reflection with the overused word \\"had\\". Colorful verbs and adjectives are far overused. I have to assume that it comes across much, much better in translation, because then it will have passed through an editing process. This author relied too much on his thesaurus and evidently was not introduced to an editor; or if he was, that editor should be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I already did not like the book by the time I finished the first fifty pages, the characters were horrible - cliche after cliche - seriously read like the makings of a B movie.I finished the book - skimming over large chunks of it,it was too predictable - the female lead - divorced mother - self sufficient - yet vulnerable -the male lead - fbi agent - tortured past - fear of intimacyI wish I had enjoyed it even a little - there was nothing redeeming about the book except for the ideaI'd love to see this redone - with someone else writing it - and new characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the train to leave the station!","review":"I had high hopes for this novel. I rarely read fiction and thought (mistakenly) that this would finally be a book with which to shift gears. The subject has facinated me for decades and I find myself, like others, thirsting for another piece or two to fill in the puzzle, albeit fictional. Unfortunately, this novel never left the station for me. The story is like the mile-long coal trains I use to watch in the Southwestern United States. They are very, very slow to start and at the point when you believe they can attain a reasonable speed, they slow down at every curve or incline. I found myself growing increasingly impatient with the story line. And the pace? Commuter traffic in DC is faster. I'm going back to the realm of nonfiction and anthropology!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, silly plot, waste of time!","review":"If you like REALLY formulaic books with poor over-used plot lines, telegraphed twists, and dialogue written by a high school student (with no prior writing experience), then you'll love this book. Otherwise don't bother. Really. Even for the usual airport pablem, this was laughably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author simply wimped out at the end","review":"Great premise and VERY strong beginning. Had very high hopes for this book. At the end, the author wimped out and decided to be safe and have the \\"big historical find that will shake the foundations of the world's religions\\" suppressed.Makes me wish the author had had a stiffer backbone or simply not written the book at all. If you aren't going to finish what you start, don't start it to begin with, Mr. Khoury..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Worst Book Ever...","review":"Okay, I've given some scathing reviews before, but this book is by far the worst. And all of this is aside from the horrible writing, the simplified plot, and the one dimensional characters. I'm going to have to look into what movies this guy writes, because if his novels are this bad, one can only imagine... If you're the type of person that has to finish a book, no matter how horrible it is, I strongly urge you not to buy this book. It's awful the entire way through, and the ending is the worst.*spoiler* What annoyed me the most was that a week or two on an idyllic Greek island convinces an archaeologist that a book written by Christ himself is better destroyed than revealed to the world - without even having a clue what Christ had written?!?! A writer, who had the courage to jump onto Dan Brown's gravy train, is willing to tell the world that ignorance is bliss?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh - the hours I'll never have back","review":"This is the authors first novel. It shows. The work wouldn't have gotten nearly as much attention without Dan Brown. The plot was ok - but predictable. The dialog was wooden. And the basic grammatical structure of whole elements was too rigid. Take a look at how characters are introduced - the same form each time.I didn't hate it. But I wouldn't recommend it, and I certainly wish I had read something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible novel","review":"Glad to come here and see I'm not alone in thinking this was awful. It did indeed get off to a fair start but quickly peters out. Following some of the same territory as The Da Vinci Code it is unfortunate that it's nowhere near as satisfying. Poor writing, ridiculous love story you see coming a million miles away and the ending gives up so it's not satisfying to anyone. I kept with this thinking (hoping) it would have a payoff but it ended up being a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blazing Start but Disappointing Finish","review":"This was a very unsatisfying novel that gets off to a memorable and exciting start but quickly turns into a mind-numbing read. The premise of the Last Templar has some promise and will grab the attention of fans of the Da Vinci code, but the execution of the story leaves much to be desired. The characters are flat and the reader never feels compelled to root for against any of the major characters. Some of the scenes are outrageously contrived, and by the time I got to the end I was rolling my eyes in disbelief. I suppose it's true that the first ten pages are what sell a book, but the last few hundred will keep me from coming back for more from this author.This is quite possibly the most forgettable book I've read in the last two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Templar","review":"Hi,I don't want to go over what others have mentioned, but I really enjoyed this book. I am a \\"historical nut\\" for no better word, specifically medieval history, so this definitely made for an interesting read.I will mention one detail some might not know. The \\"Falcon\\" was a Templar ship which left Acre in 1291, and was commanded by Roger de Flor (Templar Brother-Sergeant). It did not sink on it's way back to Marseille or Atlit, where he had delivered important people and riches to the Order.He was later accused of stealing some of the wealth, and supposedly used the riches for other adventures later on he was famous for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Vinci Code wannabe","review":"A mediocre attempt to ride on the coattails of the successful blockbuster, The DaVinci Code. Like the DaVinci Code, it has an anti-Catholic, anti Christian theme with poor scholarship that is presented as fact. IT is a modern day 'thriller' with ties to the past and a fanciful history. Could have been fun if it was less melodramatic, with better writing and less of an agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"All sizzle, no steak..","review":"I overcame the incredibly poor writing, the completely ridiculous \\"decisions\\" made by the characters, the practically copied premise (from Da Vinci Code) all to find that the author rushed to tie it all up neatly at the end, without caring what he had led me to believe about the characters. It isn't so much the ending, as the fact that the author invests absolutely no time to make it a reasonable or believable result.Ridiculous. Thankfully, it's such a poorly written book and such a laughable premise that we'll be spared the movie version. I have never had such a visceral negative response to having read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been so good.....","review":"This started out as a really good book. I was hooked in the first chapter. Then about halfway thru the book I was hopeing that he would kill off his lead female charcter. When you cant connect to the charcter anymore the book is very hard to finish. I did finish but i wish i wouldn't have wasted my $15 dollars. There was not enought background information about the Templars and you never find out what was in the journal they found. BIG dissapointment!! I will try the next book this author puts out, but i will be getting it used. What is so sad is that this could have been a really great book........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"Yes yes I can hear you saying William dosn't stand for poorly written fiction regarding The Templars, Christ and enough good old fashioned intrigue to full a pleasant afternoons Sunday reading, but you would be wrong ! All these raw elements together make the perfect ingredients for a wonderful tale. And dear reader that is what frustrates me most about \\"The Last Templar\\" despite all the right stuff the final result is a shocker. The start has merit but them falls quickly into predictable clap trap that when you finally turn the last page you are more relieved that satisified, sadly another poor copy of that nickle and dime work \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", well off to read another work, sadly coming to the belief that if you want good qualitity about the Templars you have to head to the Non Fiction section of the library. Would some one please prove me wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really quick read","review":"Anybody thinking about reading this book would be well advised to just go to their local bookseller.

Lame prose, problems get solved so quickly and easily it's a wonder this \\"mystery\\" wasn't solved earlier, and the \\"love\\" story is ridiculous. Apparently Turkey will have no issues with an FBI agent running around it's borders and the CIA and Vatican are working together but no details about why or for what purpose. The ending tries to be everything to everyone but fails.

This book is utterly bad. The characters start shallow and stay shallow. The storyline starts fast but drifts even faster. The dialogue feels contrived, and the narratives are tiresome.

However, this book caused me to buy a speed reading program because it definitely is not one a reader would wish to savor unless he is looking for something to substantiate his lack of faith in Christ. It's a bit good for that, but it's really not good even then because some ignorant carpenter from Nazareth is not going to sit down and write a diary - duh!! He's probably not even going to know how to spell Aramaic if he does speak it. Didn't people used to say, \\"What good could come out of Nazareth?\\" Of course, I'm a believer in Jesus Christ as my savior. I know what good came out of Nazareth: intrensic good.

Based on the now familiar secret-religious-history-conspiracy theme, the book opens with promising scenes of a daring museum robbery, but quickly degenerates into a series of absurdities that are easily punched full of holes. The characters are a group of cliches, not at all interesting, and the budding romance between the two major characters reads like a Harlequin romance on quaaludes. The writing style is unimaginative and uninspired. Mr. Khoury writes as though this were merely an outline of a story, to be fleshed out later. Unfortunately, he never fleshes it out. In half-page sketches, Mr. Khoury runs through scenes that should have taken whole chapters. I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash less than half finished.

Dan Brown's Da Vinvi Code doesn't come near. This is the book the Cathlic Church should have gotten upset with. Fast pace with the reluctant to put down. Story swings from now to the past during the last days of the Templars. Lot of cloak and dagger setting along with mystery and archaeoloy.

I am not even going to divulge more into the plot, because this book is simply 500 plus pages rip-off from \`DaVinci Code'. Please spare yourself if you love Brown's book. I started to read this book when I was vacationing and after a couple of hours of reading I rushed immediately to the end of the book expecting exactly what will happen.To author and publishers: please stop imitating others people work. I know it's easy to make a dollar on somebody's famous work, especially if somebody is already established screenwriter like Mr. Khoury who probably doesn't need much effort to convince publishers to publish his work. Try to be inventive and come with something more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Templars book","review":"It seems that in the last couple of decades a new literary tradition was established: the one about bringing out a novel about Templars every year or so. Within that custom, Khoury's book is just that: another Templars book.I was initially excited about reading this novel, for have had much buzz both book and t.v. series. The story caught my attention strongly at first, but around halfway it seemed clear that there wouldn't be a satisfactory way of finishing the whole thing. As someone said, the characters are really cliched and one-dimensional, like taken out from a collectible card game. The ending was just appropriate to the most-to-least plot; at least the author didn't try to overkill.Any of Dan Brown's books is more interesting, and I'm not great fan of those either.

His voice for the female lead seemed at tad annoying, but I figured that was in part the writing.Then we get to the French dealer in precious artifacts, and it becomes clear--this fellow just can't do accents. He even mispronounces words in ways that are absolutely clueless, e.g. pronouncing Louvre using two syllables. Other foreign words are similarly mispronounced, or the narrator strives just too hard to try to get the accent. A half-decent producer would have been a big, big help.The audiofile review says that \\"He's a master of emotion and accent, whether he's channeling an Italian cardinal or a Turkish thug.\\" Maybe there's another secret edition of this that I missed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Almost Had Me","review":"This is a good read, except for an overly long and flabby mid-section.The first third of the book held promise, especially with an original 'take' on the Templar secret.This, however, was killed by the self-involved, sketchy main characters and a politically correct, lawsuit-proof ending.The movie would be a good property for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

The plot is contrived (what a coincidence that the one Templar expert our hero 'Tess the Archaelogist' knows happens to be the evil genius behind all the mayhem). It reads like a B movie, where you can't wait for the boring chase scenes to end so we can get on with it already. So after plodding through over 400 pages, hoping for at least an imaginative Templar secret, we find our author has chosen to use the Templar secret and his plastic characters to argue the entire foundation of Christianity is a fraud. Too weighty of a subject for such a light-weight of an author. I fast-forwarded through the last hundered pages, confident I wasn't missing a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, may I have my money back?","review":"Bought this book at the airport to kill time on the 5-hour flight home from LAX. I could have read the United Inflight Magazine backwards and been more entertained.What a contrived load of hooey. The writing was stilted, predictable and IMHO, poorly edited (how many times can you REALLY use the word \\"stygian\\" in correct context?).I found myself skipping loads of the dialogue and wondering to myself \\"If this book is available in audio format, would it really SOUND as bad as it READS?\\"Life's too short to waste on bad books, so I dropped this stinker in the seat pocket around Chapter 72 and left it for the United clean-up crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Apparently, like many other readers, I went into this book with high hopes. Nothing like suppressed religious history to get the juices flowing. While it did start out well, the LAST TEMPLAR rather quickly degenerated into a stereotypical thriller with all the baggage that comes with that label. I ended up skipping long passages in the latter stages of the book just to avoid reading the tedious prose that was used to describe mundane matters. The \\"villain\\" was the same as in every other book of this type, the heroine as well. Even the revelation of what it is they are hunting came as no surprise. Or rather, it was an interesting concept doomed by poor writing. At the end I simply did not care what it was everyone was searching for or how the world might change if they found it. The most interesting parts of the book were the four short sections set in the time of the Templars.

I didn't think the instructions were very good, poor quality pictures with only basic bows - one style; not boutique bows, which I was looking for. And the device itself was poorly made. It was more effort to get the bows into it than I think was necessary. When I tied them off they were uneven, everyttime. I went through an entire spool of wire trying to practice and do better but it just wasn't working out.

It would be nice to have something to follow the DVD with, but it's just as easy to purchase some ribbon as well, unless you are a total beginner and have no idea how much to purchase.

Buchanan supports his thesis with a comparison of world history. He seems to want to mix church & state. Writes that less government is better and supports the 10th amendament (states rights). Supports our (Americans) inability to defeat a faith based enemy (terrorist) without a faith based force of our own.This book is worth a critical read, Buchanan makes some valid points. Yet, he seems unable to seperate his religous faith from his political beliefs. There seems to be a close relation to the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Bush; similiar to Viet Nam and President LBJ.The reader needs to make their own critical analysis. I am neither a liberal or a conservative and attempt to make a fair analysis, unlike most of the posted reviews so far.

He still lives in the world that the jews killed jesus so support for Israel is bad. he believes in dialouge with muslims who would kill us, and he believes that any conservative who disagrees with him is a 'neoconservative'. BTW Pat the original neocon was Reagan. liberalism is the cancer that \\"neocons\\" and traditional conservatives can agree on, but Pat is living in a old mindset. the kind that got us into trouble before WWII, with an isolationist belief. if you want pat at his finest read 'death of the west'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damning Review from a Conservative","review":"I bought and read this book to discover that not only \\"liberals\\" but also a known conservative, has real doubts and concerns about the Bush administration and the direction in which is taking our country.

After reading this book I KNOW I WAS RIGHT in my estimations of his qualifications and challenge anyone to find his facts or conclusions in error in any signifigant way.

When he discusses something that sounds like substance it is actually repetitious referencing and selective information gathering. Never deals with oppositions arguments and only presents his own presuppositions as gospel. This man is a hard core isolationist both in foreign policy and fiscally. While some of this rubs against notions of what is helpful it is really just a case-in-point that even a broke clock is correct twice a day. This man does not love the truth, he only loves his ideas and they are weak and poorly thought out. All that said, I actually agree with him in regard to the disaster of the Bush presidency and don't expect much better from Mitt Romney who will be president in about six months.

The first half of the book focuses on what Howie CAN'T DO which puts a very negative connotation on disability for children who dont know about disability. Finally in the second half of the story we hear about Howie's dream to be able to push his wheelchair as fast as his friends can which after all the talk of what he cant do makes his accomplishment not seem like that big of a deal... which to a kid with a disability is a HUGE deal. The pictures are also very out of date... the wheelchair Howie is in, today would be motorized and there are other kids in the class who have leg braces which would not look like that anymore which for kids would be very misleading because it wont look like any kids they see with disabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids know nothing...","review":"It seems whatever is being pushed aside these days..I tend to embrace it.

Why do people kill each other instead of helping each other? That's a question I ask myself when I see movies like this.Nevertheless, this is a superb movie.

It just went from people arriving, to the comitee meetings, and then to Mother Abigail leaving, then to \\"The Betrayal,\\" then to the stand. Just like that.

The actors and actresses were just perfect for the part, in particular Gary Sinise (Stu), Bill Fagerbakke (Tom), Adam Storke (Larry), Molly Ringwald (Fran) and Jamey Sheridan (Flagg).I guess you have preconceptions as to what people are like after reading a book and in this case it was Nadine, Harold and Nick that did not match my own. But the story and its presentation is brilliant - a long horror flick with just the right amount of edginess. I only wished it had been eight hours and included a lot more of the desert crossing with Tom and Stu or the pre- Boulder days.This is a real treasure, one that will stand up to the tests of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good vs evil!!!","review":"this is the best Stephen King book and movie. it is so well done and it keeps you involved throughout the whole movie. i love most of King's movies but this is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"I received the dvd in a very timely manner i was very pleased with that however the quality if the dvd was very poor i expected better quality and wonder if i could of gotten better quality from a used dvd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never read the Book.","review":"I know that if I had read the book this movie would have been better to me. I have always been a big fan of Stepehen Kings movies but I thought the acting and characters were awefull in this film. From what Ive heard when talking to people that have read the book they say that the onscreen performances in this movie are nearly perfect. So while I didnt like the devil character he may very well have been do a great job. So if you read the book you should definately purchase this DVD becuase you will most likely love the adaptation. If you havent read the book this movie may come off very cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all like the book","review":"I truly didnt enjoy the movie compared to the book. So much is out of proportion compared to the book. Alot of the characters are not the way I imagined them at all. Its a movie worth watching, but if you want to experience the stand, read the book. Trust me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"The most important and most interesting elements (to me) from the novel are missing. The casting is all wrong, which leads to the weak, unconvincing acting. From the way these characters act, you'd think they were going on a fun-filled trip to Disneyland. They don't act as if a plague has wiped out most the population. Poor all around. One of King's best novels is ruined by a TV adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"M-O-O-N, THAT SPELLS LAME!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sorry King, nice try but no cigar. Looks like TV had to cutback on necesarry sex and violence just to make it a PG rated hunk of X-Files abstract. This movie could have worked...COULD have..but just turns out to be flat and boring and far too long...Rob Lowe however gave the only worthy perfomance...Lame FX and even worse acting make this a stink and a half.

The movie is pablum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FILM IS ON A SCREEN NOT ON A PAGE.","review":"PUT SIMPLY, I FELT THAT THIS MOVIE DID A GREAT JOB OF CAPTURING WHAT AN AUTHOR WROTE ON PAGES OF A GREAT NOVEL. MOST OF THE CHARACTERS WERE TRUE TO THEIR DISCRIPTIONS IN THE NOVEL; AND SO WERE THE IMAGES OF THE SCENERY. THAT'S WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT THE FILM. THE ABILITY OF ALL PARTIES INVOLVED TO DO A GREAT JOB OF CAPTURING ON FILM WHAT THE AUTHOR WANTS THE READER TO IMAGINE WHEN READING HIS NOVEL. THE BOOK DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF THAT AND THE FILM WAS WORTHY OF THE NOVEL. THIS WAS A GREAT ADAPTATION OF A GREAT NOVEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You got to be kidding!","review":"Good review Lauren. I agree completely. Considering King is such an enormous phenonmenon you'd think they would take a book like The Stand, which is amazing, and do a grand movie production with good acting, good special effects, and good directing. This movie has none of that. It's a sappy, corny piece of junk that does nothing but degrade the book. The book was so powerful and the movie was so boring! I was looking foward to a good relationship with Stu and Franny and got zip. Molly Ringwald (?) was a LOUSY Franny!One thing about this story (book or movie). Did anyone notice that in the midst of the whole \\"good versus evil\\" thing that the heros of the story had nothing to do with vanquishing the evil? It was merely an insider (Trashcan Man) and the \\"hand of God\\". The heros from the Free Zone did nothing whatsoever! Strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this movie","review":"Well made movie, good acting, direction and so forth.

The movie is horrible. Horrible !!! The plot, the acting, the actors, the directing, even the lighting !!! ... a dumb B movie at best that could never do justice to such a great book. Sorry Gary Sinise, I love you in other stuff and it's not your fault, you're probably the best part of the movie.What could have been turned into the greatest apocolyptic movie of all time was instead made into a version so watered down it's almost unrecognizable.Re-read the book instead, and if you're looking for a good apocolypse on DVD ... rent or buy \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" instead.Ugh this movie was bad.

However, the movie was suppose to have 4 tapes (which is the entire movie). However, I only received part 1 and part3. I was very displeased. I then, notified the seller of the matter. He said he apologized for the problem and that he would send me the other parts or refund my money back to me in full. But to this day, I am still waiting for money or tapes. Please do something about this matter. I will, from now on, think again before purchasing anything from Amazon.Com.Please make this right. Thank You. Melissa Ashton"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we see the same movie?","review":"This movie was so lame. I like Stephen King and I read The Stand which was OK if a bit too long. This had to be one of the corniest movies I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but as soon as everone got together at the end to form their new society, the corn-ball factor went up about ten fold. The whole scene reminded me of hands across America. This was not horror in the traditional S.K. vein. In my opinion, The Shining is still the all-time best King movie ( one which King himself hates ). King's biggest problem in my opinion is his total inability to write convincing dialog. His characters are always saying the corniest things and don't relate to each other in a believable fashion. M-O-O-N, that spells cornball. Anyone remember \\"beep-beep, Ritchie\\"? Who talks like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great themes and plot...bad movie","review":"This movie was very mediocre. It was unneccesarily long, over 6 hours. Many scenes could have been removed to enhance the continuity and coherence of the movie. Also, The Stand was more like a movie made by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It's more of a religious movie than a science fiction or horror movie. The cinematography comes nowhere close to an actual film, one can obviously tell it was made for TV. And finally, the characters and the roles they played were not believable. They seemed so fake and artificial. I was very disappointed with how this movie was constructed. I recommend not wasting 6 hours on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda - cheap and blatant","review":"I feel that I genuinely wasted my time watching this excessively long DVD (TV series).It is a cheap production, proving how celebrity does not equate to talent.As for the moral of the story, it would probably appease many, and reinforce their monochrome ideas and perceptions of good and evil.....Oh!

Just like everything that's adapted from a book, it left certain things out and the effects were cheap...but CGI was new back then.Following a deadly plague that kills most people, the survivors of the plague have a dream about a black woman named Abagail Freemantle (\\"Most people 'round here just call me Mother Abagail\\") calling people to her. The survivors also have dreams about \\"The Walkin Dude\\", a.k.a. Randall Flagg. Some people join with the 106-year-old Freemantle in Boulder, while others join up with Flagg in Las Vegas (the modern-day Sodom). Basically, it's about the struggle between good and evil with people caught in the crossfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Representation But Read The Book For More","review":"I was a bit skeptical about watching The Stand after having just finished the book. While I was disappointed that certain parts were left out, I was mostly pleased with what was there. I think that the characters chosen were great, although Molly Ringwald just does not pull off the part of Fran.I loved the commentary that King gives on this DVD. He talks about characters, motivations for writing the book, and general views about scenes. I would recommend it for King fans, but be aware that it is not the same as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book to Movie Adaptation!!","review":"Anyone who reads the book before watching this movie is going to be somewhat disappointed. Well, take into consideration that the book is over 1100 pages, and it is filled with detail. That would be quite difficult to make into a movie, even an 8 hour one. The movie had a great mood to it. It's just one of those films that leaves you feeling a little creeped out. The acting was pretty good. Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, and Rob Lowe played their roles very well as far as I was concerned. I was disappointed with the way the Darkman (aka Randall Flagg) turned out to be on screen. He was very creepy in the book, but on film he came across pretty much as being a joke. The plague itself was spookier than Flagg turned out to be. Overall, I felt that this movie followed along pretty closely with the book. However, the book (as in most cases) was better, so if you don't want to be disappointed, I'd recommend watching the film first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation","review":"This book needed the 6 hours of movie. It was very long and complicated of a story. To do anything less than a mini-series would have been rediculous. This is so well casted and written, I have watched it many times! Gary Sinise is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I am a relatively new fan of Mr. Kings work. My first exposure to his material was when The Stand miniseries aired. I recently read the book and find the movie adaptation to be just about as complete as you could hope for.The performances are good, with some nice peaks into the early works of some now well known actors.The only disappointment for me... in both the book and the miniseries.... is that ending. Won't spoil it here. For me it was a sort of \\"thats it?\\" moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I never knew DVD had region, and if it's not in your region it wont play in your DVD.

I wasn't going to take the time to send it back because i'm a very busy woman. Thats why i do so much ordering on line.. So now when i want to buy a DVD i buy it at my local store to make sure it will play in my DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the book---","review":"---and the book is the weakest thing King has written. At least in the novel King is able to take us inside the minds of the dozens of characters who populate this never-ending story. The film is only able to present each character's ticks (if that guy had said M-O-O-N spells whatever one more time, my foot was going to go through the TV!!!) rather than present them to us as real people.To be fair, Gary Sinise does his considerable best, and Laura San Giacomo manages to overcome the scraps of character she has to deal with. But what actor alive could possibly play Randall Flagg? Certainly not the unfortunate in this movie.The faults of the series are the faults of the book: Overlong, Pretentious, Predictable, Overly Convinced That It Is Conveying Some Kind Of Message About Good And Evil. Sadly, the virtues of the book are nowhere in evidence. Namely King's amazing ability to create living breathing characters that engage our attention and affections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie at the Start, but the Ending Ruined It","review":"I give this two stars for a special reason. I watched the movie, and for the first 5 and a half hours, I thought it was fantastic. The acting was well done, and it was also a fantastic story. This all stopped once I saw the ending. I won't give anything away, but the basic point is that a superflu wipes out almost everyone, leaving only a certain amount of good people, and a certain amount of bad. The point is that the good people, led by a woman who can hear god, will make a stand against the evil people. The problem about the ending is that there did not need to be any good people for the evil survivors to be deafeated. This makes that entire movie pointless. To me it seems like they had a great movie, but when they realized that it was already siz hours long, they had to stick on a quick ending so that it wouldn't be any longer. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to waste six hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer BEWARE!","review":"I was surprised that my DVD was in the wrong format for U.S. viewing, be careful, the sellers don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLIANT","review":"This is another one of my favourite movies of all time.

The \\"Mother Abigail\\" character is hard to take, and the contrived contrast betwen the \\"good\\" town (self-righteous Boulder, CO) and the \\"wicked\\" Las Vegas is just too much. Still, it's hard not to like a movie that begins with Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" as background music while everyone croaks! Worth watching, for sure!

Gary Sinise played Stu Redman very very very very very very well, and this also goes to everyone else. The novel was better, but at least Stephen King didn't try to make it a two hour movie! Some scenes are disgusting, all the dead people rotting away, for example.Unlike other Stephen King novels, The Stand isn't really made to frighten you. It does make you think about how the world would be if a disease broke loose and killed us all.This is a great movie, despite the fact it is 6 hours long. Rent this movie, you WILL NOT regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bunch of actors, great plot, cheezy ending","review":"Everything except the \\"hand of god\\" coming in to save the day was stunning. The special effects weren't over done, the development of characters was excellent(Kudos to Corin Nemec - remember Parker Lewis CAN lose in this one), and the extra features on the DVD such as the making of and commentary audio track definitely make it a welcome addition to any collection. Besides, how many other DVDs can boast a 6 hour+ movie on one disc?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"Stephen King's The Stand is a novel of such epic proportions that it cannot possibly be turned into a move or mini-series. As hard as the producers of this mini-series tried, all they accomplished was to prove that it couldn't be done. They just had to leave too much out.What's really an enigma is the casting. The producers clearly made an effort to get top-notch actors, but that's all they did. They didn't seem to take into consideration the tiny little fact that the actor they signed might not fit the part. Gary Sinese is a great actor, no doubt about it, but as hard as he might try, he can't play a tall, lanky mid-40s good-ol-boy Texan named Stu Redman. The same goes for Molly Ringwald. Can that redhead possibly be convincing as the teen-aged, blond-haired Franny? I don't think so. Rob Lowe as Nick? Don't even get me started on that one.I wanted to like this film. I really did, but I found nothing but disappointment after disappointment in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of buying vhs tapes","review":"I know for the price I paid, I shouldn't complain.

I respect music that takes chances, breaks the norm and packs passion. During one listening session to \\"Be\\" w/ the headphones on, I dozed off into a mellow sleep only to violently waken to the countless screaming violence and chaotic samplage. The flow to this epic drags the listener over spike strips. The entire album goes down like a box of nails. It is a painful and unpleasant listen. At least old Ministry albums gave the listener an adrenaline rush. In between the shrapnel of samplings \\"Be\\" is just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcompensating bombast","review":"Typically epic release in this subgenre, here from the Swedish rock-progsters. And by epic I mean overstuffed and overlong. While not as cloying as say, some of Aryeon's output, the album still suffers many of the same character flaws mucking up the modern progressive rock genre. Diverse and melodically ambitious, much of the rocking just feels tepid and a lot of the progression just overly theatrical at the expense of sincerely engaging. Still, enough will work to appeal to that small demographic who appreciates their rock aggressively orchestrated. The few songs which do translate an unabashedly power-cheese vibe without overcooked vocals, clunky interludes, or overworked instrumentation could appeal to many more for their bold, albeit partially cliched melodic strokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prog at its Worst","review":"Normally, when I hear people criticize prog rock/metal as pretentious, self-indulgent, and musically masturbatory, I dismiss their remarks as coming out of anti-intellectualism or an inability to appreciate complex, challenging music. But, not this time. This album is a caricature of progressive music. It is bloated, pretentious, and unlistenable. The song titles are utterly ridiculous, the voice-overs silly or even stupid, and the concept, hackneyed (for this genre). The instrumentation, sadly, is no better. I forced myself to listen to this album several times, hoping it would get better, but each time was torturous. My girlfriend, who is not a metalhead, was present during one or two of these agonized listening sessions and I will never forget the look of disdain she threw the stereo. For a moment, I felt embarassed to be a prog metal fan. But then I just decided to throw this CD in the garbage. That way no one else would ever have to suffer through it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"POS is an amazing group but this album stinks.

The rest is spoken word and sound effects.Not worth the wait if you're a fan that was waiting since the last album. Also, it's not heavy and it doesn't flow. Concept, perhaps, but there's no music and the lack of flow is annoying. You can't turn up any tracks on the radio because there's no realy music.Pass over this one, unless you're looking to complete your collection just because.This should really have been a Gildenlow solo project and not a PoS record."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO","review":"4 stars?? 5 Stars??? Man - what are you listening to?? This is quite possibly the most boring and most disappointing release of 2004. Too much artsy fartsy crap that goes nowhere , no hooks and just plain bad songwriting. If you like this then you must like other horrible bands like Tool and Radiohead (yes , they DO suck). I have been a fan of P.O.S. since day one but this is too ambitious and too much of nothing crammed into nothing. NO NO NO , this is bad progressive music - now please pass the Ayreon , Evergrey , Enchant and Threshold for real progressive music. FORGET ABOUT THIS DUD - FILE IT WITH TOOL AND RADIOHEAD AS THROW-AWAY GARBAGE. BLAH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book!","review":"This book was full of surprises! I thoughly enjoyed the refreshing style the writer has and I especially enjoyed all the wonderful people she wrote about. I have searched long and hard for true stories with \\"heart\\" that a runner like myself can enjoy and this was certainly it! I wish I could meet the author and shake her hand! I happen to be an animal lover too and it was a delight to read about Bubba and Elmer and a few other animals in a running book. I am telling everyone I know to get this book if they love running or inspirational stories. I will also mention it to non-runners that want to understand what running is really all about. I did a lot of laughing and also had a few tears roll down my face as I read each chapter. I had something to look forward to each day as each chapter is about a different person. I felt like I was running right along with a few of the runners she knows! Great book! Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a demo CD than a real one....","review":"This is undoubtedly U2's worst album. It feels like a homemade demo CD, or perhaps it's leftovers from the vastly superior Achtung Baby. Regardless, it's not a particularly good CD, poorly crafted, written, and performed. The first single, Numb, feels like a backing track without any enhancement. While this can work sometimes in music, it doesn't here. It ends up feeling cheap. Lemon is a little better, but still has that cheap, sinking feeling. The best songs on the album are Stay, Faraway, So Close (from the Wim Wenders film), The First Time (a lovely ballad), and the great closer, The Wanderer. The Wanderer is a great U2 song, with stunning lead vocals by Johnny Cash and a great, brooding lyric that reads like Cash wrote it himself. The CD booklet cover art is stunning as well, like the cover art in Achtung Baby and Pop. If you're a U2 completist, pick it up. If not, you can safely ignore it (except for The Wanderer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great scenery","review":"Typical 1950's western yarn. The plot is very simple, the acting is actually very good..

Not only is she an incredible live performer, but her artistry continues to improve with every CD release. Larkin is not your typical run-of-the-mill coffeehouse chanteuse with a guitar. She is an astonishing singer/songwriter/guitarist, energetic and eclectic in her rhythms and moods. Her musical explorations spin around the world, and she continues to create vibrant, intriguing songs. Also check out her latest release \\"Regrooving the Dream\\". Patty Larkin is a satifying listen, kind of like finally finding a really good, smart novel. She is a rarity, very cool and hard to come by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After being so impressed by Tango and Angels Running, I was SO ready for another great album. But, Strangers World just didn't do it for me. It was missing the interesting rhythms of the other two, and, frankly, there was nothing on it that grabbed at my feelings the way I know she can.

If it's not a classic, it should be. It's up there with Menace II Society and Boyz In The Hood, classic hood movie-wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"The previous reviewers have pretty much summed it all up. This is a great American movie. The theatrical release completely passed me by, and I only recently discovered 'Fresh' by reading the reviews on Amazon. Buy this movie, it will have you rapt with attention. The story is deep and the details many, so much so you will need more than one viewing to take it all in. Great performances all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best. In a class by itself.","review":"After watching Fresh, my friends and I all stood staring at the credits for 5 minutes. It was the same kind of silence that characterized watching \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"Braveheart\\". Warning, however, the movie is not so much inspirational as it is emotionally raw. Well worth the time and tastefully done as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very very best morden drama","review":"It tells the story of a clever 12 year old brought up in the culture of danger, mistrust and urban decay. Sean Nelson displays a maturity which would guarantee any adult actor many millions a film, and the film never wavers from the incredibly high standards set by its fabulous scripting and casting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"No, I don't own this video, but I was flipping thru the upper channels and come upon this movie. First let me tell you I am a white middle aged suburban women, not the type of person this movie was made for. But I have to say it blew me away. It was visually assaultive in it's realism (as I can only assume growing up in the \\"hood\\" to be) The main character is both a likeable intelligent young man and at the same time a manipulative scheemer. As a result of his manipulation many lived are ruined or ended. And all this is done with a minimal of emotion until the final scene. It is hard to \\"like\\" anyone in this movie, but the movie itself is very likeable. Very very unusual film, and well worth the time to view it. I am not sure I need to own it, but I am glad I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite movie.. no joke.","review":"most people will watch this, and go \\"what is happening?\\" .. and just not get it when it is over. it is a complex journey through a short time frame.. and it's a true gem. and copelands score is brilliant.

Well I came across this movie on one of the movie channels a few years ago and thought is was a great movie. Since then I've been trying to find it. I'm glad I finally found it on here, for a really good price. I thought the story line was interesting. Sean Nelson's character \\"Fresh\\" is a refreshing change, cause though he's surrounded by drugs/violence he doesn't get pulled into it all. I love how he plays the game. I'm not a movie critic, I judge movies based on whether or not I won't get out of my seat or change the channel if its on. With that said, this is an entertaining movie that's worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting Peformance Poorly Recorded","review":"The first thing I noticed when I started listening to this recording was how closely the solo violin was recorded (and both soloists in the double concerto). The violin is given no breathing room by the microphones. Consequently, I never listen to this recording. It is one of the worse sounding recordings I own. What a shame, because it's my favorite performance of these pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Key","review":"I wouldn't say that this CD is the best... it's the worst! Don't buy it.

Everything was played half-step lower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this one, it's the same, and cheaper too.","review":"Don't make the same mistake I made, expensive is not always better in the realm of classical music. This is the same disc as its full priced counterpart, and it includes an HM catalogue. Seize the day on this price, it's got Andrew Manze and Rachael Podger. Remember, anything that Andrew Manze touches turns to gold, and his cohort, Rachael Podger shines and sparkles like a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrill. Murky.","review":"I was looking at a few of the glowing reviews and trying to remember why I donated my copy to the library. On the 'real' key - in Bach's day, A may well have been as low as 415 Hz, not the 440 Hz we use today, so that's OK.But the review by Baroque Music Lover is completely accurate. \\"Tinny\\" and \\"harsh\\" are words I remember muttering, and it's a recurring flaw with Harmonia Mundi recordings. \\"Murky\\" is definitely appropriate. \\"Painful\\", too.Freiburger Barockorchester, where is your version?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE Sound!","review":"I love the soloists, I love the orchestra, I love the performances and, of course, I love these concerti! But WHY did the engineers, or ANYONE who listened to the takes and did the final editing think this was a good recording??? The mikes are placed practically INSIDE the violins!!! It has the most strident and harsh sound. This recording reminds me of the early days of DDD recordings that were so awful. I have alot of Harmonia Mundi recordings and they are usually stellar in the recording area. This one misses the mark by light years. Sad, as Mr Manze and Ms Podger play their hearts out. You could by this recording as a good example of bad miking and recording technique. Might help someone studying to be a recording engineer learn what NOT to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, terribly recorded, save your money.","review":"Disappointing, terribly recorded. The microphone work is unforgivable. The violins are shrill, yet murky, the rest of the ensemble muddy. The pace, particularly of first concerto much too fast. There are several superior recordings of this material: Monica Huggett's is similar but far superior. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I have heard these pieces many times by many artists. Heifetz, Stern, And others I can't remember. Bach happens to be my favorite classical composer. Live: I've heard the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra & New York City Ballet Orchestra tackle the Dbl Concertos in D Minor. I've seen the Paul Taylor Dancers skip, hop, slide and roll to this music in \\"Esplanade.\\" In my humble opinion it is the best collection of these solo & dbl violin concertos. The smallness of the orchestra keeps it from getting that bloated ponderous sound that many other versions have. The tempos are crisp, driven, the period instrumentation, informative and oddly 'fresh' a very human imperfect, yet wonderful recording. There is this boldness, that sounds almost sloppy, but I know it to be the wrecklessness of sheer perfection. Listen to these on headphones so you can hear every nuance every sweeping stroke of the bow."},{"rating":"1","title":"would be a great product if.....","review":"the manner in which this item was packed garrentees it won't arrived intact.Shame would be a nice product otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the early years of John's career!","review":"Only recently did I learn that John had made his own version of \\"If I could forget to breathe\\" a long time ago, and then I found that the album \\"Temporary Road\\" has been discontinued. Happily, I found a private supplier on Amazon, and I promply decided to buy the CD, which was used but in fine condition.There are many great songs on the album - Looking forward, The Gypsy Life, Vinnie Charles is free, All that hammering, Can you understand my joy; those are my favorites but the others are also high quality for the most part.What makes John stand out is his characteristic baryton voice, coupled with gentle guitar picking, and really fine poetry put into songs.

The iFinder is up and running in less than 2min, with a clear view of the S. horizon. It is just as accurate and dependable as other, more costly GPS WAAS units in our hunting club. The included US map is fun to use but not something for anyone wanting/needing a serious road navigation unit. I experience no major problems using the unit while driving. I highly endorse the iFinder Go 2.2 for anyone seeking an accurate and dependable WAAS capable GPS. If you need expandable memory and detailed road navigation, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was okay","review":"I bought this as a gag gift for a friend because her neighbors are Swedish and when they invite her for dinner they serve only meat prepared with salt and pepper, no other spices. There are no sides served whatsoever, no vegetables, no starch. I thought there would be more recipes in this book. There were some pretty photos of food, but I would have liked more extensive photos of life in Sweden at Christmas time. The people, the culture, the traditions. I would have liked to see more of what the houses looked like decorated at Christmas, and more photos of people engaged in holiday pastimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GOOD BOOK","review":"This is a really good book. It gives you a full picture in your head about what each author is talking about. I recommend this book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very scary","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I'm a fan of R.L. Stine so I picked this book because of his reputation. However, the stories did not go over well on the 7 and 9 year old boys that I had hoped to entertain. We tried really hard to make them scary - sitting around a campfire at night and reading in a scary voice but it just wasn't possible. They didn't find the stories scary and at times, I would skip to the end of a story because the boys were completely bored with it. If you have kids that really like scary stories, this is not the book to buy. They will likely get bored of the stories as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"What kid doesn't like R.L. Stine? My boy read it a couple of times and will probably read it more. It's a hard cover - it'll last forever! Really happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its always good to share the blues.","review":"Kristen Hall's latest and most mainstream album left me breathless from the first listen. Anyone who hears this album will find at least one song that relates to them. For me personally it was \\"Open Arms,\\" a song of part-time-lovers' angst. But this isn't an album of self-misery; one can also find acceptance in \\"Following My Compass\\" and OUTright rage in \\"Proud Man.\\" And, just to put the cherry on the sundae, guest vocals by Indigo Girl Emily Saliers on \\"Following My Compass\\" mesh and harmonize with Hall's raspy voice so well, that one would think they were made for each other. All in all, a brilliant effort by a very tallented songwriter who is not afraid to show a full range of emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant but unmemorable","review":"I first bought Kristen Hall's \\"Fact and Fiction\\" on a whim after listening to a few tracks on a store listening station. I wasn't disappointed. Kristen has a raspy but pleasant voice and sings wonderful folk-tinged songs with real heart.\\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\" is more produced and consequently the worse for wear. The songs aren't as catchy either and all start sounding the same. This was a problem with previous albums like \\"Fact and Fiction\\" too, but is even more pronounced here. This is one of those albums that you listen to for a pleasant background noise, then when it's over, you can't remember any of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"we have been using a few different sign language series for our hearing child.

This album combines super-fresh, head-nodding beats with on point and intelligent lyrics.

Now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Album","review":"My boy Yates put me on to Tak and Ryu and this CD and I thank him to this day. This is one of the sickest records I have ever had the pleasure to purchase. The beats are refreshing from the BS that is played over radios. My heart is most definitely underground when it comes to hip-hop and this album is truely one for the hip-hop head, I suggest you cop it whenever you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome","review":"Styles of Beyond's debut album is a modern hip hop classic. So many hip hop groups are signing with major labels these days (J-5 and Dilated Peoples are both currently working on albums for major labels), it's great to see a truly underground hip hop group. All the tracks on the album are great, but standouts are \\"Styl Warz\\" featuring Rhettmatic, and the absolutely amazing \\"Winnetka Exit\\". That song has the greatest lyrics I've heard in a long, long time. Styles of Beyond reminds me of A Tribe Called Quest in their prime, with a bit of Herbaliser thrown in, while still maintaining a very unique sound. But if you consider yourself a fan of hip hop - or music in general - do yourself a favour, and pick up \\"2000 Fold\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"binary star","review":"binary star's \\"masters of the universe\\" is a timeless hip-hop classic. Period. Solid beats, solid flows delivered in that oh-so socially conscious underground style that will soon slap the mics out the hands of weak, ignorant artists like Jay-Z, Ludacris, or Missy Elliot. If you like Heiro, Living Legendz, or any of that ill underground stuff pick it up. Oh, and \\"MC D\\" is it? Kid, you're nothin'. I been wipin' the floor with flamboyant moronic punks like you since I was 12, kid. I produce, rap, and play guitar kid. You're NOTHING. Your idiotic comment about how rap is NOT about putting your 2 cents in and speaking on your perception is the stupidest thing I ever heard. You have no clue what you're talkin' about. How can you rip anybody on a mic listenin' to techno and havin' no clue about the definition of hip-hop. Once again- you're nothin'. Don't speak cuz your \\"2 cents\\" mean nothin'. FAIRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard way better.","review":"I bought this album after hearing their work on Fort Minor's recent release. The beats are less than innovative and, frankly, just don't hit very hard. The vocal styles aren't bad, just not my cup of tea, and the rhymes didn't show me much either. I'm guessing they learned quite a bit in the last few years b/c their work on The Rising Tied was far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"yeah its pretty good. All the lyrics are bomb diggity, but most of the beats lack that certain sumthin that makes you want to slap your pappy. Also, there isnt much consistency within the album. There are a couple of very entertaining jams like #9 and #10, but some of the other tracks are relatively boring and mundane. Overall, a pretty solid effort because the lyrics make up for the shortcomings in production."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beats and lyrics come flowin smoother than smooth.","review":"Best cd I ever bought.

Glueck integrates his story development along with and through his characters in a spellbinding way. The events unravel at an increasing rate and draw the reader into the action.

The occasional weekend warrior will appreciate the smartly structured storyline, Glueck's colorful delivery, and vivid characters, such as Lee Wilson, the wide-eyed Everyman who finds himself in the middle of the action. The Rambos of the reading community will note Glueck's obvious talent as an astute researcher, paying great attention to battle, weaponry, and geographical detail.

Alec sneaks a ride to Arabia, and after some dramatic close calls and fights in the desert and some interaction with a pretty girl, he decides...well, I won't give away the ending.

Even though I understand Russian, listening to the behing the scene voice (by the way, it's Nikita's Mikhalkov's voice) is annoying and takes a lot from the movie appreciation. I totally agree that this movies deserves a standard treatment with the choice of languages and subtitles.

The movie, although made about 40 years ago (1973?), is still as relevant as it was then. I use the concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics to investigate the premise of the movie, that people could live off of eating people - in the form of Soylent Green. Students have to model and calculate how long the human population can exist if everyone had to consume only Soylent Green wafers. In fact, at about 160 days, only 3 people, very hungry people, would be remaining. It's a great movie, and the authors/movie makers/etc. had great foresight.

It is very 70's era, where cultures and movie making methods were in dynamics. We found it entertaining, re-watchable (after 20 years). The plot is different and, I thought, excellent. It is another \\"the world degrades in the future\\" film, but with a unique twist. It is not just a re-warm of another film. Heston does a great job in the film as does Robinson (his last film, I believe.. #101). It was well-done and is a collectable. Wish it was out on DVD.

The picture is exellent throughout, with little in the way of artefacts or colour bleed and contrast levels are strong. The picture can be soft in places, not in any way distracting, and ultimately is a result of the original film elements, now over 40 years old.The extras are sparse, consisting of a short making of, footage of a party and a commentary. The image qualty of the extras is medicore at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to watch this old movie with such horrible production quality","review":"I tried to watch this movie...heck it was free....but the horrible production quality and sappy acting made it easy to shut it down.

The story is ok a detective tries to uncover the murder of a man who learned the secret of Soylent products. Almost everyone who discovers the secret dies. The film is a good image of the future and a haunting image of what we eat.

Charlton Heston, who plays a state investigator discovers that Solent Green is made from recycled dead humans! Most of the scenes in this movie take place in the homes of the privaleged few, homes that are much like ours today . Robinson , Heston's roommate plays a great supporting role .

It just goes on and on with virtually no plot, no character development, lousy acting, [bad] music, unimaginative sets, and [bad] diaglogue. Otherwise, it wasn't too bad.

Unfortunately, Saturn is no Mars - despite its name it's not even in the same solar system.Saturn is bogged down by way too many characters. Secondary - rather tertiary - characters abound, showing up once or perhaps twice in the 400 pages. It also suffers from a lack of a clear protagonist. Eberly is the primary person, but he is certainly not someone the reader sympathises with. His fellow conspirators are worse - cardboard stereotypes. Holly is an interesting young/old woman (ambiguous age due to cryogenics) but her emotions yo-yo from one male to another, and it is hard to care in the end who she ends up with.Potentially climatic scenes such as the posse call are left flat, as the persuasion that Eberly so effortlessly used for hundreds and thousands of people inexplicably leaves him in a room of fifty.Very disappointing. I would suggest reading Mars a second time and pretending it has rings rather than reading Saturn."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of gas","review":"Dismal writing performance. Just as blah as Clarke's Rama series. The good SciFi writers have all run out of gas. I picked up the book thinking it would be a science adventure like Foster's The Dig, only to discover it was about politics as usual, and maybe 10% reference to things of science. The characters were stereotypical, and you could match item for item how the story was put together with his own SciFI writing method he published. For an early teen audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"This book is possibly the worst so far of Bova's solar system novels and it was actually quite an effort for me to finish it. The story relates the voyage of a space colony out to Saturn and basically follows in minute, plodding and predictable detail the various power struggles amongst the colony elite as they seek to gain control. The premise of the story is pretty incredible to start with. Why would anyone send a space colony of 10,000 inhabitants out to a previously unexplored part of the solar system anyway?There isn't any excitement or wonder of exploration as in 2001 A Space Odyssey, for example. The characters are all the usual Bova two dimensional unbelievable types and even the science, which is occasionally a good feature of Bova's novels, is missing.I'm going to have to think long and hard about whether I want to buy any more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gift for pain","review":"This book was so bad it was painful.

Basically, the characters are extremely dry, weak, and/or naive beyond belief. Secondly, common with sci-fi stories, there's no spiritualality. OK, for this story, in the future, man dumps God and all religions and uses religion as a mere tool. But that always leaves a gaping hole.

The characters, especially Holly and Eberly, are cartoonish. Eberly gave a speech that was supposed to rally the population to the cause of self-government. The speech was completely ridiculous and yet the attendees were on their feet, cheering him, an ass of a guy they had never heard of or seen before. When Eberly starts the speech with \\"Each of you has received an announcement...\\" and someone in the crowd says \\"I didn't get an announcement,\\" the head of security \\"glared and pointed; two husky young black-clad men converged on the man.\\" And then they just stood there. It was stupid--I couldn't read any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeding the future","review":"First- this isn't bovas' best work, but I still think it was a good read. It expands nicely into the grand tour idea. For me I saw it as a way for him to seed the future once he was done with the solar system.

It would have been nice if the company that produced the DVD would have digitally mastered the sound as it did for the video. I have the volume maxed on my television and I can barely here the audio.

Shirley Jackson is proud (the sorry 1999 trash couldn't come close...). This will be coming out soon on DVD, and I can't wait. The Widescreen version has been shown often on TCM. In my opinion, there are only 3 GREAT Ghost movies: this one, \\"The Innocents\\" (1961 with Deborah Kerr), and \\"The Uninvited\\" (1944, Ray Milland). I can't think of another film that used the viewer's imagination to create terror, without using smarmy special effects. Finally, a DVD!! So...when do we get \\"The Innocents\\" & \\"The Uninvited\\"? Do the studios know that this is what we want? They're putting so much garbage out there...where's the class? UPDATE: The DVD is quite fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Masterpiece!","review":"The Haunting is the prototype upon which the haunted house genre is based. Poltergeist, Amityville,.. all followed in the footsteps of this classic film. In the early days of film-making, directors borrowed on the theatre for their techniques, not other films of similar genre. Because of the limits of the stage, fancy special effects and horrifying images were not possible. Instead, the audience's immagination was engaged in the creation of the story's atmosphere. That, and clever light and sound design. Never underestimate the power of suggestion! Too bad modern film-makers no longer have this advantage with today's savvy and cynical audiences. Julie Harris is one of this century's great actresses. She has stood the test of time, and so has The Haunting. You will not regret your visit to HillHouse, though you will find that those who walk there, walk alone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunts me 50 years later","review":"Any time a cast is equally split between English and American actors, a production runs the risk of appearing schizophrenic.

Horror is one of my favorite generas of film, but this one just seemed too campy. I mean if you watch this film their is a silly narrators voice and it kind of goes through the history and events that have led to this house being so evil. The feel of comes off like old news real footage that can't be taken seriously. I have no problem with old films either, I love frankenstein, Dracula, and The Mummy as they have a feel and styling that earns merit.

In the group is was with, I was the one scared then, but did not have nightmares while those not scared at the time had nightmares.Wow, have I changed. I found this to be a movie about catty women and less-than-reputable men. This is not a scary movie, it is a psychological drama set in a scary house. The cinematography of the house is great. The visuals set the stage for some scary stuff. Unfortunately all that happens is some chilling pounding in the night, \\"breathing\\" doors, and an unexpected vissage.I would like to get myself in the frame of mind I had in those days long ago and see this movie and get scared again.

Short answer is none.The 2003 release aspect ratio is shown as 2:35:1, whilst the 2010 release aspect ratio is shown as 2:40:1. Although it sounds different, the 2:35 aspect ratio is actually 2:39, as is 2:40. So they are the same. It's possible, of course, that the quality of the 2003 disk is better. Companies are always trying to cut corners. But the two releases are basically the same.The mansion used in the movie is actually a hotel called Ettington Park, in Stratford Upon Avon, in the U.K. My wife and I stayed there for one night years ago and had a great time. You can find pictures on YouTube and the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GODFATHER OF HAUNTED HOUSE MOVIES","review":"THE INNOCENTS, and possibly THE OTHERS are the only movies I can think of that come close to the psychological chills that permeate the original, classic version of THE HAUNTING. The overblown remake doesn't come close. Wise makes such superb use of the camera, music, and dialogue that you can almost feel the house breathing. The acting is marvelous, and the mounting tension is palpable. Very tasty stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly worth 10 stars!","review":"This is the mother lode of ghost stories! Shirley Jackson's novel was brought to unforgettable life here.It is quite a chilling, creepy, haunting tale. I don't want to give too much away... but there is more than one haunting taking place in the movie.The first haunting is indeed a ghost. The second is the guilt-ridden haunting Julie Harris experiences as the character Nell.One of the best sinister lines comes from this movie. When the maid 'welcomes' each of the guests she explains how things go around the house, logistically. And explains that 'nobody will hear you in the dark, at night, if you need anything. Town is over a mile away. Nobody will come any closer than that. In the dark. In the night.' A little campy, but really sets the stage for what follows.I'm not giving away any more.

This version allows your imagination to create the fears and horrors to terrify you. The best thrill is scaring your self. While special effects of today are great, the directors perception may not ignite the deep inklings of fear that your own imagination can.I remember this movie as a young person and know that it thrills me today like it did then."},{"rating":"2","title":"The single scariest thing I've ever seen","review":"When I was younger, around 10, my mother told me about this movie. One night, I stayed up to watch it. I got about halfway through it before I got so freaked out that I had to stop. Despite multiple attempts, it was a few years before I managed to get all the way through it alone. This is the single most deeply frightening movie I've ever seen, although if one is enamored of blood and gore, it might not do it for you. On the other hand, it might show you what fear...REAL fear...is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST","review":"On a stormy Saturday night, crawl in bed, lights turned out, blankets pulled tight and be prepared to be scared to death.

Several times they refer to discussing this movie with author Shirley Jackson who died shortly after this film was made. It was very interesting to see the different ways the cast saw the characters opposed to Shirley Jackson's views. A peek into the mind of Shirley Jackson is a rare treat for her fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"It's on TCM right now, I've seen it before but always have to watch it again when it's on.

The black and white cinematography is tops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adaption of a classic","review":"This adaptation of Shirley Jackson's classic \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" is well-done and meets all of the expectations set by the book.

I can't praise it enough. However, I had a real problem with the DVD hanging up and dropping back to the menu about 1/3 of the way into the film. I tried 2 different DVDs (both purchased at amazon) on 3 different players, and not once was I able to get through the entire film. Obviously, this is a manufacturing defect. What I don't know is if it is just a bad lot (both DVDs were acquired in Dec. 2005), or if every copy has this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dull","review":"Before the remake of this hit the theaters I rented this version and watched it with my wife and son, who kept asking \\"When is something going to happen?\\" I must admit I felt the same. Lots of dull conversation and banter and really only one good scary scene in the whole film. One tepid manufactured scare later on turns out to be nothing at all. I guess it seemed better than it was back in 63, when I first saw it, because I was comparing it to the B monster movies of the time which were really awful. At least this was a serious film with a good performance by Julie Harris. But honestly, for me this was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"Hell hath no greater fury than this film slighted; the almost unanimous raves are sufficient to compel viewers with the slightest pretension for intelligence to fawn in servile prostration to its supposed greatness, apparently.Granted, The Haunting might have been scary in its time, but to a jaded modern audience it is nothing more than a test of stoic resistance to irritation--truly a pathetic loss considering what a great film it could have been had the execution been a bit more finessed. The technical aspects surely could be excused, but it is the directorial decision that is on trial here.With a whiny protagonist impossible to commiserate, annoyingly repetitious voice-over, contrived and stilted dialogues (did people really talk like that then?) The Haunting is interesting only for its attempt to occasion a refreshing change in the horror genre. As a piece of cinema it is a relative success; as a timeless movie for entertainment, it is an unnecessary failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad,this just didn't do it for me.","review":"When i was young this scared the hell out of me not now,not much in the thrills and chills department either.Except for the loud banging,wavy door,Grace times two appearances,and an unsafe staircase all those were good.And Elinor what a wuss a real mental case would i keep this movie?

The \\"fabric\\" on the seat is attached with a ragged line of staples that can be seen by your guests before they sit down to have their clothes ripped by the jagged edges.

The fabric was substandard quality and reaked of chemicals. The workmanship was also lacking. The tool they used to screw the back together apparently got hot and melted the fabric.

The overall quality is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"I really like Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, but the versions on this CD I don't find much different from the original. Paint It Black and Fortunate Son are disappointing because although the songs are very good, U2's sound is so different from that of the Rolling Stones and CCR that it doesn't work very well.

Those were two truly classic songs, these versions are the WORST!!! A long time ago U2 decided to write all their own material because they couldn't play covers. They still can't. Look at some of the other great \\"B-sides\\" they have come out with - \\"Slow Dancing\\", \\"Walk to the Water\\", \\"Sweetest Thing\\", \\"Salome\\", etc. those are great tunes, these do not compare.

I was disappointed that the Atlantic convoy runs in the Corvettes contained little or no action detail. The short story \\"HMS Marlborough\\" is excellent throughout giving a graphic description of the aftermath of the ship being torpedoed after leaving Iceland for home waters. The short story of the retired MTB officers and their smuggling activities was entertaining and also gave an interesting insight into the fate of many service personnel post war. My father served on a Corvette at the end of WWII as a CPO(Mech) on HMAS Cowra,the hardships experienced during wartime in these small ships were extremely trying. Little was made of this in the text. An interesting read but I admit to skipping through some pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Corvettes","review":"This is very good companion reading to Nicholas Monsarrat's longer WWII novel, \\"The Cruel Sea.\\" A collection of nine stories taking place 1939-45 are excellent examples of realism, not melodrama. The son of a prominent Liverpool physician, and whose younger brother was killed in North Africa serving in Artillery, Monsarrat began the war briefly as a member of a London ambulance brigade before joining the Navy. Readers interested in social history will learn about the Beveridge Report(officially the Social Insurance & Allied Services,1942), censorship by Winston Churchill, wartime profiteering, and leadership psychology.In comparing \\"Three Corvettes\\" to his other war novel, \\"The Cruel Sea\\": the latter, a bestseller, is a better structured story, but the former, a rivetting first hand account actually written during wartime is better journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent pictoral history of WA.

I don't think so.This type of nonsense makes everything else in the book seem less credible. When else did they make stuff up? This is the stule of elementary school biographys - not serious scholarly works.As in their dreadful book \\"Latitude\\", there is a heavy dose of pro-American propaganda in this book which also makes its accuracy doubtful.No question that Simon Newcomb was a gifted man, but he deserves better than this fictional novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Condition","review":"The producdt/DVD was scrached and unuseable.

So this is more of a review of the overall amazon experience on this item. Each and every time I received this, the ballast was broken. The problem is in the way this item is shipped. The bulb, which is very heavy is screwed into the ballast when shipping and has no other support. What that means is that there is a 3 inch space between the bulb and the shade so the normal jarring of shipping wear and tear breaks the ballast because of the lack of support. It was a very frustrating affair to say the least. Amazon handled the returns very well at no cost to me but it was still a hassle to pack and ship this 3 times. You may be better off finding a retail outlet for this item. I saw one at Alsip nursery here in Indiana but it was WAY more expensive that the amazon price. So buyer beware.

It was recharged over the weekend, but it appeared that the charges did not last more than 3-4hours. Then on July 7th 2006, it died. I sent an e-mail to VisualLand, Inc.and have not received a reply.

This is supposed to be the book for entry level Spanish but 80 percent of it is in Spanish and you don't have a clue what to do with the exercises in the first chapters because the directions are all in Spanish and beginning learners DON'T KNOW SPANISH. There are icons beside some of the lessons that are supposed to mean something but many of them do not have a key to explain what they are. You are supposed to figure out what lesson plan goes with what tape and that is also all in Spanish. The lady that teaches me who has been teaching Spanish for years and even get thrown at times.

Full of relatively pointless and uninteresting tracks. But, if you somehow came across this album, please don't let it sway you from paying the money for Boneshakers Volume II.

I usually warm up soups in the microwave and one of the ingredients invariably explodes. The last time I used this screen, I was warming up an Indian dish. I covered the ceramic bowl with it and set the time to 2 minutes. I heard an explosion or two and thought - ha! I'm glad I covered it!

It's deceptively simple: lightweight, easy to use, easy to clean, sticks (with a magnet) to the side of the fridge next to the microwave.

Nothing comes up above the screen; but oil has got along the base of the microwave on the plate and sides coming off the screen; but it is easy enough to wipe that clean. It is great not having food or oil going up on the sides and top inside the microwave.I found it easy to rinse off the oil and food that gets onto the screen.

I dismissed the complaint as some cheapskate who probably wore a garbage sack for a raincoat.Then I received and opened the item and realized what a joke this is. It is literally nothing more than a small square of flimsy cheese-cloth with six \\"bedazzler\\" jewels from a craft store super-glued around the edges. I don't know how this could be enough weight to protect anything since a light puff of steam could probably send it flying across the room.It's not the dumbest idea ever, but I feel awfully dumb for having paid actual money for it. You'd do just as well to put a paper towel or napkin over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!!!","review":"I don't blame Amazon because they are just the re-marketer for this product. This product is a farce. A 10 cent piece of cheese cloth would work as well. Weights around the edges??? I guess if you consider 8 tiny pieces of plastic about 1/2 the size of an M&M weights, then there is truth in that statement. Save your money.

The DC books (except for most of the Batman ones) from the 50's and 60's have consistently been almost painful to read. It is hard to believe how strained the dialogue and writing were in comparison to the wonderful pictures and artwork.DC seemed to still be sure that they were writing for 11 and 12 year olds and that was never more evident in this Teen Titan first effort. It was about a group of kids so they tried really hard to write it the way they thought the teens of the day talked. I was a teen at that time, and I would have been embarassed to think anyone thought I sounded like that.In short, buy this if you need to complete some sort of collection (this is my only defense), but don't buy it for the reading value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary for kids!!!","review":"This movie was more like a horror film. An entire village is afraid that a family will excavate a mine that is haunted by goblins. The child characters have nightmares that the goblins get out and chase them down, only the nightmares turn out to be true. The twist ending which reveals the goblins are actually fairies tones the scariness down, but in my opinion, came far too late after scaring my daughter and me out of our wits! In the meantime, the father of the child characters comes down with a serious illness in which he coughs up blood and will die in a matter of months.My daughter couldn't sleep the whole night after she watched it, so parents looking for feel-good entertainment for the family should beware.

Some of that is clear from the letters highlighted in this book. Unfortunately while some of the letters are quite literate, many are not. They are crude and really do not demonstrate the power of the tsunami that turned Star Trek into a mainstream ideal. Some people wrote letters that were a blatant attempt to become famous and others were just trying to pitch a lame story idea. The best letters by far were from people who praise the role Star Trek had in motivating them to achieve more and figuratively reach for the stars. That is truly what Star Trek was all about and it is unfortunate that the selectors lost that focus when they were sifting through the documented mountain of mail generated by viewers of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting renders this unwatchable","review":"My family and I like a lot of \\"bad\\" movies(Conan the Barbarian, anyone?), and are willing to overlook a lot for a good story.

My only complaint (and it's a nitpick) would be that the lowest volume setting is actually pretty loud compared to most players.Small screen but nice interface, lots of options (you can even flip the display in case you want to see it from the other side).Bought mine at the store and it came with a belt loop and arm band, no neck strap like is listed here.It was easy for me to get songs loaded on my XP box, just drag/drop like a flash drive.FM radio has surprisingly good reception.PROS: Small, lightweight, 1Gb, easy to use controls, great FM reception, great sound.CONS: Uses AAA battery (maybe a pro for you, I prefer built in rechargable)Great player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch!!","review":"There is a \\"bad batch\\" of Zen Nano Plus MP3 players. I unfortunately got one of them. I changed batteries and when I tried to play my songs that I downloaded from WalMart it kept shutting off! I e-mailed the company and they told me to run a program on the MP3. It deleted all of my songs but I had them backed up. I tried it again and it did the same thing. I called customer service and got a very helpful customer service person. He told me there was a \\"bad batch\\" of players out there that won't play the WalMart downloads if there is a new battery in them. My options are to deplete the battery first or use rechargable batteries. After 9 hours of messing around with this thing and depleting the battery I got it to work again. They said they might have a solution to the problem at the end of the summer but until then I am supposed to use low juice batteries. If you purchase this player download from another music store besides WalMart. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvin Gaye DVD","review":"Gave this DVD to my mother as a gift since she really like Marvin Gaye's music.

Having seen Ted opening for KISS I was blown away by the power Trio of Ted, Marco, and Tommy (Aldridge). Ted's songs where always Good but with this lineup playing up to his intensity, they where great. Compare the \\"Full Bluntal...\\" CD to any other Ted CD and they pale in pure rock energy. Unfortunatly the DVD bearing the same title does not have \\"Tommy Aldridge\\" but \\"Tommy Clufetos\\". The magic is gone and its just another back up band playing behind Ted Nugent not with him. Should have filmed DVD when they recorded the CD. Or not used same title for DVD.Saddly Disapointed to not see one of the greatest rock drummers ever, the one, only and irreplaceable, Tommy Aldridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portrait of a Wasted Career","review":"This film could have not only been the definitive Nugent filmography but a guitar players favorite,but is wasted by foul language & a stupid racist joke. All by a man who built his career emulating the Red Man & trying to play the Black Man's music. Instead of being brilliant,Nugent just comes off as the old relative at Christmas dinner who can't shut up and ruins everyone's moment.What a waste. Sorry Nuge, the world is changing,Bush was wrong, and Rush is still a big fat idiot. I actually broke my copy of this & put it in the trash.Buy Sweden Rocks instead, if you just gotta see Nuge.

There is no doubt in my mind that when a toilet seat can move from side to side, it will, and over time that movement will loosen the seat's connection to the toilet. When it loosens, it will allow more movement, and so on, until finally it is so loose that it's unsafe, and you wind up replacing the whole seat. These little bumpers very effectively prevent the seat from sliding from side to side, and thereby prevent undue stress and strain on the connection to the toilet.There could be some better instructions and \\"templates\\" provided to place them properly, but otherwise, they are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe-T-Bumpers","review":"These work very well to keep the toilet seat in place even with heavy use and larger people, even when you have to twist on the seat to reach toilet paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"It held the seat in place.

But this is not one of those movies. Johnny Depp's character is funny enough to make me forget I'm watching a movie that's most often described as a \\"great date movie\\" (don't let this blurb on the cover from \\"Siskel and Ebert\\" scare you off). The movie is entertaining enough to men to enjoy as well as women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Juan Would Be Proud","review":"This movie put me in a relaxed and loving mood. I don't know whether it was the story, or the acting, or the combination of both. Johnny Depp plays yet another unorthadox character, almost as if he knows that nobody can do these roles except for him. He plays Don Juan with a confidence that is unmatched by most actors today. At first the way Don Juan speaks is annoying, but after enough time one gets use to it.Marlon Brando plays Dr. Mickler, a pyschologist who is 2 weeks away from retirement. That is until Don Juan shows up. In the beginning Mickler believes that \\"Don Juan\\" is a delusionist that needs help. But after spending time with him, he starts to change his mind. The stories that Don Juan tell to Dr. Mickler start to affect his marriage (in a good way).Don Juan DeMarco isn't the greatest movie in the world. It's not even the greatest romantic comedy. However, it still works its magic on you somehow. For anybody looking for a quirky movie rent or buy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tantalizing love story.","review":"The acting is exceptional, the sound track on the DVD is crisp and clear; but the emotional state that your female partner is left in is ecstatic.

It is fun to watch, to listen and to feel. Share the experience with your significant other. It has great visuals, great lines and great music. This is good storytelling. It takes an inspired classic from Spanish literature and constructs an American tale of fantastic love turned real. Even though it's just a Hollywood tale, it is done well enough to merit wanting to see it more than once. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR ALL TRUE ROMANTICS","review":"Johnny Depp potrays a young man obsessed with love, who actually believes he is Don Juan Dem arco. Marlon Brando plays his psychiatrist assigned to Depp. Depp convinces Brando he actually is DeMarco.

Overall a very good movie for lovers and romantics at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetly romantic with a quirky twist.","review":"I just loved this feel-good comedy about a young man who thinks he is the Great Lover and the psychiatrist who is supposed to cure him, but is unable to resist the appeal of Don Juan's fantastic world.

The first and most important is the outstanding acting. Johnny Depp sincerely presents his character as a real person without caricature (any lesser actor could not have pulled this off). He is so good he is the perfect match for the great Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando is as usual unbelievably good. Just the flick of an eyelid conveys so much. He adds almost imperceptible touches to make his character real. He and Johnny Depp interact seamlessly and plausibly. Their characters draw from one another's reality reaching an understanding that is spiritual and transcendent. Faye Dunaway is outstanding as Marlon Brando's wife - one has no difficulty believing they are a long-married couple. Because of the outstanding acting, all three interact so plausibly that they are able to move the fantasy into the realm of the real - \\"Why not?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"All Star Story","review":"Aside from the all-star cast, this story takes turns you'd never have guessed.

One of my favorite Depp movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, funny, and surprising","review":"Johnny Depp pulls off a difficult role as a delusional but ultimately engaging and sympathetic young psychotic who thinks he is Don Juan. Marlon Brando is reminiscent of Richard Burton in \\"Equus\\" as a brilliant but burned out psychiatrist. But \\"Don Juan De Marco\\" is no equine tragedy, nor an equestrian romp. It does parallel Equus in contrasting the psychotic's prison of delusion and institutional walls with the about-to-retire shrink's confinement in bureaucracy and the cliches of suburbia.But this is not harshly done, and don't expect any Brando soliloquies like Burton's diatribe about touring around Greece with a suitcase \\"crammed full of kaopectate.\\"Don Juan De Marco is a gentle comedy that contrasts the reality of the psychiatrist and the patient, reaching the admittedly cliche conclusion that each has much to learn from the other.It's a fun film and a good addition to the lighter end of any film buff's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS OKEY","review":"OF COURSE THE ONLY REASON WHY I WATCHED THE MOVIE CAUSE SELENA QUINTANILLA PEREZ PLAYED A SMALL PART IN IT I WISH SHE HAD BIGGER PARTS IN IT CAUSE SHE DID A GOOD JOB AND I WISH SHE PLAYED IN MORE MOVIESR.I.PSELENA QUINTANILLA PEREZ 1971-1995"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Mask Of Another Sort\\" ~ Physician Heal They Self","review":"The '95 cinematic release 'Don Juan De Marco' is one of those films that define what the genre lovingly known as \\"chick flick\\" is all about. You've got a youthful, enthusiastic Johnny Depp in his prime emoting more inner pain and existential angst than any self respecting woman could endure, an aging Marlon Brando who probably still elicites a few fond, romantic memories from the older ladies in the viewing audience and a withered marital relationship that almost everyone can identify with. What more could you ask for?Warning: For all the males out there. Stay away, I repeat, stay away from this one. As far away as you possibly can! Out of the house would be good and don't return home until several hours have passed since the conclusion of the movie. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much much better than expected","review":"I was put off by the opening here, thinking I was in for some sort of lame costume drama. Then, with Brando's appearance as a portly shrink about to retire, it took on a sort of TV-movieish quality. Still, along the way, I got caught up in the feel-good storyline and the positive messages about the power of love and romance. Young Johnny Depp does a great job here as a delusional youngster, keeping his Spanish accent almost perfect throughout. Brando, nearing the end of his career, came up with the goods, too. Well worth a watch, especially if you want a mood enhancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"...because Life is nothing but a Dream, and dreams are just that!","review":"Wonderful movie, great for the whole family.

It is extremely unlikely that he could have any effect on women whatsoever. Every time he appeared on the screen I wanted to skip the scene.

To be honest, I'm a huge Brando fan and I think, even with his handsome looks gone, he has such a magical aura around him that you can feel it coming from the screen.

However, by illustrating it and turning it into a children's book, one is imposing a rather 'childish' interpretation on a poem which can have a deeper meaning.

In the original version of the book, 8.5 x 11\\" (approx),the illustrations are finer, more deilicate. In the new, smaller format (7 x 8.5\\"), the lines are cruder, fuzzier, and someone has added a lot more color. It detracts from the lovely, icy, wind-blown quality of the original art. In my local bookstore, they are not even able to order a copy in the original format. It's a shame. I don't know why the publisher has decided to mangle a beautiful book.

Weak Motor.","review":"Bought this for my 5 year old nephew. We thought it would make a great gift for the holidays. Then we read the instructions. Here are the cons:1. (Time)There are 4 stages to polishing and the whole process can take 17 days. Let me emphasize: the machine has to be running almost constantly for 17 days (minimum).2. (Noise)The polisher consists of a sealed container mounted on a gyroscope run by a motor. When running, the motor and the assembly are noisy. I would not buy this is if I lived in an apartment. Even in the house, I can hear it from 1 floor away.3. (Weak motor)I might be persuaded to recommend this product if not for the weak motor. The machine has a tendency to \\"stick\\". The tumbler stops tumbling and you've got to nudge it to get it going again. I started the first stage three days ago and I've had to nudge it 10 times.

Before it could finish one set of rocks, it broke. Made this horrible gear-sliding sound. We sent it back and Discovery sent us a new one that wasn't gyroscopic. Apparently they didn't sell it anymore. The 2nd one was just a normal tumbler. And while it did finish polishing the rocks, it leaked a little.

Then the machine stopped sometime during the second stage. I can't get it to go anymore. I took the machine apart trying to see what's wrong and smoke comes out of the motor when I turn it on.Bought it for[...] at Big Lots so no big loss, but I hate to just throw away brand new stuff like this, plus my daughter never got to enjoy the results of even 1 polishing cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book about being a prisoner of War","review":"I read this book within 24 hours.

Some of his literary creations have been presented in films and television specials and some of them have been presented well. Unfortunately, this film didn't quite do a good job at transferring Bradbury's novel from book print to the screen. Steiger's talents are really wasted here as the man covered with tattoos (he keeps reminding the young man: \\"....boy, these are not tattoos; they are SKIN ILLUSTRATIONS!\\") who is searching for the mysterious woman who surreptitiously planted them on his body. A trilogy of futuristic scenarios are presented here that are really shallow and slow moving to keep most viewers interested.

The title of the album refers to a 3 part piece composed by Byrd which combines classical and jazz guitar styles - it's unique, with a slightly Spanish flavor, with interwoven crystal-clear musical lines, and is immensely enjoyable.

Most of the wind instruments sound false or ARE false. The flow of the music isn't well observed (which has to be especially when everybody wants this one to sound like Bruckner), the conductor seems to know what he wants but the orchestra doesn't respond accordingly.Recording is thin and pumping up the volume made it unbearable to me.

This was one of Gary Cooper's last films, and a fitting coda to his illustrious film career. He plays the part of a fronteir doctor in an 1870s Montana gold mining camp. His medical skills are matched by his handling of his six-gun. He will need all his skills to save an immigrant (Maria Schell) from severe exposure and the diabolically lecherous gold miner (ably played by Karl Malden). The film also gives us the debute performance of George C. Scott (as a crazy preacher). Its a film about love and lust, greed and fortune, quest and redemption.

This alternate world was interesting but it was so rushed and cartoonish in some way. The bad guy Col.

A Kenny Rogers fan from Singapore could make a better video than this in 10 minutes. This lame video just shows still images of the band, no interviews, just a few quotes. It shows a few still shots from live performances and talks to 2 or 3 Slipknot fans from Iowa. The fans don't even have an interesting story. Instead, they show random people boxing, they show a male and female acting out some sort of sword fight...for what reason is anyone's guess. This video should be received as a slap in the face to Slipknot fans everywhere.

This was a great read for those who enjoy stories about WW II and the Navy. I happen to be one of those. Character development was cleverly written and brought you into the story. Convoy work in the N. Atlantic was hazardous duty to be sure, especially in the early days which this book depicts. It is the story of just one crossing with a rag-tag escort group from various nations under the command of a US Naval Reserve Commander leading his first convoy. Those under his command from other nations and speaking other languages have been doing this duty for some time so it's a story of the Yank building credibility and respect . It is a story of the pathos of battle presented in real time with no adornments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Shepherd","review":"The second book out of the 'Classics of Naval Literature' publishing that I've read, it was an excellent, albeit quick, read. My only complaint was not with the content of the text but the condition of the book when it was received -- there was a half dollar sized area of the back cover that was coated in a sticky substance that I could not completely remove. A bit expensive for how quickly it read but still worth the money I think -- once it was started it was hard to put down and read quickly enough to finish in one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"North Atlantic convoy duty should be a great subject for this fine author of the Hornblower series but sadly this novel fails.

Howe has shown time and time again that he is the master of his craft; be it electric or in this case acoustic guitar. It's a very relaxing and enjoyable cd.From the opening track \\"Distant Seas\\" to the 18th and final track a cover of Yes' \\"To Be Over\\" Howe's fingerpicking is just inspiring.If you happen to find this in a used rack like I did grab it. If not, buy it brand new, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old bugger's still got it.","review":"This album is a dramatic shift in Steve Howe's catalogue. Where he has dabbled in acoustic music before he has never recorded an entirely acoustic album in the studio. Until now. Backed by his son, Dylan, on drums, Anna Palm on violin and Andrew Jackman on recorder, piano and glockenspiel this instrumental album is brilliantly executed from beginning to end. The majority of the pieces are new Howe compositions that present his remarkable sense of melody wonderfully. There are two classical pieces with contemporary arrangements and acoustic/instrumental workings of three Yes classics; Your Move, Disillusion and To Be Over. The latter being perhaps the highlight of the entire set. Where Howe may have slowed some as he ages he is still one of the greatest living guitarists. It seems that his return to Yes has inspired both the band and the guitarist. May they both continue to create such wonderful music for years to come. This disc is highly recommended...Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful acoustic release from a master","review":"I have always loved Steve Howe. His contribution to YES is just mind blowing.

I lost a great friendship to a narcissistic and controlling individual, and didn't realize that my anger at that person was grief for the lost relationship until I read this book. I keep it by my side when I am feeling angry and consult it many times to make sure I am not harming myself or others around me more by my actions.Defoore is straight-forward and honest. He says in the beginning that a mere book will not fix the problems of anger. He suggests that the reader go to counseling along with reading his book. It is great advice.

Michael started off sounding like the typical goodlooking, tortured and sexy hero but ended up boring and a sucker. Fae Rae was an anorexic-never-learned-when-to-enjoy- yourself bore. I could not believe she fell for the Dark Lord. Who, by the way sounded unappealing and too darned thin to be a sexy hero. Also, he had absolutely NO REAL powers. I was never scared or thrilled.

This book was not written to be a medical book, but more of a story how Jimmy lost weight in one year, using the low carb lifestyle.I don't give the book a one star because it's not something I expected, but because of the nature of the writing. As you will see in many posts, many discuss the \\"conceited\\" or \\"self-righteous\\" nature of a book. This is true, but the man is writing about himself, which should a tone of this should be expected from anyone who writes a book about them-self.So, if you're looking for anything more than this, this book probably isn't for you.I just didn't like the book.

Actually, another guy trying to take your money, because he has a blog. He probably wrote the 5 star reviews for the book. This book is not researched based, his claims are not research based. Basically seems like he went on a diet and is trying to package and sell his experience.

He tried other diets before and would lose weight, but would gain it all back when he started eating \\"normal\\" again. His story is like many other people who have tried diet after diet. When he found low-carb he made a decision to follow this lifestyle for good. It was a choice he made that has transformed who is was and has now become.

Impressive debut of William Atherton and a wonderful performance of Burguess Meredith as a washed-up vaudevillian still selling dreams. Maybe we can be talking about the most remarkable entry of John Schlesinger around the riotous nightmare and horrid underworld around those awful years in what the horror of the War would have permeated all the environment; even in the land of dreams.A potent film and without any doubt a towering and personal cult movie; sarcastic and bleakest picture, hard to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT OF FOCUS","review":"I have decided to post my note just because former reviews refer to the VHS only.

Harmony Gold totally killed Macross when the redubbed the voices and rewrote the storyline to change it into robodrek, and I also feel that ADV did much the same when they redubbed SDF Macross that time around as well. It's sickening how here in America we always want to dub and dumb down excellent examples of foreign culture. So in short, this product stinks......end of discussion"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful chair","review":"This is a beautiful, stylish, and comfortable chair.

As we all know, these digital purchases, especially the expensive ones, are a leap of faith.You won't be displeased with this production, and you won't need a translator ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very difficult Kindle read","review":"This book covers a fascinating subject in great detail, yet it is incredibly dense and difficult to read. Specifically, the Kindle version often fails to separate quoted text via punctuation or font change, creating a constantly changing point of view (which rambles from language to language) that makes it nearly impossible to understand. Add to this some very poor translation and you get a read that is somewhat akin to swimming through molasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peaks, no troughs","review":"The opening track's a gem - once heard, never forgotten, and probably danced to. Has the stamp of blues standard all over it, in a rollicking Jimmy Reed sort of way. Over Nevada is a real rarity - try finding it anywhere else - and it's fab. Like a long lost Patti Page single, and a good one. Anders Osborne's track is quite tasty, and the rest is less memorable but always at least pleasant. As a whole, it hangs together very well as a rootsier package than the movie would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lake Rake","review":"Product is heavy duty and should give long life. I have used it both for weed removal and for algae removal and it is very effective for both putposes. Handle extension allows a reach that we could not normally have for most rakes and, although I haven't used the float yet, the float will be very useful with the extension for algae removal as the assembly gets a little heavy.

It may be a bit too strong for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product and Great Price","review":"When I read a product review, the main thing I am trying to figure out is \\"Does this product achieve its intended purpose?\\" and \\"Is it worth the money?\\" So when I write any reviews, I start by explaining why I bought the product and then telling how it performed.Because Chicago winters can be harsh, I was looking for a gentle daily cleanser. I picked up this cleanser because it had the CoQ10 ingredient (which I had just done some reading on) and it was affordable.Boy was I pleased! The cleanser goes on well and doesn't dry out my skin. After rinsing, my face doesn't feel as if it has been stripped dry. In addition, the scent is pleasant but subtle. This isn't a deep pore cleaner, but will remove the daily dirt and makeup accumulation nicely.One container lasts me about 6 weeks because you really don't need a lot to get your face clean. So it's a nice product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Papa Reu!","review":"Without a doubt, Papa Reu is my favorite artists of the south. The reason I like this guy is because he sounds like no other rapper i have other heard. He's not American, I think he was born in Trinidad. Anyways, This guys a producer and rapper. His beats sound real tight, and his vocals sound somewhat like reggae music. But his beats and his vocals blend together beautifully. Some tracks are smooth and laid back, and most are bangin. I reccomend this album to anybody that appreciates good music and talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classical (and classy) Bruckner Eighth","review":"Although this recording was made more than a half century ago (1955), it still has much to recommend it.Recorded in Amsterdam in June of 1955, it doesn't have the dynamics that modern recording can produce, but it also does not have the scratchiness that is often encountered on older performances.Additionally, Eduard van Beinum's interpretation may be much closer than many to the original intentions of Bruckner. Van Beinum was born only four years after Bruckner's death, and doubtlessly worked with many musicians who had previous experience under Bruckner.As to specifics, I always look forward to the apocalyptic finale of the fourth movement as a guide to judging the vitality of a Bruckner performance. This one lives up to my expectations, and it seemed that the timpani were much more predominant than they sometimes are.If you think an old (1955) recording is not worth hearing--think again! This is a classy, classical interpretation of Bruckner's Eighth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars.","review":"This video, dated to say the least, gives false and misleading information.Useless as an educational tool and not worth your 27 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"Book is cute and fun but I was hoping it would have more options involving cleaning on shells.

It reads more like a novel then I had expected. The book makes it clear that speaking in tongues as a sign to unbelievers is still a phenomenon today. However, it doesn't really answer the age old question whether tongues can be used for a prayer language."},{"rating":"2","title":"An objective and unoffensive review of Pentacostalism.","review":"John Sherrill does a credible job as he traces the roots of Pentacostalism with particular emphasis on the phenomenon of speaking in tongues. It's an easy read without being simplistic. Although it includes Sherrill's eventual embracing of the Pentacostal movement, he does not seem to lose journalistic objectivity. While much of the material is anecdotal, there is thorough biblical basis and historical fact included.As a mainline religion subcriber, I have been both curious and skeptical about the business of speaking in tongues. This book has satisfied my curiosity and dented my skepticism. The Pentacostal movement is widespread in Christianity. Those who want a full prospective about Christianity today will be well served by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced","review":"John Sherrill, writing for Guideposts magazine, was told to write an article about speaking in tongues. Reluctantly, he began his interviews and research. He soon discovered enough information to fill a book. This one.At first, he didn't even want to write about speaking in tongues. At the end of the book, he's doing it.He tells the history and the theology of glossolalia and ends with the attitude, not that all must do this, or they're second-class Christians, but more like, \\"This wonderful thing happened to me.

One lamp will now come halfway on, but the other one doesn't work at all. They have not been dropped or abused; they just haven't stood up for the relatively brief on/off cycles that this application requires of them.

If you are not trained in the dismal science you might just find this book to be dismal itself.Far too often the author asserts points and then asks the reader to take his assumptions on faith while he builds up to his grand conculsions. This can serious hamper the lay reader in being able to follow the arguments made. Those with a more in depth understanding of fiscal policy might just find the conclusions themselves to be faulty and un practicle.Written in 1996 this book is already out of date and rapidly becoming more of a hostorical document than a current events book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a \\"Caution\\" sign","review":"If you thought a book with a foreword by John Kenneth Galbraith would be a tax-and-spend, big-government screed ... well, in this case you would be right. The authors are probably too oblivious to even be embarrassed by the wrong-headed interpretations they put on such matters as productivity and the expected unending upward slope of interest rates to favor \\"the lenders.\\" This is ham-handed analysis, often shockingly simplistic and tendentious, and now getting dated of course. But I give the book one star for at least touching on some interesting subjects and being reasonably readable, even if one must be cautious about its interpretations. I bought my copy remaindered for about three bucks -- about the right price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevelle - LIVE FROM THE ROAD","review":"After seeing them twice this cd sums it all up.

The intensity and chemistry of the Loeffler brothers is unparalleled and makes them absolutely dynamic on stage. This CD could be longer, but seeing as it was released before This Type of Thinking, it makes sense. The songs are of great quality for a live CD and the music is as intense as ever. Worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, I agree with \\"monkey_brains7945\\"","review":"I was very excited to receive my copy of this bootleg, and having purchased some Pearl Jam concerts previously, I expected a lot more quality. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not comparing the two bands at all, but live recordings should have a higher quality standard than the one found on this record. I understand that they're a \\"new band\\", and their live material is quite limited, but come on! They should have picked better material to put on the record. It's very short and badly mixed. I guess the only thing that kept me from throwing it in my \\"crappy cd\\" pile, was the autographed cover. If you want live material, buy the DVD instead. It also has some faults, but it's far better than this CD.

I've loved Jon for many years but was disappointed with this. There's an old man who talks about Indian rituals through the whole thing with Indian flute music and harp accompaniment. Jon adds some of his own vocals every now and then but quickly yields to the old man's jargon and the background music. I give it 2 stars; one for Jon's voice which I love so much and the other for his harp playing which reminded of when he played harp on some of his earlier work with Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Silence","review":"--was the original name of this project, but it was released only on cassette then shelved by the distribution co. My facts may be a bit off... Anyway, in the original it was a really very nice, sublime work. Then for this release, Jon added stuff, took other stuff away, and this is the result. Still good, but not AS good. It's idealogically somewhere between the Castaneda book (The Power...) and Native American themes. It hopefully still ends with an excerpt from Handel w/ Jon's vocals in a lovely song. There's also good percussion and choral voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen with both ears","review":"As a spiritually defunct, Howard Stern listening sarcastic product of the baby boom generation, it is hard to reach me on the level that this work reached me. There is something in this CD that resonated - from the spoken word teachings of the old Indian (American Indian) who urged the children that (in my minds' eye) I saw at his feet, listening in rapt wonder - to the haunting song that ends this piece. It really brought tears to my eyes.The arrangements and orchestrations are lush, and if you believe - let the music transport you to a different place. The last song, without knowing what it was or what it meant, sounded like the friend of a teacher, relaying the importance of the man to his son after the man's death.I know, I'm whacked...but, with all great art, the power of interpretation and meaning makes it relevant.Just remember to clean up your back yard, 4 times...then invite your friends over.

It was filled with a lot of self-deprecating humor, as you watch Mr. Cameron make a complete fool out of himself. Yeah, it was good. However, he drew the entirely wrong message from the success of that book. He assumed that what people want are books that make men look like a load of laughable dunces.Well, for all I know old Bruce is a dunce, but I, on the other hand, am not. There's a well established market in America for misandrous books, and this book will no doubt appeal to such buyers. If, on the other hand, you don't like sexist humor, then you will not like this book.I hated this book, and highly recommend AGAINST buying it. 1 star is the most I give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this book to be completely dull and unfunny. I really wanted to like this book because he used to write brilliant columns, (but even those have lost their edge). I was hoping he was putting all the funny stuff in his books and that's why his columns have been so uninteresting. After reading this book I find that that isn't the case. It just seems to me that if someone has barely enough humor to write a column, a book is out of the question. Sorry, Mr. Cameron, I just can't recommend this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Funny","review":"I'd never heard of Bruce Cameron before, but the title and the cover made me want to read this book. Some of the reviewers have compared him to Dave Barry.. but I don't think he's as talented or as funny. This book wasn't purposeful so much as it was just a lighthearted look at men and how they are. Some of the chapters were funnier than others... but overall I wasn't impressed. I wasn't expercting a 'serious' book, but even so this didn't live up to expectation. The good thing about the book is that the chapters are independent of one another so you can skip around and read just the ones that interest you most."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment - a big snoozer","review":"I bought this for my mom-in-law for her birthday, because I had read an article of his that was hilarious - too wordy, but hilarious. I took a peek inside this book, and was so disappointed. It was a major snoozer. Come on man, when you TRY so hard to be funny, it's just not funny. I think he'd do better to stick to articles, not try and fill up a whole book. It just gets soooo wordy that the humor falls asleep (and I almost did) before he finishes a topic. I gave it to Goodwill, not mom-in-law. Maybe someone can save themselves some $$ and a little regret by not buying it new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic W.

Great book, highly entertaining and somewhat sneakily educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and absolutely true!!","review":"Laughed until I cried...can't decide which I like better, his meetings with his children in 8 Simple Rules or this book, which talks about men's inability to ask for directions, find things in the fridge, etc. Great book to read a little each night before bed or to give as a gift.

Real advice like, what to do if your'e caught in a norther in the Gulf Stream might have been useful. We also found the author to be non-chalant when talking about passages and channels. We had a terrible experience because of this, read the North West Channel LIght - we encountered 10 foot chop there! Also, the Whale Cay info is not highlighted enough.

The only thing that works in my case is resting the knee (no running/jumping) and icing it a few times a day until the pain goes away.

A++","review":"This Mueller knee strap really does work. It's my 3rd pair. I started using them about 3 years ago for my badminton play, which requires a lot of abrupt change in direction. This exerts extra amount of force in the knee each time. The strap helps to minimize the demage caused by these stop-and-go motions. Works well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slips off","review":"This strap keeps slipping/moving around when I exercise and sweat. Hence, it doesn't really work because it doesn't stay in place to support my knee! I would recommend it to people who would wear it to just walk around or for very low activity. It's better to buy the knee brace if you will be moving around a lot like exercise at the gym, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mueller Knee Straps as Promised","review":"I was replacing much older knee straps that I use when running.

I can't express how good this works. It's not expensive either. A must buy IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product...helps relieve pain","review":"This is a good product since it applies pressure in just the right places. In fact, it works so well, I use it on my forearm (for tennis elbow). I know they sell braces specifically made for the elbow, but they are all very big and bulky and prevent my arm from bending correctly. This brace works perfectly on both my knees and elbows. The only drawback is that it's prone to slipping out of place, but that can be said for all braces."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful little device","review":"I got a little runners knee after increasing my Saturday long run. While a knee brace isn't the only thing you should be doing to correct runners knee, it does feel better while running to wear it. I like it. It is a little bulky behind the knee but you get used to it. Not much of a price to pay to keep running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly little thing really helps","review":"It was surprisingly difficult to find one of these locally (impossible, in fact). I suffer from some ITB pain below the knee, and this really helps to ease things and bring the pain down during a jog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"Seems to work pretty well, definitely don't hurt as much after running or playing basketball. Wish the strap was a bit more secure around the leg, it tends to slip a little, especially as I sweat. A simple update to a hook and loop design would do wonders for this. But hey, for the price it's a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Strap Helps My Knee","review":"I have patellar tendonitis from 30+ years of playing sports, running and working out. I had cut out running for cardio exercise due to nagging aches and pains. However, after a while I decided that other forms of cardio weren't cutting it so I resumed running on a limited basis using this strap to lessen the patellar pain. Using the strap I have noticeably less discomfort than without it. I recommend this strap for anyone with jumper's knee (patellar tendonitis) as it worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works!!!!","review":"Buy Two!

I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers chronic knee pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"The basic product does what it is supposed to do; however, there are small very scratchy fibers that stick out of the ends where the Velcro is sewn in. I think these are actually hard plastic fibers from the Velcro that are protruding through the covering fabric. When you fasten it on, if you do not position it exactly right, the little \`stickers' bite into your skin and are extremely uncomfortable. In my case I had to repeatedly interrupt my workout to adjust these so they did not irritate my skin. The problem got worse the longer I used them. After a while it was very aggravating, to the point they were not useable no matter how carefully I adjusted them. They went into the garbage and I'm now using another brand, the \\"Futuro Sport\\" adjustable by 3M, which is available on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Good support strap","review":"Did not totally relieve me from my knee issues, but helped a lot more than I thought it would.

I totally recommend this for those with patellar tendonitis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I started struggling with runners knee about a year ago and I abandoned running all together. At that point in time I was unaware you could manage this discomfort and run long distances. After being encouraged to participate in a half marathon I started researching possible methods of treatment. This product came up as a great means to help healing. Having only purchased this device last week, I have been able to run much longer distances while not waking up in the night from the pain. It is very easy to use, has a simple design, and very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective, would purchase again","review":"Effective strap brace, helped tremendously. after a while, it started to get a touch worn, but i've had it a few months and it's still serving it's purpose.

A++!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be better with a support loop and a complete velcro","review":"This is my second knee strap. The first one was from Futuro.Futuro lasted ~6 months before getting stretched in a way that made it too large for my knees (I am a 116 lbs woman, so my knees are not large). This one lasted maybe two months. The velcro does not have both parts - the part with hooks gets attached to the material the strap is made of. While it is sufficient when the strap is new, it doesn't hold after a while (as I said - 2 months for me, with 5 runs per week), mainly because the material gets fibers pulled all over. Consequently, the strap keeps falling off during the run (really annoying).As a side note - it doesn't have a support loop so it is not easy to put it in place.It is an OK product - while it lasts (my knee was happy with it on), but I will test the Pro-Tek one next.I'd give it 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Put On, But Lower Compression than Futuro","review":"Good Quality, and for someone who wants light to moderate compression on their knee, this product is easier to get on and off than the competitor Futuro product. I returned the product because the Futuro provides a 2 to 1 mechanical advantage, when adding compression to the knee joint. Futuro is harder to put on, but if you want the extra compression it works better for my karate trashed knees. I think that someone with lesser disability might prefer this product. I would recommend this product to women or men with moderately degenerated knees. If you have some serious damage, and don't mind the extra 15 seconds of putting it on, get the Futuro."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit","review":"it's about the design, not the size. it tends to slide down no matter how hard you fix it, and it doesn't work anymore when it's not in the proper position.In a word, it doesn't work.

The quality is actually okay, but the shape is not good for staying there for protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helped with knees...strain on ankles/hips","review":"I run about 20-30 miles/week and started noticing some knee soreness. One of my friends told me about these straps so I thought I'd try them out since they were pretty cheap. I first tried them during short run and noticed some soreness in my hips/ankles after the run. I didn't try them again for another 4-6 weeks. This next time, I immediately noticed hip/ankle strain within the first 1/4 mile so much so that I had to take them off mid-run (no strain on my knees though!). Maybe I'm compensating my running stride with my ankles/hips? Either way, will never be wearing these again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't run without it","review":"I haven't been able to run for a few years now relating to a knee injury.

At the end of my runs my knees hurt and I also feel unusual tightness in my quads and minor shin splints.I can't explain how these straps works and I was a little sceptical at first. But somehow, they have provided much relief in my legs. These straps combined with my Saucony Hurricane 12's actually feel great. Now I look forward to my daily runs.I will also mention that these straps do stay in place and can easily be worn all day long under your pants without causing discomfort.This is by far the best and cheapest investment that I have made thus far for easing my leg pains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixed my knee problem","review":"I started training for the Country Music Half Marathon and noticed my knee started to hurt after long runs.

While there's a specific knee condition this is meant for (which I'm told I don't have), it's amazing how helpful this was for me. It cut the pain by 90% during the run and 99% post-run. Ultimately, by wearing this and upgrading to running shoes that are well-suited for my running style and have more cushioning (thank you Fleet Feet in Chicago!), I was able to remove practically all the pain.The only issue I ever encountered was once placing the strap too high-up, too close to the knee cap. This made my pain worse. By moving it down 1-2 inches, things were back to normal.The strap is well-made: durable stitching, strong wetsuit-like material, soft Velcro, and an inner material that wicks away moisture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stay in place...","review":"I got this for my runners knee, could not do more then 1/2 a mile before it started slipping. Do not recommend this for athletes or runners, does not stay in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"As stated","review":"We've used a bunch of these knee straps over the years. The velcro always seems to wear out on them within a season of sports, despite care with washing. This model does not have antimicrobial treatment to it, as my last purchase of the straps did. That feature is nice, because there is less 'stink' to the strap after a period of time. The strap does help with my daughter's Osgood Schlatters, and stays in place as long as the velcro is still working well."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply works","review":"Not much to say.

You would think these would be restrictive as you run but I've hardly noticed it. I highly recommend these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never steal.

The story - somebody comes to steal it. Gee, not very interesting...or is it? As with most BBC dramas, it isn't the story as much as the actors that draws you to it. The way they emote, walk, talk, and fit into the setting makes you want to watch the DVD again and again. And I have!And, as many of the others have pointed out, it will not make you jump, but it may make your kids demand a night light. Bwuahahahahaha!Peter Vaughan is one of those actors that the BBC could not do without. He is in everything, includingBrazil - The Criterion Collection - (Single Disc Editon).Clive Swift you should know, if for nothing else but the fact that he has been in Doctor Who more than once.

He fit in perfectly, The story is about his Aunt (who is in a bad marriage) and who falls head over heals for an eligible bachlor -- a pianist who is gay. I think everyone in this story had 'a few screws loose'. This made the story all the more pleasing because in everyone's life there are people like this.The main charactor turns out to be Nicholas's aunt Joyclyn. The ending may surprise you.

The premise was what drew our book club to read it; however it fell far short of expectations!The characters are shallow, underdeveloped and simplistic, the plot was contrived and predictable, and the worst part was the fact that it was overly-preachy. While I enjoy a book that has a strong spiritual message, this one lacked a compelling and strong message. It came across as insincere and was quite a turn off. I wouldn't have read past the Leticia section, but that I was part of a book club.I was unable to muster any feeling or emotion toward any of the characters, especially Brendan, who was perhaps the shallowest character.Very rarely has a book disappointed me the way this one did.

Swordfish is a nice compilation of progressive trance (vocal based and instrumental) and hard-rockin' break beats. The album is a bit similar to \\"The Saint,\\" and \\"The Jackyl\\" sountracks.

Buy a windmeter for $30 and measure your area because there are not too many places in the world that get this continuous sustained high wind enough to make one of these useful. The windmill only begins producing even just a trickle of low-voltage power once above 20mph which is still a lot of wind. You also need a long heavy industrial electrical cable as well as a tower and can either build your own or buy theirs. Either way, you'll spend another several hundred dollars and lots of time.

When he has a heart attack, the affair is put on hold indefinitely and Keaton ends up with the job of nursing Nicholson back to health. An added complication occurs when Nicholson's 30-something Dr. also begins to fall for Keaton.

They could have cut about 30 minutes out of it, streamlined it somewhat, and it would have been better. I saw it with a person their age who despised it as being absolutely stupid and unreal. I guess my suggestion is, is you're 60-ish, you might really hate it. It is worth the price of a rental or pay-per-view, but to me, only barely.

A great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This movie is one of the best this year. It has the most prolific actor of all time, Mr. Nicholson. How come Keanu Reeve can't still get his act together? Good thing he's still very cute and mysterious at 39. Call me at 156-38-3461."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful romantic comedy","review":"One of the best films of the year, this film concerns a successful hip hop record executive played by Jack Nicholson who dates many younger women. One weekend he goes to the Hamptons with one of his young finds and meets a woman who is more his peer in terms of age, intellect and accomplishment, mother of his young date, a successful playwright played by Diane Keaton. There are many delightful scenes including one dinnertable conversation in which Jack claims to have been engaged one time \\"to Diane Sawyer.\\" Eventually Jack has a heart attack and is cared for in the hospital by a doctor played by the young Keanu Reeves, who subsequently begins to romance Diane, also. The whole movie is quite light-hearted without many somber moments and ends up in Paris. I rate this among the top 5 films I have seen this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT NEW","review":"The video was sold as NEW but had no plastic seal and seemed to have been opened!

I can relate to Diane Keaton's character but I don't think I would have made the choice that she did in Paris. Enough said, it's a good movie, get it, guys, it's a chick flick, get it and give it to your girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting by Keaton and Nicholson!","review":"I am in my 40's and I love watching movies with mature actors.I watched this dvd last night, and I love it. I have been a Diane Keaton fan back to Annie Hall.I feel I got to know a different Diane this time. A much more mature one. It was refreshing.I am not a great fan of Jack Nicholson, and I think at the first part of the movie, he was not that great - but he acted much better than I expected.It was a joy to watch these two excellent actors.Only bad thing about this movie - it's way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was FABULOUS!!!!","review":"I can't say enough good things about this film. Jack & Diane are excellent as mature, successful, yet playful, middle-aged people. Throw in Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet for eye candy and Francis McDormand for character and you have a GREAT movie. I laughed, I cried, I got starry eyed from the romance. The plot is a little predictable, but manages to pull off scenes that you are not expecting. Let's just say, IT PUTS IT ALL UP FRONT. Deal with it or not. Again...EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute to Aging Yuppies","review":"Yes, Keaton and Nicholson do a great job. But the script has at least 3 cliches per second and everything is predictable, even the food they coose to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Young for This?","review":"Perhaps at 34 I am too young to 'get' this movie. I was hoping for a great romantic comedy, but found this one fell flat. Not even in the same universe as As Good as It Gets. After Jack Nicholson's character is stranded at Diane Keaton's house, I just lost interest. I didn't think he was anyone's dream man, and their love scene was frankly more than a little embarrassing. And the ending! Let's just say I find it very hard to believe a 60-something leopard would change his spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly for an older crowd!","review":"This movie was most definatly not made for the audiences under 30 years of age. My friends and I call it \\"old people porn\\" because old people do it with young people, then old people do it with old people, and then the old people do it with young people again. Not very appealing. The full frontal nudity of Diance Keaton was totally unnecessary. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't \\"give\\" me anything","review":"I saw this movie has 4 1/2 stars. How? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life! I bought it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend's mother. I watched it first, and after watching it, I couldn't even give it to her. It would have been an insult. Like \\"here is your crappy gift. this is how much i think of you.\\" I was talking about it to a co worker just describing this terrible movie I had seen and without even saying the title, she said \\"you talking about Something's Gotta Give?\\" She also agreed that it was a terrible movie. (she is twice my age so it's not just because i am young) Bottom line: don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"Im 23, and i loved the movie. I found it funny and entertaining. I think it bored my husband, but most chick flicks do bore him and almost every other man. Still a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"Long, meandering, and at times downright boring, I just can 't see why this movie was so hyped. Yes, Diane Keaton does look great for her age, or any age, but Jack Nicholson has gotten fat and I found myself grossed out during the scene when they first went to bed. I didn't see the chemistry. And her with Keanu Reeves, I dont' know, it was a stretch. I was also disappointed to see a strong female character like that reduced to a blubbering, bawling idiot after knowing the Jack Nicholson character for only one week (and not even liking him for much of it). This movie had a few cute moments but I wouldn't rank it among the stellar romantic comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"hollywood flaccid, however funny at times","review":"This is a pretty lame comedy, not much more than formula junk, though there is some good writing and the actors are truly fine. Alas, nothing new emerges, and the thought that the Nicolson character cd learn and grow - not only at his age but given his character - is ridiculous and ultimately ruins the impact of the film. It is too bad, because Keaton and Nicolson are such graet actors that they cd have done something original, even pathbreaking. Instead, it is just less rather than more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill me now!","review":"I'd rather gouge out my eyes with a dinner fork then sit through this movie a second time. The acting was fine, of course with this cast that's a given, but the story is so horribly horrible... only rich divorced women over 50 would even get a chuckle out of it. The plot is so obvious and the dialog was so unreal it made me feel like Moses lost in the desert as I searched the barron wastland for the ending credits.I think the one tag line from the movie says it all \\"...what about birth control?\\"\\"menopause, don't worry\\"<shiver>AN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Entertaining for Adults","review":"This movie is well cast and well acted; the cast headed up by Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, and Diane Keaton does a splendid job which permits the viewer to develop a concern for the characters and a desire that all will work out well for each of them.There are a lot of laughs as well as touching situations to which many will be able to relate. The movie is well paced and seems to go by quickly. There is beautiful scenery which always contributes to the enjoyment of the movie.Although funny and entertaining for mature adults I can in no wise recommend this movie for the entire family. It presents ideas and situations which are not suitable for children and does not promote high moral values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nocholson and Keaton do it again!

Thinking that buying the envelope and postage would probably be more then the refund I decided not to bother or to purchase any other DVDs from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best FEEL GOOD movies.","review":"This movie makes you feel good about life after you watch it.

Yes, Nicholson might overdo a bit the famed sardonic smile and look, and the old curmudgeon/escapist tricks, but al ot more intelligence in this movie than the comedic aspects let you grasp at first. And superior acting. Both Keaton and Nicholson still have it (by the way, Keaton sure wears her high-class outfits well, and still has the charm and the \\"it\\" (the 'je ne sais quoi'). Not for the and sorority bunch, the blow-them-up-and nuke-em crowds, or those born in the 70s or later. Watch out for Oscars. Don't miss this gem!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations Fulfilled","review":"This was a great movie. Stars of the movie was Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.

This gets my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nicholson movie","review":"This movie is one that I have seen on TV and wanted it for my collection. I think that older people would like this movie more than younger people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and hilarious at times. Must see for 30-70 year olds.","review":"Jack Nicholson is awesome in this film. So is Diane Keaton. Screen chemistry is perfect and they are both believable. It's cute, funny, hilarious at times and you really get the feeling that Nicholson and Keaton are not acting. The movie is a little bit long, but you don't really notice it. Something is always happening in the movie makes you care. Francis McDermond plays Keaton's sister and really fits the character. I think this movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone over 25 years old. I'm not sure anybody under 25 would actually get it... perhaps I'm not being fair to the x generation... sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Film For Adults","review":"A friend of mine said his 15-year-old son saw this movie and commented on how awful it was. While I can see how this film won't appeal to teenagers, I couldn't disagree more. This is a really entertaining romantic comedy with superb performances by the great comedic actress Diane Keaton (Erica Barry) as a somewhat uptight playwright and the venerable Jack Nicholson (Harry Sanborn) as a successful businessman with a reputation for only dating young women. Amanda Peet also delivers a good performance as Erica Barry's daughter Marin, who is also dating Harry Sanborn.This is a film that shows some of the pains of growing older and, in the case of Nicholson's character, the process of finally growing up. Anyone who enjoys good, if mature, romantic comedies and appreciates excellent acting and writing should see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and the City plus 20 years","review":"It's Carrie and Big, 20 years later.It's a 2-plus hour movie that needed to be 1-1/2 hours. While MONSTER has one writer and director and was tight as a drum, this movie has one writer and director who is self-indulgent. A waste of talent. OK if you have nothing better to do. Or see MONSTER and the finest acting I can remember ever seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys, stay away!","review":"This is a chick flick through and through. I agree that its lack of intensity make it a movie you could play as a side show in your living room while entertaining friends over popcorn. However, it's way too long and though Amanda Peet's a dish, she needs acting lessons. Jack's the best! . . . this was beneath him. And sorry casting consults, Diane Keating doesn't cut it as a playwright. Oh, and one other thing, I'm done with Ebert & Roeper. This movie did not deserve \\"Two Thumbs\\" - No way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"This is the first movie I have watched from Diane Keaton, what a terrible actress! I don't know how she got so famous, maybe this was the only bad movie she made! Anyway, 2 stars goes to Jack Nicholson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romantic comedy","review":"Diane Keaton plays a divorcee who finds love in the strangest of places: with her daughter's 60-something boyfriend (Jack Nicholson), a self-proclaimed playboy who's never had a serious relationship in his life. The dynamic that makes this movie even more interesting is that both Keaton and Nicholson seem to be playing themselves on screen, or at least they're playing the characters that the media has made them out to be in real life.\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is a wonderful love story that will have you laughing from start to finish. Nicholson and Keaton have great chemistry, and supporting cast members Frances McDormand and Amanda Peet are fabulous as well. Keanu Reeves also has a supporting role as a love interest of Keaton's, and he does a fine job (I realize that might be hard for you to believe, but it's the truth). I definitely recommend this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contagious Laughter.","review":"Hilarious movie! Diane's scene where she cries and cries, then laughs, then cries and cries, then laughs is the best. I laughed and laughed. Her comic facials are worth the price of admission on this film. Jack is Jack and he's back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was this movie ever boring...","review":"I should just say that I can't stand Keanu Reeves. He is such a horrible actor. I didn't think this movie was funny, and it dragged on for quite a while. spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholson Does It Again","review":"Nicholson was consumate as usual. He is a real man's man who can still make you belly laugh when you don't expect to. Keaton was extremely good, eventhough she can't really act a lick! She seemed to get into her stride later in the movie. Reeves was as lackluster as ever. He was as lame in this as in most of his movies.The plot was oriented toward the 40+ crowd and didn't dissappoint. Thought some indicated this a chick flick it was far from that if you went to see the Nicholson stick along with the young girls beaten off by the Keaton character.A must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is just awful.","review":"Prompted by the worst movie that i've seen in a long time, this is the first review that I've written.

She was delighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I couldn't even finish watching this claptrap, and from the other reviews on here I am glad I didn't. This could have been a great comedy but Keaton and Jack appeared to be making up their lines, or flubbing them badly. Nicholson was particularly bad seeming to be reading the lines off cards, slowly. Keaton giggled and mugged through the entire movie as if she was on drugs -- Jack just isn't that funny or annoying. And really, did anyone want to see Jack's buttocks so much. No.As for Keaton's character, although I can see her anger, she was so focused on the issue of Jack being an older man she came off as a man hater. Why Jack or Reeves falls for her is beyond me. I am just glad I didn't pay for this one in the theater. Don't buy the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"A challenge to \\"Showgirls\\" for best bad movie","review":"What does it take to be a good bad movie? Lot's of talented people getting together and making every mistake and bad choice possible.By that criteria \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is the first movie I've seen in a long time that could give \\"Showgirls\\" a run for its money for best bad movie. All the elements are here - lots of talent (Nicholson, Keaton, Peet), a boringly predictable plot, and some of the most excrutiating writing I have heard in a major motion picture. Nicholson is barely acting at all, while Keaton is trying to act, but failing - miserably. When the best performance in your movie is given by Keanu Reeves, you know something spectactuarly bad has occurred.My advice - rent this movie, get a bunch of your friends together, get rip-roaring drunk, and a good time will be had by all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite Star Vehicle","review":"This trite, formula-governed movie should be an embarassment to Keaton and Nicholson, or their agents, who generally find better scripts. Obvious, predictable, its saving grace is Keanu Reeves' performance as the perfect American male. Anyone who enjoys membership in the latter category should watch this movie to see how it's done. Looking for a good film? Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with moviegrlll","review":"I coudn't agree more with moviegrlll-- how any self-respecting woman could find Jack Nicholson's character (and his real self) appealing to the point of givung up one's autonomy and self-respect is mind-boggling, and a bunch of patriarchal propaganda horsecrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrendous","review":"Is this film meant to be uplifting? You've got to be kidding. In what universe would it be considered acceptable for a successful woman to choose the puffy, lecherous commitmentphobe who beds her, doesn't call and humiliates her, over the loving, cute doctor who happens to be 20 years her junior? Is it considered to be \\"mature\\" to be with a man your age who neglects you and is incapable of forming a serious relationship? And oh, by the way, you met the old guy when he was dating YOUR DAUGHTER. Ecccchhh. And to nominate Diane Keaton for this role, which is basically a yuppie Annie Hall retread, for an Academy Award is simply a joke. See this movie at your peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did people watch the same movie that I did?","review":"It started off just fine. It got a little boring going along the storyline but I like Nicholson and I generally enjoy Keaton. HOWEVER, I thought Diane Keaton was an actress? When she was crying, in the film, I was more than annoyed! I turned it off completely. She's supposed to be an actress!!! I was very disappointed in her acting in this film and for that I give the movie 2 stars as I thought it could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I wasn't expecting the best romantic comedy in the world but I was hopeful that this one might be reasonably entertaining. Instead, I found it embarrassing and deadly. I am not a fan of Diane Keaton but I didn't expect her to be this bad. Her character behaved like a melodramatic teenager and the crying scene was idiotic and interminable. Jack Nicholson was his usual lecherous, boozy-looking over-the-hill lothario and it was very hard to believe that any woman of any age would go so nutsy over him, especially with Reeves waiting in the wings (also an incredible premise in these circumstances). Even Frances McDormand, who is always good, could not do much to help out as her character was severely underwritten. It was a relief when this movie was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite, ridiculous, and stupid!","review":"This movie was as dull as dull gets! Sorry Jack, you're just not convincing as a charming old fart who can \\"reel-in\\" the twenty-somethings with the fight and personality (lack there of) of a farm raised trout! Diane Keaton's character, supposedly a sharp counter-point to her competition (youth, beauty and naivette) was unconvincing. Instead of genuine wit and eruditeness, the script gave her trite and expected lines. We, the audience, were treated to multiple scenes of Diane et.al., laughing at her witticisms which she silently mouthed as the music swelled. I suppose we were supposed to believe that at these times at least, Diane was clever. At least Diane isn't a plastic-surgery addict -- it was nice to see a mature woman looking her age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously funny and heartwarmingly touching","review":"Not being a Nicholson or Keaton fan prior to this moving I was amazed at how the writer and director changed my opinon within hours.

But Kevin Smith's role is both cheap and embarrassing and makes a mockery of every scene he bellyflops into. The rest of the cast (including Jason Mewes and the over-the-top mother) are rock-bottom as well. As for the script... let's just say it REALLY goes downhill after Flappy \\"saves the day\\". A juvenile and unbelievable turn for the worst, I'd say. Completely ludicrous, since the movie had a pretty decent and gritty start. To be blunt, that scene basically sunk the whole movie. Boy, did it ever tumble after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time watching this film could be used to not watch this film","review":"I haven't compiled a real list yet, but this film would definately be up around the top 5 or so worst films I have ever tried to sit through in my entire life. If you can actually get past the horrible acting and the fact that none of the sound actually matches the chartacters who are speaking, and the fact that the story is really unoriginal and unimaginative, you might make it almost to the end of the movie...I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rape Isn't Funny...","review":"..unless you're raping a clown, and even then it's still not funny.It stars Brian O'Halloran (Dante in Clerks/II) as Flappy/Vulgar/Will - a man who has trouble paying his bills and is mocked and laughed at by almost everyone. He works as a clown, performing at parties for kids. He rents himself out as a transvestite clown who, as a joke, jumps out of cakes at bachelor parties. On the day of his debut performance, he's drugged and gang-raped by three men. The rape scene wasn't as horrific as I thought it would be.O'Halloran is a brilliant actor when it comes to him playing these whiny,weak characters. Mostly everything he's been in, you just want to hug him and tell him it's gonna be ok.This movie is called a \\"dark comedy\\", but there was nothing funny about it. It was a very good movie, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of SH** !!","review":"This was horrible, horrible, horrible. And I consider myself to be a person who enjoys offbeat, \\"dark,\\" movies... so it says a lot if I thought it was trash. If I was Kevin Smith, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this cra*. I've lost all respect I ever had for Smith after this... I can't imagine any truly respected director such as Scorsese, Kubrick, or Tarantino delving into this kind of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars is more like it","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I rented it due to the cast list featuring many of my favorites. I thank every God, god and goddess there is that I didn't actually purchase it! It is hideous. I usually quite enjoy shocking movies and such. But this was too much. It just didn't stop, one hideous scene after another. Pure crap for the entire movie. There was not one redeeming element throughout. Don't buy it. Trust me. Or trust all the other reviewers who've said the same thing!30 Helens agree... this movie completely sucked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not watch this movie","review":"I am a huge Kevin Smith. I love just about everything he has ever created. As such, I was suckered into watching this movie one day when I saw the View Askew stamp on the cover. An important fact: KEVIN SMITH DID NOT WRITE THIS MOVIE. It is not funny in anyway; in fact, it's the complete opposite. It's one of the most disturbing films ever made. It was only allowed to be made because the writer (Bryan Johnson) is a good buddy of Kevin Smith. His skills as a storyteller pale in comparison to virtually anyone else who works for View Askew. Hopefully Johnson will stick to what he does best from now on...selling comics and playing the role of Steve-Dave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Kevin Smith movie, Not very good","review":"I bought this a long time ago and thought it was absolute S***!I love Brian O'Halloran's work in the Kevin Smith movies he has been in but even he couldn't save this movie.This movie is not even funny accidentaly!Only Artificial Intelligence and Napolean Dynamite were worse movies!AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOd what was smith thinking","review":"Normally, i love kevin smith and think movies like dogma are masterpieces. I have read from other movies that kevin smith did not actually write this which would fiqure why it is nothing like any of his other movies.

It's worse than seeing someone die... in real life.I'd advize you heavily to NOT see this [stuff], and if you do, don't say I didn't warn you.In closing- this movie [upset] me , disgusted me in a bad way (hard to do), and just plain bored me. I'm ashamed of this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow. . .what was that?!","review":"If you don't know the basic premise of Vulgar, and you want to be suprised when and if you watch the movie, then stop reading now.\\"Vulgar\\" is based around the brutal rape of a clown who decides to perform gag strip-teases at bachelor parties. When the clown makes it big on TV, his rapist try to blackmail him.I know this sounds bizarre, but that's exactly what this movie is - bizarre. It's not funny, like other View Askew films (although kevin smith and jason Mewes play minor parts in the fim). It's not a terribly interesting story. Just plain weird.I'm usually not one scared off by the strange or different, but this movie had nothing to offer. No humor, no depth, no interesting dialogue. This is the sort of movie that pretenious movie critics like just because it's weird and the story-telling is disconnected (e.g. Magnolia)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is perhaps the worst written film I've ever seen. For a script that is entirely over-written (just watch the mom/son scenes)you still can't understand what is going on, why any of anyones actions are called for, nor the relationships of any of the characters. This movie just captures senseless violence at its peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"As I am often surprised by the clever dialogue and offbeat humor with which Kevin Smith's name is associated, I approached this film with a certain degree of optimism. Though Smith did not take a direct hand in writing or directing, I felt it reasonable to expect something of value. While films such as Mallrats and Clerks found a certain charm in their lack of slick production, Vulgar is without a single redeeming quality. It is poorly written, directed and acted. I can only wonder why Kevin Smith (or anyone for that matter) would want his name associated with this film. Should it ever develop a cult following, it will be a cult of sheer mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"There's a smidgen of fun in seeing O'Halloran, Mewes and other members of the View Askew universe, but this mess betrays no skill or talent on the part of its screenwriter/director.

Normally I would at least resell the item, but I don't wish to put another person through such an sloppy attempt at a film.

But the only thing good about this disc is the Dogma Documentary that Columbia Tri-Star was too chicken to put out on the Dogma DVD. Some people might like this moviebut I doubt many will. There's not much of a point to it all.After watching the movie I had a weird feeling. BecauseI never got bored watching Vulgar,Nor did I feel a need to eversee it again.Hopefully We can get Kevin Smith to change his mind about the end of Jay and Silent Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled","review":"This movie is pretty good, but it is the worst Kevin Smith movie and even though at times I wanted to fast foward it or either turn it off, I still enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Please give this film a try. I disagree that this film is badly acted and unrealisted. This film is ugly and it's uncouth, but that's what American cinema needs. It needs to show pain that isn't glamorized. Human beings are pretty darn ugly and evil down deep. We're not natually good and wholesome. This movie shows how ugly we are.

Although I am in treatment for breast cancer, and Joni had lymphoma, her book was the closest book I have read to portray the many facets of dealing with cancer. I couldn't put it down. No, it's not a pollyanna book that wraps everything up in a neat little package. It is a book of love, passion, joy, spirituality, discovering your strengths and humanity, raising small children while fighting and hoping for the opportunity to see them old enough to remember who you are, the misery and miracles of chemo etc. She is hilarous, informative and very very human. Would suggest this book to any female who has cancer or as a gift for a female going thru cancer.

She can't wait to learn her lessons and have fun. She's heard about so many great things happening at school and is eager to try them out.Things start well enough for Miss Spider. She meets the principal and then dives into the day's activities. At first she has fun, but when she doesn't seem to be succeeding at anything, she begins to get worried. She learns that she has a special quality that can always be appreciated.The story, like most other David Kirk books, rhymes and the illustrations are bright and delightful. They're full-page on every other page, with smaller illustrations to accompany the text. \\"Miss Spider\\" fans will enjoy learning more about the early life of one of their favorite bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, quick read","review":"We love this book. The illustrations are bright and colorful, the story is written in rhyme. The pages are a little glossy so it makes my daughter feel like she is reading a super special book. It is not a long book, great for a toddler.The story of Miss Spider going to a new school can easily be made personal to a child getting ready or just starting school. Miss Spider worries that she is not good at anything or not as good as everyone else. It shows the spider trying everything and not always succeeding. As parents we walk a fine line of protecting our children and putting them out into the world with a potential of failure. This helped us with the dialog to always try.In the end she gets a special award from the school principal for just being kind.

(low budget)It is disappointing to know that some big actors such as Val Kilmer would agree to act in such movies.The only thing that this movie got away with is that it somehow was able to not get you bored while watching it. I think its the action that kept us watching till it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly exciting and thought provoking film","review":"When we got this film, we expected it to be an action movie, something to pass an evening without much thought.

Val Kilmer is washed up and I don't mean his character. Gary Cole is the only 'real' actor in the movie that even acts like he is trying. The movie is so heavy handed in its left wing politics that it is hysterical. 'Halicorp' is the bad corporation. And it is so obvious that it is a schlock remake of Bad Day At Black Rock.

The town setting is an old western town, dirt roads, saloon buildings, etc. It looks like they walked on Universal studios with a camera.The movie bounces back and forth from war time, to present, to one minute he is in bed with one woman, then the next minute its another.

There's no skill required, and no real strategy.The idea is to finish one phase and then get rid of the cards left in your hand. Be the first to finish all 10 phases and win the game.The typical game lasts about an hour.To start each player is dealt 10 cards and they all work on Phase 1, which is getting two sets of three similar cards. three 5's and three 12's, for example. Once you've laid down your phase you're ready to discard your cards and move on to next phase. You can play for points or play to be the first one out.It's a good game to teach younger children sequences, and counting; and challenging enough to keep kids of ages interested.Since it's a card game, the durability isn't long lasting--depending upon how rough you are with cards.

Part of the excitement came from Bruce Springsteen's involvement. He produced \\"Dedication\\" and follow-up LP \\"On the Line\\", wrote some of the songs, and sang backup (almost reaching duet status on some of them).This disc compiles the above hit, follow-up \\"Jole' Blon\\", and \\"On the Line\\"'s hit single \\"Out of Work\\" (#21, 1982), and some LP cuts from the two releases. Rounding it out, and giving some sense of history to Bonds, are previously-unreleased, live versions of his biggest '60's hits \\"New Orleans\\" and \\"Quarter To Three\\".Important for both Bonds and Boss fans, and useful because the two separate LPs are very expensive now, at least as out-of-print CDs circa 2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great metal album with an 80's feel","review":"Dragon Slayer, by Dream Evil is one the best metal albums that I've heard in a long time. It's fast, hard, and powerful without all the screaming that is so common in most modern heavey metal albums. What I think is also great about it is that the whole album is a story, and you can hear it progress as you listen to it.I personaly would recomend this album to anyone who enjoys good metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty d*mn good for a debut...","review":"yeah, I have to say that for a debut release, this is pretty solid. The first song, \\"Chasing the Dragon\\" reminds me of Dokken BIG-TIME. \\"In Flames you Burn\\" keeps up with KAMELOT or STRATOVARIUS any day. \\"Save Us\\" gets groovin' and has that 80's feel a little bit. The only songs that really bug me are \\"Losing You\\" which is a little to sappy for me, and \\"Heavy Metal Jesus\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Dream Evil","review":"This is the best Dream Evil cd ever. This cd has so many good songs \\"Chasing the Dragon\\" the song that got me really started on power metal. \\"In Flames you Burn\\" is another good song. But the best song on this cd is \\"The Chosen Ones\\". On the whole this is a good cd I must say I've heard better power metal but still this one ain't shabby. Most people I talk to say the second one is better but disagree this one is better by far. The sound is good. The lyrics are well writen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Archaic and obnoxious.","review":"Heavy metal Jesus? These guys can't be serious. They sound like a 21st century version of Accept! This band, along with bands like Hammerfall are trying to drag the Metal scene back to the time of mullets and jean jackets while the rest of the Swedish Metal scene (most notably the Death metal scene) is constantly progressing.

There is NO techno, NO thriller, confusing plot, inexplicable murders. Not a good book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending Was Found Wanting","review":"This book was very intriguing at first glance. The story line was very enthralling because it involved multiple different people and their secret reasons as to why they are cheating. Also, it explores why the main character, Simon Gray, was helping the cheaters if he was as good of a boy that he said he was, and as good as everyone else said.What really killed this book for me was the ending. The ending didn't solve any problems in a satisfying way. The greedy characters got what they wanted, and then the quiet good girl that was always passed over and was just the friend finally had a chance, and he, yet again, passed over her. This ending just begged for another story to if everything, but that story shall never come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shades Of Simon Gray","review":"I didn't find this book to be very interesting. Mind you, I'm only halfway through. But given the fact that I bought the book and started reading it at the beginning of August (2003) and it now being the end of March (2004) and I've only gotten to about chapter four, and have also read numerous other books in the time between - this book was definetly not for me. Sure, the author has a good style of writing, a good way of describing things, and all that. But to me, it just wasn't appealing. I can't say nothing major happened, but just the way everything worked out around what happened, it wasn't exciting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story everyone can enjoy!","review":"Young or old, Shades of Simon Gray is a book everyone can enjoy.

My thirteen year-old son started reading it for school. He realized it was not something he should be reading and alerted me. I then read the book and totally agree!Also, the outcome of the story teaches kids that it is okay to cheat if you get away with it:For three years of high school, Simon and his friends cheat by accesssing exams on the school's computer. The authorities suspect Simon until it is found that a teacher is allowing football players access to the school's computers using his password. The football players view pornography on the internet and the teacher gets in trouble for permitting it. Since these students had access to school information through the computers there is no way of finding out who was actually accessing and printing the tests. Simon and his friends get off the hook and are never caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Simon Gray","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book because there was never a dull moment. It was also a challenge with the constant change of perspective between each of the four main characters. McDonald kept the suspense high throughout the novel, keeping you guessing until the very last page about what might happen next. Many of the events that took place were closely related to my own life as a teenager, because everyday I face the same problems that each of these four students faced while nearing the end of high school and beginning life on their own. This book is directed toward young adults, but would be an awesome book to read at any age, inspiring the young and the old to find truth within themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I'e ever read.","review":"This book is uninteresting to the extreme and full of characters who aren't in the least compelling, plotlines that are in no way connected, an ending that does not resolve anything, and poor, flat, heavy handed writing. Its supposed dealings with morality and right and wrong are laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor radio","review":"I am in the military, currently deployed and purchased this radio to use as a second form of communication among our squad. Although the set works, its range is smaller, its batteries do not last as long, and its about twice the size as other Motorola sets. In fact both of my radios often miss traffic that everyone else picks up. I would recommend looking at another Motorola radio before you waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice radios for traveling","review":"I recently got these radios for Christmas and I am pretty impressed. They are easy to use with very clear sound. I previously had a set of Motorola 2 mile radios and in comparison, the T7100Rs work 100x better. I just got back from a vacation in Disney World and found these radios to be extremely handy. In the group of people we were traveling with we had my two 7-miles, and 4 2-miles. No matter where you were in the park you could always hear who had the 7-mile radios which wasn't always the case with the 2-miles. The only draw back was that they were just a little bit bitter than the normal Motorola radios. If you are buying these radios expecting to use them over any 7 mile terrain, don't. When they test the distance, they do so in some flat part of the dessert. I think these radios are great and would recomend them to any casual user wanting a little extra range."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not purchase this radio","review":"my dad bought 2 sets of these and i bought one. two of his broke when he tried putting the rechargable battery in. and one of mine broke. the ones we got the battery into without ruining the radio we were not impressed with .. very poor sound quality.

I would encourage anyone to avoid this radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional!","review":"Depending on the use you would give to the radios they are very functional and cool to use. I use them with my informatic team and we work in a four stories building. Great reception in about 4 kilometers. Great accesory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so radio","review":"As other reviewers have said, this two way radio is not worthy of the Motorola name. The only reason I'm still using mine is that I bought it for $25 (after tax) as part of a damaged two radio package. This radio will go through a fresh set of batteries very quickly, and certain channels can only receive from FRS radios (channels 1-7).The T7200 would be a better buy, if you can still find it. The T7400 is similar to the T7100 without its shortcomings, but still can't use channel 1-7."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Peter's Fair","review":"This fourth in the Brother Cadfael series builds the history of the Abbey and the life of Brother Cadfael. Ellis Peters (Edith Pargeter) is a wonderful writer, adept at pulling you into the story and making her beloved Shropshire come to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medieval Controversy","review":"St. Peter's Fair is another excellent Brother Cadfael chronicle by Ellis Peter's. She continues the story of a monk inside the monastery, who has already seen much of the world. St. Peter's Fair opens with a controversy between the locals and monastery. The local people of Shrewsbury feel that the monastery is reaping unjust benefit from the fair without giving the town its just due. Soon a merchant at the fair is found murdered and a local is implicated.Cadfael uses the skills he developed outside of the monastery to help track the murderer. Aiding him is Hugh Beringar, who was introduced in a previous chronicle. Cadfael continues to develop as a warm, loving human, who has a sense of justice.Ellis Peters is a must for any fan of medieval tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sublime historical mystery","review":"\\"St. Peter's Fair\\" seduces you into an exceptionally credible mileau and engages your empathy with many-faceted characters.

Using his weak Vanessa makes him her slave and sets out to have herself returned to her husband the Count Dracula who she has a hard time understanding has been distroyed. Countess Vanessa is hardly the beauty she is made out to be, unless you like that expressionist look. But she is truly vicious and totally amoral like a good vampire should be. Nothing concerns her but her own desires and she satisfies them with brutal effientcy. For example Van Hessian's ancestor appears and sets out to destroy her, so she goes to his place and turns him into another bloodsucker. This film has more gore then say most Hammer films but less then most slasher films. There is no nudity or lesbianism, more the pity. If you like your vampires truly evil and vicious this one is for you, no slopping around in sentimentality for the poor creatures of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap, low budget, B- rated movie","review":"This movie not only has a cover creepy enough to turn anybody off, but the movie plot line really sucks. This movie doesnt even deserve 1 star. Dracula's widow is really ugly also, which in old legends she was supposed to be beautiful. Dont waste your money on this peace of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece ? Eh....","review":"I do not regard this as a so-called \\"masterpiece\\". To be blunt, I think it's reputation has been helped along all these years by the fact that it's old, in black-and-white, and in French, giving it an arty feel. Granted, it has some good cinematography, making good use of shadow, and it's quiet passages lend it an air of mystery. But a masterpiece ? No, it is not. I think I was intrigued by it up until the non-climactic end. I was left thinking, \\"That's it ??\\". I kept expecting a chilly, goose-bumped ending, one that the film's reputation carries with it.I thought the extra documentary, \\"Blood of the Beasts\\", on the disc was more intriguing to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Horror","review":"Georges Franju's version of a mad scientist trying to play God tells about a brilliant but controlling and obsessive doctor who is trying to restore the face of his own beloved daughter that was horribly disfigured in a car accident caused by his reckless driving. He requires tissues of recently deceased young women that look like his daughter and he is not going to wait for them to die in an accident - he creates the accidents with help of his loyal secretary/nurse/lover/former patient Louise (Alida Valli of \\"The Third Man\\") who kidnaps the unsuspecting girls and brings them to the secluded mansion in one of Paris's suburbs where Doctor G��nessier is ready to perform the fascinating and horrifying surgeries.\\"Eyes without a Face\\" is a very impressive, classy picture that has inspired many later horror movies. The music by Maurice Jarr adds to the uneasy and creepy atmosphere - it makes you feel like on the never-stopping ominous merry-go-round and you can't get off it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Movie","review":"A great scary tale from the past, some one should remake this maybe the booth Brothers?Check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"FRANJU'S GOTHIC MASTERPIECE....","review":"In a French chateau, a famed plastic surgeon tries valiantly time after time to restore his disfigured daughter's face...driven by guilt since he was responsible for the accident that caused it. Georges Franju's 1959 Gothic shocker still retains the power to disturb unlike other similarly themed horror films. It is grislier than others of the period and stunningly photographed in b&w with haunting images (like the mask) that linger with you for days afterward. The surgeon (Pierre Brasseur) and his assistant (Alida Valli) are obsessively devoted to the daughter (Edith Scob) and don't take into account her personal feelings. Young women are lured to the estate, drugged and used for skin grafts as the daughter stands by helplessly, hoping for a new face. A dreamlike quality to the film makes it all the more disturbing and unforgettable. A collector's find without a doubt and a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Portent of Movies to Come","review":"This startling work combines the plot of a splatter movie with the cold, composed style of 1950's Stanley Kubrick. You can sense in it the French appreciation of Poe, Cornell Woolrich, and the Gothic. It has many touches of dark humor and irony that complement the ominous, poetic visual style. Strange moments of anguished emotion keep breaking through the tightly constructed surface of the film. It also anticipates the more graphic horror films to come in the future. The famous \\"operation\\" scene will make your skin crawl even after 40 years. The real subject is, of course, our fetishization of female beauty, and what that dehumanization really costs. The figure of a ruthless, murderous doctor performing obscene medical experiments also must have had special relevance to a France that had experienced the terrors of German occupation during World War II. Maurice Jarre's music is memorably spooky. You won't soon forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to say it but... :(","review":"Hate to say it but, this was wwwaaaayyyy to confusing for me.

Come on, you know you want to watch this adorable show. Guy or girl, this show is awesome. I cant say anything about the english voices, I always like the Japanese voices myself, but that is just me. The music is sweet, I love the main intro song. I could listen to it a thousand times. The characters are hilarious and it's so crazy that no one realizes their teacher is a CAT! He is my favorite. Sounds crazy huh? BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GREAT!

His preference was a film done by the BBC for the 40th anniversary of the event and his least favorite was the wonderful \\"Babies and Banners\\" which has been ritually condemned by every one of the old UAW leaders (because of its use of a Ford plant scene while discussing Chevrolet and the not-quite-accurate view of the Women's Emergency Brigade's contribution). This film uses extensive interviews with Victor, the Krauses (long-time editor of Solidarity), and others. The American Experience crew found a great deal of original footage that even the UAW archives did not own including material from the Kelsey Hayes strike. While I never had the privilege of hearing Victor talk about this film, I am sure it was his favorite as it was an accurate and rousing depiction of one of the signal events in his life. I recommend it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show your PhD at the front page......","review":"I bought this for a Psycology paper I needed to write. I should have gotten my PhD before attempting to navigate this read. I wrote my report, but this book uses terms that are far more advanced than a college student in Psyc 101 has covered.

Long winded, gads of meaningless philosophizing about nothing. An incredibly boring plot. Characters who are out of the 1950s. This is bad science fiction at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthy opening chapter","review":"David Brin writes science fiction the way it should be written--with imagination, heroic characters, and the triumph of all that is good in the human spirit. \\"Sundiver\\" is a prime example of how good Brin's books can be.Many cite \\"Startide Rising\\" as Brin's masterpiece. While \\"Startide\\" is a great book (Earth is actually my favorite book written by Brin), I do not think that Sundiver is a \\"weaker\\" effort. The two books are apples and oranges. One, \\"Sundiver,\\" is essentially a mystery. The other, \\"Startide Rising,\\" is more of an action-adventure book. I recommend them both. \\"Sundiver\\" really sets the context for \\"Startide\\" nicely.\\"Sundiver\\" is a great mystery that kept me guessing until the end. It is filled with the kind of invention and personal treachery/heroics that make the Uplift series great. Brin has made a visionary world in his two great series.I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor-quality kindle editions","review":"Important note for buyers: I loved this book, but if you're interested in this book, do not buy the Kindle edition.I bought most of the Uplift series in Kindle editions: Heaven's Reach, Brightness Reef, Infinity's Shore, Sundiver, and Startide Rising. I was extremely disappointed by the quality of these ebooks. Words were frequently mis-spelled or replaced with similar-looking but incorrect words; words and whole passages were arbitrarily italicized; many words were split with hyphens for no reason. It was confusing, distracting, and eventually irritating. I got the strong impression that all these books had been run rapidly through an OCR system and never checked for correctness or quality. For a publishing company of Ballantine's size and reputation this is ridiculous.If Ballantine are going to sell ebooks, they should do it properly, and give them the same care and attention they would to physical books. There's no excuse for releasing shoddy digital products."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave this book a two for effort","review":"To be honest this book should be rated a one. The reason why I gave this book a two is because it had alot of well interesting ideas. This book lack focus and direction. I wasn't sure were the heck it was taking me. David Brin brought up so many things I eventually got lost. He also left loop holes and got me thinking about things he never bought up or mentioned again. Most of the time I was left with a big fat \\"Huh??\\" throught out finishing this book. If you happen to read part two of this series, you will also be loss because it doesn't tie up any loose ends with part one. Well, anyway that is a different story. I wouldn't recommened to book to anyone unless they want to put together the pieces of the story together in thier own way."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 dimensional characters and weak plot","review":"I had high hopes for Sundiver, but it was fairly predictable and boring. I noticed another reviewer comment about the aliens seeming like second rate Star Trek transplantees, and I agree. I've heard the series gets better after this book, but I may have to wait until I forget how bad this novel was before I pick up the next in the series. Such a shame -- the uplift concept is so interesting, but Brin made the least of it with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twice was enough","review":"I read this book twice, and I might read it again in the future. As an introduction to the uplift universe leaves a lot to be said. All the other books in this universe are absolutely great. I've read them 6 times Startide, 3 uplift war, 3 brightness reef and 2 for the other two. Don't miss this magnificent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dissapointing SF","review":"Maybe it was because I had such high expectations of this book from reading the reviews. The beginning WAS kind of interesting, and i thought, hmm. maybe Brin is onto something. Unfortunately, Brin did nothing to take the interesting societal ideas any further---and instead I was left with Miss Marple in Space; filled with a lame mystery, cardboard characters (the 'male lead' was the usual Competent Man found in hard SF, completely uninteresting; even his dysfunctions were neat and tidy) and aliens that appeared to come out of a third rate Star Trek costume shop.others have said that his other books in this series are better, and that might be a fair assumption, but after being very underwhelmed by _Sundiver_, i'm not exactly running to the bookshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convincing and Entertaining","review":"David Brin sells his characters better than most. They jump to life and one cannot help but come to like them. Reading this book sold me on the rest of the series, as well as other Brin works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got some good stuff here, man.","review":"The first in the Earthclan books. For some reason, I really like the entire concept of the universe Brin made here. Earth against the Galaxy, with a little helping tree branch from our friends (teheheh). The investigation the humans did, trying to figure out what was going on was reminiscent of a Lije Baley/Daneel Olivaw novel, (ref. Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, etc.), and was really interesting. The most interesting characters in his novels, I find, are the aliens, but for some reason, he doesn't spend enough time on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"you got to be kidding","review":"Had to be at least thirty years since I read this book. $7.99 for electronic version of book this old, forget it. Maybe $1.99 maybe. Enjoyed the uplift series but this is not the best book in the bunch and can be skipped without problem. Need to get price down on the older books. I'm becoming disenchanted with Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Starting Point Into Brin's Uplift World","review":"Sundiver is a good starting point into the Uplift world that Brin has created. This is the weakest of the six books in the series but is still a worthwhile read. The book is a very easy read, the later Uplift books (actually 2 books plus a trilogy) are much denser and much more rewarding.Brin's physicist training really shines through in his descriptions of the Sun and its various phenomena. If you like your Science Fiction sprinkled with actual plausible science, then you should enjoy this book as well as the rest of Brin's writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing and long, boring story","review":"I tried to give this book a chance, really I did, because of all the good things I had read about the Uplift War series, but the interminable internal monologues, pointless philosophizing, Star Trek-style menagerie of aliens, and unsympathetic characters put me off for good. Too bad, I had hoped for some excellent sci-fi, but this isn't it. Maybe the rest of the series is gold, but this is a poorly-written and incredibly dull novel that took me months to finish. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Dockers Haven Shoes!!!","review":"I have been wearing these shoes at work for several years.

Amy uses this technique very well and writes about it in her book.If you noticed throughout the show, Amy's main goal was getting into Nick's pants the whole time. Way to set your priorites little girl.To her credit, the only idea she had was to use companies from earlier projects to purchase ad space for the later project.

All four came back and stated the same thing.. that Amy has no substance. She uses all the right words and talks \`the talk' .. but they all stated that there was nothing behind those words.Most of the book is filled with common sense, everyday items like \`Know the power of networking---get connected to the right people'.. really?

Also \`\`Dating at work---know the consequences' .. and my personal favorite piece of advice, \`No crying in the boardroom' .."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is \\"What It Takes\\"","review":"I highly recommend this book to any woman looking to quickly move-up in her company. Even if you did not follow The Apprentice, this book is a great guide to follow in order to help network, promote yourself, ask for promotions, and prioritize challenges to excel outside of your comfort zone in what is still a male dominated corporate America. If you did follow the show, there are good insights sprinkled in of the much publicized relationships from the show and how best to ward off gossip in the workplace. Though quite young at only 30, Amy Henry shares her varied business experiences from her years of sales and business consulting in the male dominated high tech industry proving her credibility to know \\"What It Takes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for Younger Women and Those Breaking into the Business World","review":"As the last woman standing on NBC's hit show \\"The Apprentice,\\" Amy Henry has a lot to say about business. Rather than focusing on her television experience, however, Henry draws from her eight-year career of managing multi-million dollar software projects and offers a host of strategies for success, particularly in male-dominated industries. She insists on the power of networking with the big boys; stealth bragging, so that people will know about your accomplishments; speaking up and using your charm, beauty and womanly intuition. Henry's advice is similar to those found in other books, but her no-nonsense, woman-to-woman approach will be helpful and enjoyable for younger women and those breaking into the business world."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating junk","review":"Threw away my beloved pruner for 20 years by accident, did't remember the brand and this one sounded good.

It's just styrofoam-like.Plus the upper cloth isn't soft at all. It's a bit hard but not as hard as mouse plastic pad.To come to my conclusion, this is indeed a quality of a .74 cent mouse pad. It's not too bad.

I prefer the Flexibility session to the Deepen and Strengthen.The 2nd session makes you hold the positions for long periods. The young woman demonstrating the moves is Amazing!

I did have a problem with getting the top of the fuselage to glue down flush with the body of the vehicle. I had to use a little Testors gap filler. That is really the only complaint I have with this model. Oh, also this model comes with an adjustable stand. The normal clear plastic base can be topped with a clear ball and then there is a special cup that fits over the ball and into the bottom of the model, so you can pose the vehicle in mid air to a degree.

By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried.

It inspired us to create a poetry portfolio of original works that they shared with the school during a poetry slam. I've used the poems with all different grades.The poems focus on the angst of teenage years. Some contain \\"inappropriate\\" language or topics (sex, thoughts of death), but mostly, it's the perfect outlet for Glenn's students, just as this type of poetry is an outlet for my students. The language is modern and natural, rather than the \\"stuffy\\" figurative language, confining rhyme scheme, and overwrought emotion of more traditional poetry. Though it won't replace other forms of poetry, it's a great resource. I highly recommend the book to other teachers to use in the HS English classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixed up","review":"boy, is this man mixed up about history, fairies, Picts becoming Pixies from Atlantis with Gypsies who worship celtic gods who came from small people bla bla bla"},{"rating":"1","title":"book","review":"This book is nothing but the fabrication of a delusioned mind.

Solid construction. I gave it 4 stars only because they need to add a shoulder harnessed 'yanking motor' or something on there... lol. Yes, it's hard work, but this tool has blades sharp enough to cut on the first yank which does cut down (no pun intended) on the time you're out in that hot sun. I did about 30 yards of cutting from the bank in about 30 minutes.

It is a very compact storyline and short novel, so if you want something different to read for a long weekend, I recommend this book.The story was initially somewhat reminiscent of Stephen King's \\"Firestarter\\", since the main character can start fires at will, but that is pretty much where the similarity ends. As with her other novels, Miyabe entwines social issues, gender issues and other pertinent topics into her novel and this is what makes her writing so unique.

It is the very highth of comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This movie is hilarious, One of my top 10 favorite comedies of all time. Every moment in the movie is filled with nonstop laughter. I think they picked the perfect duo (being Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels). Their chemistry on screen is perfect, they are both funny in their own right. The extra features are pretty cool, it shows 2 alternate never before seen endings, deleted scenes, and interviews with the cast. All in all, one of the best comedies of all time. I also recommend Dumb and Dumberer, it's geared more towards teens and young adults where as dumb and dumber is funny to everyone. But I think anyone would enjoy watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i cannot believe this crap!","review":"i cannot believe they are disgracing this classic movie by doing the ol' \\"unrated\\" shpeel on it. this is blasphemy on new line cinema's part because a classic comedy should never be seen in another light than the original release; in my opinion. i fell in love with this movie and now they got the unrated edition; if the \\"extended\\" scenes are so funny, why did they leave them out in the first place? it is still as funny as it was the first time i saw it and this is a completely ridiculous move by new line. i can understand if they did this to the ludicrous sequel \\"dumb and dumberer\\", but this is just out of hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"imbecilic and humorless to the bone","review":"I downloaded this movie off Kazaa by accident (the file title said it was something else, that begins with an M and ends with a 2). I figured, what the heck, I might as well take a look. I'd never seen a Jim Carry movie before, and I thought maybe I'd been prejudiced after all.I don't have a high taste in comedy (I like Naked Guns, Hot Shots and the like) but I think most highschool kids would write a better script, and funnier lines, than this movie has. I won't even get started with miserable acting. This movie looks like a social experiment, as if whoever made it wanted to see how low they can go.Here's a hint: if you see a file of size 665,762KB, don't download it, whatever the title says. It's this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had its funny parts","review":"Yeah, It had its funny parts but overall it was pretty stupid, to the point where It just became annoying.

Every time they have a scene that was cut from the version we know and love, we felt that it actually detracted from the movie. Generally speaking everything they added was unnecessary, unnecessarily raunchy and, frankly, unfunny. Everything they cut is evidence of why we have film editors in the first place.My advice, save your money and buy the original version on DVD. This one is not worth owning. I have purchased the original and will be selling this version on eBay (if I can)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"DVD arrived quickly in great shape.

There is no sophistication, no allegory, no subtext, absolutely nothing cerebral a viewer ought to be reading into this film.This is the pinnacle (rock bottom depth?) of low brow comedy. Yes, its childish. Yes, its sophmoric. And it succeeds in this brand of humor like no other film.

This \\"Unrated\\" Blu-Ray is extremely disappointing. Instead of loading the Blu-Ray with a ton of nonsense, why not give me the option to watch the PG-13 version. Even the DVD version gives the standard and widescreen versions. The uncut scenes that are in this unrated version are not funny and ruin the movie. I'll never watch this Blu-Ray again and it was a waste of money. Stick to the PG-13 DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Just got smarter..... What Next.","review":"Dumb and Dumber is comedy of major sucsess because it portrays two typically pathetic losers, who fail in everything from women to jobs, yet somehow they repeatedly capture viewers laughs with \\"the alternative force of humor\\" first captured by Jim Carrey inwhich a restriction of common since is applied, thus creating humor in it's finest form for contemporary America."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"Don't you folks know this movie never would have been released if it weren't for \\"MASK\\".

Whats disturbing about it is that Jeff Daniels went from Arachnopobia to garbage like this and for Jim Carrey garbage like this is nothing new for that guy. It is full of ... pranks and foolish behavior that you find in really stupit people. It has everything immature that could be from farting to burping out loud all of the ... behavior that you could ever find is in this movie. Another sad factor is the attention that this rediculous film recieved its always the dumbest movies that get raved about. But yet again TBS and TNT were given the movie right away the three major networks did not even have it on so that right away tells you that ... movies do not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!!!","review":"One of the best comedies ever!

It's gut-bustingly funny!This movie follows Lloyd Christmas and Harry Doyle as they drive from Rhode Island to Aspen to deliver a briefcase full of ransom money to Mary Swanson, a rich socialite whose husband has been kidnapped.There's a lot of toilet humor here (literally), but it all works! The scene where Harry discovers that the toilet doesn't work after he's already used it is hilarious.My favorite scene is where Lloyd (Carrey) is getting a toenail manicure. Lloyd had thick yellow toenails, and they needed to be filed down. The lady tried using a small hand-sized file, but after making little progress, she started using a power sander to file down his toenails. When she touched his toenails with the power sander, sparks started flying everywhere!

The movie follows two friends on a cross-country quest to return a lost suitcase to the woman of one's dreams.

The classic 1994 Dumb and Dumber directed by the Farrely Brothers is getting the New Line Platinum Series DVD release on January 3 2006. It is an UNRATED edition with atleast six additional minutes with the goods. With Documentary and alternate and deleted scenes. I'm not the only who's been waiting for this!

I can't wait until it's available at amazon.com!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Dumb.","review":"OK there are actually some LOL bits in this movie, it is just that there are to many groans also. Good enough for 2 stars, but there is not enough here to say that it is a good movie, worthy of 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't a really deep movie","review":"This film still makes me laugh out loud. It's a comic road movie by the Farrelly brothers, and probably their best movie to date. Two [people] are driving from Rhode Island to Denver with a brief case belonging to a woman that one of them drove to the airport. They don't know whats in the case, and both of them end up falling in love with the woman.Okay, so that synopsis doesn't say too much, but I really don't want to give anything away. If you like [disgusting] movies (I love the \\"Turbo-Lax Tea\\" part) then this is highly recommend this film. If you hate [disgusting] movies, don't bother.As for the discs special features; commentary would have been nice, as would a decent featurette. At least you get a nice widescreen transfer and good sound. The gallery is pretty pointless though. Still, that doesn't matter too much as the film is good enough to not really need any extras to sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Talking about a Little Place Called ASSSSPIN!!!","review":"Hilarious as it was with two unemployed guys down on their luck until Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) decides that he and his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) should get plugged into the social pipeline - all because of a briefcase left behind by the girl of Lloyd's dreams - and getting tangled up in a kidnap for ransom plot. Unknown to them, they were being pursued by two thugs, following them 2,000 miles from Providence to Aspen.This was one of Jim Carrey's best movies, using his hilarious style of humor and acting as he had in \\"Liar Liar\\", the \\"Ace Ventura\\" series, \\"Cable Guy\\" and \\"Me, Myself and Irene\\", making the most annoying sounds, dueting \\"Mockingbird\\" with Jeff Daniels and both being dressed in the most outlandish tuxedos that seem to come from another time. This movie is sure to cause any Jim Carrey fan to roll around the floor in laughter and this is one movie that is too funny to miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite comedy of all time.","review":"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The unrated version with extra minutes don't really add anything significant to the plot, but I don't find that they detract from the movie as a whole.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 90s Comedic Masterpiece","review":"This film is really funny filled with laughter fromstart to finish. It's a classic.

Like that whole fish face thing in his dream sequence before he gets punched out. Stupid beyond all recognition. Its ashame, too, because I do like Jim Carrey.

Anyway, I wish I could give this movie a much higher rating but I can't so we'll leave it at 5.

This is an absolutely hilarious and moronic road movie! This is Jim Carrey's comedic ability at its best (why he he is squandering his gift on \\"serious\\" films lately is a mystery to us all). If you do not laugh at least once during this movie, check your pulse. Life's too short to take every movie seriously. (eg-Leonard Maltin's review.

It doesn't look like they put much effort into it this time around. The models are not posed in interesting locations, it is all done in a photo studio so the poses get repetetive - just standing in front of a screen or wall mostly. The music will put you to sleep - it's dainty classical French parlor music. ZZZZzzzzzzz. I suppose they don't have to pay royalties to anyone that way. The models this time around are uglier and heavier for the most part (Julien Arias being a delightful exception). Overall, they are not attractive. There is no music video this time around, either.

It's too bad that Neve Campbell didn't have a bigger part because she is quite a good actress and definitely a solid member of young Hollywood, but Ryan Phillippe's charm, good looks, and portrayal made up for it all. He could have played the role with a little more feeling, but he did do a very, very good job.

As a New Yorker, I am interested in knowing what went on inside Studio 54, and so I thought I might learn more by watching the film.Unfortunately the film is mainly focused on the character and narrator (played by Ryan Phillipe) than on the club itself. Yes, it shows the viewer some of the things that went on in the club, but not enough.The acting is excellent though. Ryan Phillipe is much more than just another Hollywood pretty face; he's a good actor. But the real treat in this film is Mike Myers; his portrayal of the club's ringmaster is quite impressive. Various celebrities appear as themselves, which makes it a bit interesting. But overall, the movie is a big disappointment. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Nothing you can do about being short!!","review":"This DVD doesn't advertise it, but it does contain several deleted scenes... one of which is the Anita/Shane love scene towards the end which explains why Greg is so jealous.

Flasy, trashy films are my calling, but there was just something about 54 that pulled me in, it is actually good! Mike Myers is fantastic and I was very surprised.

Geeez! OK - Mike Myers as Steve Rubell is the one stand-out in this dreck, but unfortunately the film focuses mainly on Philippe's character and his romantic exploits instead of on the club's guru-owner. Even most of the disco music used isn't authentic for the period. What a waste! \\"54\\" is a dreadfully banal attempt at recreating a long-gone era and it fails miserably.

I watched this movie late at night to get the feel of it, but there wasn't much to feel for. What I got was a fictional story between Hayek, Philippe, and Campbell. When you try to mix fiction (the above characters) in with fact (Steve Rubell and the Studio 54 legend), it mucks up what could've been a great movie. The movie should have concentrated its script on what Studio 54 was. Rather than showing Philippe getting it on with Sela Ward (Poor Sela must've been hard up to get this role) and trying to score with Campbell. Don't get me wrong, it was an okay film. It's just that a whole lot of potential was wasted on a fictional story (a la Titanic), rather than dealing with the facts. If you really want to know what Studio 54 was like, check out VH1's \\"Behind the Music\\" special on it. It gives you more detail on the club that we all wished we could've got into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, great soundtrack","review":"Fantastic film set around the 70's night club \\"54\\".

However what remains is still great and definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of promise, but fails to deliver","review":"I agree with one of the other reviewers: the movie was cut to shreds, re-shot in places, and generally is a different movie than intended.

This movie could have been an explosive documentary about this period if it had focused on Studio 54 itself and on the music and the era. Too bad the storyline followed a lowly bartend instead. Disco deserves better than a so-so movie.The soundtrack was the saving grace of this movie though. It was mainly due to the soundtrack that I gave this movie 4 stars. The only problem I had with it was that there isn't a single song from the Kings of Disco (Bee Gees) or from the Queen of Disco herself (Donna Summer). How could you make a Disco movie without mentioning either the Bee Gees or Donna Summer?I really look forward to this movie and was somewhat disapointed. I was really entertained by the soundtrack though. I have both volumes and if you like Disco music I do highly recommend the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a groovy film","review":"this movie is so cool.

Studio 54 is a place that i always held interest in. I very well studied up on it and it's characteristics and i was truly dissapointed at the results of the film. It seemed so chopped up and uneven, that it was allowed no chance to speak, which is exactly what a film of such a subject matter should posses. I was so let down with this film and i would assume it would do the same to others that feel the same ay about such an astonishing place as i do."},{"rating":"1","title":"As empty-headed as disco was","review":"This is a good example where a first-time director gets a heap of money (from Miramax) to \\"document\\" a particular subculture and fails miserably. From of all its hype, Studio 54 was supposed to be another world entirely, a place where excess and truly eccentric characters thrived. What the viewer gets is a film that completely glosses over all eccenticities and parades a collection of woefully underdeveloped characters across the screen. Ryan Phillipe is a poor actor and cannot hope to anchor the film; Salma Hayek, neve Campbell and the rest of the cast have so little material to work with that they become nothing more than window dressing. The only saving grace 54 has is Mike Meyer's surprisingly effective performance -- I'd like to see Meyers do more than his Austin Powers shtick. For a truly superior look at disco subculture, check out Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco, a film that shows disco as a social outlet in the lives of twentysomethings in 1981."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered for your protection","review":"Trying to make a film concerning Studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea. It's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era. Gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on. From what I understand, the original director's cut was gutted by Miramax before the film was released it and it shows. Other than Mike Meyers portrayal of Steve Rubell, there's hardly a gay character in sight. There's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted. Thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel.

I felt isolated and unattached to the characters as well.54 is a lost cause. I felt like i witnessed the night disco died. They didn't even showcase half of the songs that made that era what it was!

Not sure where it was shot but some of the scenries are pretty beautiful. My biggest problem with this movie is it's rather racist: a (...) Southeast Asian woman who loves intercourse with a white man 4x her age, and Asian men depicted as ignorant and brutal. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quiet American","review":"Excellent movie beyond expectation. I had read the book years ago.I have always been an admirer of Michael Caine.Brendan Fraser wasalso excellent in this movie.It recalls the atmosphere of the Far East, Vietnam in particularwhen I came there as a young man in the early 1960's.I am now in my seventies but my daughters in their 30's alsoappreciated this movie very much, a lot of violence too, but notvulgar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quiet American","review":"Good movie and great acting by Michael Caan. Being filmed in Vietnam was a plus as the opening scene on the veranda of the Continental Palace Hotel brings back memories of Saigon in 1964."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shh...Don't tell","review":"My major complaint with this film is the element of surprised was ruined in the marketing/promotional material, probably by someone who did not watch the Quiet American.A lovely vignette about the inception of love and war, and the deception involved in both. Brendon Fraser is excellent, complex and wonderfully cast against type. Michael Caine brings his decades of acting experience and makes a strong story work well. I now want to read more of Graham Greene's writing upon which the film was based.The ending montage was convenient but unnecessary. The story is powerful enough and more information may be satisfying to some, but distracts from the spirit of the previous 100 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Idiot","review":"I understand Graham Greene began work on his well known novel after meeting an American aid worker of some sort in Vietnam during the early 1950s who lectured him on what needs to be done in that country. Something about the need for \\"a third force\\". Dear God. The performances in this film adaptation are superb. Brendan Fraser can act serious if a role calls for it. Actress Rade Serbedzija is wonderful. And of course the one and only Michael Caine deserved his nomination for Best Actor. I love moody, atmospheric films and THE QUIET AMERICAN is surely that. The story revolves around a love triangle between a young idealistic CIA agent, a Vietnamese girl and an older British journalist and is set at the end of the first First Indochina War in the early 50s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Caine at his world-class best","review":"Michael Caine is an international treasure. His performance as an aging British journalist in 1950s Vietnam brings great depth and emotional gravity to this movie. He makes Brendan Fraser as the American who invades his life, tries to take his young Vietnamese girlfriend, seem shallow. But of course this is appropriate to Fraser&#65533;s character, who manages to be both arrogant and at the same time nave.Greene&#65533;s story, now filmed with its original ending, now seems like a masterpiece of prophecy. The production is beautiful and thoughtful. Overall, this is everything you could ask a movie to be: thought-provoking, a great script, beautifully filmed and acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful film","review":"I've always loved both Michael Caine and Brendan Frasier, but I was surprised when I saw them in a film together.'The Quiet American' contemplates the effects of unbridled passion, jealousy, and war. The violence is not overwhelming, and not over-the-top gorey, but is honest, nonetheless. Besides the Vietnamese war that is omnipresent, the film focuses on the mental anguish that it causes, as well as the relationships that are the product of it.Overall, a wonderfully acted film. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it sounds","review":"Instead of buying this book, I went to the library to check it out and after reading the other reviews, I was very disappointed. This book has little to do with \\"sanity saving\\" it's mostly just letters of unique situations written to the author of this book. He replies with common sense advice and even sometimes advice that \\"beats around the bush\\" (indirect advice). For the average healthy bride I recommend reading the book by the Knot (don't remember what it is called but it has \\"The Knot\\" in the title). I also got that at the library and it has absolutely everything! No need to get another book. It offers real \\"sanity saving\\" advice and some real life stories for all situations. But if I have to say something positive about the other book, it does have a cute cover... but thats about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Anyone Who Dreams of The Perfect Wedding","review":"Wedding Sanity Savers is the perfect antidote to the highs and lows of planning a wedding -- no more worries, be happy! Wedding Sanity Savers anticipates for you any and all situations that may arise and gracefully takes you through solutions with common sense, practical advice that allievates anxiety, makes you smile, and teaches you how to get the most joy out of your wedding day. I recommend Dr Atkins book to brides, grooms, parents of the bride, siblings of the bride and groom,grandparents, bridesmaids, bestmen, ushers, and clergy. In fact, anyone involved in planning or participating in a wedding can benefit from the sound advice of Dr. Dale Atkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many boring parts...","review":"And where are those harrowing photographs advertised on the cover? I've read much better true crime books. The psychological analysis gets really boring. Writing is unimaginative at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well put together","review":"I disagree with the negative reviews (except about the \\"harrowing\\" pictures promise on the cover being bogus, but that is not the author's fault.)I found her discussion of cannibalism in general to be interesting and enlightening. The psychology is not boring, but engaging. True, if you want in depth on each killer's story, this is not the book for you (it is only about 300 pages), but as an overview, it rules. Also, I love her(?) [Moira] theory on the origins of vampires and werewolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was disturbing yet held my attention throughout the end.","review":"The book described in detail about Dahmer, Gein and others. It was extremely graphic but the need for that was apparent. It was not glorifing what was done. It was scaring you to death. Things like this could happen to anyone anywhere. I can't say it was an enjoyable book. Nothing of that matter can be \\"enjoyable\\" but it did hold my interest. I could not put it down. When I did it was minutes later I'd pick it back up,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the essence of casework and history","review":"One of the reasons people don't believe in ritual/cult abuse is because they don't -- or don't want to -- believe that there really are, in this day and age, cannibals: human beings who eat others of their own species. This book puts that lie to rest once and for all. I wish I had known there was a more current version of the book when I ordered this one (there is), but this particular version served its purpose for me. While the book itself does not address ritual/cult abuse specifically, it captures the essence of casework and history that involves more cannibal killers than I really wanted to know about. I kept turning the pages anyway. You will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't forget to turn on your nightlight!","review":"A shocking book of the worlds most grousome killers.The cannibals.This book contains woderfully frightening details and fascinating storys of childhood concerning flesh-eaters such as Ed Gein-the inspiration for Psycho and the Award winning Silence of the Lambs, Albert Fish- the sadistic and mentally twisted old man who looked foward to his execution as one would look foward to a sunday picnic, as well as the infamous Jeffrey Dahmer- the \\"boy next door\\" who kept heads in his fridge"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOOOOVED this book","review":"I wrote a 10-page paper on Cannibalism and most of my material came from this single source. It is extremely informative and a very interesting read. My only complaint is that I wish there were photos - of the cannibals mentioned, of their victims, etc. This book was recommended by my professor who is a highly respected FBI agent of many years. It's definitely a great addition to your book collection if you are a Criminal Justice student or you just enjoy reading about these unthinkable things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The face of disappoinment!","review":"The face of power tells the tale of a young man and his nonsensical and often anti-social behavior somehow leading him to a higher knowledge. Matt Guest clearly has a problem with the opposite sex and identifies with his female relationships as \\"energy draining\\". His account of romantically embracing a close male friend in a kiss is most certainly his moment of clarity. It would have been more honest of a read if he just accepted his homosexuality and moved on. Instead the reader is given uninspiring pieces of drivel such as, \\"where do all the birds go when they die\\"? This book came highly recommended and sadly it offered nothing useful or even mildly entertaining. However, if you like self-indulgent, sexually confused, new age ramblings, then you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!

I had to start forcing her to eat (open her mouth, put some canned salmon or dry food with oil on it and make her swallow) because she was getting very weak.

The umbral danse remains unknown territory (till Werewolf Players Guide 2nd Edition), much of the info in the PG was NOT included in Nuwisha, and it was over all poorly organised. Though the over all content of the book was good, and useful, this one needs to be sent in for a makeover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"I've owned two of these. I returned the first one after about six months after the rear fan bearing died and started making a terrible noise. My replacement did the same thing after four months! I stuck a toothpick into the fan, not only making the squealing go away but also removing the fan noise completely (which was quite loud even out of the box). The problem now is that it freezes more often than before, and it always chooses the most inconvenient time to freeze. It doesn't burn usable disks with DVD-R, although some say that it works well with DVD+R disks, I haven't tried. The final straw is that when a timed event is activated a small icon shows on the screen ALL THE TIME. Annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read on a rainy afternoon...","review":"I received this book for Christmas, and could not put it down till I finished...

It doesn't deserve that. I don't know who wrote the back summary of the book, but that person completely misrepresented it. This was a completely childish, poorly written piece of sholck that I read for my book club. We all hated it. It was truly awful. There is no \\"message for dreamers, cynics, belivers and sceptics\\" or any one. Do not pay money for this book. I can't warn you enough that the book description is NOTHING like the book itself. Don't be fooled as we were that this was a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Poetry!","review":"Grass Dance by Laurel Johnson is a book that for a lack of a better way to put it to me is \\"pure poetry.\\" Johnson has crafted her true testimony type tale to be anything but: interweaving poems, memories, emotional peaks and valleys in her life into a book that makes this piece of literature a masterpiece of expression. It is perhaps meant as a Christian genre book, but it is more than that, much more.This book embraces the ups and downs of the time we spend on the earth in a beautiful way and gives the reader the hope and courage they may need to turn the pages in the book and in their own lives as well. I recommend this book highly. This is one book that the reader will probably want to read more than one time.

It is well written, acted, filmed, and produced. Probably Dylan's best film role since playing himself in \\"Don't Look Back\\", (\\"I'm glad I'm not me\\"). Great supporting perfromances and demonstrates just the right tone for classic underground, vagabound filmmaking. Great tributes to Dylan classics and a fine story set in a type of \\"Desolation Row\\". A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still think about this movie everyday","review":"This movie is about human nature, human interaction, and the trials of people. There is a lot of wisdom in this movie. Most people who didn't like this movie probably didn't understand what Bob and the cast were conveying to us. There are no car chases or explosions. It is a work of art. It is Bob's poetry on film. Just slow down, take a couple of deep breaths, listen and pay attention! The live performances are incredible, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good; Dylan fans add a star","review":"I'm not even going to attempt to describe this movie in any detail, it is too rich. You don't have to \\"get\\" Dylan in the first place to appreciate this movie, but it helps a lot. It is good for the same reasons Dylan's songs are; but you need a lot fewer fans to make a successful record than to make a successful movie. A million CDs sold is quite a success; a million tickets sold for a Hollywood film is a miserable failure.The music is great, the acting is excellent, and the scenery and stock footage paint fascinating pictures; and the plot, while minimal, is quite enough to make the movie work. On its own terms, a big success; ignore the bad reviews and watch with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but extremely entertaining!","review":"Dylan, and his character Jack Fate, are just incredibly compelling. His Bobness is an extremely strange human being, as we all know by his music, but to see the man walk and talk and interact with other people (actors) is nothing short of surreal. The movie moves like a dream. It is by no means all neat and tidey.It requires you to suspend preconceptions and needs to be seen repeatedly (and even then its up in the air). And then there's the musical performances. Worth the price of the dvd alone. Dylan and His Band rock in a way here before unseen in any movie ever (period)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Visual Dylan Song","review":"I really enjoyed this film. I really didn't know what to expect as Dylan's forays into film have been irratic at best. This isn't a film that you will walk away from saying \\"That changed my life,\\" but it is one that I will watch repeatedly in the future. M&A feels like a 106 min visual Bob Dylan song. Take that for what you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth A Look","review":"This film is full of good ideas - sadly they never come together. However, there's enough interesting content to warrant a look if you're into Bob Dylan, experimental films, political satire or any of the lead actors (although they are sometimes left to flounder with little or no direction the writers & director are genrous to the leads, giving them plenty to do and lots of screen time). The frighteningly Bush-like speech by the new president (too complicated to explain) given at the climax makes this film worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space seem like Shakespeare","review":"What a great cast! I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right? After it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it, although you are shaking your head in disbelief! Stunning! You've never seen anything quite like it! If you are a fan of the campy awful, you may see it as a masterpiece, if not you will still have a unique viewing experience.Proceed at your own risk!

A terrible script (co-written by Dylan) with pretentions way above its low budget and Dylan's non-acting wreck this film. That some reviewers give this film five stars is hard to understand to say the least. Maybe, like Dylan appears to be doing, they are playing some kind of joke on the public. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived crap","review":"If you like Dylan, you'll probably love this. If you like good movies, you'll hate it.

Until then, we have filmmakers like Bob Dylan, who have the accessibility to monstrously construct the elaborate and profound thought process they have experienced. How can such a cold and lifeless movie come from such a warm and gracious artist? As a visual feast to Dylan's most recent work, it manages to exclude his entire heart. Great sound and extraordinary soundtrack does not a movie make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice box, eh?","review":"A pal of mind once told me I should see this really great documentary about Bob Dylan. He said it was called Masked and Anonymous. So I ordered the thing. Much to my surprise, when the DVD arrived, and upon studying the box, I saw it was not a documentary. It was a drama. What the hell, I thought, and then looked around to see if anyone was watching. I have not, as yet, recovered from the shock of this discovery, but when I do I intend to watch the drama.Until then the only thing I can comment on is the box. It's a nice one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the music hate the movie","review":"Perhaps this will help some folks who are considering this movie. I understood the premise just fine, but the awful dialog and sincere but pathetic acting (John Goodman seems like a nice guy, but it doesn't mean you should watch all of his movies, and Jessica Lange was as surprising as a cardboard cutout) reminded me of one of those movies that disappears quickly only to re-emerge as a depressing Sunday matinee you find on cable TV while folding your laundry.

So many great actors, but the story is nonsense. The characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes. Unnatural dialogue. Poorly lit. Poorly directed. Poorly edited.And Bob couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Stone-faced, frail, semi-catatonic; completely devoid of charisma. It's his vanity project, but he comes off looking ridiculous. Even his musical performances are only so-so.The movie was shot entirely inside a Hollywood studio (except for a few 2nd unit shots of downtown LA), making it look fake and crowded.A case in point: Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. Amazing together in The Big Lebowski.

Some movies make their points so subtly that you can't seem them or understand them - maybe this one does but after about an hour I no longer cared.

I first read it because Lois Lowry's book Number The Stars struck my intrest. When I read the stories of the Resistance and the Jews, I can admit I cried. The author tells their stories perfectly. She conveys the courage these people had and how brave all those young Resistance leaders were but does not leave the hardships endured by these people. It is certainly a wonderful reference book for anyone doing a project on the Holocaust. There was only one thing that disappointed me. There wasn't a reference to the permeated handkerchief that fishing boat captains used after the Nazis started using dogs to search the boats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope from History","review":"I know this book was designed for ages 10 and up but I believe it was well done and thoughtful enough for many adults as well. Providing many photos of the people involved and at the end giving descriptions of where they are now was very helpful. And it was good to know that the author had shared her writings with them for review and editing before the final draft. Many times people are interviewed and later find their words were misrepresented somehow.It was a great read because it is important for people to see that although Hitler was an evil psychopath with a lot of power and charisma, even he would not be able to plow through a place like Denmark where the common people thought of Jews as fellow Danes.

Why make people look for it. And the corrections for the Razor Edge shawl are still not right - there are unanswered post on the author's website that have been there since 2005.

I'm glad though, it taught me to check out the next ones from the library which I feel really helped with the Son of Stitch n Bitch (it sucked even worse)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Similar to the Stitch n Bitch Knitting book, this sequel has many of the same style patterns. Likewise, some are really fun and fresh while others simply flounder.This is a nice collection of knitting patterns and there are several that I can't wait to get started on.The layout of this book is MUCH better than the first, without the weird orange pages and such. I would really recommend this for anyone who enjoyed the first book and is looking for some patterns to take their skills to the next level."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish","review":"I found that this book has lots of cute projects, but when I tried to knit one (baby booties) the pattern was wrong -- a disappointment considering I had already purchased the yarn!! There is little point in owning a knitting book with unusable patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for its intended audience","review":"I borrowed this one from the library so I could see the newsboy cap. There were some other cute patterns, including fuzzy monster slippers, alligator mittens, bonnets with ears, and a basic sweater with flames on the sleeves. Of course, you will find ponchos, legwarmers, wristwarmers, cell phone covers, and scarves as well.There is also plenty of basic knitting information and lots of helpful tips. Everything is written in a clear, fun style, and the pictures are snazzy.Experienced knitters probably don't need this book. Most patterns are slight variations on basic shapes. The information about knitting is excellent, but if you own any basic knitting books, you already have it.However, if you do not have a basic knitting book, if you find them hard to read, if you want a fun gift for a teen knitter -- this could be a very good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"i started with the other s'nb, and it was great. this one likewise is full of greatness, but you really need to have the first one if you're a beginner like me. i think that the patterns are very unconventional - modern lines, modern designs, and loads of fun. so, buy both of the s'nb's and you'll be set."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT follow up book","review":"This is just the book I was waiting for! Stoller continues to delight with her witty, fun approach to knitting. The fifty patterns are enticing...I cannot wait until my finals are over this week to get started!Much appreciated in this book is the beginning section on how to alter existing patters. There have been sweaters I want to alter, using different yarn guages but haven't had a clear idea of exactly how to do that. I can't wait to get started on playing with patterns to come up with my own creations.There are some excellent, quick projects in this book that can be knit up quick for gifts, and, in my opinion, handmade gifts are more personal and meaningful thangift cards.An improvement in this book is the fact that the color pictures are with the patterns, so you no longer have to flip back and forth between picture and pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent follow-up to the book that started a phenomenon","review":"Eagerly awaited by so many, Stitch N Bitch Nation is a wonderful addition to any knitter's library.More fun and funky patterns and lots of great information, many of the knitting books I own, don't seem to cover.It was also great to see and read about the SnB groups across the nation.I love that knitters are everywhere, KIP-ing and ripping together in coffee shops, buses, subways, bars and anywhere our needles will take us.If you don't have the first book, buy both. It's a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one, buy this one","review":"One reviewer said if you have \\"Couture\\" dont buy this. Remember Couture is 20 years out-of-date and mostly black and white. This is the book for every fashion student who wants to know each decade's celebrities, looks, designers, etc. It is the whole course in a nutshell (well rather a big heavy nutshell) but still, if you only buy one, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate's dream is to dance...","review":"I first read Kate's Turn over 6 years ago, (I'm now 16), and I've read it many times since. It is realistic, all her characters certainly could be real. It is all about ballet dancing and living in New York (though less on the latter). It's a classic, it is easy to read and very fulfilling. Any aspiring ballerina should read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazzard","review":"Beware - these bulbs, which appear to be part of a PGE GIVEAWAY that are being sold retail burst into flames or simply smoldered when shortly after I installed themI would never buy them again and destroyed them after the second incident.Oh and they performed lousy as dimmable bulbs in every fixture in which I installed them (I bought a dozen).But that's just my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Potential at its Best","review":"The Edge motivated my son to be a state champion in wrestling in a competitive state. Reading the book as an 8th grader, he started to write quotes from the book on 3 by 5 cards and carried them wherever he would go and would read them often to keep himself focused on winning a title even though at times he barely would be good enough to make the team at times. The book taught him that hard work makes dreams come true and that persistance does pay off in the end. The lessons learned from this book have proven to be lifelong and after he did win the state title, he has shown consistently that the lessons were long lasting into his life after wrestling. The book is a must for young people of all ages. Thanks Howard for giving us this treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"This title was used by my grandson's wrestling coach. It made such an impact, he wanted his own copy to read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Edge Paper Back","review":"The book is as described, shipped on time, and I am happy with the purchase.

What an excellend combo! I have a nice 4 Cycle Troy Bilt trimmer but was so frustrated with the bump head on it and the string would not last through a single pass around the yard.With these inserts and the Grass Gator I can edge the yard several times on a single string before replacing them. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brittle","review":"Though a good idea, I found the the repleacement lines to be brittle and last no longer than traditional string. They are convenient considering I have to change them constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced","review":"At $2.98 for one package, this is a ripoff. I just purchased this same product for $1.49 at my local supermarket, which by the way is not a discount store."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST TISSUES ON THE MARKET...","review":"Kleenex is the only brand of tissues that I buy. They are very soft and do not chafe or irritate one's skin. As they are fairly substantial and resilient, they do not fall apart easily when used while blowing one's nose during a bad cold. They are also quite absorbent, as well as durable, given the inherent fragility of such a product. While other tissues may be cheaper, one would not be as happy with them in the long run as one would be with the Kleenex brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient lighting","review":"The flexible arm is too short to extend beyond your 12v plug and the lighting is not bright enough to cast sufficient light to read a map unless you place the map directly underneath the light within a few inches.

Fans of hard music will surely love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"K&N's performance is legendary. One small problem with this model: Because the rubber used is so soft and the filter box was designed for a filter with hard rubber, the filter does not keep the desired shape and sit correctly in the filter box. Look at the picture: See how the sides are concave and not straight? They should do something to stiffen the sides to prevent this flexing. Maybe imbed a wire frame in the moulded rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate This Recording: Get the Denon","review":"The sound quality between this Harmonia Mundi recording, and the Denon, is night and day. I feel as though it's my duty to recommend that you steer clear of this and just go for the Denon and the BIS, both of which complement each other. My major complaint here is the recording of the 'Sixxen' instrument: it sounds clangy and cheap. The Denon eliminates the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Very disappointing movie. I bought this movie. When you watch a movie you like to believe some of the things that are happening can really happen in your life or someones. It doesn't happen.

I am so happy to have found it again and share it with my family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely underated!","review":"This movie is one of the best \\"love stories\\" of the 90's. It has both heart, and intelligence. Davis and Keaton have real chemistry on screen. The fact that they are both writers really adds to the humor as they tear into each other through their respective candidates speeches. This movie just feels real. The little nuances (necisito una toalla) really add depth to the movie and the characters. I own this movie,and really wish they would hurry up and release it on DVD. My VHS copy is starting to get a little thin and grainy from so many plays... Has anyone else noticed that they changed the cover art almost immediately after releasing the VHS version?Bonus* The soundtrack is great too. \\"Sorry seems to be the hardest word\\" really adds a melancholy tone right after the climax of the film--talk about memorable moments..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quer se apaixonar ?.......Ento veja esse filme.","review":"�� imposs��vel no se apaixonar por Michael Keaton ao ver esse filme, ao lado de Geena Davis, eles fazem um dos casais mais belos e engraados do cinema.

Unfortunately when it came in, it was only the adapter. My fault, I guess I didn't read the fine print. Ended up paying shipping and then having to go buy the soft ring to go with it. To add salt to the wound, the local RV place had the complete set for $12.99. I spent $20 with shipping and purchasing the soft sewer ring seperate. Haven't used the item yet, but I think it will be perfect for our pop up camper. I rigged the Shower and Sink drain together and will use this to hook to the camp ground sewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"I was hesitant to order this at first as it seemed expensive but it really was just what I was looking for and now I have it I am not disappointed. As with all guidecraft products the quality is excellent. it is solid and well-constructed. the drawers are a great size for toys and it is handy to see what is in each one, in fact my son likes to play with the bench itself almost as much as the toys that are stored in it. I am sure that in years to come it can be used for items other than toys as it does not look like it is only for a childs play room. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't mind paying for quality and who will put it to further use once it has served it's life as a toy box."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I know this is a must have for any decent fly fishing book collection, and I was very happy with the condition of the book, etc. However, as others have stated, there is only a page and a half from Jim Leisenring on how to fish the wet fly. The rest of his portion of the book is how to tie the wet fly. His patterns, as well as the flymphs from Hidy, are very effective, but if you want a better how to book, I recommend the wet fly book by Dave Hughes, who actually talked to Vern Hidy before his death, and got some interesting information for the fly fisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"An introduction to Chopin for a 10 year old","review":"I made a mistake in my purchase on line as did not know this was a young childs book. (There were no notes at all by the seller to help) This publication seems to me to be written in fantasy, fairy tail form too rather than based on biographical facts. So I am not sure what use it is apart from its entertainment value.My copy is a musty 1960's vintage and was (at least to me) expensive at nearly $16 plus shipping.I contacted the seller about my dissatisfaction and received a rather hurt and almost rude reply back. So, I do not take a chance and buy books which have no basic accompanying notes anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great","review":"We used these to create personalized luggage tags as a favor for an event.

Now while the shipping time was great, the earrings I cannot say the same for. Within minutes of putting them in, a stone fell out. I also bought another pair of a different style and color from this same seller, and the same thing happened. Within mere minutes of wearing, a stone fell out. I was sucked in by the lower prices than the regular silver seller I buy from. I got exactly what I paid for. Junk! I have learned my lesson that cheaper is not always better.

Could never get the blade to stay on the wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Here's a wonderful duo that mysteriously remains largely unheard. Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer sell themselves short with the billing as a folk act: They also work the same alt country turf as Steve Earle, Lucinda WIlliams and Emmylou, and should cross over nicely for folk rock fans who appreciate Richard Thompson, Nick Drake and the like. They certainly have a dash of Beatle magic. Grammer has a remarkable voice and it is upfront on much of this great album. Carter's songwriting gets a bit arabesque at times, but he has delivered a half dozen or so classics here, notably Ordinary Town, 236-6132, Tillman Co. and Disappearing Man. See them live if you possibly can -- and by all means buy this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowiekazowie","review":"What an unanticipated, diverse and unbelievable piece of music. While can't go for the \\"I love every song\\" rating the stuff that hits is very strong.

People from Iran and Azerbaijan will differ their opinion on the subject of the book - the identity of Azerbaijanis in Iran. But the problem of Azerbaijani identity in Iran exists despite the denial of Iranians. Yes, some part of Azerbaijani population align themself with Iranian state and culture. But the significant other portion DO NOT. And this problem emerged not yesterday - we have to recall the attempt of Iranian Azerbaijanis to create its own state and unite with North in 1945-46 (I would advise Turaj Atabaki's book on this subject). With current Iranian regime, supression of Azerbaijani language and culture, the problem is going to be exacerbated. Brenda Shaffer did a good job enlighting this problem in last two decades of the XX century - aftermath of Iranian revolution, collapse of USSR and the establishment of independent Azerbaijan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Academic","review":"While I have yet to finish this book, I was somewhat disappointed as the book is extremely academic and somewhat dryly written.

No one ever has nor ever will sing as achingly, as sensuously, or as purely about love as our late and sorely-missed Dusty Springfield. She was as particular about what she sang as she was about the way she sang it and the proof is right here. Turn the lights off, light a candle, pour a glass of wine (unless you're in program) and luxuriate in the voice that is absolute proof that there is a God and that He adores good singing.Graci, Dusty.

Grab yourself a copy, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Bleed","review":"Purchased this CD on the basis that Dusty in Memphis was one of the greatest albums of all time. That may be true; however, Rhino records doesn't have a clue on how to record a quality CD. The 1999 Rhino version is one of the worst sounding CD's I've ever heard. It lacks music dynamics, is shrill, noisy, and distorted. Don't waste your money on this version. From what I've read, earlier versions such as Phillips is high quality and more enjoyable to listen to.

A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated","review":"This is one of the most overrated albums of all time. I like Dusty and recommend \\"The Very Best of...\\" or one of the other better compilations that show both the pop and soul sides of Dusty. This album has only a few songs that are very memorable and most of those have been done better by other people. Generally, it a real bore - slow and wordy. The sound quality is good and the band is good. Also, Dusty does sing with soul, but she tries too hard too often to sing as the downtrodden 1960's rural black - and a rich English girl just can't pull it off. If she had stayed with the quality soul songs like \\"So Much Love\\" (track 2) this would have been the classic that some people claim it is. I've listened to this about 20 times and it still just doesn't click with me, and I like soul music and Dusty. Maybe someday it will hit me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled...","review":"The revisionist history being espoused by rock critics embraces this one as a long lost gem. Actually it is a sickly sweet sounding bit of pop poop with maybe two good songs on it. When the strings aren't sending you into a diabetic coma you might catch a whiff of a couple of excellent songs like \\"Preacher Man\\". Basically these are interpretations of other people's songs & I can't for the life of me understand why this soul-less wonder is being lauded as a classic. There is plenty of great soul out there, but this ain't it folks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl!","review":"If you own no other Dusty Springfield recording, this is the one to get.Early on, Dusty was spinning white soul so fine that Martha Reeves thought Dusty was a black girl when she heard her on the radio years before this album.

It's not. 'Dusty in Memphis' deserves every accolade it receives. At 11 tracks, it is the peak of Dusty's strength as a vocalist. What makes this album so special is the selection of songs. Dusty was reportedly very picky regarding the selection of her songs (she was a perfectionist in all aspects of her career) but for this album, it paid off. There is not one track that is filler, and the more you listen to the album, the more cohesive it becomes. It's warm, vibrant, sensuous, touching and dramatic, showing different sides of Dusty; her sexy side on 'Son of a Preacher Man' and 'So Much Love', and her more vulnerable side on 'I Can't Make It Alone'. She enters diva territory with her reading of 'The Windmills of Your Mind'. 'Dusty in Memphis' is a great showcase for songwriters such as Randy Newman, Gerry Goffin and Carole King, but ultimately, it's Dusty's show."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Men with Beards smell","review":"I have it too they are not in business anymore they were simply called BOOTLEGGERS used cd's as their source what record company gonna give a company called 4 men with beards their master tape you can hear the hiss and the tinniness on it the vinyl is cheap and trashy and still selling sealed ...they are not legitimate ( Hoffman and Grey who I wonder about too are putting out a 45 rpm LP version which Analogue Productions who have the MASTER TAPE is manufacturing in their new record factory which I have been on back order for MONTHS for 50 dollars new ) of DIM and the bonus tracks are the same as the 1992 rhino cd I smell no tape...20 year old cd as their mastering source"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME FOR HER REVIVAL","review":"This fine lady has still so much to offer: a unique voice, great song material and the heart and soul for it all.

However, on 10.6.4 although the USB devices show up in the Keyspan USB server management software window, they cannot actually be used.I called Keyspan and they verified that 10.6 is not supported, that they have no plans to support it and that they are not even sure if they will continue to produce this product.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy with caution","review":"I purchased one which worked fine for about 6 months.

I've tried the old software in Win 7 and it will not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"love/hate this product","review":"This product has produced plenty of hassles for me, but ultimately it (usually) gets the job done.Suggestions for use with Vista (and even some XP machines): to avoid the Blue Screen of Death on my HP computer running Vista, I had to drop back from the latest version (2.0.2) to the previous version (1.3.4) of the Server software (listed on [...] as a version for Windows 2000) and the Firmware. This cleared up my Blue Screen problem. Over the years I have adopted a policy concerning device drivers... if it ain't broke, don't fix it. When I updated one of our Dell XP computers to the 2.0.2 version (and updated the firmware), it also got blue screens until I dropped back.As others have mentioned, the US-4A requires an occasional reboot, about as often as our LinkSys router does. Most often after rebooting the US-4A, we have to press the reset button to make it drop back to the 1.3.4 version of firmware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatibility","review":"It will not operate in Vista without crashing (my laptop crashes to the BSOD EVERY time I connect to the device). It conflicts with Logitechs Quickcam software (or Logitech conflicts with it...neither company will take responsibility or assist in the matter). It constantly loses its server settings, forcing me to reset the unit by unplugging it or my pc's wont recognise it. Being that it wont operate in Vista, I see little hope it will work under Windows 7. All I have is a single USB multifunction printer attatched to it and it wont even run that correctly without assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good?","review":"This product may be good, but it was not compatible with our large format scanner (Colortrac SmartLF Cx40), so I can't accurately review the product itself. I can review the setup issues and customer service - I have a pretty fair knowledge of computers (thought I'm not a trained IT person). It took me a little too long to set it up, the manual should tell you to first make sure ALL of your firewalls are down. This means your Windows firewall, server firewall and disable any antivirus software while installing. I use ESET Smart Security for protection, and the firewall needs to be disabled every time you want to use the product. At any rate, Keyspan was recently bought by Tripp Lite, so to make things more confusing, the customer service reps are still learning how to troubleshoot the product. 2 out of 3 reps I spoke with were quite helpful though. I think if you have a popular printer or server, you'll have better luck with this product than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn' work with al products","review":"This product didn't work with my wireless mouse, scanner, and it would mess up my print que and I would have to restart the Keyspan software to get it working again.I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works only as a print server not with scanners!","review":"I purchased this item with the express understanding that it would work \\"backwards\\" with my xerox scanner. It does not. After several emails ftp transmissions with tech support and hours on the phone I was able to get it to limp along as a printer server not for scanner - now for the unfortunate part as a printer server, each user has to release the printer they are using for another user to use the printer. I have had much better success sharing printers with pc's on the network and leaving all the pc's on. The product did not fit my needs tech support was weak at best - they were not fluent in english and resorted to written correspondence via email - then because I couldn't get the unit to work as they said it could they gave up on me and stopped responding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I thought this device would be the answer I was looking for, allowing my wife's computer and my laptop to print to the same printer. I've had it for almost a year and as far as printing goes, it has never worked from my wife's desktop (XPSP2) and only works sometimes (rarely w/out a reboot) from my laptop (XPSP1.) I can only get three ports to show up, but it does work just fine with the other devices (a memory card reader and a thumb drive). Tech support has been no help the one or two times I've actually been able to get them on the phone. My advice, save your money and buy a Network Attached Storage Drive with built in print server."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"A really good dog book! Easy for a novice dog owner to understand, but some good ideas even for the more experienced ones.

Of course the eight songs chose for this complation are good,but who the heak puts out a cd with only eight tracks on it? Heak in the 70's most best ofs and greatest hits had at least ten songs on them. Another complaint about this cd is that \\"Slow Ride\\" is the single version, not the full length album version.

Very little is actually said about Olongopo, Subic City or The Barrio, (I have been in all of these places.) Most of the stories revolve around the USN Chaplain Corps, which the author seems to confuse with a mission service. The author also seems to be unaware that MSC does not comprise the Merchant Marine, (I have sail as a Merchant for 20+ years, never on an MSC vessel.)ALL in all skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst direct-to-DVD sequel you'll see this year, which is saying a lot","review":"The original Boogeyman was, well, it was bad. Boogeyman 2 though makes the first film look close to Shakespeare though, completely disregarding any kind of supernatural thrills for a tried and true, formulaic, slasher flick that isn't only predictable, it's downright boring. What is good to note about Boogeyman 2 is that the film doesn't pull any punches with blood and gore, but the film as a whole is so atrociously bad that you'll wonder why you even bothered with it in the first place. The direction is tired and trite, the acting is godawful (genre stalwart Tobin \\"Jigsaw\\" Bell and Xena: Warrior Princess veteran Renee O'Connor have done much, much better than this), and the effects are almost laughable. In an era of direct-to-DVD horror sequels that have been flooding the marketplace lately, Boogeyman 2 just may be the worst of the bunch, which in itself is saying quite a lot. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"First one is better","review":"This is a straight up slasher film. It has nothing to do with the first one. The first movie I liked because it was original and there was a hint of violence. It was scary without being disgusting.

Average acting. Overall, average story without any real visual engagement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"First off, it is best to note that this movie is not a continuation of the original Boogeyman. In fact, the only thing the two movies share in common is the title.The best way to describe the film is: dress a man up in a boogeyman costume, mix it with any of the Saw films, and viola, Boogeyman 2.Hope this helps in your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defies Belief!","review":"I thought the original Boogeyman film was suspenseful, well paced and really scary. This 'sequel' is total drivel. It's not even a sequel in the true sense of the word - the only similarity to the original is the title and is nothing more than yet another pathetically bad 'Scream' clone! There should be some trade description law prohibiting vague and tenuous cash-ins on original titles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boogeyman 2","review":"I must be in a time warp. The Boogeyman 2 I just received stars John Carradine and is directed by Bruce Starr & Ulli Lommel. It is nothing like the movie description reviewed by the others. Where did this one come from? It looks like a low budget movie from the 1970's. (Is it??) I just finished watching Boogeyman (which I liked), and popped Boogeyman 2 in the machine to continue what I thought would be a similar story. The version I have is horrible. I actually wish the Boogeyman would come out of the closet and take this DVD with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is just a comment=)","review":"Boogeyman 2 (2008)ok, i haven't seen the movie yet but if it involves producers sam raimi, rob tapert, and divine actress renee o'connor than it's going to entertain us no matter what. they worked very hard on this film for it to only be released on dvd so as a fan i'm adding my support to show them the appreciation they deserve. these guys love what they do and who couldn't love them for that?! i hope everyone gets something out of this movie whether they purchase or rent it. cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome movie!!","review":"I had first seen Boogeyman several years ago.

It is easily the equal of his more well known \\"Year of the Cat\\" but with less of the over polished pop sensabilities of that album. The remastering retains all of the great sound of the original Alan Parsons produced vinyl version, but with added clarity. I took away one star because of a botched fade between the songs \\"Not the One\\" and \\"Next Time\\" but overall this is a highly recommended remastered addition to Al Stewart's catalog. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Times","review":"My favorite Al Stewart album! The title cut is probably my #1 Al song, but The Dark and the Rolling Sea is right up there along with Carol and Apple Cider Reconstituion.

And, in conjunction with a qualified shooting instructor, these two books should give the trapshooter a high measure of success.\\" Daro Handy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware.","review":"While this book offers many sound trapshooting points, they come amidst a sea of personal opinion, Christian evangelizing, and the marketing of other books. This book is self-published and begs for professional editing. There are countless glowing spelling and grammatical errors. If one were to eliminate the redundancy and material not related to the subject, this rather expensive book would barely reach 100 pages. And, as if the contents were all his original ideas, he offers no bibliographic reference for any of the opinions, facts, or conclusions, even though many are contrary to conventional trapshooting wisdom and instruction. While Russell is quick to point out that the book is only useful if kept constantly on hand during practice and competition, he also sells it as an e-book that cannot be printed. All things considered, I have to seriously question the accuracy of the material and the validity of Mr. Russell&#65533;s opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Trapshooting Secrets - WS-South Africa","review":"The author definately has a lot of tips, but the general layout of the book is poor. There is a lot of repetition, so both the content and price could be cut by half.

Each story in this book leaves you wanting to say \\"So?\\", yet your heart knows the answer to that. The stories aren't profound, nor are they even exciting in any way, yet they are more real than our own perspectives on life. If the author is attempting to make us stop a moment and look back on those insignificant small pieces of our past, like the time we talked with that stranger on the airplane, or that man we ran into in the bank who reminded us so much of Dad, or the lady behind the counter at the 7-11 who knows how we like our coffee each day, then these stories succeed in doing just that.

With this sad collection of short stories centered around the many facets of travel, the frequent Binchy reader may well be disappointed. It is hard to \\"feel\\" a character in a 6-7 page story, though some writers have the gift that allows this to happen.

There some wonderful shots of scenery from the desert in North Africa. There are plenty of very beautiful half naked men running around the desert, but the pace of the story is painfully slow. You know something happens in the movie so you wait and wait to see what it is. And in the end it's not worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profound -profoundly bad!","review":"The only thing I enjoyed about this movie is the laugh I got out of reading the good reviews. It reminds me of a scene from the play \\"Art\\". I am certain the same type would have raved about the Emperor's New Clothes. Not even a multinational cast of sweating, minimally clothed beauties makes this one worth sitting through. It fails on every front, including homoerotic. The cinematography is incredibly overrated. It's simply not even very pretty and completely devoid of mood, lingering way too long on uninteresting scenes that add nothing to the emotional content of the film. Sure there are a few nice sequences, but MANY that look like random bits from a poorly made vacation video. It's bad even as a travelogue. When people refer to this film as \\"hypnotic\\", think coma inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beau Travail is bogus","review":"French movie directors never feel compelled to follow a narrative arc. In this movie, there's no coherent narrative at all. We have endless flash-forwards (or are they flash backs?) and when the final credits come up you are left wondering whether they didn't leave one reel in the can when they transferred this to DVD. The dialog amounts to a few incohate phrases and little human interaction. The scenery of Djibouti is breathtaking, but \\"Sheltering Sky\\" is much better. The rigor of French Foreign Legion training (and the consequent impoverishment of the Legionaires intellectual and spiritual lives) is interesting to observe, but this move can't be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and pointless","review":"This film is excruciatingly dull and pointless.

What this is, is an agonizing, angst, totally 100% testosterone movie that got away from the Director Claire Denis. There is no point in trying to convey a story-line to you as there was no script, no script, no acting, no character to follow, no hero, only sweaty Legionnaire's running around the desert posing sometimes naked and bare chested. And even this is a bore.I really liked Denis' Chocolat, it had character plot and great acting, but she was directing mostly women. She did not know what to do with all these men in a desert, running around looking at each other as if in a daze. And the ending was really too much for anyone to bare.

I whole-heartedly recommend that you save your time and energy and watch/buy something else. I really wouldn't even recommend renting this one.

Accordion master Karen Tweed, of the Nordic group Swap, continues her fascinating career as a Celtic/world crossover artists with this richly understated set of accordion-based instrumentals. Teamed up with the pianist of JPP and Troka, Tweed spins out melodic yet moody ballads and airs. The Celtic influence is undeniable, although moderated with a wealth of other styles, including just a hint of Astor Piazolla-influenced tango.

There is not a clinker in the bunch. Just listen to the clips! Great, catchy power-pop that sticks with you long after the songs end. Peter Case's solo albums are OK, but for me, they never had quite the same spark as this first Plimsouls album.

I know the price of this one is steep but if you liked them in the first place (Got the original Zero Hour on a 45rpm when it first came out!) it is great to have everything all together. I did get the next album as well but had to get this one when I saw the additional tracks and that version of \\"Zero Hour\\" is on this album! So if you like this band alot, by all means get this one and while your at it, get the second album as well. Still think to this day this band should have made it real big.

This excellent performance, brillantly recorded in St. Petersburg's famous Mariinsky Theater, home of the Kirov State Opera, conducted by Valery Gergiev, proves this resoundingly.

To my disappointment, this dictionary has none of those words. Instead, it is full of technical words. All I care to know about Venus is the name Venus. Why would I need to know the names of fossils?

Also, Clarke's overview of that Inauguration Day (Jan. 20, 1961) is fascinating...he provides great sixties details and a keen assessment of what people on that podium (such as his brief but vivid portrait of Mamie Eisenhower) thought about JFK, based on firsthand accounts, memoirs, conversations. Also, this is a good refresher on what real Democrats and real Republicans stood for in Kennedy's time.

However, the author does not do a very good job of keeping the reader in suspense. I believe an eight grader could correctly guess what is going to happen next.I believe Jon Smith's character is a real stretch. The combination of being a top level biological scientist and a James Bond type agent doesn't make sense. The first story he was introduced in was believable. This one is not.The author spends way to much time trying to weave suspense into catching a slow moving ship. I cannot believe any government would allow that ship to get very far without being blown out of the water.The sub story regarding Castilla's father really didn't work in this book.Since the ending of this book was telegraphed so early in the novel, there was very little suspense left for the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Read","review":"Ms. Lynds has surpassed herself once again! Altman Code with its return of solid characters is a page turner that will keep you reading well into the night! The genre is Ludlum but the intensity is Lynds!

And for those unfamiliar with weapons, the AK-74 is the newer model of the AK-47.Ms. Lynds is a stand alone author on her own and ALWAYS provides her readers with excellent material for a read that can only be described as 'The Best'!Read this book, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"It is obvious that the plot and characters are very good. Ludlum was a master of putting a good novel together. The problem comes when another author picks up the outline and tries to create the story from it.At times, the book is very readable and the action moves along, but other times the author decides to try and describe characters you have already been introduced to and seemingly has an inability to create a different description for each, as much of the wording is identical or very close.As others have mentioned, there are times when the author seems to have difficulty writing a particular passage and the words come out a bit jumbled. I would have expected a proof-reader or editor to catch some of these snags.If you can ignore stinted and misplaced descriptions along with poorly phrased sections, the story the author is trying to craft can be quite decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Work for the Ludlum Name!","review":"This will be short.

I enjoyed the story, as the protagonist has make several appearances in stories before, and has been well developed as the series has progressed. Some of the situations the capable Jon Smith encountered did seem a little far-fetched in his ability to extricate himself. There were a lot of interesting characters, all with their own agendas, who were well described in the flow of the story. Overall the story was entertaining, but not always grounded in believable reality. I do recommend the story to Ludlum fans in particular and to adventure story readers in general. While I rate it as a 4 overall, it does have a lot of entertainment in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturous","review":"I stopped reading books written by Robert Ludlum approximately 20 years ago.

Mr. Ludlum skill, knwoledge and writing style are been buried with him and what last is a naif atteimpt to imitate his \\"way\\".The plot is pretty like a soap (including the \\"idea\\" of the US President's father who live since 50 year in a light security chinese prison) and some passage (as when Jon Smith enter in the carrying company ran by the bad people, just picking the locks with medic disguised pick tools) are really light year far away from a serious confidence with the covert operations literary topics.Not to mention what happens when dealing with weapons: it seems that the gun/rifle universe of Ms. Lynds stops to \\"old AK47\\", Beretta and a few others.I don't think Mr.Ludlum would be happy with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I LOVE Ludlum books! they are great for long plane trips (or study breaks) but this book was very disappointing. I was expecting the usual twists other Ludlum-isms but none could be found! I had been under the impression that Ludlum had written most of the book. Anyone who is familiar with Ludlum's style knows that in every book the character has rubber soled shoes when they are sneaking in to get the crucial bit of evidence. I don't think Mr. Ludlum had a whole lot to do with the writing of this book. It may have been his story line but he did NOT write any of it. The ending was telegraphed from the first chapter on. The publisher should not have made it seem like it was mostly Ludlum's work, his name is MUCH more prominent on the cover than Lynds' is (I missed her name when I bought the book in the store). While the book is not bad if you are looking for a great Ludlum try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore writing; grammar errors included","review":"Am an avid Ludlum fan for 20 years now.

Ludlum never dressed his characters in \\"bespoke\\" suits before. Also lots of errors in choice and use and description of various weapons.

It's so bad,it makes Madonna's acting look like it should win an academy award.The acting is absolutely terrible.Second,the photography SUCKS.I don't know what kind of camera the film makers used.The lighting is awful too.And third,the script is seriously padded,along with the storyline and plot,which did not make ANY sense whatsoever.Flat and extremely unimaginative.Now, the film DOES have it's good points,the special FX and gore galore being the best features,but all in all,there really isn't much to recommend here.

He's not hoarse, and his voice is strong throughout. The only thing I can think is that the monitors weren't allowing him to hear himself over the guitars, or that the small nature of the venue created overtones that made on-pitch singing difficult.At any rate, it's a minor complaint. An even slightly off pitch Paul is better than 90 percent of vocalists in the world. The playing is remarkably refreshing.

There seems to be a system of mutual hypein the publishing industry.Maybe there's automatic deference for a law professor/poet.Can't be so bad ?

But if you're looking for a good book to get little kids to take dental treatment then you'll learn a pain free needle technique and more specific information on how to approach a children in the book \\"Building a no-fear dental practice\\" which IS written by dentists. A pediatric specialist even. Who USED to do all the restraining of kids and now uses general anaesthetic on only 1% of his cases.

Rush, Davis, and the entire crew did such a great job in presenting a dramatic portrayal of a life a champion children. I think that each child deserves a medal from the father if such treatment was as harsh as depicted here - but, unfortunately, we know individuals on this earth have it even harder than this. It is the act of watching such cruel psychological abuse that is difficult. Physical abuse is also present.So although a movie about swimming, it is not about swimming. It could be a motivating movie for swimmers, I guess, but it goes much deeper. It is a true story of life. A true story of champions, and the acting is top notch.I wish there was a 4.5 button. I do love the film. I hate the father and also the boys for not standing up to him, but because of the hate evoked the movie was quite effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Formal teaching methods","review":"This book offers a lot of opinion and advice on how to go about teaching art in the classroom.

For one thing, the book is not broken down into chapters, but consists of two sections with each section having one subsection. This causes a lack of consistency in the presentation of facts. The book seems to wander at times and doesn't really seem to get its point across. Also, there is no index to find information you need.Then, when it comes time to discuss the mystery of Lucifer, there is a breakdown. Some information, such as the pagan origins of Lucifer, which it would seem should be given are only vaguely footnoted with a suggestion of seeking another source for the facts. But they are key to the arguments of the book. All in all, a difficult read. There is a good amount of factual content, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE OTHER SEQUELS!

The story is forced, the characters are ridiculously over the top, and any scene with the monks is just bad. It's almost painful to watch this movie. Some of the lines are laughable. When Julie (Swank) challenges the bully to fight, she says, \\"If I'm ever going to respect myself, I need to do this.\\" Um, okey dokey. There are several lines which are just as bad. The villain characters are laughably unbelievable, especially Col. Dugan. Why would any school have a team of bullies like the Alpha Elite? Nothing makes sense in this movie.

The single player is great the game itself is great but with no multiplayer it is a big loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just fell in Love","review":"I bought this game a year ago. It was the only F1 game on the market for a console and I immediately fell in love with it. From the physics to the realism. At first I missed my rumble. But last week I bought the Dual Shock 3. That made me want to play the game all over again. But today I fell in love with this game all over again. I bought the new Logitech wheel for the PS3 \\"Logitech Driving Force GT\\". It was designed for Gran Tourismo. I cant stop smiling and laughing as I make seemingly ridiculous turns with such struggle. It truly brings the game to life. If you don't have a wheel for this game then you have not actually played the real game. Get a wheel and start having some fun. This is now my favorite game for the PS3 and yes I have already tried the wheel with GT Prologue, Dirt and Nascar as well and they all are amazing with this new wheel. Get the wheel play the game it just plain rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge dissapointment","review":"I hear non-stop praising of the graphics capabilities of the ps3, so I finally buy one for the single purpose of driving simulators, as I did with the ps2. since gt5 is yet to be released, I forked out 60$ for f1 ce as I am a huge f1 fan. graphics are amazing, the sound is accurate, the tracks are accurate, but as a simulator, this is the worst game I have ever played. there is at least a .3 second lag between control input (with a logitech dfp wheel and the sixaxis). this makes the cars close to impossible to drive as I am used to both the feel of a real car and the instant response of gran turismo. despite the graphics and getting to drive tracks like monza and suzuka, I find this game miserable to drive, and I end up playing the free gran turismo hd demo instead after getting bored struggling to keep the car on-line. if you want an arcade game, go ahead an buy this, but if you are looking for a realistic simulator, your only choice seems to be gran turismo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great racing game","review":"I think this may be currently the best racing game on the PS3. There are a lot of other driving games on the console, but few are really racing simulators. Yes, it is outdated in terms of the teams, the drivers, the tracks, and look of the cars, but it is true to those details when it was made. The simulation is fantastic throughout. Highly recommended if you actually want to race!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Fast but little room for error","review":"Overall, a fun, very realistic, fast (try full driver's view at Monaco), and somewhat addicting game. My favorite feature is the qualification format. There are three qualifying sessions per race. This gives you three chances at the pole. Each session is about 10 minutes long allowing for about 5-6 timed laps. I only have two areas for improvement:1. 2 players would be nice. I know most PS3 games are solo but racingshould be the exception.2. Don't penalize so heavily for spin outs and minor wrecks. These can be overcome in Easy, but a single error on Medium or Difficult-You Lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great playing. Bad recording quality.","review":"This is so disappointing. Paul O'Dette's musicianship is quite high here, but his artistry has been undermined by a very poor recording engineer. The sound is often muddy, with detail of O'Dette's playing frequently lost. Just sad. Compare to most of Lutz Kirchoff's recordings, which uniformly are detailed, distinct and wonderful. O'Dette really deserved better, particularly with a multi-disk set. It's suitable for background music, but not much else. Definitely not for careful listening with a quality sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spinners do disco as well as anybody","review":"One of the best 70s soul groups ever, known for unforgettable classics like \\"I'll Be Around\\" and \\"Games People Play,\\" the Spinners (like many others in the late 70s) took the chance of trying to cash in on the disco craze, and in this case, it definitely was a good idea. Best known for the smash hit \\"Working My Way Back To You/Forgive Me Girl\\" (the first half of which is a cover of a Frankie Valli & The 4 Seasons song), there's also some tasty disco juice in selections like \\"Body Language\\" and \\"With My Eyes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The ostentation of the brilliant researcher","review":"I have found A.S. Byatt's latest book most disappointing. One of your reviewers thinks that the brilliant, meticulous and extensive research in this book is like \\"mayonnaise\\" - I think it is more like an enormous diamond ring: impressive, valuable, beautiful but, ultimately, fairly ostentatious and valued more for its bulk than its contribution to whatever wrinkly hand it graces. Sorry Ms Byatt - I think the story line and character development need to be stronger in order to sustain all that encyclopaedic stuff. As you did with Possession and with Angels and Insects."},{"rating":"2","title":"of facts and fiction","review":"What is a biography? That is the question that haunts me now that I have put this incredible book down. Is it a simple exercise of \\"finding your facts, selecting your facts, arranging your facts, considering missing facts, and explaining your facts\\" or is it, like all writing, a river flowing \\"toward the writer's own body and the writer's own experience\\"? Is a biography then, in some way, an auto-biography? After all, what is a fact (and how is it different from fiction)? And what makes this (and not that) fact important?How will I (or a biographer) know it when we see it? And what, in the end, is \\"experience\\"?This story, as much of a mystery as a story, grapples with these and other questions. I was not necessarily satisfied with the answers-tentative as they were-at the end but that was not the point. The point was the question; and the question is a good one.It made me think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me","review":"A. S. Byatt has written such fine books in the past, \\"Possession\\" being my favorite. Lately, she's writing dreck. Boring, pedantic, pointless. I tried hard. I read eighty pages before tossing it. Perhaps she's too buried in academia to remember what a good book is. It disappoints me that the literary establishment is willing to publish such stuff. It can't possibly sell. Let her publish it on the Internet if she wants an audience, but don't try to fool the book-buying public with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"one too many happy endings","review":"If you made a list of all the literary devices A.S. Byatt uses in The Biographer's Tale, it would look like a best of postmodern narrative. There are embedded stories, documents, theoretical discussions, and a double ending (happy both times). A.S. Byatt knows how to make a novel, I'm just not sure she has a real story to tell in this book. On the face of it, grad student Phineas Nanson leaves the academy to write a biography and finds love and adventure instead. It all feels extremely predictable and safe-from the sexual partnering to the debunking of contemporary postructuralist thought. Somewhere along the way a great idea for a novel about the contemporary state of the self became an exercise in literary structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les mots, les choses, and la Byatt! Toujours!","review":"A. S. Byatt writes of British intellectuals in academe and publishing in all their marvelous quirkiness. Her droll little biographer here unfailing delights with his idiosyncratic whips and dashes; the biographee is no less intriguing. Byatt never hesitates to drop the erudite name at the most opportune moments such as Virginia Woolf, George Henry Lewes, and, most importantly to this work, Carl Linnaeus. Her prose style is chattily academic with always just the merest hint of British snoot-in-the-airyness. Her stories never fail to engage and keep the reader not only reading, but thinking as well. A new Byatt is always a treat; this one is absolutely as good as Possession, if not nearly as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I recently purchased this cd and had high hopes for it, being a fan of such music.

Quality movies that move at a snail's pace compensate with either stellar dialogue, well-developed characters or first-rate acting (\\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" is a good example of a film with all those qualities). None of those things apply in this film. I watched the entire film with the hope that its climax/conclusion would engage me on some level. I'm saddened to say it didn't. In the end, \\"Caged Terror\\" was a major disappointment; I felt cheated and robbed. Even its low $6.99 sale price doesn't justify the purchase of this film.

I know that since I have been eating a lot of fresh meat every day I feel much better, both physically and mentally. While recommending this book without hesitation, I do have a nit to pick. Ray says to avoid foods that are acquired through technology. Since any technique is, ipso facto, a form of technology, this is hardly useful or even meaningful advice. Better, in my opinion, that he should recommend avoiding foods that are intrinsically the product of mechanized labor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking that makes sense","review":"I'd have to say that this truly is a great book. Someone who had already benefited from its ideas and wanted to spread the word originally lent it to me. After I read it and saw it starting to work for me I bought a new copy and passed that one along to someone who needed it much more then me. The concepts in this book are so simple that it almost makes sense that a layman figured it out. I highly recommend this to anyone hoping to live a long happy life. Not only did I lose over 100lbs and feel energetic, but my chronic sinus problems also disappeared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give a 6th star?","review":"I am a college athlete who was quite interested in losing body fat.

I was waiting for this new(and beautiful) book because I've tryed all ( yes,all ) of the ones in the first and never made a mistake! And the pictures are again beautiful.

Mostly it's just Tom with his guitar or piano, and some unobtrusive (and uncredited) back-up musicians. Much of the work turns up on his first two albums - Closing Time and Heart of Saturday Night - while other songs were never released until now. \\"In Between Love\\" is sooo early Dylan. His voice is clearer and softer than it ever was again. It's a very sweet, quiet album, filled with love. If you liked 60's folk, or if you appreciate the Tom Waits of the seventies, you'll enjoy this a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Early Years, Vol. 2","review":"The Early Years, Vol. 2 being the second part of the early years compilation and are recordings before his debut album Closing Time and were recorded 1971 but not released till 1993 on Bizzare/Straight Records.

I give it sligtly lower but still a 4. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Best Of ...","review":"The tape hiss on this compilation is horrible. Tom Waits is a genius, and he deserves better than this. This is nothing but an off-brand attempt to cash in on the revived interest in Waits. One would be better served by getting the original albums that this compilation draws from (\\"Closing Time\\" making up the bulk) than to suffer through these poor quality versions in a static-filled setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new look at some classic tunes","review":"These are mostly demo songs, some of which were never relased, from Wait's early years (no kidding). Some of the songs on here, such as \\"I Hope I Don't Fall In Love With You\\" and \\"Ol' 55\\", would go on to become classics. Some of these songs are actually better than the versions that were put on the albums, especially \\"Shiver Me Timbers,\\" here turned into a piano-ballad romp, rather than the jazzy outting featured on HEART OF SATURDAY NIGHT. THE EARLY YEARS, VOLUME 2 offers a good introduction into Waits's early music (sparse arrangements, beautiful lyrics), and is also a handy addition to previously-existing Waits collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one album of Tom Waits you'll love in the morning.","review":"Sorry, but anyone who thinks this album is horrible has no feelings towards some great love songs. His voice in this album with the beautiful lyrics get me goosebumps all over. It's something great to listen to when you're with people you love. No doubt, Tom Waits amazing talent is prooved in his later albums, but anyone who would like to hear a soft and emotional side of Mr. Waits, this is a must have! And afterall, wouldn't it be nice to have an album of Tom you could easily listen to in the early morning?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans only","review":"The Early Years Volume 2 is a logical extension of Volume 1 -- more pre-Closing Time demos. As one would expect, there are not as many previously unreleased tracks. For the most part, this has early versions of songs from Tom Waits' first three albums. These do not differ substantially, the main difference being that they are mostly performed on acoustic guitar instead of piano. Different vocal inflections also pop up occasionally. Casuals will not even notice this last, but fans will hear and appreciate the differences. This release thus isn't as essential as Volume 1, but only the hard-core will want these discs anyway. I recommend getting all of Waits' actual albums first; all are great and worth owning). Then, if you find that you must have more, try these. Get Volume 1 first; if you like it, then get this also."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes yes y'all","review":"I've read most of Nancy's works in translation and a good deal of the available secondary literature out there, so I wasn't sure if picking up this new volume would be that enlightening... but it certainly is.James covers much ground, but also manages to deftly situate and explicate the core facets of Nancy's work (from his early works on Nietzsche and Descartes even, to develop his core thinking on subjectivity... this in particular is very useful, not only because it shows Nancy's thought evolving from within the milieu of french philosophy and in his approach to such canonical thinkers, but especially because these early works are not readily available to an English speaking audience).Throughout, this is first class scholarship, and should be of interest to anyone working in philosophical study of community and political thought, notions of ontology and the subject, or aesthetics.and don't ask me why I titled my review \\"yes yes y'all\\" I just had that in my head for no reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"We have a very large opening between our kitchen and living room, and this was the only barricade with a gate that we could find. We went ahead and bought it, and it was fairly easy to install.Pros:1) You can angle it so that it custom fits your space. You can also make it longer or shorter without having to buy extensions.2) It has a gate, so you don't have to continuously step over it or take it down.3) Its soft mesh material means fewer bumps on the head for our little one.4) The gate slowly closes after you walk through it (but it doesn't latch shut, FYI).Cons:1) Although the gate can be opened with one hand, it's not the easiest (you have to move a button and then lift up, not a huge deal, though).2) Its also not the easiest to close (have to lift up and then push down).3) It's wall mounted (not pressure mounted), so it leaves holes in the wall.Overall, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Toddlers","review":"We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well. We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter. My husband installed it easily (one end into a stud in the wall, one end into an oak stair banister) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle, it has shown no signs of dislodging.I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome (and tough for guests to figure out). But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"It says somewhere in the Amazon description that this gate could be used for a top of stairs application, which is why I bought it....we have a staircase that is 76\\" across. To keep it short, this gate is not for that application at all, and even says so in the instructions for use. It is not nearly strong enough to keep a curious toddler safe. The components are plastic and brittle, and two of them cracked on installation (and I used my tried and true handyman who was frankly disgusted with the quality of the gate). Try the Configure Gate instead...much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a daycare provider","review":"I operate and in home daycare and needed a gate to fit a large opening to seperate our formal living room and dining room- which we use as playspace for the kids.

The first five tracks are outstanding culminized by the phenomenal \\"It's A Curse\\" which despite being about a minute too long is one of my all time favorite Fall tracks. The Infotainment Scan is the first release after Brix Smith either left or was booted out of the band and despite her absence the polished sound that she helped to develop is quite evident. One of the highlights is a cover song called \\"I'm Going To Spain\\" which if you surf the net can be found on a compilation record of the ten worst songs ever written. Personally I've never heard the origibnal bit Mark E. Smith somehow mangaged to take what apparently was a piece of crap and turn it into what sounds like an all-time radio classic (although ironically the song never really received any airplay). As I said one of my favorite Fall cd's and well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously underrated","review":"A sadly obscured, yet high quality album. Is there any bad MES album? But, to give people the feel for it, I would say the songs largely resemble that of 'Athlete Cured' from the Frenz Experiment.

I am a diehard Fall fan, and this one bored me stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to the senses","review":"Amazon.com has restored two of the fragrances I wore in my youth, both of which are sensational and evoke wonderful memories for me. Diorissimo, with its light, brilliant combination of lily-of-the-valley with a slight nuance of lilac, is one of those. Dior stopped making this incredible scent years ago, and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I had thought this was a hopeless cause -- that I would never be able to wear this fragrance again or find anything close to it. Fragrances today are so light they disappear within seconds of application -- a waste of money and time. The Houses of Dior and Jean Patou were the grand old masters of the perfume world, creating fragrances that would last with a single spritz, would not be heavy or intrusive, and smell like . . . flowers. A good thing. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this endangered species."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I love this product!

To find a bottle which still smells fresh and true was a great surprise. I love this scent for the memories of spring that it always brings. It smells of lily of the valley, lilac and hyacinth, all just after a spring rain. Just lovely. I feel almost like I shouldn't tell anyone about this, because there is undoubtedly a very limited supply available and I want it ALL. But I am very satisfied with this purchase and will purchase it again, if I can find some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Fragrance strikes perfect balance","review":"I've never met a perfume that was so perfectly balanced. It is a primarily sweet fragrance but not at all treacly or cloying. It is neither overly bold nor weak. I never tire of it. I think it was fate that brought us together. It was introduced the year I was born. I first smelled it during a wonderful trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands when I was 10 or 11. I also bought it in Paris, where I turned 16. I have almost always purchased it for myself -- the best way to get precisely what you want. I have a few empty bottles in my lingerie drawer at all times. The biggest disappointment, however, is stepping into every perfume store I can find -- even duty free -- and finding everything in dior....but diorissimo. It is incredibly hard to find.

I'll put it bluntly, it was very boring. I had to force myself to finish it, mostly because it was due back at the library soon. I have no idea what the author was trying to do writing this book, since it obvisously didn't get much attention. The book is not really a biography, he (Holmes) does not start out saying where he was born, in fact he never goes there but sort of skips to his childhood in the middle of the story to explain why he never talked about his childhood with Watson. Which isn't reason enough to read this book. Some things that annoyed me was the fact that the author tells us that \\"the woman\\" was actually a famous (or is that infamous?) prostitute; Holmes had never gotten married because the type of women he liked were of \\"a certain occupation.\\" Holmes?

Avoiding false heroism and false virtue, this slim volume has much to say about combat over North Vietnam, the men engaged, and their effort to focus on their mission despite the loss of comrades, poor military leadership, and no political direction or support.

I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality.

The plot is predictable and lacks originality, the acting is unconvincing, the characters are ridiculous and the action sequences are utterly average. Craig Armstrong\`s score is decent, but that alone doesn\`t make this movie work. \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" is not more than a run-of-the-mill action movie with enough cliches to be unworthy of any praise.

Unlike Romeo Must Die and The One, Kiss of the Dragon's martial arts is strictly ground fighting. No wires, no nothing. Just Jet Li beating down a whole lot of people.

I have truely been ruined since viewing that movie. Jet Li and Bridget Fonda was simply wasted. The fight scenes were the only redemming quality. If not for them and the sound track I would have asked for my money back. I hunger for anything with Jet Li in it, since he is the best martial artist since Bruce Lee without a doubt. However I wish someone would come along and truely exploit his true talents as was tasted in Fist of Legend. KOTD was excellent compared to most action movies, but lack when compared to the capabilities of Li. And to not get Li and Fonda together and add some passion is truely a crime. Hopefully someone will come out with these 2 in a movie worthy of their talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"JET LI IS JUST TOO COOL!","review":"I have been a fan of Jet Li for a long time and his first American/english speaking movies like Lethal Weapon 4 and Romeo Must Die were not too bad but they didn't quite show Jet's true speed and ability....and then Kiss Of the Dragon came out and ended all that. This is tied with Fist of Legend as my all time favorite Jet Li movie. He completely goes all out in the fighting in this movie using no tricks at all but instead just his own style of lighting fast kung fu. What also makes this movie good is that it was produced by Luc Besson who's top cameraman directed this and did a phenomenal job. It should also be said that for a man who has only been speaking English for a handful of years, Jet's english is so fluent you could never tell. He really shows that he can act in this which also surprised me. So if you want a good story, smooth style, and hardcore insane martial arts get this movie, believe me you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three times is a charm...","review":"This is Jet Li's third movie in the United States, and I must say...this is probably his best so far. It doesn't disappoint in the action area...within the first fifteen/twenty minutes of the movie you are already off and running with Jet Li through a hotel in Paris into a web of deceit and intrigue. The plot is actually quite easy to follow and is well conceived. A Chinese undercover agent caught in the web of a dirty French cop (Tceky Karyo), and a down trodden American prostitute (Bridget Fonda)plays an unlikely side-kick who is Li's only salvation to clearing his name.The martial arts action is non-stop...and yes highly plausible...no hidden wires here. The fighting scenes in the police station are incredible; stick fighting, wu shu, tae kwon do...you name it.Overall, there is a good balance between action and drama. Something that isn't always easy to come by with many action flicks today.

Crystal clear quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li pairs up with Luc Besson","review":"There are few pairings that work quite well together, and undoubtedly in this instance, Luc Besson's usual flair for action coincides with Jet Li's martial arts skills. Most of the \\"American\\" movies Jet Li had made had been lackluster at best. They've tended to focus on his acting skills rather than his fighting skills. Unfortunately in his movies \\"Romeo must Die\\" and even in \\"The One\\", his martial acrobatics are few and far between. \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" blends a balanced mixed of Jet Li's fighting as well as the suave yet sadistic acting by Tcheky Karyo, whose solid performance complements that of Jet Li's. Seeing these two do battle blends into a menagerie of action sequences reminiscent of \\"La Femme Nikita\\" and \\"The Professional\\". As with all great action stars, it is my hope that Jet Li continues to choose to surround himself with the best of Hollywood as he makes his foray into the American market. \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" was a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes a French Director to reproduce HK Qlty Action in US","review":"Jet Li gets to finally make the film he's always dreamed of. A US action movie of HIS caliber without all of our watered down action scenes and horrible butchers of imported films. Jet Li is a show man like no other in this day and age, he outdoes all the shwarzeneggars and tom cruises. In a time where we are in dire need of GOOD action stars with REAL talent Jet knows how to give us what we want. Plenty of ground action with as little Wire work as possible. Be wary this movie is not for the faint of heart, its bloody and violent, with some sexual scenes. BUT NO nudity. It's story is watchable, and all the players in this game do what they are best at. KUDOS to this awesome French director who also gave us 5th Element.

Although I liked \\"Romeo Must Die\\" & \\"The One\\" RMD was missing in really great fighting scenes (although the few short fights were pretty good), and \\"The One\\" was pretty much the opposite, with plenty of great fighting, it was lacking in the storyline department.Kiss of the Dragon has almost enough plot, and almost enough good action... but not quite enough. It also might have been the fact that there were a bunch of Chinesse in France but everyone was speaking English... I think I heard half a dozen French words in the whole film... a little disappointing, and confussing (well, not confussing, it's a movie and they can get away with whatever they want).Overall it should have recived a 3.5, but I rounded up for good behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most EXCELLENT hand2hand battle vs. Government corruption","review":"This is my first Jet Li production [it was on TV sinfully edited, I couldn't watch it] and I am REALLY impressed !!!

The film's plot is confusing and, if understood, boring. The film makes no effort what-so-ever in making an actual good story. Instead, we jump from fight scene to fight scene dodging huge plot holes and receiving dumb dialogue. The fight scenes are mostly pretty good, especially a random scene where Li fights off a troupe of ninjas.

It proved how much Romeo Must Die (an excellent movie) really depended on good actors (and actresses). The fight scenes were overly violent and made me cringe at times (and i usually don't mind excessive violence).

Jet Li is just a short little chinese man and the movie just sucked. What really made me mad is at the end when the bad guy gets killed from the kiss of the dragon needle.

It already made me made the way the bad cop died in the end by stupid Jet Li, but I would have been more mad if Bridget Fonda was a super hot lady and Li killed the awesome bad guy the way he did at the end.

While the Germans in the movie are speaking German, the French surprisingly all speak English with a British accent- and I am afraid also behave like it. While it might be better to settle on English rather than using fake French accents, the script does not give the star cast anything to work with. The characters are one dimensional: Michael Caine's war time criminal either pants, sobs or shoots someone, Tilda Swinton's judge chain smokes and barks at everyone.

A wonderful book I have shared with everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Read","review":"After many years of sitting on my shelf I decided to finally pick this book up. I was not disappointed. It is filled with sweet vignettes about a quaint southern town. Only the more you read the more you discover the town isn't so quaint. But it does resonate as real. I enjoyed the book very much and am looking forward to more books by Fanny Flagg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked this book","review":"I saw this movie first, and liked it. Liking the movie usually means checking to see if it was based on a book (and not vice versa) and then deciding whether or not I liked the movie enough to actually read the book. In this case, I did, and don't regret it a bit. This was a very engaging story. Very similar to the movie, but as with all books (and as they should be), more detailed, and more intriguing. The style hooked me immediately, and the story stayed with me even when I couldn't continue reading it. I only read during work breaks so there was a lot of time between, and I looked forward to every break even more because I couldn't wait to continue the story. That's the mark of a great book for me. It's an endearing tale, and if you liked the movie, you'll love the book. Definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Service","review":"I had never ordered from Amazon before, and I was very excided to receive my book. and Boy was I pleased.. It arrived quickly and in brand New condition.. I am about 1/2 way done and have started look for that next book.. Thank you and I will be back..KJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Folksy, funny characters make you love this novel!","review":"The Whistle Stop Cafe is a place that any reader would want to visit. I read this book in hard back when it first came out and re-read it again as a paperback recently. I laughed and cried all over again. The story is as fresh today as it ever was -- not too many novels can make that claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"deffinately one of the best books i\`ve ever read!","review":"Fannie Flagg is quite an accomplished writer who combines teaching and humor in a book that will break your funny bone and drain your tear ducts."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"this book is awesome. read it in like 2 hours. i loved the movie and the book surpassed my expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I quite liked it!","review":"Whenever I see a movie that was originally a book, I always want to read the book. Then i got on amazon and saw how many people were just lovin the book! So i got. And here I am, to make my own rave review.Although the book jumps around alot, somehow I never got confused or annoyed. It just still fit seamlessly together, ninny telling her story and the rest being filled in. And then it tells the story of Evelyn, who's struggling with depression and her want to die. And then it goes through with her as she suddenly becomes angry, calling herself Towanda.I'd say that it's definately worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Serious Student of English Pours Her Heart Out","review":"I read this book after seeing the movie, and it is ten times more engrossing. There are twice as many characters, and you'll love them all. I also found \\"Ruth\\" of the movie quite flat, but I love her in the book. Besides the wonderful charaterizations, the book dealt very well with an obvious lesbian relationship. Although Flagg never directly states it, it's clear that Ruth and Idgie are in love, and all the other members of the community are so accepting that they give us an example to live by today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Dr.Seuss books are more believable than this book. Her overly comical approach is entertaining and humorous, but does not add to the deeper meaning of the book, which is, I believe, real and genuine friendship. Comedy is an important element, but too much of a good thing really takes away from the value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy????","review":"Well, I hate to be negative, but I do not like this book. True, there is comedy, if you have a lame sense of humour. There are touching moments. Actually, I don't know that for sure, somebody told me that. I never became attached to the characters, and after a while, they just became plain annoying. I wish I had never bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase!","review":"I like the way the book came in just the way it was promise, arrived on time and good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"no words...","review":"this is one of the best books i have ever read. it manages to be both pop fiction and literature at once. you feel like these people are real -- albeit strange.flagg skillfully weaves themes of gender, sexuality, race (and racism), all while adding a murder mystery and bandit mystery to the mix. it's incredibly good and incredibly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 thumbs up!","review":"I loved reading this book. It was hard for me to put it down on most nights. I would get lost in the streets of Whistle Stop or loose track of time in the caf��. Fannie Flagg's characters seemed real to me and I often found myself referring to them like I would to my good friends. Not only was it a good story, but it was also a good lesson. Mrs. Threadgoode helped Evelyn through a hard time in her life, and now Fannie Flagg has helped me through a hard time in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read!","review":"To fully immerse yourself in this book you need two things: a quiet place to read and a lazy afternoon with no interruptions. With these you will be transported into the lovely, quaint town of Whistle Stop, Alabama. Here you will meet numerous interesting folks such as best friends Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison, wanderer Smokey Lonesome, wise and nuturing Sipsey and easy to please Big George. This book never really does decide what time period it wishes to be set in, it just wavers back and forth, mostly between the late 1930's and mid 1980's. Fried Green Tomatoes captures the essence of the human spirit and shows what the epitome of love and friendship really are. The words will jump out at you and stay with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Daisy Fay","review":"I had read Daisy Fay and the Miracle man and I must say it was not my favorite book. But I loved fried green tomatoes filled with the sweetness of the south and even features the recipes from the book. This book fills you with compassion for the less fortunate and a hatred for racist and sexists alike. You come to love all thew inhabtants of whistle stop and will laugh and cry right along with them. So will Evelyn Couch who is having the story of this town told to her by Ninny Threadgoode and will never be the same agian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fried Green Tomatoes","review":"This was an excellent read the first time I read it several years ago. I enjoyed it just as much this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I was completely bored with this book. I am reading Can't Wait to get to Heaven and I don't want to put the book down. I really like Fannie Flagg's books but just couldn't get into Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. If I could return it I would. Sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I saw the movie years ago and just read the book. It does vary from the movie as do all books/movie makes. However this one was really good! I liked how it followed different characters other than the movie just following the main characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"I just couldn't put this book down. Some parts were funny and some were heart-wrenching, but either way I really enjoyed it. My friend also read it and felt the same way. It is even better that the movie. It is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All too often","review":"FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is by far the best book I've ever read. Period. All too often the words \\"heartwarming\\" and \\"touching\\" get applied to a book or movie that doesn't deserve them. Not the case with FGT. I laughed, I cried, and I would have given it four thumbs up if that had been possible. A truly wonderful tale, which is well-crafted and without a doubt the best of southern fiction, FGT will live in your heart forever. I've recently become fascinated with southern authors, having just finished reading INNER VOICES, INNER VIEWS by Kingsbury, and have to say that I'm going in search of EVERY southern book out there! Must also recommend the book PRINCE OF TIDES by Conroy, which I recently finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe","review":"I had to know if the character played by Jessica Tandy in the movie was Idgie. I'm not telling. I was also surprised to find the differences between the movie version and the book. I wish the screen writer had followed the book. Worth reading if you've only seen the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Although I picked up this book because it was on my school-required summer reading list, I enjoyed this book immensely. The story wasn't a page-turner, per se, but it slowly grew on me and I found myself eager to read more. The story is truly heartwarming and I was sad when I reached the end... I strongly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I loved the movie until I read the book","review":"Okay, I still love the movie, but the book... Oh, the book. I adore this book.I had never been introduced to Fannie Flagg's writing before reading Fried Green Tomatoes, but reading it has made me want to track down her other books. Once I started reading this, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"wow, i dont think words can describe this book. Its a romatic comedy that will make you lagh and cry, Im 13, and this book, i can recomend to all ages. If you want to know alot more than just what the movie shows you, like i did, then you should definitly read this, it explains alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Literature at its best","review":"If you're trying to decide between seeing the movie or reading the book first, definitely go for the book. There's something about Flagg's writing that makes it leap off the pages with Southern charm. Being overly familiar with the excellent movie of the same name, I felt like I was reading the screenplay when I read the book, and I wished I could enjoy this literature on its own, without imagining Kathy Bates and Mary Stuart Masterson in their big screen portrayals.That said, this is an excellent piece of Southern literature, interweaving years and generations of colorful characters. The stories about family, relationships, love, community ties, and more are beautiful and important with their life lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons Better Than the Movie","review":"If you enjoyed the movie, then you will love the book. As always, the book ended up being better than the movie by far. I would recommend this book to anyone who asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I watched the movie several years ago and liked it so I thought I would try the book. I like certain aspects but was disappointed in some of the language, mostly the cursing, I don't see the point of putting that in to ruin a good book. I also don't remember Idgie and Ruth's relationship being homosexual. In the movie I got the impression they were just really good friends, more like sisters. I wouldn't think their relationship would have gone over so easily, as the book portrayed, in those times. I also thought there were too many characters and the timeline jumped around a lot, it was hard to keep up with. I did like Mrs. Threadgoode and Evelyn's story, again minus the horrible cussing \\"scene\\" at the grocery store. I was quite shocked that language was in there. I am over halfway through and probably will stop reading it because of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language very bad","review":"This was purchased for my 96 year old Mom. She was appalled at the terrible language she heard in Fried Green Tomatoes. Being legally blind, this is the only entertainment she has now, so she was completely taken back by what she heard. She has other Fanny Flagg audio books, but this one she will not listen to. If I could get her a refund, I would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title with inadequate description","review":"*WARNING* The title for this item says \\"snow paddleS\\" (plural), but there's only one included. From the title of the item, you would expect to receive two of them, since there are two paddleS in the snow blower.If your snow blower takes two, make sure you order two!Besides only getting one of these when I needed two, it seems like a decent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am a big Jeff Speakman fan but I have to say that this is probably the worst movie that he has made so far. The best part of the whole movie is the first five minutes where you get to see him perform his Kenpo techniques as a silloette. The story isn't that bad but the direction stinks. Especially for the fight scenes. Things go by so fast that you can't really see what Jeff is doing to the bad guys. Plus alot of shots get obscured by objects in the rooms. And just as a final comment, if you watch this movie watch as a stunt man jumps backwards through a window before Jeff can fully extend his kick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"I'd have to say that I was very disappointed with this movie. The fight scenes were hard to follow and the story was pretty weak. The bad guy played a pretty good nut case and I'm a pretty big Speakman fan but overall I'd have to say that this wasn't a very good movie. The one thing that I'd have to say I liked about the show is the first couple of minutes where you can see Jeff performing some of his Kenpo techniques. That is really the only reason I ever put the tape in the VCR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action Flick with Some Kenpo in It","review":"Action flick with some halfway decent MA scenes in it; Speakman was still buff in this one, but I found myself fast forwarding to the fight scenes at times. Also stars Ron Silver, who is pretty good as a bad guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tank Top - sizing...","review":"I love Stone Cold and I will look great this summer in my new tank top!

I love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best baby items","review":"Our son is now 2 1/2 and we still us this bag. We love all the pockets and that you can fit everything you need for a day outing plus some and keep it organized. We have also added a clip to attach item to the outside for quick access. Great unisex bag, dad also loves carrying it. The bag is a great size because it also fits easily into a stroller basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the cost, I'm happy","review":"Inexpensive, so I could afford to buy this just to try it.

I'm a huge Jared Leto fan and love pretty much every movie Alicia Silverstone has been in so I had high hopes. Well I put it on last night since I just received it from Amazon on Monday and boy was I ever disappointed. The review above mine gives a good depiction of the storyline but this movie was terrible. I found myself watching it to see if there was a chance of it getting better... it didn't. The highlight of this movie was getting to see Jared shirtless. It was long and drawn out with too many stupid, back and forth type scenes which left me begging for the movie to just end. The acting wasn't great and although the storyline sounded good, wasn't successfuly executed. If anyone is interested in this movie to see Jared in his younger, acting days I'd suggest checking out something other than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorter than advertized","review":"Please be aware that this bench is not 3 feet long.

However, it does provide a lot of good information. I checked it out from the library, but it wouldn't be a bad book to own. There is not mention of anything about the internet as it was published in the 80's. It is mainly geared toward nonfiction writing. Though the information would be good for anyone planning to self-publish. Another book I would recommend if you're really into self-publishing, is Dan Poynter's Self-Publihing manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"This book is very informative and written in layman's terms. It is easy for a first time publisher to understand. The author is very real with his communication;no complicated verbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Fluff: a Toothless Vampire = No Vampire At All","review":"I can hardly believe this book is receiving positive reviews and is selling so well. The book I read was an embarrassment, weak on every front, academically non-existent, informationally void, with absolutely no \\"bite.\\" The author writes very poorly and presents neither useful information nor entertaining anecdotes, simply throws together a bunch of lame facts, observations, and personal opinions in a lackluster fashion, and then presents it as a work of substance. Most surprising of all is that it comes from Llewellyn, a publisher that used to have some discernment, but apparently is now only interested in what sells. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really mind opening, great for separating fact from fiction!","review":"This book really gave a good insight on the different types of vampirism.Also included was actual references to vampire deities not made up fictional characters.One word somes it all up BRILLIANT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids stuff..","review":"This book is just for new fans of vampires. The information that konstantinos brings here is just hours of browsing in the web. Every single topic is on the web. He just going to save you hours of web searching,but the information is for begginers. I doubt of the knowledge of magic of Konstantinos.I gave the book 2 stars, just for the trouble of collect all the web pages and make a book with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring","review":"I read this book and several times found myself falling asleep to the blah blah blah meanderings of this author. The information there is good if he would try and condense it into something tolerable to read. The stories are good but found elsewhere, the letters were intriguing but the way he writes just doesn't keep me wanting to read more. I had to force myself to finish this book as it was picked as a book for school to review, otherwise I wouldn't have completed it without a second thought as to what the ending chapters had to ramble about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and informative","review":"If you want to know more about vampires, be it immortal, mortal or psychic. This book really helps. Easy to understand and down-to-earth. You can find basis information regarding vampires, and its myths, what is true and what is fictions only. A book that will thrill you with past stories, how did vampires exist on this earth and why people are so frightened by them. What is the so-called psychi vampires mean, especially nowadays, very interesting piece of stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"One section","review":"This was the first book I read by this author.

Yes, there are vampires - but those who don't have willing donors seldom take more from any individual than they can afford (or even notice). There are also passive-aggressive individuals; and while the monicker doesn't sell books half as well as does the trendy \\"vampire,\\" those who wish not to be preyed upon might do well to learn the difference.There are plenty of people and things out there that should be considered dangerous, but vampires aren't one of them. This book encourages irrational fear and a divisive attitude, which only makes it a pity that it's so well and convincingly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much wind resistance","review":"Don't recommend these pants if you are trying to overcome wave drag or supersonic flow.

On windy days, I don't even let Helen out of the house even to pick up the newspaper.

We Belong Together just sounds like a carbon copy of all her better ballads. I used to be a huge Mariah fan from 1990-1997 - this woman had a killer voice and her songwriting was pretty darn flawless, but then she changed into this hip-hop/r&b knockoff - it was a terrible career move on her part. If you want classic Mariah then check out Music Box or Daydream, now that's a true artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't It Bad Enough This Album Was Released Once?","review":"The fact that Mariah has somehow managed to crawl out of the ashes of Glitter and back into heavy radio rotation with such terribly predictable and uninteresting music as this has made me lose complete faith in music in the this country. She wasn't bad ten years ago but her new material is trash. Lots of mediocre R&B guest stars shouldn't be a selling point for a record. Hopefully next time around all the young kids who thought this kind of music was great will grow up and realize how regurgitated it is and decide not to purchase another amateurish CD from Mimi. I suggest picking up something from Janet Jackson in the 80's since that's clearly who she's trying to emulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comeback of the century!","review":"Mariah has still got it.

What happened to the days of \\"Music Box\\" or \\"Day Dream\\" where she was a vocal diva? Very few could sing like her. Now, we're forced to hear this monotonous, cookie-cutter crap that any moron with a microphone could put out. Can she still sing like she used to? Or, has she lost her voice like Whitney (there's another sad story). Note to Mariah: drop the hoochie-wanna-be hacked hip-hop horse crap and remember the music that put you where you are. What a waste of talent (if she still has it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Stepped Her Game Up!!!","review":"Mariah stepped her game up from her last 2 albums and the buzz was definitely worth it. The first half of the album is good and the end was good, but the middle is a bunch of fillers. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is definitely the best track you kinda get a feel of the old Mariah back it the 90's.

People actually would have slept on this album if she didn't record the record of her career, \\"We Belong Together.\\" She looked great in all of the videos; the live performances of this album were o.k.

So what if Mariah wants to release this CD for the third time or even for the 10th time. I mean artists rerelease albums all the time. This CD adds 4 great new tracks but leaves Sprung and Secret Love off, a bad move on Island's part. However, if you don't currently own this CD, then this is the version to own.I really think that kid's should be banned from reviews. I mean what does her weight have to do with the quality of an album review. These reviews should be from people who actually have heard the CD.

Here are the problems I encountered when using with 3 or 4 people:- not enough forks (unless you have a LONG time to eat)- food falls off the forks, they need to be more substantial- cannot have more than 4 forks in the pot at one time, throw away the fork ring, it makes things worseBut for one or two people:- can handle four forks at a time from the SAME direction (again, throw away the fork ring)- by alternating forks from cooking to eating, the pot will stay hot and you will be well feed- great for vegetables, fresh and crunchy (try bok choy)- use small pieces of meat and they will cook quicklyI have not tried the pot with oil, cheese or chocolate; I just use water with spices or a broth."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"unfortunately this product is not well designed, first of all the safety handle is poorly thought out, disconnects too easily, secondly, the product makes a nice fondue but then it starts to congeal cause the product kind of goes into warm mode.... not recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I can't wait to try this fondue pot out later this week!

It's a great product. The magnetic break-away cord is a necessary nuisance for safety. I just run an extension cord up onto the table. The heat selection dial is predictable. It was easy to set the dial to cook with the hot oil without scalding everything. Some recipes suggest cooking on the stove and transferring to the fondue pot before serving, but with this product you can cook in the fondue pot. I can't imagine what could possibly use the maximum heat setting! Turning the dial down reduced the heat predictably. Cleanup is easy, as the cords are removable and the entire dish and legs are submersible. Plus, the dish is stainless, so just allow it to cool and everything cleans up nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still working","review":"It heats up cheese pretty well and is easy to use.

Unfortunately, the quality of this toy is awful. All of the holes in the hub pieces are oversize, so the sticks won't stay in them. Everything just falls apart, which is very frustrating for the kids. I know from my childhood experience that the fit of the pieces can vary due to humidity - loose in the winter and tight in the summer. But all of the parts are just ridiculously loose - I have to wrap the ends of the sticks with aluminum foil to make them stay in the hubs. We've purchased 2 (Tinkertoy Classic Jumbo) sets in a year, and had the same experience with both. This is a wonderful, educational toy. If only Hasbro could make it correctly.

However she has already learned some about how to make something stable with a wide base, and how different size holes affect the stability of structures she builds, so there's some educational value there.Unfortunately, she hasn't played with it too much since she got lots of other stuff for Christmas and it just can't compete with her new Geo-Trax set!

My recent purchase was very disappointing. The quality of the pieces was inconsistent so that some of the rods and spools fit nicely, and others fit so poorly that the resultant structures fell apart at the slightest touch.Tinkertoys have always provided creative play for our family in the past, but imagine witnessing the frustration of a child who has designed and built a Tinkertoy \\"project\\" only to have it fall apart.

And he doesn't keep them picked up very well at all--soooo, little by little, they're getting tossed in the trash.

Ms. Hart researched the time period well, making her descriptions credible and interesting. The details about square-rigged ships are especially impressive. The story, centering around a young Irish lady and her forced marriage, was enjoyable and exciting; there are swordfights and battle scenes to complement the torrid romance between Reed and Kathleen. I loved this book. The characters are strong and the story exciting. I've already read it three times! The only thing holding back the novel is the sometimes poor writing of Ms. Hart. She tells a great story, but some of the dialogue is inappropriate. In spite of this, \\"Fire and Ice\\" is a great read. There is also a fabulous squel, \\"Ashes and Ecstacy\\" that is simply heart wrenching. I strongly recommend both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This was my third Catherine Hart book and as usual I couldn't put it down.

Could have been told from the beginning to about a third of the way, and then ended there. That whole part could have been elaborated a bit more, and that would have made a perfect story. It was quite tiresome to read the whole thing. Kat did get angry a little too quickly, but it was nothing compared to Reed. His behavior sometimes just made me want to kick him in the crotch, especially the two scenes toward the end when he actually spanks her and makes her beg, and then slaps her in stupid ridiculous anger. Both those instances REALLY should have been left out. She didn't deserve either of them. He deserved to be called most of those things she called him, especially when he demanded she obey.But anyway, disregarding the whole second half of the book, the first part was very hot and intense. Catherine Hart writes very heated intimate scenes.

And the one pan that did warm up did not warm up to any great degree, in my opinion. Accordingly, I returned both trays to Amazon, and replaced them with two warming trays purchased locally.

It runs for a longtime before changing batteries. One of the best features is how fast it will re-route you if you get off your route.

You can't beat it for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I listened to the poor reviews - Waste of money","review":"I'm a avid hiker and enjoy watching this type of documentary. I was very dissapointed in this DVD. Aside from a few hikers whom I found semi- interesting, I didn't really care if these people made it or not. The film skipped A LOT - most of the trail actually.The film showed a few guys partying, a lost dog growling (milding entertaining) and some hiking. The most entertaining part was one of the bonus features. The most interesting guy went on a rant for about 5 minutes. It was by far the funniest part of the film.No, I didn't buy this film to laugh, but do enjoy humor and entertainment while learning. I was not entertained nor did I learn anything about the AT or hiking that I didn't already know.I first got hooked on the AT after channel surfing and stumbling upon PBS's Five Millon Steps. This was much more interesting than 2000 Miles. Read the poor reviews and seriously consider them before purchasing this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT DVD 2000 Miles to Maine","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD, especially after section hiking the AT in Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland this past April. I have been section hiking the AT for 10 years now. This DVD gives a snapshot of the people and places of the trail. The emotions the hikers go thru came out. The photography stands up well. I've watched it five times now and it's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"For the life of me, I can't figure out how this dvd garnered any positive reviews! The camera work is bland, scenery shots seem to be at a minimum and it's as boring as can be. The background music is thin and doesn't add anything to the energy of the trail. This is a dull, poorly done production. Save your money and time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I received this DVD as a gift after putting it on my Amazon wish list and man was I disappointed! I thru hiked the trail in 2009 and am always up for a good DVD about the AT. This isn't one of them. If you're expecting to get an insight about trail life, you won't find it here. The production is low budget, amateur, and badly edited. Your money would be better spent on a good AT guidebook or even a couple dehydrated meals than this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"2000 Miles To Maine","review":"As an avid hiker i was quite interested in watching this DVD. I did enjoy it somewhat and ONLY for its entertainment value.It has no educational value whatsoever. The film had major holes in it and failed miserably regarding scenery. If your interested in the ATs culture then this might interest you. I hate to be so harsh but its pretty much a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Missing","review":"This film was not that bad, but too much of the trail was left out. It started out in GA of course and the next thing you know it is in New England somewhere. I would have liked to have seen more of the trail itself. It would have also been nice to see those behind the camera. The film did do a good job of telling the stories of several hikers themselves. For videos on the AT, I would recommend Trek instead of this one, but if you are a true backpacker you will probably find this one somewhat entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about Hiker to Hiker interaction.","review":"I liked this DVD. I would have given it 5 stars but it left out alot of trail. I would like to have heard more about individual stories. About how people came to hiking. What their life was like alone on the trail. The difficult times. Good times. etc. There wasn't much of that. Most of the DVD is about hikers interacting with other hikers. The interviewer gives open general questions. Like - \\"Whats going on now?\\" - \\"How are you feeling?\\". Hikers just seem to give their impressions of the momemt. Not much reflection on yesterday or vision of whats ahead. The story seems to follow one individual in his quest to reach the end of the trail in Maine. I liked this. However. Seeing the isolation of this person. The tired and worn expression. I won't tell you what happens in the end. I will say. Now I know why people quit the hike before completion. Overall a good DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've seen","review":"I just purchased and viewed 2000 Miles to Maine and Trek. Both videos are very good but 2000 Miles wins my vote. I did have two small problems with it though. Too much of the trail was missing and I didn't fully buy into the camera crew just bumping into Chad all the time. I thought the scene where he doubts his ability to do the trail was contrived. He seemed like part of the cast to me. Regardless I still liked following his hike and thought he was very likable. He seemed to appreciate and respect his undertaking. The thing I liked most about this film over Trek was that we were introduced to many more hikers with varying ages, which meant different views, attitudes and personalities. Not some collective frat house mentality. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any AT enthusiast or wannabe AT enthusiast!","review":"Within 24 hours of receiving my copy of 2000 Miles to Maine I had watched it three times!

The characters are entertaining, the footage is excellent and the production work brings it all together. It is a great piece of work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good AT Documentary","review":"This is a straight forward look at a season on the AT and its typical array of hikers. The film covers the early crowds from Springer to Neel's Gap, the section hikers and the thinning, but diligent, hikers who finish on Katahdin. Certainly not an overproduced, glitzy depiction, the film gives an inside look at the real experience of covering 2000+ miles on foot in the back woods of the eastern U.S. I only wish Morse had the time to cover more of the middle section of the trail and a few more of the hikers who went all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT","review":"Of 4 DVDs I have veiwed about thru hiking the AT, I thought this was the worse one.Gave a real slanted look at the type of people who hike the AT.The other DVDs I have seen about the AT made me want to chuck my job, throw on my rucksack and hit the trail.This DVD made me think \\"screw the AT, I am going to hike the PCT.

I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe.

I know taste preference is all subjective. But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point. After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it. I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters. I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste, Great Results","review":"This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results. This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake. It fills me up, it can be used as a meal replacement. It also has helped me increased muscle size much faster then previously. This product is great and I recommend it for anyone from an everyday Joe just trying to get into shape to people who are very serious about working out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes Great!","review":"This is the only protein powder that I have used that tastes great even mixed with just cold water and a shaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty, cheap","review":"Cheaper than the other meal replacement shakes without sacrificing too much flavor.

Every single song that was on \\"A Stash Christmas\\" is on \\"A Swinging Christmas\\" with one exception -- Dinah Washington singing \\"Silent Night\\". Instead, you'll get \\"Swingin' Them Jingle Bells\\" by Fats Waller & His Rhythm. It's a nice trade-off, in my opinion. This is a great collection of early blues/jazz holiday songs from 1925 (\\"Santa Claus Blues\\" from the Clarence Williams' Blues Five) to 1955 (Louis Armstrong's \\"Christmas in New Orleans\\"), and includes Armstrong's charming recital of \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" from 1971.

While there are no government guidelines for ozone levels in the home, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does have an ozone regulation for medical devices (the FDA does not recognize home air cleaners as medical devices), and air-purifier manufacturers may voluntarily submit their air cleaners for ozone-emission testing. The FDA mandates a limit of 50 parts-per-billion (ppb) when measured at 2-inches away from the unit.Oreck purifiers produce ozone which are harmful to your health and the enviroment.Ever wonder why they are being sold a dime a dozen on Ebay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"As of 11/11/05, 942 people have rated this film a \\"10\\" on IMDb.com...","review":"..looks like they got served.The plot: Two friends have to win a dance contest if they want to open their own recording studio.This film is another movie that every 13 year old rap fan seems to salivate over. It averages a rating of 2.1 on IMDB. A 2.1 is disturbingly high for this movie. The movie was just another example of how today's youth's culture is degenerating at a steady pace. It's another movie glorifying \\"thugg lyfe.\\" It was just a plain, flat-out boring movie, or in other words, a flat-out P.O.S. People who say \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\" is bad should see THIS.

I think Omarion,Marques Houston,3 Members Of Disbanded Group of B2K J-Boog,Raz-B,and Lil'Fizz and the rest of the cast and crew did a pretty good on the movie. The dancing in this movie is great and fantasic and I can't wait until You Got Served 2 comes out to theaters probably until early 2007 or 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Got Served Rubbish","review":"The storyline of \\"You Got Served\\" is a little too similiar to \\"Drumline; two groups competing with each other and a contest at the end hosted by some so-called celebrity. At least \\"Drumline\\" was interesting, but \\"You Got Served\\" was corny and boring. The dancing grabbed my attention, but nothing else did. Everyone had dancing skills, but no one had any acting skills. Jennifer Freeman is a total floozy. Anyway, don't rush to watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Be Served...by lawyers","review":"Actually, I think the \\"South Park\\" episode lampooning this movie is ten times better than the movie itself--as crude and obnoxious as that show is.I lost an hour and a half of my life watching this on cable. But the reviewer who said that the DVD extras were hilarious--because everyone interviewed takes this \\"film\\" so seriously--may be on to something: that sounds entertaining in a Spinal Tap way.I kept waiting for the alien monolith from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to appear on the dance floor during the big showdown dance-off sequence.Not THAT would've been interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it, if only to be blown away","review":"The introduction to this movie is jaw dropping, the high energy dance routine that opens is top class, not to mention amazing.The storyline isn't the best, but you get the feeling that the movie ain't really about a storyline its more about showcasing the talented dancers, however Steve Harvey stars as Mr Rad who brings a sense of humor and wittiness (as always) to the film and what little acting there is from other characters it's ok and necessary to be included in order for the movie to be complete.There are also some cameo appearances from Wade Robson & Lil' Kim.If you're a fan of hip hop music, B2K and break-dancing's your thing then you should definitely see this movie, if only for the dance routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"There had better not be a sequel.","review":"Because one star is the minimum, I'll give it that. But I find it quite hard to believe that this movie is rated so high. There is absolutely no plot, there is no proper acting, the whole movie basically, for lack of a better adjective, 'sucks'.The dancing is good. I guess. But how much breakdancing can you take before it starts to get on your nerves? I was so bored during the movie that I even started to play on my cell phone in the theatre.The story line is predictable and boring, the acting is flat, and even the dancing was drawn out and repetitive.Don't watch this movie unless you have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...just awful","review":"\\"You Got Served\\" is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. To give this piece of cinematic s**t even one star is being generous beyond words. It's so bad, it's not even laughable (at least Showgirls was funny).If you're wondering why or how anyone could rate this at anything greater than two stars, just take a look at the grammar in most of those reviews and you'll have the answer.The only benefit of watching this sewage is the appreciation you'll gain of South Park's brilliantly excoriating spoof of it--it's one of their best episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GReat american movie classic","review":"I already knew this movie would stink before I even saw it.

I borrowed a copy of this from work because I saw it listed on IMDB's bottom 100 films. It out ranked such schlocky classics as Manos Hand of Fate, Glitter, and Plan 9 from Outer Space. I knew I had to see this movie.Unlike those other films, this isn't even remotely funny with how bad it was. Every single urban genre cliche is pulled out of the bag and defficated all over in this flick (as if it hasn't already been done enough.) I guess the dancing is good, if you consider acrobatics combined with full body seizures dancing.The saddest thing about this is that it topped the box office in it's opening week. That says alot about today's youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got served junk...suckaz!","review":"I'll keep this review brief. This was easily the worst movie of 2004. The whole thing is about two kids whose dance crew is challenged by some preppy wanna-be-black suburbanites who steal the crew's moves thanks to a treacherous friend named Sonny. Omarion and Marques's character fall out over Omarion dating Marques's sister and things get more problamatic from then on. The acting is atrocious and the dance moves might be cool at first but get pretty mundane after a while. Omarion as well as Marques Houston cant act. Lil Kim looks like recovering heroine junkie and the attractive Jennifer Freeman(My Wife and Kids) is whiter than Jenny McCarthy. You can tell this was a vanity project for the suspiciously effeminate Chris Stokes. And it still bombed! If you're into a movie all about dancing then go right ahead but if you're looking for something more than a dull dance film with heavily edited dance scenes look elsewhere. You just got served suckaz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Listened To Movie Critics","review":"After watching this trailer, with all the cool athletic dance moves, I really wanted to watch this DVD, regardless of the critics mercilessly bashing the movie.

Corny corny corny...Ebonic cliche after ebonic cliche, this movie was so predictable and the plot was very lame. Even Li'l Kim, as fine as she is, wore some badly fitting Summer threads that made her look like a bon bon eating trailer trash chick.I'm pretty easy when rating movies and I enjoy a majority of the ones that I watch, but this one has to definitely go down as one of the worst ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"This doesn't even deserve one star.

Thats the kind of stuff you see happening on a high school campus, not on a movie set.Amazon asked me \\"Under 13?\\", and for a reason.

The problem is ... I don't think it was supposed to be a comedy. The acting, if you can call it that, is laughable at best. The paper-thin story lines are contrived messes that were simply \\"borrowed\\" from better produced, more cinematic urban films. The only shining spot in this abysmal mess is the stellar dancing!! Most people think Wade Robson was the main choreographer for the film. Turns out he only played a minor role with the dance sequences.

Do us a favor and disappear forever. Please don't waste your time watching this movie because I really regret wasting mine. The only reason why this movie makes me happy is because it inspired one of the greatest South Park episodes I've ever seen.

Please do the world a favor and jump of a building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Frankly, I do not know why I decided to watch this. The most abysmal factor about this film is the direction. I would estimate this to be a MTV film and nothing stellar. The acting is garbage and the plot has been done (ex. Bring It On).There is nothing much to say about this film. It has that lackluster 'bring it' vibe that turns me off. I cringed throughout and nearly cried from embarassment. Not to mention the genre itself is outdatted. The film also has a negative implication, stating that kids at the age of 15 are involed in drug deals and will have to put their talent to use in order to get money - a timeless stereotype.One of the worst films you'll see, simply put. Avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put John Travolta in You Got Served Again","review":"I used to always make fun of this movie with my friends but I had never seen it. Then one day I noticed that it was on HBO so I decided to see if it was as bad as i said it was. I almost threw-up, I missed some of the beginning of it but the part that I started at said it all. It was just a dance scene for 20 minutes with people yelling,\\" Oh Snapp!\\" and \\"You Just Got Served.\\" If you like this movie you are possibly the dumbest person on the planet. Oh and about the title, I just saw Civil Action and thought that John Travolta would be a hilarious addition to this movie, if i was the writer all I would put down on the script would be Travolta, whenever I think of him I see gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD CHOREOGRAPHY!

The acting is terrible, the dialogue is ridiculous:'What are you thinking about?''About a lot'.As for the sub-plots, they are terrible, including the too nicely done romance between Omarion and Jennifer Freeman or worse still, Marques Houston gets jumped while running errands for the local, too cliche gangsta, causing unrest between him and his 'boy' Omarion, why doesn't he just get a real job at a fast food place or something? Also, are we supposed to feel sad when the little ten-year-old boy dies? He's in the film for two scenes and Chris Stokes thinks us as an audience is going to care enough about him? Sorry Chris, we're not that stupid.Unless you're into hip-hop dancing or a fan of B2K, then I strongly recommend to STAY AWAY from this film. Ladies and gentlemen - this is filmmaking at its very worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Was Craptastic! (That's a bad thing)","review":"Whoa! No wonder the first ten minutes of the movie was the undergound dance battle - the dancing was the only good thing about this pathetically written and horrifically acted movie! Even the somewhat seasoned actors were crappy! The whole story line was a joke! The two main characters were drug dealers for crying out loud! And then lame 'ole Steve Harvey \\"I knew a few people on the police department and I pulled some strings...\\" Get real! And Omarion, Lil' Fizz whatever he calls himself, smiled so much throughout the whole movie that MY cheeks began to hurt! Fortunately I rented this joke so I'm only out $4.

At the opening night of CLUELESS, it was painfully evident when all the kids around me were literally jumping up and down in their seats at the clever wisecracks on the screen, and me and my friend were looking at each other with puzzled stares wondering what exactly we were missing. Now, a decade later, it has happened again. Only this time the adults seemed to enjoy the movie as much as the kids were. Somehow, amongst the horrendous acting and over-the-top scenarios, an entire theatre of kids and adults alike couldn't be more satisfied. People were even making fun at just how bad some of the lines were delivered, but yet the second the music came back on, all was forgiven. Sadly, I missed the boat. It takes a little bit more than great choreography to keep me entertained these days. However, I'm in the minority.

Poor Raz-B (Chris Stokes's cousin) and Lil Fizz had bad lines throughout the movie. The made Lil Fizz into the cry baby.

That said, a number of tracks on the album sound similar to \\"Rumble,\\" as Wray attempted to repeat its success. Still, there are so many tracks that you get a bunch of cool sounds. (A few have vocals, which are generally poor -- Wray lost a lung in Korea -- but add to the biographical feel of the disk.) I could have done without the cover of \\"Dixie,\\" which the liner notes encourage you to see as a parody, but the rest of it's great.

It's dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic guitar sound","review":"I'm a sucker for unique guitar tunes and Link Wray delivers in spades. The sound from start to finish is so different from anything else that its hard to believe you don't hear it more often today.

The backstory is told in the most pathetic fashion. None of the places that the movie explores are named even though they are some of the most iconic villages in Switzerland. Having been to Grindelwald, Zermatt, Lauterbrunnen, etc. it is a shame that none of the aspects of these places were filmed at all. Instead we are treated to some lame family video on the Glacier Express and then a few minutes of \\"climbing.\\" None of the glaciers with the exception of one were located or named.

Seriously, the sound track pretty much ruined an otherwise, decent documentary. My wife and I couldn't stop making fun of the music long enough to pay attention to the movie. One positive is that it was absolutely visually stunning as should any IMAX equipped documentary in the setting of the Swiss Alps and it was a somewhat interesting story but was it just me or did Harlin's voice overs sounded a bit disjointed? And by disjointed I mean sounds like he's been sniffing paint for 20 years?Here's a bit of advice. Edit the film and release a new version, swap the musical score for something more mountaineering documentary and less cheesy 80's lead guitar, provide Harlin some public speaking lessons and then rerecord his voice overs. Repackage and sell film as \\"The Alps Without the Dream Theater guitar licks\\" and then and only then, you may have a 3 or 4 out of 5 documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tha Alps","review":"I do not recomend this DVD ( Bluray).

There's more that left me shaking my head in disbelief, but it's integral for what passes for a a plot in this ego-driven mess.

Granted, I should have done more research into what was actually contained in the DVDs. I was looking for a recap of every goal, both in the group stage an in the playoffs (or, at least, a bit of every match). Instead, this series, for the most part, shows only highlights of the main games of each world cup. Team celebrations, arrivals at the airport, bus rides, fans partying, locker room talks, and, in some DVDs, even the personal stories of stadium workers are heavily covered in these documentaries. Nothing wrong with that if you are interested in the \\"behind the scenes\\" aspects of what goes on in these torunaments. In that case, you may find these DVDs interesting. If, like me, you want to see the goals and summaries of the matches, you probably do not want to purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unprofessional","review":"Quite disappointing. Of the games (only some games), you see the goals and nothing else: no tricks, no dribbling, no tackles, no passes, no saves--a very superficial idea of what soccer is about. Moreover, a lot of the footage concerns what happened outside the pitch: but nothing interesting is shown or revealed. The narration is embarrassingly boring and banal, and the clips are cobbled together in a very uninventive, unattractive, amateurish way. Not to mention the elevator music that somebody chose as a soundtrack--it has no connection whatsoever with the images and does not express the spirit of soccer. With its resources, and even without them, FIFA should have produced something much much better. In these DVDs there is no creativity, no professionalism, no soul: just the intention of exploiting to the utmost our passion for soccer.
