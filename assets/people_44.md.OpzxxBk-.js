I'd prefer that the knob change only the volume of iTunes and not everything else.The mouse is wonderful. I use it with my left hand and it is very comfortable.

The pieces on disc one are reminiscent of everything from Western Spaces (like \\"Undershadow\\") to Dreamtime Return (like \\"Steel and Bone\\") and extends the tribal-ambient direction he started on Dreamtime with \\"Beat of Desire\\" and \\"Thunderground\\", the latter of which is the best piece on the disc one. Disc Two, \\"To The Threshold of Silence\\", was his most ambitous space music composition at that time, beginning with a Tibetan- inspired gong ceremonial section, continuing with three other linked sections that move through various emotional spaces tied together by a common textural theme. A great introduction to Roach's music, particularly if you're interested in his '90s offerrings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh those Italians","review":"I've heard over the years how awful Italian choirs can be.

I only used it on that one hole. For the rest I used my Rotozip spiral cutter. Saw a video on Utube where a guy just did a plunge cut into the approximate location of the can, moved out till he felt it hit the outside, repositioned it outside the can, and then just felt his way around the can. It left a clean hole in exactly the right place in about 5 seconds. I tried it, and it was much faster, easier and left a tight hole.

It has never been given any credit because of a supposedely bad production but at the time it DID sound different from all the Morrisound releases. Top tracks are the first two, the title track and the last \\"Disciple Of Abhorrence\\" which grinds and grinds and the production actually makes it darker. Unfortunately too many of us metal fans are convinced by reviews and the production on this is one that the so-called experts chose to hate (unlike the first Napalm Death,Carcass , Repulsion or Bathory albums which are equally odd but somehow favourable to reviewers ,nowadays at least). This is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic death metal release!!","review":"Malevolent Creation on their peak, period!!!

Before you complain about the sound quality of the album, you have to take into consideration that in the early 90's recording equipment wasn't as advanced as today. The cd has a mono effect to it which works great with death metal. Plus Malevolent Creation probably wanted the cd to sound the way it does. Either way this is a kick ass cd from Malevolent Creation.

There are many tracks with an exotic sound, due to the sitar which can be vaguely heard,and the ethereal vocals of Djong Yun.\\"Departure\\" is a very beautiful and atmospheric melody which is characterised by the lyrical sound of Robert Eliscu's oboe. In all, this compilation of these two albums \\"Tantric songs\\" and \\"Hosianna Mantra\\" is very relaxing and soothing.

So \\"Christian\\" men are basically just a product of their environment, which is post-industrial society.

Ms. Gracen has done a wonderful service to all of us McCartney fans, by sharing her talents and fortitude to get the right photo, sometimes under very extreme circumstances. The selection of her photos were made to be a book. The accounts of the various fans and venues was very entertaining. Also, the layout and design of the book is very professional, no shortcuts here!

If I had only one wish about the book, it would be more non-concert pictures - although there are many supplied in the book, and they are fantastic. The book, however, does say it is in support of his forthcoming tour, so this is understandable. My only other wish is to acquire the same jacket Paul's wearing on page 46 - been nuts about that jacket for ages! All in all, highest recommendations, and kudos to Ms. Gracen for getting it right - so many others over the past twenty years have attempted similar things, and have fallen far short of this effort.

Although there are a few wonderful pictures, overall I would think anyone with a camera who was able to get close to Paul McCartney could take pictures like the ones featured in this book. To say Ms. Gracen's photos are like the late Linda McCartney is a far out lie! Gracen's photos are nothing like Linda's. If you are a fan of McCartney and like to look at photos of him this isn't a bad book, but if you want to look at quality photos of him, skip this book an buy a book by Linda McCartney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the words/stick with the pictures","review":"This is a beautifully shot, carefully bound, very glossy tour program.

The thin kerf design means that the blade has to remove less wood to make a cut than do traditional blades, and that means your saw doesn't have to work as hard, and can cut much faster. One trick used by a lot of boatbuilders is to use a hand held curricular saw with this blade for cutting curves in plywood: Set the blade for a very shallow cut, just deep enough to cut through the wood. You'll find that you can follow gentle curves and make much smoother cuts than you could with a hand-held scroll saw.Most boatbuilders use the 6\\" version with a traditional saw, but I bought the 4-1/2\\" version for use with my Makita rechargeable saw. The thin kerf and lower drag are a huge help with this little saw, and help extend battery life as well as allowing it to cut through thicker plywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"The Porter Cable blade is designed for small cordless saws and smaller jamb-type saws.

Eliminating cardiovascular exercise from your routine, as advised in this book, will mean your cardiovascular fitness will suffer. The basis of this book is \\"weight training only\\", and although weight training is important for many reasons, it is not enough for overall fitness and generally does not significantly improve your cardiovascular fitness and heart health. There is much scientific evidence to support this claim.Also, this book discounts the fact that exercising everyday energizes you and prepares you for the day. Their advice of 30 minutes maximum of exercise per week will not allow you to benefit from the energy gains of daily exercise. Any avid exerciser will agree with this.A better book would be one that advocates a combination of weight training, cardiovascular exercise in your target heart rate, and flexibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"My energy diminished","review":"I followed the program in this book and found it less than satisfactory. Basically, I cut back my exercise from 5-6 days a week to 2 days a week, as recommended. I found that my energy levels on the days I didn't exercise were low. I like to exercise in the mornings because it gives me an energy boost for the day and I feel great all day. This still occurred on the 2 days that I did exercise, but barely, since my exercise was only 15 minutes (twice per week), as outlined in the book. I felt dragged out on the days I didn't exercise, so I believe there is a shortfall in the exercise guidelines in this book.I have now switched back to exercising daily, and I feel great. I plan on running a marathon soon as well, so I joined a running group which teaches you how to schedule proper run times to be able to do well in the marathon.

Also, since muscles tend to adapt to the same routine there were no alternatives for developing a long term program.This book is a total waste of time and money.

Nothing! In fact, not only did I not lose weight and feel better, but I felt worse! The book got me off the foods I love and that gave me energy, and the exercise routine was less than I was previously doing! The guidelines in this book caused a real drop in my energy and my desire to eat right or exercise. I followed this routine with several of my friends and all of us exerienced the same disappointing results. I can't imagine why anyone would want to do it. I consulted about my results with my doctor and he told me to go back to my old routine regular daily cardio and weights.

I've always lifted weights so this part of the routine was nothing new for me. The book recommends 30 minutes maximum in one week, which I found to be not enough at all for me. I did 15 minutes one day and then 3 days later did another 15 minutes. I hardly felt like I was doing anything, even when pushing myself with the heavy weights as they recommend. Then, after the 30 minutes there was no time left for cardio, even though they don't recommend it.I was really disappointed in this book because I was hoping that 30 minutes would be the quick fix I need.

As a long-time back-pain sufferer, I've truly seen how the approach taught in the Eades' and Mr. Hahn's book can alter a person's physical condition very swiftly and dramatically.

I didn't read the portion on doing these in the gym but I am sure it will produce better results if you follow their suggestions.As far as the diet portion of the book, I didn't pay much attention to it. I have read many books on food, nutrition, vitamins and minerals and what is offered here is minimal but probably not bad for you. so overall this kind of exercise program is certainly appealing to those who are tired of the aerobic approach and certainly takes less time. the book does explain why the aerobic exercise does not produce lasting and satisfying results physically."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rational book","review":"Finally, someone has written a rational book about exercise, w/o any mumbo jumbo on how you can be in great shape w/o doing anything.Most books promise a lot and give a little.This promises a lot and does follow though on it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Fix...again!","review":"This book is typical of quick fix solutions.

I've spoken to many trainers in my gym and they all have heard of this book and think it's garbage. I agree. 30 minutes of exercise a week is just a quick fix. We all know this might help a little for someone who has never exercised and eats poorly. After all, 30 minutes may be better than nothing, but it really just doesn't cut it for people who want overall health and want to lose weight and build muscle for the long term.Like they say, any exercise program that tells you it's this way or no way, or any diet that tells you to cut out foods groups all together, are probably all bogus.

With baseball - and its labor disputes, nascent drug scandals, and rapidly tarnishing image as the American Game - much in the news these days, the fit is a most appropriate one. And he delivers the goods. Minor League ball is currently all the rage, and this book gives you the background and personal stories which fill in a complete picture of a fascinating world most of us know only from the grandstands. His writing flows nicely, his story is compelling, and his team...well, you'll just have to read it and find out what happens to the Aberdeen Arsenal during the course of this singular season. Let's just say that it's good Conan had a job waiting for him back at NPR. Can't wait to hear what his next book is going to be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"Many books have been written about the minor league experience. But this one offers little new or refreshing. Rather, it is the obvious story of a man in the midst of a mid-life crisis.

Also, the bottom feed tray does not snap securely into place and falls out.I would not recommend this product because it is not easy to maintain and is too costly for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love mine but the squirrel resistance isn't as claimed.","review":"Again, I love mine to death but I have to replace mine due to massive squirrel damage to the feeding ports.If you get one, take extra precautions to keep squirrels away. They figure out quickly how to get around the dome baffle and the feeding ports are not protected as claimed. Otherwise you'll come home and find that the plastic pieces in the feeding ports have been clawed out and all of your seed has poured out onto the ground.Note: The copper does not protect the feeder as it claims. It is merely decorative band around the tubes at the feeding port levels, the actual feeding ports are plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feeder from an excellent company!","review":"I have now had this feeder for a month, it was a replacement for the same model (not in copper) that we've had for many, many years. This company makes great products, and their customer service is excellent. This feeder was missing the pole when we got it, and it only took one quick call to Opus to have it shipped here immediately. We also ordered replacement tubes for our old one, not that there was anything wrong with them. It's just that after 10 years, they don't look as pretty as they used to. These feeders last a long time, and the fact that they have three tubes means that you can keep a lot of birds happy with a variety of mixes. Definitely a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a lot of seed","review":"The birds and I are quite pleased with this feeder because it holds more than a week's worth of seed and has several perches to accommodate multiple eaters. Note that the top and bottom are plastic, not copper, but it is an attractive product. Mine is hanging on the front porch so the seeds stay dry, the squirrels can't jump onto it, and I can watch the birds from my kitchen window. The only assembly required is tapping the perches into place and screwing on the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not All Copper","review":"I too was disapointed that the top was not copper like I thought.

The second one was missing a part (one of the perches for the feeding hole) so I used one from the first feeder before returning it.

The Squirrels were the only things eating from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for covered feeding","review":"I, too, was expecting a copper bird feeder. Should have read the reviews a bit better but I skipped right over the one that showed disappointment for the entire construction being plastic. The other thing that bothered me was the loose construction of how the top screwed onto the base. There is nothing to prevent rain water from seeping in the tubes. Which would be fine for covered feeding (like under a porch or an awning) but not good for exposed feeding in a rainy climate. Damp birds need to eat, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"This birdfeeder was advertised as a copper and it is copper colored plastic!

The top frame holding the tubes wss cracked and several pieces broke off and were in the bottom of the box. The box did not show any signs of abuse. Makes you wonder how this feeder will hold up to a squirrel attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT squirrel proof!","review":"One of the advertised features of this feeder is that it does hold a large amount of seed. Unfortunately, if you have squirrels you'll find yourself refilling all three tubes at least every other day. The feeder has plastic coverings for the ports that swivel up and down to allow you to serve either a regular seed mix or nyger seed. The squirrels clawed off the coverings and I had to constantly re-attach them. (You can't fill the tubes without these covers because the seed will just poor out.) Three of the covers are now missing. I put this feeder up the first week in December and it went to the landfill Easter weekend. Now since this is an equal opportunity review I will tell you that the squirrels give the feeder high marks. They like the large dome that keeps them dry in the rain, and they especially like the tray that lets them sit while the dine. If you want a feeder that squirrels won't even look at try the Droll Yankee Whipper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not squirrel proof bird feeder","review":"Pretty and sleek disign.Probably is normal that it took several weeks for birds to get acclaimated to use it.Squirrels have no problem climbing the pole to the seed.

I wanted a 3-tube feeder to hold a large quantity of seed since I have squirrels and pigeons feeeding, much to my dismay.Well, here it is 3 months later and the feeder is gone. It apparently unscrewed itself and crashed to the ground breaking it beyond repair. Even before its demise the feeder ports kept closing to the thistle seed position which halted feeding of the sunflower seed. I had intended to glue them in position when the weather turned warmer; however, that is no longer necessary. In short, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird Feeder for feed the squirrel","review":"I was looking for a bird feeder that my bulimic squirrels do not empty in 2 seconds. I saw a beutifull 3 tubes feeder made of couper. This is mine!! I thought and I ask for it inmediately. First disappointment: no coupper; instead I found \\"plastic\\" poliuretane. I mounted it in a pole; at least I thought, my birds can eat the expensive food I bought for them. Well, the only live creatures in my bird feeder were \\"squirrels\\". The birds are scare of the shape of the bird-feeder. I dont know why. Maybe because it looks like a scarecrow with a hat. I put oil with pepper. My hangry squirrels run away but the scarecrow didnt attract my birds. I dont give up. I have not put seeds in the other bird feeders and I filled the coupper scarecrow with exquisite seeds. I hope that with this strategy, the plastic scarecrow will feed my cardinals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"Well worth the money, quickly shipped, exactly as pictured.

Many people, including me, have been led to believe they were buying a copper feeder when it is made of copper colored plastic.

However it was described as copper and it is not. The picture made it look like it had a copper top and bands,but the top was plastic and so was the base. Not very sturdy.

I've never had to contact Amazon over anything before. They stated this came from a different party. I explained that on the website it stated that it was sold by Amazon (no 2nd party). The company is refunding my money which I'm still waiting for. As for the product, it probably would've been very nice. It is quite large for a bird feeder and the copper looked pretty. Too bad. The UPS driver even said he was ashamed that he had to deliver it. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Got full return on money paid","review":"I was very disappointed in the feeder when it arrived. The box was torn and taped in several places also the feeder itself had several parts broken off. I notified the company and they asked me to return it with a comment as to why.

For sale, Cheap.Amazon usually has quality products."},{"rating":"2","title":"DECENT TRAY SIZE FOR ALL BIRDS","review":"the problem with a lot of triple feeders is that the tray underneath the tubes is too small. This copper triple feeder was a replacement for one that died of old age and I don't even know the manufacturer of that one or I'd get that. We use a pole and there aren't a lot out there with that capability. (this one fits great!) Unfortunately we got an oil tank in our back yard and the squirrels jumped onto our feeder demolishing the tubes completely. I bought another one as a replacement from another manufacturer (relocating the feeder LOL) and didn't notice the tray was smaller. We have cardinals, woodpeckers and jays that eat out of our feeder who can't balance on the smaller tray. I am NOW buying this one and will be happy when we get it as we have happy finches and sparrows but my usual diners are absent. Please be aware of the plastic parts if you have an aggressive squirrel it will be destroyed overnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review","review":"Bird feeder is very attractive and my birds love it. Only problem is that after a little more than a month the bottom tray does not want to stay attached. Is already dropping down on one side and even though I tried to push it back up in place it will not stay. It is mounted on a pole out away from trees, etc. so that only birds can get to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap squirrel feeder","review":"This product is almost a good one. The squirrels have learned that they are able to grab the lower ledge of the feeder as they fall past it from the top. They then proceed to chew the plastic seed doors off which then causes an avalanche of seeds as the entire feeder empties onto the ground. After a week this feeder is no longer usable as it no longer holds seed. A few improvements are needed: 1. Make the top baffle larger. This will prevent the squirrels from being able to grab the ledge as they fall past. 2. Make the seed doors out of metal to keep the squirrels from chewing them off. Make these changes and you could have a good feeder. As is, I would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copper-colored plastic","review":"I was expecting this to be a copper bird feeder - I was hoping to match my copper bird bath.

We have had an older non-copper (looking) model for two years in two homes and ,up until now, it was industrictible. Yes, we had to position it to keep off the squirrels but the feeder kept a lot of birds (and us) happy. Unfortunately, a group of raccoons recently discovered the feeder and my anti-squirrel measures have not worked. The worst part is that the heavy weight of a raccoon landing on the tray has caused it to break, spilling the entire contents of the feeder on the ground. They too were very happy. The bottom tray and the tabs that attach it to the tubes are plastic, like the rest of the feeder, and will break, given enough force. If you don't have any raccoons, this is still one of the best feeders that I have seen. In fact, I will order another one because I've since discovered a better way to keep the critters off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"There us very little copper on this \\"copper bird feeder\\". Don't kid yourself by thinking that the roof is made of copper, it is made of plastic. The only copper portions are the accents near the perches.This is definitely NOT squirrel-proof. The squirrels were able to easily jump up and sit on the bottom of the feeder, and even chewed through the feed holes next to the perches. Once they did that, the feeder is useless as the feed just pours out of the side of the feeder.If I could give it zero stars, I would. This definitely not worth the money. Keep looking for another feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy construction","review":"* I would not recommend this bird feeder.

I wasn't concerned because the feeder is absolutely gorgeous anyway! I had recently purchased other copper feeders & houses & this one fit right in with my decor. It is indestructible but squirrles do get thier share of food from it because the bottom is large enough for them to sit in. I don't mind because I adore squirrels & the birds get plenty of time on it also. I recommend this for anyone who likes the look of copper & if you don't want squirrles to use it be sure & hang it from a place where they can't get to it. The extra large top of this feeder does pose some problems for them but they are persistant & can figure out ways around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I have monster squirrels?","review":"After just four months in our bird feeding station, this feeder has been destroyed by squirrels.

I should have returned it, but needed a new feeder so I didn't. It's been up about a month, and the squirrels have already chewed off three of the plastic parts that shield the openings.

There is no way to assemble it, apart from taking entire feeder apart and using a long-handled socket wrench to affix it to the top. I infer from the directions (which say nothing about having to make this assembly) as well as the photo that the eye-screw should have been pre-attached at the factory. It took me hours to attach -- normally I would just have returned the product, but I happened to have the tools and didn't want to wait. Also, the feeding tubes are fairly small in diameter, so it doesn't hold as much feed as I expected. And, although the copper plates around the mid-section are nice, the rest of the copper-colored parts, as well as the tubes, are cheap plastic, easily cracked. I will keep looking for a replacement for my previous triple tube feeder (which didn't have these defects, and which I thought maybe this would be)."},{"rating":"1","title":"looking 4 a sucker?","review":"With no description, this is a joke right? $$$ looks just like others and half the cost.

Even Alan Vega's unpredictable and manic vocals, which added so much energy and drive to their earlier albums, have gone into boring talk-singing. The best songs are the title tracks and \\"Flashy love\\", the rest is not memorable. \\"Why be blue\\" was released in 1992, but that's simply unbelievable, because the music sounds like being made in the early-'80s. Why did they release such a bland and uninspired album? I suppose they've run out of money.

Cheesy tunes and weak melodies and a production that was too awful to be believed . They say that the album has been improved a little with this new remaster, but I wouldn't recommend it anyway. It's always been Suicide's weakest effort. Maybe their legendary reputation as the fathers of industrial/electronic music made them to rest on their laurels, but the truth is that this album constitutes an indelible stain on their career. If you don't believe me, just listen to it and compare it to the early releases by the band; there's simply no comparison to be made between them.Corny"},{"rating":"1","title":"size is too big for calves","review":"i like how it looked on the internet and fell in love with it when i saw it after delivery. however, it was way too big for my calves. like it was 2 times bigger than it should be. the sizing for my feet is ok, but this is made for people with big calves. i am small but not skinny. the boots even has some elastic fabric panels around it, which i think isn't necessary for it is really way too big. i was really upset because the boots really looked so nice and sexy, (love the shape and heels) but i look like a 5 year old wearing my mom's shoes! i gave it to my mother in law (and she was so happy) because i got it with free shipping and i am losing a lot anyways. won't order again if not sure about the size! shoes not made for smaller built people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Deal ~ Great Boots!","review":"These boots are sooo worth the price.

Avoid at all costs unless your a submarine nut, then proceed with extreme caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"These are supposed to be 20x25x4 inch filters. They actually measure 19.5x24.5x3.5, don't fit where the 20x25x4 fits, leak air around the edges. Totally an unacceptable substitution for the real thing. The vendor should be ashamed of themselves. I tried one filter for 2 weeks and will NOT be purchasing these again. I'll be using the brand name Honeywell filters in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly not MERV 12 filters at so-so quality.","review":"These are decent air filters, but due to the appearance of the media I'm 100% sure that these are not MERV 12 air filters. The media look just like my MERV 8 filters, but really bothers me since they advertise them as MERV 12. To top it off, nowhere in the filter or the box there is a MERV rating. Very suspicious indeed... Also, I have a Honeywell air filter system in my house and these filters are just a tad too small. They do not seal perfectly and the filter was actually on top of one of the feedramps that keeps the filter in place. I did not measure the sides, but this filter is definitely not within the specification parameters. If I can get these at about 1/2 price of similar MERV 8 filters I might buy them again. If they are just a couple of dollars less than a more reputable filter I would definitely stay away from them and I recommend you do, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filters","review":"As a previous review stated the filters are a little on the small side but they work just fine. It's better to have them smaller so they fit in than larger so it's difficult to install."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all 25 x 20 x 4 are the same","review":"these are actually 3 1/4 inch or so, and did not fit my trane a/c. They are even a bit small around the outsides as well as too thin. tried to modify them a bit with cardboard and duct tape to no avail. Dropped them by goodwill and hope someone can find a fit for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Check sizes","review":"Received the filters in a timely manner, everything was packed well, etc. The filters look no different from the 3M that I was replacing, and by all accounts are good build quality. Taking them out of the box, I noticed they looked a little thinner than what I was used to. Make sure when ordering to double check the \\"Actual Size\\" of these filters. According to the product description they are \\"Actual Size 19.5 x 24.5 x 3.75\\" rather than the true 20x25x4. Other than that, like I said, they appear to be equal in quality to all the other filters I've used before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth for the $","review":"This is the worse product I purchased in Amazon. Not worth for the money. The actual size is much smaller. It is not 20 X 25 X 4 and I don't consider this is a Merv 12 level air filter. I bought 6 to save the cost since I have 4 furnaces in my house within the main building and my cabana. The cardboard material is not as strong material as you can find in retail store. Poor quality stuff. Very disappointed on this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"20x25x4 not accurate","review":"I read the details stating the filters were not fully 20x25x4 but I casually thought that just must be an industry thing. Shame on me for thinking that. I will end up fabricating a spacer or block to make these work in my unit.Look closely and measure your existing filter. Mine measures fully 20x25x4. Can't recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Product","review":"These filters are very good. They last approximately 6 months before a change is needed. I'm very satisfied with the quality of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"I purchased this and the 16 x 25 x 4 item, as I have two furnaces. These are a tad smaller than the Honeywell versions that sell for $40 to $60 and fit my electronic air cleaner slots well. Both of the $600 electronic air cleaners I had died in less than 4 years and these do the job just as well, I opted not to fix or replace the electronic filters but to use these filters instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's gonna review this album or what?","review":"I see nobody paying attention what I'm sayin. I asking everbody for that new reviewers or one-star reviewers alike should stay focused of buying or rating this album as a superior 2 date. I see everybody saying this is what I wanna listen to or this is what I wanted right here. Anyway, I actually read about this guy on a gospel/Christian magazine one time and seems 2 be the one I need to add on my trumpet list. He sure plays gospel pretty well and recommend u check him out like u do with the other trumpet players of today...Rick Braun, Chris Botti, Miles Davis, Chuck Mangione, Al Hirt, Maynard Ferguson, Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard, Clifford Brown, Art Farmer, Herb Alpert, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE IN ROACH'S CAREER","review":"When Roach put out this album, he was well-received, and thus his career began. I agree with the other reviewer that this would be a very good album to start with if you are not familiar with Roach or the genre. I have been a Roach fan since I heard his collaborative album with Jorge Reyes and Suso Saiz called Suspended Memories, and I think this album is probably one of my favorites. It is definitely a work of art. As with all Roach art, it is best understood when listened to with hi-fi headphones, lying down and closing your eyes. The music usually conjures up images in my mind and I am taken to a place beyond my imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roach's finest hour","review":"The soundscapes Steve Roach creates on Dreamtime Return are out of this world. They'll grab you instantly and by the time this double-disc set comes to an end you'll be amazed and stunned by it. This is Roach in his finest hour and it's definitely the finest hour of ambient music. This is a must have for every ambient music fan...."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Age meets Ancient Age","review":"This is an amazing collection of pensive and calm pieces for synthesizer and various instruments (but it's not without a sense of unease or uncertainty, as per Eno's spot-on criticism of most \\"New Age\\" music). Roach's guiding musical principle seems to be the rhythms of the human body, in particular the act of breathing. Highlights are the ominous 30-minute landscape \\"Looking for Safety\\" and \\"The Other Side,\\" which contains a stupendous violin solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acquired taste...","review":"I can see why people call this album a masterpiece. The music is not melodic, so it will require a taste for this sort of stuff. It doesn't resemble the usual \\"electronic\\" genre (Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis) because of the overall lack of melody... nor does it resemble something like improvisational Shakuhachi flute or piano, which also could be called \\"unmelodic\\" but in a different sense (lacking a predefined musical structure).I voted it a \\"4\\" because I really haven't acquired much of a taste for this sort of music. You may be tempted to vote me a \\"not helpful\\" because some 'personal preference' went into this review, and I didn't just rave about it like everyone else... but before you do, plz ask yourself, was it helpful at all in making a purchasing decision?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still stands the test of time","review":"Roach's style has changed a lot. A lot of new ambient artists have come along since this release, such as Stars of the Lid, Deepspace [...]and Vidna Obmana, and yet this stands near the top of the field. His style is more complex and layered now, but elements of this recording are still evident in some of his newer stuff, like mantram, and new life dreaming.Roach became a bit obsessed with the Australian Outback at one stage in his career, and you can hear that he nailed the feeling of the place quite well. Having lived in Australia most of my life, I can hear what he was trying to do-the sense of starkness, and impenetrability in the deserts here is very tangible. Very impressive Mr. Roach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful!","review":"Simply one of the best space/newage/ambient works ever pressed, Steve Roach's expanded score lends itself to the ultimate relaxation or chill-party CD. It's an arresting work - the man works miracles with electronics and sheets of sounds. Along with the same decade's \\"Chronos\\" by Michael Stearns, and Don Slepian's psycoactive, hypnotic, let's-get-back-to-Nirvana masterpiece, \\"Sea of Bliss,\\" Roach's two CD epic will take you places few musics can. THIS IS GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to get bored...","review":"Maybe I'm ignorant about electronic music, but I've heard a lot of symphonic rock and new age, and I can hardly denominate \\"music\\" to this CD. Poor recording quality adds to what is a mistake in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Video.","review":"The best video ever. Something that everyone should buy for those whom like Tenchi sagas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justy plain comedic","review":"This volume has a mixture of emotion and the usual comedic flare. There is a ghost in one episode that Sasamie becomes friends with and learns a few new things. While in the other episodes you have some of the usual crazy adventures like a food shortage and requiring Ryoko to get more supplies with their money (heh heh). Then an episode where the Yagami is stolen by a couple of punks who end up face to face with the Juria military fleet. Its good but it doesn't really add much to the storyline but kinda gives a break from it temporarily. Kinda of like the Time & Space series, a quick offshoot. I think if if you liked the earlier volumes of Tenchi Universe then you'll like this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This is a high quality cordless impact wrench made by Hitachi. I bought it when Amazon had it on sale for $123.00. It was a heck of a value. I also bought a Hitachi 1/2 inch drive to 1/4 hex adapter, so I can use it as a impact driver as well. I do most of the maintenance and repair on both of my cars. This impact wrench comes in handy. It balance pretty well in the hand and it's not too heavy. It has almost 120 lb-feet of torque so it is good enough for most of the lighter duty stuff.Update: I ended up returning this and got the Bosch 14.4V cordless impact wrench instead. I went for the 14.4V version mainly for the additional 30lb-ft of torque. I ended up with the Bosch 14.4V because of the lower price available at Amazon. I am equally happy with the built quality of either Hitachi and Bosch cordless impact wrench."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really GOOD!!","review":"This a somewhat mysterious album by Gary.It was released originally only in Japan and, altough the release date is often mentioned as being 1984, I think that 1984 was the year when it was released in England, because I think it was recorded before talbuns like CORRIDORS OF POWER (1982) and VICTIMS OF THE FUTURE (1983).AS for the album, it has Gary playin his fiercest solos ever, great skill, great technic, great feeling, THe guy is a monster guitarrist, underappreciated in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I loved reading this book and had a hard time putting it down. It gives you a look into the lives of the extremely wealthy in Manhattan and I found it very interesting. It isn't extremely well written, but it is fun and a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"nannie diaries","review":"This book was an excellent book! Good for everyone from the \\"nannies\\" to the \\"employers\\". It's hard to put down once you start it. LOVE THE ENDING! You go \\"Nanny\\"!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never read a book like this!","review":"You can definitely tell that Nan has first hand knowledge of how some of these high society, unattached parents live. It's an eye opener that I was not expecting in a very good way. It was quite sad though to wonder, \\"What will become of Grayer?\\" The story is so capturing that you start rooting for Grayer and hope that Nan will be able to convince his cold mother that she should adopt him and take him home! I have a child and my heart really went out to this character. I know this is a story but it obviously was written from first hand knowledge and it just makes you wonder...how many other Grayers are there out there? Must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I loved this book! I found myself carrying it with me everywhere I went so I could read what happened next while I pumped gas, waited at a stop light, etc. It was an excellent get away from everyday life- excellent character development, interesting story line. The character of H.H. could have been developed more, but I believe that kind of helped with getting the feel that Nan didnt really have time to develop much of her own personal life. The ending was a little disappointing. But overall, I would definitely recommend this book to all of my girlfriends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly depressing story if you have kids","review":"Picked it up thinking it was supposed to be a comedy based on seeing reviews for it on TV (can't even imagine a movie option as was being discussed). It was well written. Enough about that. It obviously evoked a reaction in me. As a mother of two, I sobbed at the thought of such unloving, manipulative parents. I know the characters are fictious, but paint a horrible picture of what the \\"good life\\" is. Makes you happy for what you have if you know how to take care of it. I really would not care for a sequel or movie version. It would be awful to remake a \\"Mommy Dearest\\" from the nanny's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want an excuse to hate the ultra-rich?","review":"I have been there. Right out of college, I supplemented my income by babysitting for families like The \\"Ex\\"'s (usually whenever their actual nanny had a conflict). I found myself laughing frequently out of recognition as I read through this book, but at the core is the very upsetting fact that there's a 4-year old who is given anything he wants except for his parents' love and attention. Though one reviewer expressed a certain level of frustration over the fact that Nan didn't stick up for herself, I understand and know why she didn't...nothing can penetrate the self-involved lives of those who think they're far more important than anyone else around them. It's a light read, but you'll find yourself haunted by the lack of stability and genuine love surrounding Grayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I had trouble putting this book down -- it had a \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" feel to it, sucking me into the decadent and ultimately empty lives of the ultra-rich in Manhattan. I kept turning the pages to see what other indignities Mrs. X would heap on Nanny (and on her poor son). In this way, the book was a little like a literary (and literate) version of the Jerry Springer Show -- you can't believe that such awful and crass people actually exist, so you stay tuned.I thought the book was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed the light social commentary it offered on the lifestyles of the rich (and on modern child-rearing). The only thing I didn't like was the ending, which just seemed to peter out and leave a few threads hanging...rather disappointing since the rest of the book was so cleverly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling take on Upper East Side Life","review":"I found this book to be a interesting look on the life and styles of some of New Yorks Rich. Although at times a little slow, it kept my interest the whole ways through showing that no matter how much money you have, in some things you are still incredibly poor, event though you pretend you're happy. The contrast between Nanny's family life and that of her employers was huge, even though they have \\"everything\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably True","review":"A non-stop reading. Living in NYC and seeing these rich women without their children, knowing they have children, you can't help but believe what you're reading-which makes it very interesting. Definitely recommend it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Depressing","review":"Although I found myself chuckling at a few situations that Nan was in or phrases she used, I was for the most part saddened at what I read. If this book represents a semi-factual basis of what a nanny and the child he/she cares for has to endure, then it is truly depressing. I was practically in tears seeing how Grayer was so badly neglected and ignored. Maybe a few years ago, I would have found this book more amusing, but after having a child of my own, it's not so funny. I can't imagine hiring someone to look after my child hours and hours on end without me so much as giving a hug. While I appreciate the authors' enlightening the audience on how some of the other half lives, I don't understand how this book has been labeled as \\"light\\" and \\"funny\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Pool-side reading only.","review":"This story doesn't require a lot of thought. It just ambles along and leads to a predictable end. The book was loaned to me and I am glad I didnt purchase it - it was a quick and dirty beach read but was not suitable for holing up in the winter for some serious reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring . . . Boring . . . Boring!!!","review":"The book was read by my book club. One person liked it, but the rest of us found it boring. Perhaps, former nannies will like the book, but I found it a waste of my time. But, I sure loved Seabiscuit, our next book club read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, please","review":"I had to force myself to finish reading this book! I never felt anything for any of the characters--even the kid. Poor character development, unbelievable coincidences. Okay, so maybe the rich are different. Is that news? It certainly isn't a novel idea! They dress better, eat better and live better than the rest of us--but does it make them interesting? Apparently not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarcastic frustrated employer bashing","review":"This book was touted as being \\"funny\\" and \\"hilarious\\". I found it to be neither. The nanny seemed nothing more than a frustrated employee who took delight in ripping her employer to shreds with a sharp tongue and sarcasm. When a person becomes a \\"household\\" or \\"domestic\\" employee, the private life of the employer is revealed. Every family has ghosts and troubles of some sort or another. The authors of this book are merely exploiting the personal matters of a \\"richer\\" family for financial gain. A disappointment to read. I threw it away after the dog chewed up the corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful from start to finish","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this highly entertaining, hard to put down novel.This book is about a college student named Nan who is majoring in Child Development at NYU and takes a job as a nanny to a 4 yr Grayer Addison X. Her employer (Grayer's Mom)is a self-absorbed, inconsiderate woman. The father is even worse, and practially non-existent as a father & husband.The book itself is aimed at being very funny yet has a very sad overall tone.I enjoyed this one very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending Needs Work","review":"The book is really droll, and I enjoyed it, but the ending is unsatisfying. It's very abrupt, and the reader never finds out what ultimately happens in the subplot...Nanny and her sort-of boyfriend, H.H."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, fast read","review":"This is a great beach read. Not too taxing on the brain, the pages seem to fly by as you go through it. I actually used to work with someone like Mrs. X in the novel (we were never quite sure why she had kids, as she couldn't seem to get away from them fast enough) so I found those scenes the funniest. Yes, Nanny's name is annoying as \\"Nanny\\", but you get over it fast. The most implausable part of the book is Nanny's falling for the rich neighbor upstairs and his returning her feelings. I just can't buy that at all! Take this book for what it is - a fun, fluffy book. Tolstoy it isn't but that's not what the book is aiming for, now is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"This is one of those fun books that you can breeze through in an afternoon or two. But, it is not pure fluff- this one has real substance.I found myself thinking about it long after. The authors know Park Avenue and effectively satirize it right down to the tropm L'oeil doors. The descriptions of these apartments/parties are worht the price of the book. I understand whyt the protagonist is simply called \\"Nan\\", but it made her too impersonal.Seeing her relationships with the little boy she watches as well as his parents grown and change made for a book that I did not want to put down. My (minor) complaint was the ending felt rushed and could have been better.This was fun to read and I hope for more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read, not great!","review":"Surviving my own experience as a nanny, I was anxious to read \\"The Nanny Diaries\\". While I found some great truthes in the relationship between Nanny and Mr. and Mrs. X, (being smushed in a car with screaming kids while seemingly being ignored by the \\"adults\\" in the car was priceless) I felt the characters onesided and harsh. Though we see cracks in the crust of Mrs. X, I never really cared about her or Nanny. I did cry over the lack of a daddy for the little boy. I spent many days and nights nursing hurts, loving as though they were my own, and Nanny showed the deep cracks and differences between caring for and owning a child as the X's did. Its a good traveling book, because thinking is an option. Its truth and humor and I'll admit some tears. Childcare workers will see themselves in it, but outsiders might wonder what evil parents exist in big cities and why no one does anything to stop them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, yet very sad","review":"I started out thinking this book was very amusing. However, as the plot thickens, I felt very sickened by Mrs. X's self-centered behavior. What surprised me though were my feelings toward Nanny. I felt on the one hand that she was very loving to the child, but on the other hand I became increasingly frustrated by her doormat behavior. I felt she was a co-dependant in the relationship and I had a hard time reading page after page of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tres Magnifique! A Must Read!","review":"First of all, I highly recommend this book to all nannies and former nannies on the East Coast. This book was hilarious and it's amazing how much of it I could relate to. A reader from CA reviewed this book and stated that it was \\"unsympathetic\\" to employers of nannies in NYC -- which is untrue. As a former tri-state area live-in nanny, alot of this book was right on the money. I know alot of nannies who have so many different stories, but a lot of the basic facts are the same. These parents are so self-involved and so quick to hire someone else to raise their children that they fail to see what is really important - their children! Just like the mother in this book - Mrs. X, who does not work, yet has a nanny that she depends on over 50 hours/week. So, if you are a nanny, former nanny, or even a working parent with a nanny, or just anyone looking for a quick page turner, this book is a must read for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"300 pages of tremendously predictable story. I read half the book expecting more, unfortunately the author did not deliver. Again, too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"This book is a must for those who farm out their children to nannies and day care workers. It is also a must for real moms who raise their children. Those who have nannies raising their children may just finally realize that it takes more than \\"stuff\\" to be a mother and those at home with their children will rest assure that they are doing the right thing. The book would have been much better if the characters were given believable names and if it was maybe in a journal format that exposed the feelings of the nanny more clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution","review":"The nanny-authors attempt a contemporary version of the life of the governess, set in the upscale high-rise apartments of New York's Upper East Side. (Excerpts from nannies of past literature -- Mary Poppins, Jane Eyre, Gone with the Wind, etc. -- are the best feature of the book.) But they fall short in the opportunity for a modern classic, due to terrible writing and confusing tones of satire, disdain, and sentimentality.I can't decide whether to categorize it as (bad)\\"comedy\\" as some reviewers have called it, or (bad) social commentary. In any case it's satire that loses control by being at times, too ridiculous (the scenes in Nantucket), or too sappy (the sorrows of the other house servants).I'd like to read a book that tells the same story with a sharp, witty, satirical edge OR one that exposes the heart-breaking sadness of kids with self-centered absent parents. The authors tried to achieve both in one book and failed twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like one of those Frothe commercials","review":"This book is littered with cliche and expected situational comedy. It is almost like a screen play - the character banter is so predictable, you can skip several pages at a time and still be stuck in the same scenario. I feel sorry for everyone involved in this book, but mostly for the Nanny. She went to a glorified baby sitting job the night of her college graduation! Hopefully Nanny Diaries II will come out, Nanny will get gusty and finally tell the Xes to kiss her well-educated rear end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point of this book??","review":"After hearing all the buzz on this book I was quite excited to read it.. and once I finished I was wondering why? What was the point of this book! To show how a twenty-something year old woman can be pushed around by a snobby rich woman! I think Nanny is a weak character and I couldn't believe she or anyone would put up with the X family . I kept reading thinking something good would come out of the book, however when the X's made a fuss about her graduation and leaving for vacation etc.. the writers had gone too far! The writers made it seem that Nanny was staying for Grayer, but yet the end could not have been more tragic for him.. leaving in the middle of the night with Grayer screaming for her??? and Nanny takes the puppy?? WHAT? I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand what all the fuss is about","review":"Nanny Diaries is pretty stinky. It was sad and horrifying to see how these supposed \\"parents\\" (merely the sperm and egg donors; they don't actually parent at all) act with their kids. In a way you can't help but read on, like rubbernecking to catch a glimpse of a horrible car accident, but you really shouldn't bother.... There is really not much story-wise to this novel. Like another reviewer said, there isn't any character development. It just ends. There was way too much profanity for me (the f-word has no purpose or meaning other than being a horribly crass and ineffectual way of expressing oneself).It's a waste of a read; I wish I had just quit reading. If you feel you must partake, check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"I could see how this book could be appealing to some, especially former or current Nannies. It's a fast read, parts of it are funny (I suppose), and parts of it were sad. Great beach blanket book for some! However, I found that personally, I didn't relate to Nanny, Grayer, Mr or Mrs X, or any of the characters in the book. I did not find that the book was \\"a page-turner\\" or particularly well written. And, finally, I didn't feel like I acheived anything when I completed the book. With most other books that I've read, I've felt a sense of completion that was lacking here. However, to be fair, I purchased the book thinking that it would be funny and sad, but mostly funny. Unlike the New York Times quote on the cover, I did not find this book to be \\"Diabolically Funny.\\" In fact, no part of this book made me laugh out loud or even smile. Serious or funny, The Nanny Diaries is my least favorite book that I've read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and overrated","review":"Another book marketed as funny that is just plain disturbing. If you like reading about little children being neglected by self-absorbed parents and rich employers abusing their financially-desperate employees, you'll think this book is a real hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"get it from the library, if at all","review":"This is not a book to spend your money on. Though I thought it was an entertaining and quick read, but it was disappointing. The device of using anonymous \\"names\\" for the main characters annoyed me, as did Nanny who always seemed eager to be the brunt of mistreatment. There were several times I thought, \\"Really, this would be such an easy situation to remedy! Why doesn't she just . . . ?\\" But, Nanny always pulled through with a stupid decision that pulled her more directly into her unsavory situation. Really, her decisions were so bad and seemingly unrealistic, I could not root for her. But, if you need something that's not too challenging and a bit entertaining, check this our from the library. I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I was looking forward to this book as it was put in the same genre and Confessions of a Shopaholic and Bridget Jones. I enjoyed the book up until the end. Its almost like the author ran out of time to finish the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanny, defend yourself!","review":"Nanny Diaries...a collection? Not! It's just one long story about a strong-willed NYU Child Development Major who works part-time as a nanny ... just happens her name is Nan. The paradox is that she cowers to her despicable employers who treat her like dirt. By the middle of the book, you're so sick of the situations, that you want Nan to tell Mrs. X to shove it and move on. That's the only reason for finishing the book...if you want to save time, just go from the middle to the last few pages. Oh, the authors felt the need to make Nan a smoker - this doesn't fit Nan's overall character at all - just Hollywood's uncreative symbol for frustration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nanny Diaries","review":"The authors did an extraordinary job of balancing a real life occurance into a story written with humor and delicate sensitivity. I literally could not put it down. I was captivated by the style of writing and how it intertwined truth and such compasion in the main character of \\"Nanny.\\" She was so real and it was clearly understood what her true self was devoted to and why she put up with such outragous abuse while doing her job. She was truly a heroin and I applaude her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped Nonsense","review":"I'm sure that there is a good idea buried in this book, I just feel that it wasn't excuted well. A Nanny named Nanny and employers named Mr. and Mrs. X-like this was some attempt to protect real people. My problem is that in the 2 YEARS that it's taken me to read this book, is that the humor (if one wants to call it that) is at first in the begining too over the top and then the rest of the book severely lacking. Maybe this was to be a modern version of Agnes Grey-another book that sets out to complain about the previlege of the rich while the help CHOOSES to be of their employ. It's a book without a cohensive plot but has milked a lot of mileage off it's commerical title. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I wouldn't say that this book is a waste of paper, but it is far from great literature. This book is basically about self-absorbed half-wits who are incapable of loving others. None of the characters in this book is really like-able, including the main character, the oh-so-cleverly named \\"Nanny.\\" That being said, it is a good book for beach reading, though you are more likely to throw it in the ocean when you are done rather than on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying book","review":"This book was very annoying. The main character was a weak and passive person who didn't seem to have a mind of her own. I don't think the personality of the main character was thought out well and written well. The plot just dragged on and the ending was very disappointing. There was no wit to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like the Ninny diaries","review":"This book was touted as a tell-all insider's take on the 'other half.' The central character, Nan, becomes unnaturally obsessed with someone else's four year old child, whose mundane activities are chronicled in painful detail. This obsession then extends to the philandering of her employer's husband. Nan also harbours growing resentment for her employers' position in life yet allows them to treat her like a doormat, which fuels her resentment. She was a pitiful character that really made this book a sad study of her pathetic life."},{"rating":"1","title":"More could have been done with such ripe material","review":"The best thing about this book is its subject matter. Unfortunately, the writing is so amateurish it made me wince at times. Also, contrary to what some of the reviews say, the authors do not always \\"get the details right.\\" Furthermore, they should have worked harder at making the narrator a little more three-dimensional, a little less high-minded and admirable (likewise her oh-so-lovable yet totally faceless parents and grandmother). I found excruciating the sections in which the narrator encounters nannies from less privileged backgrounds and lets us know that -- wait! you'll never guess! -- they are people, too. This revelation seems very self-congratulatory on the part of the authors. It may be news for some, but not for the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only no stars were possible...","review":"What a piece of crud. Not one likeable character, and not one truly amusing or moving episode. I rarely stop reading a book part way through, but after 2/3rds of the text, it was the book or I. I made the right choice. Hope you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I enjoyed the book but found the BEVERLY HILLS TUTOR to be much for enjoyable. The BEVERLY HILLS TUTOR added a better sense of surpise and mystery the nanny diaries simply lacked. I recommend the BEVERLY HILLS TUTOR over this one anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I thought is was","review":"I bought this book for my wife who is currently getting her teaching credential in California. She had just finished up a class called, \\"Psychological Applications in Education.\\" I thought this book would help, but I was WRONG.She was coming home each night and explaining to me what she was learning about generational poverty and generational wealth. It really opened our eyes to the different social-economic classes. This class is especially helpful to her as she will need to be able to understand and teach to all students.When I saw this book, I thought this material would be great for her to read so she could learn from it. I hoped it would give her an actual insight to the wealthy class...I did not see anywhere that it said this is fiction...I fell into the trap of the writier and the publisher and the way in which they marketed this book.It turns out my wife enjoys the novel, but I am very disappointed that I did not get what I led to believe I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable Pap","review":"It is disheartening that such a shallow, smug, self-congratulatory, artificial, hackneyed, tricked-up, hyped piece of junk has such a large, enthusiastic audience. I think that speaks volumes about the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"I bought this book on a lark. Thought it would be fun, humorous and take my mind off some things. Instead, I wondered into a mock world where no one cares about anyone but themselves. The nanny is as unpleasant and nasty as the subjects she humiliates. No winners in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanny the Victim","review":"I set out really wanting to like this book. I might have enjoyed it if the main character \\"Nanny\\" didn't play the victim in almost every situation. Nanny really needs to get a backbone. I thought she would finally get one by the end. Didn't happen. Maybe she will in the movie version. I don't understand why she (or anyone, for that matter) would put up with being spoken to in such a demeaning way. Maybe if she had told the X's off and then called Child Protective Services to report their neglect of their son, I would have a more favorable review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a Break!","review":"I'm bafffled by some of these reviews. I don't agree that the authors are taking the subject matter lightly at all. Through their detail and the episodes throughout the book, I felt the disgust of the authors for the Xs and I tip my hat to them for calling attention to a type of parenting that does exist (just spend some time in the Upper East or West Sides of Manhattan). Just because you can't relate to it doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. These girls know first hand. They've been in the trenches. And, it seemed to me, hoped that their readers would come out of this just as broken hearted for little Grayer. Since when is a book that evokes such emotion a bad thing??"},{"rating":"1","title":"very overrated","review":"I couldn't believe how badly written this book is. It's heavyhanded. The co-authors lack the subtlety and finesse of real writers. The characters are one-dimensional. The \\"touching\\" moments are underlined, highlighted, and all but pointed out to the reader lest we should miss them. Maybe the movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving advertising","review":"This book was very disappointing to me. It is advertised as humerous, but I did not find anything funny about it and I can't imagine who would. It is a sad, frustrating story that leaves you very unsettled. The authors make you fall in love with the little boy in the book and does not provide any resolution for his horrible situation. You also get so frustrated with Nanny and what she puts up with. The ending was very abrupt and unsatisfying. Not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, boring, and just tells you more about the women who need to get a backbone.","review":"The lives of these characters are boring, and the characters are absolutely devoid of any life. This might be more indicative of the idiots the story is based on: manhattan moms....if they can be called that. The Nan character is difficult to like as a person since she is absolutely incapable of saying no. The reason for her to take the insult from Mrs X is inexplicable. She seems to come from some wealth if her family is nearby. IT is not believable that she just LOVES the little boy. The book is simply filled with trivial pursuits, shallow characters and is thoroughly annoying. Would NOT recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Would I Do?","review":"I am not a person in a position to hire a nanny for my children. I got this book thinking that it would be a good laugh... and at first it is. Many of the things that Nanny went through at the beginning of her job were dead on to things I've experienced just as a periodic babysitter.I passed this book on to a friend who had worked in Daycares for 20 years and eventually had a nervous breakdown from the demands the job was placing on her emotions. This book is a cathartic experience for anyone who has ever felt that heartbreak. I left it feeling much more sane."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the mouth of one nanny....","review":"I was reading this book one day at work, and one of my co-workers (who is also a nanny) said that everything in that book was true.My thoughts? Of course some of the stuff is wildly exaggerated, but that's the beauty of it. We love to hate and mock the rich because of what they represent: what we want and what they have. Let them sit in their chaise lounge chairs and sip martinis by sunrise while we tend to their young, overindulged, often disrespectful, charges. We sneer and thumb our noses at them in silence, as the two former nannies and writers of this book have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Laughter and tears...","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! I work for very wealthy attorneys who all have stay at home wives who also have nannies. I on the other hand have two beautiful girls and work full time but can't wait to go home and watch my girls get food on their face, show me fingerpaintings, and chase each other down the hallway. I thought the book was so funny for the most part but I got sad throughout most of the book when realizing what was happening to Grayer. I literally cried in the end. Now I know this is a fiction but I can just imagine this really happening to all of my boss's kids. Getting \\"spatula'd\\" when they get home so not to dirty their suits and minks. I didn't expect a fairy tale ending and I am glad it wasn't. Great book filled with comedy, drama, and sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"From One Nanny to Another","review":"I had walked past this book at least 100 times at Borders, before deciding that I would give in and induldge myself in a read. I have been a nanny for two years now and wasn't sure at the time of purchase if this book could actually tell me something I didn't already know. Working for a wealthy family-one a lot more personable than the X's, I found that I could actually relate to the authors' realistic portrayl of the whole interviewing process and the awkward intro's. I couldn't part with this book because I couldn't wait for the day that Nan would give the X's a piece of her mind. Even though the beggining hooked me in, I closed the book for the last time a bit dissapointed that Nan, other than the videotape, never gave the X's what they deserved- THEIR walking papers. The Nanny didn't end up being my glamourized heroine after all. I guess it is a realistic book(I have yet to face off with my own boss), but I was just hoping to live vicariously through Nanny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, unsatisfying","review":"I cannot understand how this book became a bestseller. Basically the entire novel is an account of irritating college student 'Nanny' crying for herself as she permits herself to be shat upon by the world. Her job sucks, her boss sucks, rich people suck, college guys suck, her roommate sucks, her roommate's boyfriend sucks, club employees suck, computer lab employees suck, real estate agents suck, job interviews suck, being poor sucks, everything sucks and Nanny exults in whining, bitching and complaining about it while never actually doing anything to improve her situation.The conclusion of this book is unsatisfying, the authors are not talented writers and I cannot recommend this book for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, boring book.","review":"As a teacher and former child care provider I too know the waycertain paretns can treat their child's caregiver, and their childfor that matter. The concept is great, but the story lacks imagination and is not very absorbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"it sounded fun, and there was a lot of hype... I think I did laugh once but my only motivation to continue reading it was hoping that it all became worthwile somewhere. It never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I had to slip into the bathroom in our hotel room to continue reading this book!! My husband was asleep...I just had to read one more chapter. This book is hilarious and so true to life! Read it and pass it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Kid Lovers","review":"The Nanny Diaries is a quick and easy read. It offers insight into the goings on of the rich New York Park Ave set. If you have ever walked by a brownstone or high rise in New York and wondered what kind of person lived there, this may be interesting to you.The issue I had with the book is that I personally could never imagine persuing or having a job as a nanny. I like kids, but at a distance, so I was constantly thinking--QUIT this job! I certainly would not put up with everything that Nanny (the main character) did in order to keep such a grueling job. I also did not find Grayer (the child in the novel) a very endearing character. I did not see the bond that was keeping Nanny there as his nanny. I felt sorry for the often neglected boy, but I can't imagine staying in that situation for so long for someone else's kid.In short, if you are in the child care field, you will love this. If you are not so baby/kid crazy, this is not your sort of read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my time and $","review":"When I hit page 100, I started to skim the rest of this book. Usually by page 100, scenarios have been set up to pay off with something really outrageous or interesting. But all this one does is PLOD along page after page of what Mrs X does to her (if-I-don't-go-along-with-the-group-and-have-a-kid-even-though-I-don't-really-want-one-but-I'll-be-regarded-weird-if-I-don't ) child/pet. Yes, it is pathetic, all these women in the kid's life (no men, I wonder what affect that will have on him later) micro-managing everything he wears/eats/touches, yet psychologically ignoring him except the nanny, who is not allowed to really discipline him and has to watch Grayer become a spoiled rich brat.To be honest,I can't remember what I've read, truly, and probably won't remember the rest of the book IF I can finish it.I should have listened to all of you who panned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The back cover said something about REVENGE???","review":"Although the back cover hints at it...There is no revenge in this book.Nanny is so spineless it's frustrating. I practically had an ulcer while reading it. I kept waiting for release-Nanny's eventual come-uppance against the horrible Mrs. X. But it never happened. It left me highly unsatisfied.And Nanny is constantly complaining about her job to anyone who will listen, her friends family, boyfriend. But she never quits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother","review":"I kept asking myself why I was bothering to read this book. I guess the answer was that I was on a boat. Why anyone would feel it was ok to put up with the abuse that was ladled out to Nanny is a mystery. Aside from Greyer you feel sorry for no one. I did finish it because I always finish books I have gotten half way through and because I didn't have anything else to read. The blurbs on the cover stating that it is absolutely side splitting was stupid. Any reviewer who stated that should be fired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutley moving","review":"This book was absolutley awesome. I managed to read one hundered pages of it in about an hour and a half, I simply could not put it down. The \\"Nanny Diaries\\" really exploits wealthy families and shows what most people believe is happening, actually is. I hope that someone can help me find a book as fabulous as this one. I hope that we see a sequel soon because I am absolutley on the edge of my chair, not knowing what happens with H.H. and Grover. Anyone would love this book, I recommend it to ALL readers of teens and up. It has almost knocked Catcher and the Rye off my top favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating...","review":"I picked up this book because the description looked interesting. Within the first chapter, I couldn't put the book down. The requests of Mrs. X did seem a little outrageous, but believable of a society woman (I've lived in Malibu, CA and have seen some of them in action). The relationship between Nanny and Grayer was heartwarming and really drew me in. The absence of Mr. X and then the revelation of his affair made me hate a fictional man.This book made me laugh, gasp and even cry at times. I found myself rooting for Nanny to \\"grow a backbone\\" and stand up to Mrs. X and tell her where to put all of her requests, but at the same time realizing that her love for Grayer was just too strong and hoping that she would just deal with it all and stay for the kid who seemed to have no other love and role models in his life.To me, this book evokes all the emotions needed by a good story and is a great and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising your own children, a guide what not to do??","review":"Ok, Ok, I had to see what the fuss was all about. Heard great things about this book. I'm 3/4th of the way through it and I just got it two day's ago. It's sure hard to put down. I'm concerned that this book is filled with some truthful parts. What horror and shame this mother should feel. I do hope she's read the book and thought?, hum, I wonder if she's referring to us? I hope that this book will show other's what NOT to do. I don't believe Nanny is a door mat at all. She feels obligated to spent time with Grayer since no one else does. She'll make a good mom someday! As a mother, I'll admit there were several times I reflected, what a horrible mother Mrs. X was and I would never do that. Maybe an eye opener, for 1st time mommy's?? Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having been a nanny, this book is so accurate...","review":"I was amazed at how quickly this book took me right back to the days of being a nanny for a wealthy family. The seemingly \\"outrageous stories\\" are so close to reality, it was alarming. The writers did a very accurate job of depicting life as a nanny. Though I did have some very positive experiences during my time as a nanny, I found myself actually feeling stressed as problems unfold for Nanny. I was brought back to issues that I myself had to deal with, and with uncanty similarities. I have talked to friends that have read this book, and they are amazed that any of it could be even close to reality. Unfortunately, much of it is. When my friends ask what my time as a nanny was like, I can refer them to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even though \\"false\\"...very disturbing","review":"Even though this story was supposed to be false, I got the impression that the author's (former nannies) gathered their material from personal experience. That in it self was disturbing enough, to know that this type of thing really happens. However, the main character annoyed me the most. Her spineless character made me want to reach in the book and smack her for not standing up for herself.Although marketed as a comedic light read, you'd have to be heartless not to be affected negatively by the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Poor Writing Style!","review":"This book was word for word the exact replica of one that I had read when I was in the SECOND GRADE! Of course that was 21 years ago and the title of that book escapes me, but I do remember it being far better written then this time waster. The only reason that I bothered finishing the \\"Nanny Diaries\\" was in amazement as to exactly how similar the older book and this one had in common.Not to mention the several errors! I realize that this book was not meant to be a manual for brain surgery, but for a fun and quick read, but please! A complete insult to my intelligence! A reality t.v. show would have been far better entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed this book and appreciated how it glided easily between the funny and the sad. That is very well done and reflective of life.The authors also do a very good job of depicting a very curious world of privilege and oddity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"Simply put, if I'm going to read what basically amounts to a best-seller trifle, I demand satisfaction. I want resolution and comeuppance and happy endings. This ain't Virginia Woolf. I was not looking for a \\"real\\" (i.e. bummer) ending. This novel manages to be both light as a souffle and leave a bad taste in your mouth at the same time. So much for fun summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, exasperating and nothing near its namesake","review":"Smoothly read, it is an interesting read but nothing near the Bridget Jones books. Its not funny. Actually it's quite sad.Really not worth it.(this is about the audio version of the book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is NOT a comedy...","review":"This is a SAD book. I can't believe all the good reviews. doesn't anyone feel sad for that poor little boy? especially with the ending of this book???"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read!","review":"If someone had lent this book to me, I would have gladly given it back. Unfortunately I paid hardcover price and felt forced to trudge through it, hoping it would redeem itself. It was predictable and extremely boring. Most people in Nanny's position would have quit and moved on. It's hard to feel sorry for a character that does nothing to better herself. I would NEVER suggest this to anyone or even offer to lend my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my FAVORITES!","review":"I don't understand how some people can give this novel 1 star - its crazy.This book is cute, funny, sad. I think the people that gave this book 1 star is looking to into the book. It's a great novel, fun, light read.I hope the movie is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down! It's a must read for anyone who works with children and enjoys it like I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"My step-daughter is a nanny, and I used to work in a very upscale private school (starting age: 2) in Marin County, so I could really relate to a lot of the pretentiousness. I felt for poor put-upon Nanny, but even more so for poor little Grayer (nicknamed \\"Grover\\" by Nan in an attempt to bring some fun into his over-scheduled life). The poor little guy breaks your heart in his obvious and desperate craving for attention from his parents (he wears his father's business card pinned to his shirt). The authors did an amazing job balancing the humor and the heartbreak, especially when you consider its their first book. Well-written and enjoyable, but it breaks your heart for the children everywhere who only want to be loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, Sad, and Oh So True","review":"I have several friends who are nannies and this book simply reiterated all the horror stories I have heard from them. While none of the Mr. and Mrs. X's I know are chaffeured around in town cars, the sentiment is the same - wealthy people without any time or concern for the children they brought into the world. The authors' descriptions of the people, the houses, the mountains of activities the children are required to participate in, and the overwhelming responsibilities placed on the nanny ring true from every page. While I was sad for poor Grayer, I also found myself giggling while reading this book simply because I know this is really the way it is, no matter how insane it sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was great! I loved it. The stories the narrator tells are both funny and sad at the same time. This is a great quick read, a nice beach book. The whole book paints a really comical picture of upper class life in Manhattan. The book is bittersweet, though. I hope this doesn't really happen (though I'm sure it does). This is a must read for everyone who's ever babysat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensively bland","review":"This read like a poorly written young adult book, with all the hand-wringing, the forced lingo, the requisite \\"hottie,\\" and the predictable plot line. It reminded me of a lesser caliber \\"Babysitters Club\\" novel. Or, as the title suggests, a string of melodramatic diary entries, the kind where the writer starts off by describing what she wore to school and how many times she passed Bobby in the hall that day. It was as if the writers made a bulletpoint list of \\"shocking\\" X-family revelations, then thought up some superficial sentences to fill in the spaces.Was the point for Nan to remain completely blanched and characterless in the mind of the reader, as she was in the mind of the X family? I don't think the writers would think that deeply, frankly. As a 23-year-old female, I'm the target audience for this title, but empathy was nowhere in sight for me as I read. Maybe I missed it in between my lids drooping and my eyes rolling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially compelling, ultimately unsatisfactory","review":"I awaited the publication of The Nanny Diaries with a great deal of trepidation. As a former professional nanny myself, I feared the book would cast only shame and disrepute on the profession.I couldn't have been more wrong. Instead the book, despite being about a fascinating field, managed only to bore this reader into a profound somulence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial-episodic-expi-al-ido-cious","review":"Don't be misled by the hype: This book does not explore issues of importance to nannies in any real depth. Instead, the reader gets a superficial glimpse into the narrow world of New York City's ultra-rich living on the Upper East Side. When Nan, the main character finally stands up for herself, she doesn't even do it face-to-face with her employer. What a letdown. There is no arc to the story, just a series of episodes meant to skewer the obnoxiously wealthy parents. The Nanny Diaries should be a fun romp for the New York crowd featured in the story. It's great to laugh at the foibles of these people. And it's great, finally, not to have to read about a nanny who does horrible things to the children in her charge. However, those of us struggling every day to make this intimate employer/employee relationship work out in the hinterlands will have to keep waiting for the New York publishing industry to produce a book that resonates with the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hated this book...","review":"There are so many reasons why this book was terrible, but the main reasons are...Nanny, the main character, is very unlikable,there were frequent attempts at humor, but I did not laugh once,the writing is choppy and self-serving, andI wasted my time reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Action","review":"I was really disappointed with this book considering all the hype that was associated with it. For starters, it could have done without the first six chapters. I had no interest with her following around this bratty boy - at least not to that extent. You get the picture after one chapter. The interesting part did not even start until after halfway through and even after that I couldn't find enough interest to finish. I think the story is pretty predictable and I can't believe I waisted my time reading as much of it as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Boring Ending!!!!","review":"My main complaint about this book was the ending. I was so angry that I wasted my money and time on a book that left me totally unsatisfied with the ending. It was almost like the authors decided to stop writing and decided 'OK, the end'. After investing so much time in these characters you really wanted to see the X's get what is coming to them and nothing happens to them. Or at the very least, have Nan's character triumph in some way.So, don't waste your money unless you enjoy making up your own ending which is what I had to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Adorable, Fun and Easy Read!! Perfect for a vacation!","review":"I don't think anyone pretended that The Nanny Diaries was the great American novel! I read this darling book on the outside deck of a cruise ship. This is the perfect book to read when there are a lot of distractions (like beautiful views). It was easy to get into and there are not a lot of characters to keep up with. The writing is crisp and fast paced. Since my life is so far removed from the X's, I enjoyed reading about the rich and famous (are there really people like that?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book! Bad Book! Naughty! Naughty!","review":"You were a VERY BAD book to waste an hour of my time inthe hopes of finding some really good inside dirt onthe filthy rich. Instead I get a lame-o half-bakednovel filled with over-the-top caricatures, unbelievablystilted dialogue, and all topped off with a snotty, self-righteous main character who needs a good spanking morethan her charge. *WHOOOSHH!* Into the Vortex of VileVolumes you go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Whiny Diaries","review":"After every chapter, I kept asking \\"WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT??\\" A protagonist needs a compelling reason to continue in their current situation and $10 an hour or listing a babysitting reference on your resume just didn't seem worth almost failing out of NYU and being completely demeaned on a daily basis. Nanny just seemed whiny and spineless and completely uncharismatic & uninteresting. Even more implausible of her staying in her nannying post is a rich, Harvard hottie falling for such a spineless dud. The only reason I kept reading is because I kept thinking, \\"this has to get better, it was a best seller.\\" Boy was I wrong. Two thumbs way down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where it all started!","review":"Reads like it really happened! Why? These women WERE nannies! I just loved it! All the oddball behavior! Just so funny, so cutting and insightful! In my opinion, this is where the chick lit revolution - at least the recent one - really started! (With the tv version of Sex and the City too) I wish the others had followed in a similar fashion. Go back and read this one again! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buck up Lil' Buckarette, and get another career!","review":"Should we be shocked, shocked to find that those who inhabit the highest socioeconomic levels are not all sweetness and light? Hello! They didn't get where thay are through altruism. The first few chapters were entertaining but by the fifth chapter I quickly tired of all the simpering, whining, and poor-me-poor-little-kid-aren't-they-horrid? I expected more, and expected it on the next page, but I didn't even get earmuffs. The protagonist should have told them to have a Coke and a Smile, quit and called the department of social services and the labor board on her way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, waste of time","review":"I thought this book was awful. It was hyped as a comedic look at the lives of nannies in NY and their upper class bosses. I really found nothing funny about the story of Nanny and Mrs and Mr X, or the other nannies and their creepy bosses. The parents are terrible and have absolutely no redeeming qualities. The situations get worse and worse and Nanny gets more unlikeable as the story progresses. Mrs X acts like a complete monster and Nanny never stands up for herself, no matter how much Mrs X devalues her and her life. It just wasn't funny, and it's scary to think of how many \\"parents\\" there are who are just like the Xes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise spoiled by poor execution","review":"Too bad these nannnies are treading on Tom Wolfe turf; they might have added to his unbelievably-bad-behavior-of-the -upper-east-side-noveau-riche genre if they weren't such awfully bad writers. Any momentum the story has, in the compelling character of the little boy and his neurotic mother, is dissipated by a tepid romance subplot and dull visits to Nanny's smugly perfect family. It doesn't help that errors are frequent: it's Dorian's, not Dorrian's, and Mattel, not Matel. A good copy editor would have helped, but a rewrite by a skilled ghost writer might have been even more usueful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly nonsense","review":"I was expecting something along the lines of the Herriot books, snippets of the Nanny's life with various families. Instead, this is an absolutely silly unrealistic book about narcissitic parents with an abandoned child, left in the care of a 'looking for a guy' nanny. Silly and ridiculous! Pass this up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's funny about this book?","review":"I see a lot of readers say this was so funny, such a great book yada yada yada. I must have missed the \\"funny\\" chapter. I couldn't find one character to like or even sympathize with. I hated the spineless nanny, the kid was a brat, and the woman/mom was horrid. I realize the point of the book was to show how some of the wealthy treat their kids and help. But come on... it's not funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I got the Nanny Diaries based on all the great things I had Heard about it and I can tell you I was VERY Disappointed. I was hoping for a nice light Beach Read and all I got was a book about a very uphappy family and the perfect Nanny that comes into their lives. Not worth twenty-five dollars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I found this book to be funny.It is a story about Nanny who meets Mrs. X and becomes the Nanny to Mrs. X's son Greer Addison whom Nanny soon calls Grover. Over the next couple of months Nanny must juggle the responsibilities of school, Greer, and her personal life leading to some funny moments in the book.There is only one this that I did not like about the book-the names. It was weird that the main character went by a profession and that while the boy she babysat for had a first a middle name, his parents were Mr and Mrs. X. I don't feel that it would have taken away from the book to have the main character call herself something else or give the X's last names (and maybe say that the name is not their real last name)Over all though this is a very good entertaining book with some really great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreaking","review":"i am a mom, and this book broke my heart. i cried as i read, not only for this fictional four-year-old boy but for real, vulnerable children who are suffering the same sickening pain at the hands of selfish, thoughtless parents. this book is funny, but be prepared to grieve -- the laughs are scattered among starkly sad scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not only disappointing, but annoying","review":"What a complete disappointment! All I wanted to do from about 1/2 way through the book was to scream at \\"Nanny\\" to repost at the Parent's League and get another job! I had absolutely zero sympathy and exceedingly little respect for her by the end of the book. I had thought it would be about multiple jobs with multiple families, not one long whine about a single one. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not what you're expecting","review":"I got sucked in by the hype of this book. I was expecting a funny book of observations and experiences something like Bridget Jone's Diary. Wrong! This is a not-very-well written book that is not funny, despite the ridiculous demands that Nanny's employer makes on her. You just want to scream, \\"kick Mrs. X in the butt, tell her where to go, and walk out the door!\\" Poor Nanny endures humiliation after humiliation.An somewhat entertaining read, but not worth the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing to say the least.","review":"I was pretty excited about reading this book. I picked it up for a light summer read. I thought it sounded really fun. Turns out that anything would have been better. It was just so lacking. The story itself was descent. However, it would have been nice if Nanny could have had just a little self-respect. Instead she was sometimes just as infuriating as the parents because of her extreme inability to stand up for herself. I had to finish the book just to see how everything turned out, but the ending left far too many questions unanswered. It wasn't worth finishing. This story could and should have been easily summed up. I didn't expect a happy ending, but some sort of conclusion would have been nice. Overall, I would say this book lacked a lot of character development, but that the overall theme and message was fairly clear. The ending was just too open-ended for my taste. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected much more","review":"After all the buzz on this book, I was expecting to be blown away. I was expecting the next Bridget Jones' Diary. Wow, was I disappointed. There are so many more worthwhile books out there. Do yourself a favor, and check this one out of the library if you must read it.This book is, at best, just alright. I can say that it was mildly entertaining and an easy read. The characters were a little sketchy, and I felt I had nothing invested in them. I literally didn't care what happened to them, and by the end I had to force myself to finish the book. Dialogue was a little stiff, scenes should have been thought out some more.Nanny is in a tough situation, but her solution is easy - she simply chooses not to end it all. I didn't have a lot of respect for her. I also didn't believe her attachment to the child was enough to deal with all of the .... she gets from Mrs. X.Again, while not a terrible book, it was a disappointment. Check it out from the library and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and fluffy","review":"This is a good enough read when you just need a distraction, and can't concentrate too well. It's entertaining on some aspects, but most will be very irritated that \\"Nanny\\" doesn't tell \\"Mrs. X\\" to shove it, love for the kid or not.A word to other reviewers though - if you hate the book so much (for instance, the reviewer with the subject \\"GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT GARBAGE THROUGHOUT!\\") posting your review nearly a dozen times in a month isn't necessary. Once is plenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I was eager to read this book, hoping that it would be a fun poke at the rich and famous, but it was a big disappointment. None of the characters, with the exception of the child, is sympathetic--including the Nanny who comes off as EXTREMELY self-righteous and aggrandizing. In addition, a lot of the literary conventions (Mr. and Mrs. X?) are just plain silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy","review":"This is a delightful book filled with wit and soul. Emma McLaughlin insightfully nails the pretense of parenting among the rich, where children are mere status symbols. McLaughlin also sees the irony of the world of work, especially the world of work when it deals with childred.Anybody who has ever been a teacher, a little league coach, or a Boy Scout Leader can relate to this book. I highly recommend it. That reminds me, I should also recommend Lenny astellaneta's \\"No One's Even Bleeding.\\" His book recounts being a substitute teacher in L.A. He too has the same sense of irony.The absurdity of parenting in America is ripe for ridicule."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had that 3 hours back","review":"I was so disappointed in this book I had to write a review. The writing is extremely poor and Nanny's character comes across so pathetic I found myself annoyed. She is portrayed as a girl with no backbone that never does anything to please herself. Her charater was so weak that, as she is being fired, she does not even have the courage to comment on the fact that she's being underpaid by over $1000.And the H.H. storyline...sorry everyone, i am a new york city girl and trust me no Harvard Hottie would give a girl like that a chance. That storyline was definitley made up in an attempt to make this book interesting.I'm not saying the way Mr & Mrs X treated Nanny was right. I'd just like to prevent someone from wasting their time on this book.I can't believe those two are making money off this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"When I began reading this book, I was intrigued. But as I went through, I began to wonder how parents such as Mr. and Mrs. X can neglect a child so. And if they take therapy, how no one noticed that the son was suffering from love loss syndrome. Through Nanny, the child can love someone who loves him back, regardless if she's wearing a mink stole. I must say though I loved this book, I was disgusted by these NYC high and mighty people. Child Protective Services ought to burst into these homes, kids with moms on crack, parents who hire someone else to care for the child they spent nine months carrying around as if it is some piece of cattle. I applaud Nanny for getting out when she did. I became physically exhausted reading this, sharing in Nanny's turmoil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too talked up . . .","review":"I too heard great things about this book, but was disapointed. I agree with the previous reviews word 'depressing'. I think this book is probably pretty true to many nanny/family situations, but still sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This book was slow and boring. The only reason I kept reading it was to see if she ever told the X's off-which she didn't.I felt like burning this book after I finished it because it was so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep!!","review":"If you have something better to do..Do it!! I really don't recommand the book, I found if boring the way the story is described and it is just so snobbish that it bored me to sleep.It describes the mishaps of a Nanny that takes care of the son of a wealthy family, but to be sincere, the humor is definatively for people living in New York.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the one star!","review":"I am sure that people such as decribed in this book exist and my question is: \\"so what?\\" I feel badly that I wasted my time reading this total garbage of a novel with no plot, no positive characters whose only aim was to make some quick money for its authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Self Serving Tripe","review":"I can't believe I paid for this drivel. A couple of ex-nannies write a completely self-serving piece of trash and now they are living the high life from the proceeds...the life style they so love to look down upon from their ivory tower. Pity the child who was exposed to such holier than thou attitudes. Does the author really think she/they are any better than the parents they portray so vitriolically? I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Responsibility","review":"It is about time that someone shed light on the lack of responsibility and accountability that exists in the upper classes of our society and how destructive patterns of parental behavior can ruin all children. Love and attention, not material property are the essential child-rearing tools. I LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Diary","review":"A little tough getting through the first chapter though keep on going. It's well worth it. The author is very convincing in illustrating how the relationships of a family can change so dramatically and believably under the circumstances given. The characters in this book are believable and well established."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breezy and entertaining","review":"This is a fun, breezy novel perfect for the beach. Written in a voice similar to Bridget Jones's Diary, The Nanny Diaries is a hilarious look at the rich (and dysfunctional) New York City families and their nannies. It's hard not to finish it quickly, and when you do you'll be overcome with chutzpah--'Hmph! They may be rich, but they certainly aren't happy!'I only have one complaint: the characters are over-simplified. The parents are bad, bad people, the boyfriend is cute and smart and sweet, and the nanny is dedicated and altruistic. It would have been a more satisfying read had the characters been slightly more complex.As a college student who's just finished her finals, this book was just what I needed: easy, fun, and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than i expected","review":"I received this book as a gift, and, based on what I'd heard, I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I found the tone, the subject, and the nanny and Grayer, her 4yo charge, engaging. Mrs. X was rendered as both hateful and worthy of pity, while Mr. X was painted as a cardboard figure, the epitome of the philandering AWOL dad. The writing was good (I'd give it a B), although some of the transitions were confusing. The success of this book is not surprising, but I doubt it will stand the test of time. It should, however, make a hilarious movie, one that will NOT appeal to wealthy Manhattan couples who hire nannies. They will all be too worried about seeing themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the fuss?","review":"Sorry, but I found this book terribly disappointing. I thought it would be a collection of true stories, but ended up being fiction. I think this book would appeal to twenty-something single female singles or former nannies, but no one else. Wouldn't recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful surprise!","review":"I originally only read this book because its authors grew up in my home town--but I was wonderfully surprised by how much I actually enjoyed it! It was sharply funny while still being caring--not self-consciously cynical or angst-ridden as often \\"modern\\" novels are. I'm looking forward to seeing anything that might come out from these writers in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Public relations firm hyping mediocre book","review":"It is annoying that so many of the reviews are written and hyped by the same person. \\"Heartfelt, laughed and cried, page-turner.\\" Pleeeeease. I am in awe of the successful P.R. effort but after reading the book, you'll feel very disappointed.Note to overzealous P.R. firm: Let the book rise or fall on its own merits without pumping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and Sad","review":"I was given this book as a present for a new mom. It is horrible. Very poorly written, without a plot or a satisfying conclusion. The treatment of the poor child in the book is deplorable by everyone, including the so-called Nanny. Aside from feeling sadness for little Grayer, the rest of the book elicited no emotion or interest. Pretty sad and bad given the wealth of material the two authors had to work with..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"I think the authors have tried to make a funny novel, but I dont really think it was. Moreover the style of writing is not that good.Well personally, at the end of the book, when I thought about it, I didnt laugh when reading it, and I didn't gain anything from it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read and Re-Read!","review":"Once you've read it, this is definitely one novel you will reach for again.Our main character, \\"Nanny\\" is as sharp as a tack; you will find yourself laughing at the thought of what she struggles NOT to say out loud.My only disappointment is at the end of the novel... without giving too much away, I have to say that I thought the manner of Nanny's departure was inconsistant with her spunky character. My heart bled for Grayer!That being said, I highly recommend this for a good summer read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is a quick and easy read. If you're looking for something slightly salacious and gossipy, then this book is for you. I was fascinated and at the same time disgusted with the attitudes of the rich people in the book. Only goes to show that just because you have money doesn't mean you automatically get class with it. Poor Nanny gets put upon all the time and Mr and Mrs X don't seem to understand that she's there TO WORK. She's not there out of the goodness of her own heart. There are some very funny moments during the course of her tenure with the Xes. At the end she just sort of walks off into the sunset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing Gone Wrong!","review":"I purchased this book based on the entire hub hub surrounding it. I just finished the book last night and must say I am sadly disappointed. The plot is very disjointed especially concerning the supposed boyfriend although how they went from hating each other to being serious is beyond me. The editors did a poor job of making a potentially great story very weak. There were too many plot assumptions made and for that I wouldn't recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"I couldn't put it down. It was witty, hysterical....there were times I was reading lines out lound to everyone around me. I wanted everyone to hear how clever these women are. And, living in NYC, I can attest to the fact that so much is true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my second-favorite nanny...","review":"Nobody can replace Mary Poppins for me! But Nanny in this book is a great character--one that you would like to get to know--and that you feel you would like and would be friends with if you could get to know her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy hype.","review":"The Nanny Diaries is a lot of hype. Borrow it from a friend for a silly read at the beach. Save your cash for an other book (suggest Lucky Man - Michael J Fox, loving that book at the moment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Life: Kinda Freaky-- but in a good way","review":"Having recently been a nanny for an affluent family originally from New York, I found the description and detail greatly entertaining. From the Manolo Blaniks to the Spencer school, it all inhabits the life of New York's high-society. At times the description was a bit too much if you can believe that...but a great 3 night read. Bravo to McLaughlin and Kraus on their premier piece of fiction and congratulations to them on their sale of the movie rights to this book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A FUNNY BOOK","review":"The New York Times calls this book diabolically funny. This book is NOT funny. This book is sad and pathetic. I understand it is supposed to be a satire but there is nothing funny about a child getting attached to his part-time nammy, the only person who cares about him. Instead of laughing I was shaking my head. I was actually crying at the end of the book because of how Nanny and Grayer relationship abruptly ends. Yes it is funny that people these days name their children some of the ridiculous names presented in this book but that is the only funny thing about this book. For any normal mother out there looking for a fun light read, this is not it. Not only did I hate this book but I'm angry I wasted my time reading. The fact that the New Yorker liked this book just goes to show who the audience for this book is. Wealthy New Yorkers who have time to read lousy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a whimp!","review":"I am extremely disappointed with this book. Poor character progression.... By the end of the book I thought that Nanny deserved all she got for letting Mrs. X get away with that attitude. I can tell that instead of leaving the x's a dirty message for revenge, the authors of this book just decided to use the book as revenge. What unsympathetic characters!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nanny diatribes","review":"These 20-year-olds raising other people's children should take themselves off the market and do those kids a favor. I felt the book was a long drawn out whine. Wait until you have your own kids and start setting boundaries. Your parents were right, quit the job and find something better. Don't try to entertain people with behind the scenes garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Wicked","review":"I believe the Nanny Diaries is one of the freshest, most delightful books to hit the market in a very long time. It is a well written book that flows smoothly,is snappy and is both hilariously funny and tearfully poignant. From the very first page your interest is grabbed and you come to care for the little boy in Nanny's care as much as she does. It also is an interesting insight into how little childcare providers are truly valued, and how they are expected to step in and fill many other roles, perhaps just a step above slavery, withstanding abuse from the kids and their parents. It also provided a thought provoking window into the thinking that seems to prevade the non-child care providers in that those who do tender the little ones have no other life outside their charges. I think it is a great summer read, and I highly, highly, recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Jane Run","review":"Amazon forced me to give this book at least one star, but I'd really give it a big ol' ZERO. It took two grown women to write something that could have been written by one of their 5 year old charges. Their writing skills would be put to better use by the folks that churn out Harlequin Romances. Keep your day jobs, ladies. I cannot imagine why this book was so popular. Fran Drescher? The cute cover? Confusion with the Princess Diaries?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite cliche","review":"As a former NYC nanny, I found this work embarrassing and nothing but a huge cliche. How sad to know that it took *two* authors to write such trivial one-sided characters, and such a redundant, obvious storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE...What is all the fuss?","review":"A sophmoric attempt at best. I was excited to read this book and had great hopes for it. As a mother who has used nannys and as a former nanny myself, I was all set for some fun light reading. I enjoy \\"first\\" novels from up and coming young women writers and tend toward the genre. What a disappointment. The saddest thing, I think, is that the protaganist herself, is Mrs. X - just give her ten years. The authors don't even see it. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Worth It...","review":"I bought this book craving for something funny to read and from it's hype and fabulous reviews, I thought 'hey! this is a must read'. Boy, was I wrong. It started off well enough and it's first chapter hooked me in but it progressively got worse and worse and I found myself just skimming haphazardly through chapters. I couldn't wait to finish the book so I could move on to something better. Yes, the subject may be untouched and therefore seem original but other than that, there isn't really much to it. In fact, I think the word I'm looking for is BORING. The authors didn't really know where to take the story I believe and it just went on and on. So my advice to you is to save your money and wait for something better to come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Wow- they must have had great publicity to create all that buzz, because this book actually stinks. It was a great concept, but so poorly written the protaganist is not even likeable.It could easily have been condensed into an article. I don't know who edited this thing, but the ending was awful, and there was no resolution to subplots, including the nanny's relationship with her boyfriend.Very disappointing. Don't waste your money- wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge of the Nannies","review":"Starts of good...nice details that will shock and amuse you. The nannies speak for all others who come in contact with these ignorant clueless parents. Unfortunately, once the fun wears off it becomes boring and tedious. The nanny love interest/tie -in is for the high school readers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I knew I had to read this book, when I kept hearing my friend Claire -- who is always an excellent source for finding incredible books -- exclaiming a barage of things including \\"Oh my Gosh!\\" \\"Those monstrous people!\\" \\"That's the funniest thing I've ever read!\\" and \\"Oh for crying out loud.\\"And that basically sums up the book. The reader is slung happily around from bursting into hysterical laughter to being absolutely disgusted to feeling so so so so sorry for everyone.While it's not the best book I've ever read and the writing itself, having been cowritten, is not exactly incredible (though very good; the writing isn't BAD by any means at all) it is definitely a pageturner -- I finished it in 2 days, and it will make you think before judging."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I could hardly stand to read the few chapters that I made it through. The arrogance of the writer is incredibly off-putting. I'm sure that the stories are based in reality, but the nanny herself was so cocky and fancied herself so superior to the families I couldn't bear to go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Books that I enjoy I can't put down, and when I am done I share with a friend or donate it to our local library. This book I could not put down because I kept waiting for it to get better, to live up to its hype, to be something substantial. When I was done with it, I did what I have NEVER done with a book.... I put it in the trash where it belongs. No imagination, or creativity went into this book. The characters on both sides, Nan and Mrs X were too stereotypical to like, love or believe in. This book is one of the few I have read that I consider literary garbage. Who considers emotional child abuse from a parent funny? Would we consider a poor woman's neglect of her child humor? Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least.","review":"I was pretty excited about reading this book. I picked it up for a light summer read.

It's both hilarious and horrifying to see how uppper Manhattan so-called mothers raise their children -- or pay someone else to raise them. The 4-year old, Grayer, is just another fashion/social strata acessory to Mrs. X. But what makes this book so enjoyable to read is the writing, which is direct and simple and clear. This book is very entertaining -- and I felt myself totally addicted to it after the first five pages. Read it! I promise you'll enjoy it! Also recommended: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me laugh...then made me cry","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers. I was really depressed after reading this book. I, too, was happily tearing through this book, laughing out loud to myself and then....came to a screeching halt about 75 pages from the end. I realized that the poor child (Grayer) is going to be left again. It truly broke my heart.I am not usually a \\"cryer\\" but I actually cried thinking about that poor kid. It made me look at my own relationship with my child and my job. Like another reader, I also finished the book late at night and had to fight the urge not to wake up my son and hug him. Funny and witty but sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this in 1 week and i work 40 hours","review":"This book is so good I really hope they write more. I couldn't put it down.

This is how it is to be a nanny. I would recomend this book for any person who thinks they would like to be a nanny, so they know what they are getting into! There really are people out there like Mrs. X, I have seen it. I could not stop laughing at this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was furious!!!","review":"I read this book in one sitting ( I really couldn't put it down!), but all the same, it really made me angry. I used to be a nanny, and the things that Nan put up with were totally uncalled for! I couldn't believe that someone would actually put up with all of that. I am not sure if the authors would really have reacted that way in real life, or if they would just like it if everyone thinks that they would. It feels as though the authors wanted us to picture them as some sort of saints or something. I think this book would have been a lot better if Nan had been a little more real and a little more feisty, and a LOT less long suffering!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"This book gave me a new view of modern day novels. This book is an excellant addition to anyone's library. This book a The Lovely Bones, and Dreams: Gateway to the True Self are very powerful books. They are well worth your time and exploration."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the adults were horrible","review":"I read this book to the end hoping to find one adult worth knowing something about. There are none. Nan gets what she deserves because of her inability to set boundaries. The X's never show a moment of humanity. Four-year old Grayer is less a human child than an artful construct against which the inhumanity of the adults is portrayed. I was embarrassed earlier this year because I read a sort-of bodice ripper called \\"Fancy Pants\\" and enjoyed it. I am much more embarrassed to have read this bit of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it 'til the end","review":"I LOVED this book (until the last chapter.) It was incredibly engaging: well-written, funny, and, yes, tragic, with a spunky and likable main character. I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to find out how it would end. Then I got to the last chapter, and in a few short pages, it suddenly did end, but unsatisfactorily. The ending felt rushed, as if the authors were writing a term paper and were almost over the number of allowed pages, wrapping things up as quickly as possible. I liked the idea of how it ended, but the execution of the ending was a bit watered down. The result: a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Much Worth it!","review":"I LOVED this book! I laughed, Cried, Winced, and smiled. It covers every emotion on the scale but it keeps with the story. I passed on my copy to all of my friends and each one loved it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Tragic","review":"I was hooked from the first line, and didn't stop until the last one. This unprecedented, no-holds-barred glimpse into the rarefied world of the uber wealthy made me actually glad that I am not \\"one of them\\". And knowing, despite claims to the contrary, that this story was based on real people and real events, made me feel sorry for the children of these narcissistic, hedonistic, soulless billionaires who think that money buys good parenting. My heart ached for Grayer; and I was actually a little emotional at the end. And it made me want to be a better mother.Well written, funny, and heart-breaking. Everything a good book should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Charm Escapes Me Completely!","review":"I couldn't even get through half of this poorly-written book. It was as though the authors were trying way too hard to think of catchy descriptive words to fit in ad nauseum. I thought it would be \\"hilarious\\", but I didn't find it funny in the slightest, in fact it was very boring and empty. It didn't hold my attention, the characters were one dimensional and the writing was oh, so completely bad!I found myself thinking after turning virtually every page, \\"what a waste of time this is\\". I finally tossed it into my garage sale box after forcing myself to read almost 1/2 of the book. The popularity of this mindless piece (rather than the subject) makes me worry about the state of society!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and fluffy","review":"This is a good enough read when you just need a distraction, and can't concentrate too well. It's entertaining on some aspects, but most will be very irritated that \\"Nanny\\" doesn't tell \\"Mrs. X\\" to shove it, love for the kid or not.A word to other reviewers though - if you hate the book so much (for instance, the reviewer with the subject \\"GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT GARBAGE THROUGHOUT!\\") posting your review nearly a dozen times in a month doesn't prove your point that the book is terrible. It just makes the rest of certain that you have no life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Exciting Diary","review":"Everyone said this book was great, so maybe my expectations were too high.

While it was captivating, there are many faults to the book. Why couldn't the author use REAL names, rather than initials or the name Nanny for the nanny? (I.e. Mrs. X, or HH).

WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter [garbage]","review":"Yes folks it's true - women who hire nannies are neurotic weirdos. This book mysteriously focusses very little on what Grayer's father could be doing to improve his child's upbringing.

Well it is choking me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time or money","review":"i just finished this book, and all i can say is: \\"i want my money back\\". ... the characters in this book are completely shallow, the situations often take unexpected yet disappointing twists, and the only thing that will keep you reading is the bleak hope that something interesting will happen. i'll save you the time: nothing interesting happens. in the whole book. ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon oversold this one!","review":"With a 5-year-old grandson in New York, I was interested in the nanny scene and, on impulse, ordered this book from Amazon. While in some ways it was an entertaining (though often painful) read, it felt more like an extended cartoon than a genuine novel. Literature it ain't! Be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"This book is completely overrated. The lead character is a spineless, annoying individual, who even when encountered with the perfect opportunity to stand up for themselves, they are too much of a coward to do it. It's something else when the employer, the mother of the child she cares for, is far more interesting than the lead character. That character had depth, which made you sometimes pity her and at other times hate her, which somehow left you wanting to know more about her (as opposed to our lead character.) This was a mindly entertaining book.This book was a cheap knockoff of the \\"THE DEVIL LOVES PRADA\\", which is an excellent book. Now that book had an array of characters (especially the lead character) with depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Bad language","review":"This book started off fairly interesting, but as I progressed, the F word began to appear and I quit. Do not recommend this mundane, uninteresting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upper East Side Misery","review":"Only read this book if you want to hear how the wealthiest 10% of America live. Having worked in the Upper East Side I can assure you that its one of the most miserable places on the earth- hence money doesnt make you happy. Snotty rich kids being raised by their nannies, socialite attititudes \\"Do you know who I AM??\\" mentality, this book reveals it all. Enter the world of doormen, service entrances ,kiss ... building supers , personal chefs, etc. After youre done with this book, you will be glad you arent a rich snob who is to busy to raise her kids right and needs a nanny and a live in maid! This might save you money the next time a powerball jackpot catches your eye - it just might not be worth it....."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever","review":"I don't get all the hype about this book. Maybe it's because there are so many like it on the market today. I found the present tense, first person narrative annoying and the main character whiny through most of the book. The ending was very disappointing and really predictable. Every possible stereotype of a WASP socialite mother was included.Not really worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I don't know why people like this book. I think it's poorly written and not that intersting. The summary of the book on the back cover, made it seem like the main character \\"Nanny\\" found some secrets of Mrs. X that she used it to revenge on Mrs. X later on. So I read and read to see what kind of revenge Nanny would do. But, no... nothing... I was duped to think that Nanny would do some kind of revenge. The ending was horrible and the book is very bland. I was disappointed and wanted my money back. And I agree with some of the users' reviews that HH character-- Harvard Hotty -- is so irrelevant. He is there just so that there is some romance to satisfy the female readers. Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Blurb.","review":"The blurb sounds great. The premise could be really humorous, given the elements of the story. However, this book was in no way funny. It did no even qualify as satire, it was simply really disturbing. The atmosphere that this child is in, his crazy mother and the things she did at times reduced me to tears and at other times had me cursing. And Nanny, who is supposed to be getting a degree in child development - the fact that she put up with what is being done to this child, and allowed herself to be treated as she did, makes her completely unbelievable as a character. Your heroine should be a sympathetic figure but in this case, Nanny simply appears to be one dimensional and far from intelligent based on her actions. I have never had a book make me angry before but this one did absolutely. The only character that was even remotely appealing in this is the child and he emerges as a tragic figure and at times smarter then all the adults around him."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even good airplane reading","review":"It's a great idea and I had high hopes, but these young writers need an editor - badly. Take a bad episode of \\"Friends\\" and then commit it to paper. If that isn't dreary enough, dilute it some more so that all the pithy quips are gone. You then have the basic technique of TND...They'll make a bundle with the book anyway. I hear it will be a movie. It might also make a good HBO series.I got it at a half-price bookstore for 12.50. I was going to save it for friends who need something to read on an airplane, but don't think I can recommend it even for that. I think I'll try to sell it today.I read the authors are working on another book. Wonderful, another team-written novel. what's next, a committee?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting to get to the part people liked","review":"Several people told me I had to read this book. They said it was funny and a great look at life among the rich. So my expectations were pre-set. I didn't find the book funny, I thought it was very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is completely overrated. I bought it because it was getting great reviews from editors and magazines, plus the fact that it was supposed to be extremely funny. As I read through the book the more stereotypical it becomes and the jokes less amusing and even less funnier. The first few chapters are devoted to how rich this nanny's clients were and how awful they are to the help. Mrs.X is supposed to be a character that you love to hate but in fact she is just as bland and shallow as the nanny who narrates in the book. I found this book thoroughly unentertaining since it is gives horribly exagerrated accounts of the relationships between nannies, their employers and their wards. This one is guaranteed NOT to make you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! How could you love it?","review":"This was one of those books that I'm shocked to hear anyone liked. I read it with the same feeling you get when a friend tells you a long, boring story, but you listen because they're a friend who needs to vent. By the end, I got the feeling the nannies/writers were using this book to yell at all the terrible parents they worked for. Then I realized they worked for over 30 families - and they're so young! Does that mean they had as many problems being a good nanny as the parents did being good parents? It at least raised the question. I wouldn't recommend this book - not enough depth or character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype.","review":"This was OK for a quick beach read when I went on vacation, but I found myself just wanting to get it over with.I found the writing mediocre and a few annoying things, like:Most people didn't have real names, they were descriptive names and I felt that to be an insult to the readers intelligence.Cell phones are ringing like crazy in this book with unwanted calls, so people hide them. Newsflash: cell phones have \\"off\\" buttons. My last gripe is that the descriptions of what the 4 year old says is more advanced than a 4 year old.Not worth buying but if someone gives it to you and you're really, really bored...have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"This book was really boring. The reviews on the back of the book were misleading. They said the book was funny. The only funny thing about this book is that I bought it. There is nothing about the book that captures the imagination. The writing is very bland and not creative. It's only focus are very rich people who are very depressed and very rude. I was waiting for \\"Nanny\\" to tell Mrs. X off for the way she treated her, her son, and others around her. I was very disappointed in \\"Nanny\\" as a person. She is very weak. I wanted \\"Nanny\\" to come out of this a winner but she never made her move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned...your heart is broken every 7 pages","review":"This book lets you see into a world that only an insider can describe. That is interesting. This books allows for some laugh out loud moments about the silliness of the ultra New York rich. And then the book describes the longing of a child for love and attention from his parents. A need that is never met. This book is being celebrated as being a fun read. If you have a heart, be prepared for it to be crushed unmercifully by the authors. If I read \\"I want my mommy\\" or \\"I want my daddy\\" while reading the full description of the poor child's tear stained face once more...I think I will scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I saw the movie first years ago. This book really gives you insight on what it could be like growing up with parents who are not concerned with parenting and instead thrust the roll of 'mom' to the nannies. Its actually pretty funny as it highlights the ridiculousness of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so funny?","review":"While most of my friends have said they loved this book, I found it a sad commentary on the lives our children live. I could not find the humor in this story! The nannies portrayal of the tortured life of these children not to mention the cold and lonely lives of both the wives and husbands just doesn't spell comedy. The material world of all involved painted a picture of callousness and a lack of understanding of what is really important in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This was like reading about a foreign country - one full of shallow, ultra-materialistic, insecure people. Are all nannies this spineless? Are all Park Avenue families this caught up with their image and neglect their families like this? I certainly hope not but I can only wonder.Vocabulary choices were substandard and I can't get over the shallowness of the characters (besides the nannied - Grayer).I kept telling myself to stop reading this book but I couldn't - I guess that's what earned the two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanny Diaries: A must read for former nannies!","review":"AMAZING! Anyone who has worked as a nanny in New York will see themselves and their employers in this book. It is so full of accurate descriptions of a day in the life of a nanny that I thought I'd wake up in my live-in bedroom in NYC. The book is true and funny, but it helps to remember that endings between children and their nannies are often sad. (The people who employ nannies, if they bother to read this, will not see the truth in it, which you know means it's completely accurate.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"When is the Sequel?","review":"This is a frightening story about how the new rich treat their children as acquisitions and objects, just like their houses in the Hamptons and Aspen, to be taken out and shown off when appropriate and otherwise hidden away. It is a fast easy read filled with details of NY life that are unimaginable, but real. I've met these moms and seen their nannies and only one is qualified to take care of a child (and it isn't the mom). Unhappily, there is a lot of truth to this story. I cannot wait for the sequel or the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love this book!","review":"I am constantly reading and rarely do I come across a book that I would so highly recommend. The brilliant satire and realistic characterizations are reminiscant of the best of Tom Wolfe. I haven't enjoyed a novel as much since \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". Get it, you will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ending ever!!","review":"I'm giving this book 2 stars because it did keep me entertained for a short while. Then, like many other reviewers, I began to get bored of all of her complaining and whining. But the ending....horrible!! I was left feeling bewildered & felt like perhaps my book had some pages left out of it. The authors did a very poor job of tying up loose ends. What happened to her and HH?Also, she mentions that she needs to find a job using her degree, a whole section is even devoted to describing one interview. Then, the only thing you ever here about her job hunting again is a one sentence reply during a dinner party???? What???? Did we miss something? I was extremely disappointed and would encourage you to pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time","review":"The book had a relatively pointless story line, but at least it made up for it with a horrible ending. But hey - if pointless drivel is your thing - enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why a bestseller?","review":"I found this book very tedious to read. I guess I had a problem with all of the personal injustices that Nanny had to endure (and the various other \\"help\\" in the X household). There were some cute moments, and the little romance between Nan and H.H. was kinda fun... overall, not all that it is cracked up to be... I was expecting something great since it has been a bestseller and all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really undeveloped characters","review":"If the authors are trying to write an expose\`, then they should just tell some juicy gossip in article or short story format. As a piece of fiction, this book is very unpolished. After reaching the end of this book, I'm still not sure who the MAIN character was. Certain major characters (such as H.H., Mr. X, and Ms. C) are completely undeveloped and the seams between the two different authors' (and their ghost writer's) writing styles are glaringly obvious. I only finished the book because I hoped it would get better (it didn't). I immediately gave away the book.I know this book has gotten a lot of publicity, but don't be a sheep. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, Blah, Blah","review":"When I finished this book, I thought it was me. I was glad to see so many others at Amazon felt the same way. Before you spend money on this book, check out all the one-star reviews. Some disappointed readers have written very good critiques. Personally, I think that all the effort in this book went into the marketing. This was a very \\"sellable\\" idea. Apparently, however, not enough time and effort (and money?) was spent on plot development, characterization and editing. All in all, the story reminded me of a former co-worker who never stopped talking. It was blah, blah, blah all day. Every ten minutes or so, I listened to a sentence or two of her endless chatter and got the gist of what she was saying. Likewise, if you buy this book, you can read a paragraph...skip ten pages...read a paragraph...skip ten pages, etc. This book was a lot of blah, blah, blah. Don't waste your time and money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, relaxing read","review":"I bought this book because reading about upscale, rich snobby people sounded like fun. It was. This book is written by 2 ex-nannies and takes a satirical approach in telling the tale of \\"Nanny\\" and her charge, Grayer.I enjoyed reading the book, being able to read a few pages and pick it back up again with ease. I didn't get hooked on the characters, or anything, so it wasn't a big emotional overload of a book. It was just FUN to read. However, I didn't really care for the way the book ended. If you read it, you might agree with me. I won't spoil it for you, though.This would be a great book to buy, then pass around to share with a group of friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and engaging; great light reading","review":"This book describes the life of a young woman working as a \\"part-time\\" nanny while attending college in NYC. Her employers are the ultimate definition of \\"rich dysfunctional,\\" a couple who cares more for their high-class clothes and furniture than their adorable 4-year old son Grayer. But the main character (aptly named \\"Nan,\\" or Nanny), can't help but fall in love with Grayer, which causes her to quietly accept being treated as less than human by her employers. Although the behavior of the rich couple is so outlandish as to seem unbelievable, the authors spent years as nannies themselves in NYC, and the implication is that they encountered similar abhorable behavior and worse. However, Nanny's passive acceptance of her treatment by the couple is even more difficult to understand, to the point which it was frustrating to read. Despite this, I enjoyed this lighthearted book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, easy, and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I read this book with low expectations yet...even then I was disappointed.The main character \\"Nan\\" has a series of tasks (which her high-strung employer \\"Mrs. X\\" commands her to do), which makes her ideal 15-20 hour weekly job a 60 hour a week struggle.Nan has one-dimensional friends (Sarah and Josh) and a relationship with a man whom she never reveal the name of but only refers to him as Harvard Hottie or H.H.Its confusing how her relationship with H.H. even came about or how her friendships really are as they are only backdrop to the her more important relationship with an expressive 4 year old named Grayer.This book is definitely hard to put down but not because it is well written (which it is not) but because the reader hopes that at one point the protagonist would gain likability and depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...I Wouldn't Jump Straight To \\"Diambolically Funny\\"!","review":"This book was not as wonderful as or as funny as I thought it would be. I read the books before I read the reviews and I should have done just the opposite. I truly didn't find any humor in self centered parents, a 'willing to be a doormat nanny', or the spoiled but ultimatly ignored child Grayer. I must admit that I did finish the book only because I spent the money and didn't want to waste it, the authors took the time to write it, and someone in publishing felt it was worth publishing. Take my advice, borrow it from a friend, or the library if you're set on reading it. Otherwise I would just avoid it all together. There was really nothing redeeming about the read at all. Not one likeable character, and a serious lack of wit or humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated hype by PR department","review":"The so-called wonderful reviews were written by same PR firm, i.e. I laughed, I cried, heartfelt, etc.(give me a break!) A lot of unnecessary hype for a mediocre book."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Nanny Diaries","review":"I enjoyed this book for its humor, and there is much of that. But this book also made me sad, because the children were held in so little regard by their parents. After due consideration I was glad the kids had such good nannies, and was angry they didn't have more loving parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanny Diaries","review":"Very funny, but scary knowing that these vignettes were based on events which actually happened. No need to worry why some kids get really messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT funny","review":"I read this book after reading <u>The Nanny</u> by Melissa Nathan, and reviews in amazon that this is a funny book. Biting Satire maybe, but hardly funny. This book is more a sad commentary, and though I would recommend it to someone who wanted a glimpse of yuppie lifestyles, I wouldn't suggest it as a fun or funny read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wry Insider View of NYC Elite and Their Child Rearing","review":"Seeing the behind-the-scenes lives of New York's super-rich and their children is an eye-opener. Nanny, a savvy college student, can't help bonding with her charge, Grayer, and experiences with him the pain of having disfunctional parents.They are so wrapped up in their high-powered lives, that a child is merely a nuisance to be shown off on occasion and otherwise kept out of sight. Read Nanny's descriptions of the ups and downs and how she copes with Grayer's needs and keeps her own life somewhat on track.You'll laugh - You'll cry - You'll hope they are writing another book (I just checked and their 2nd book, Citizen Girl, comes out Nov. 16)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny satire of graduate wage slaves and the overprivileged","review":"Nanny has problems setting limits, which is why she's practically raising a young sensitive boy named Grayer (who she calls Grover) while his father makes business deals and adulterous love, and his mother heads off to the spa when Grayer has a fever of 104.3. The juicy part: The mom was the trophy wife once! Now she spends her days hunting for lavender water and yelling at both Nanny and Grayer.This is not Mary Poppins--it's not even \\"Clara's Heart.\\" As several of Nanny's compadres from Jamaica, Mexico, Australia nd other countries know. The only spoonful of sugar is Nanny's love for Grayer, her burgeoning romance with H.H., aka Harvard Hottie, and her sense of self evolving beyond the wage slavery of graduate school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Grayer","review":"The Nanny Diaries was a very enjoyable book, but that poor little boy that Nanny was taking care of! What a life, having parents and not having them. There must be millions of kids in the world just like him. The Nanny Diaries is not in the classics league, but it told a good story. That story must be true to life, too. That's what's frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter Sweet","review":"The book is funny and sad at the same time. Funny because it is simply crazy the things that Mrs. X and her \\"friends\\" find essential in life. Sad because even though the book is supposed to be fiction, this is the daily life of some families and in the end the children suffer the brunt.You decide what is more important: the pattern and colour and designer label of the dress you want to wear to the Chrismas Party or the snowman your son spent his whole afternoon making and is now dying to present to you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanny knows best","review":"I just went back and re-read this book again, and while it still didn't blow me away like so many other readers, it was still a good time. Nanny is so every-girl, a character you like, you cheer for, and you want to win, even if you wonder at times why she never stands up to anyone. Instead of disliking her for being passive, I just decided to enjoy the story and see Nanny as the benevolent care taker who lets us see inside the seedy lives of elite New Yorkers, never quite laying into them when they deserve it, and not quite fitting in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, entertaining pulp","review":"I would venture that most people would enjoy reading this book for a lark. I don't normally delve into this sort of literature, but it is occasionally a fun diversion.High points include humorous anecdotes, shockingly evil antics, and an inside look into the lives of the unhappy rich (an old but tried and true format).Flaws include a slightly irritating protagonist, unrealistic situations, one-sided characters, and side plots that go nowhere.If you can get over the \\"old news\\" quality in this book, you'll have a good time reading it. Take it to the beach. Sip a mai tai. Laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"I honestly don't know what the big hype is. I thought this book was one of those can't-put-down, have-to-read-in-one sitting but it's far from it. I didn't find it funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"This book is not badly written, but anyone pushing it as a comedy has got to be kidding themselves. There are funny parts, to be sure, but mostly the book is just full of frustration. As I read, I became more and more agitated, and though my job has nothing to do with children, by the end of the book I was even feeling irritated with my job. I would have felt better if we knew Nanny came out alright or at least got some sort of revenge. No one, and I mean no one would allow someone to walk all over them that badly. Even Mary Poppins would have blown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"There are too many well-written, interesting, wonderful books in existence to waste your time with this one. True, the uber rich, completely self-involved, Upper Manhattan parent exists and should be exposed, but it could/should have been done with more character development, humor and angst. I found little to enjoy here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate at all...","review":"As a 15 year old who lives on the Upper East Side and has had a nanny all her life, I am very disappointed in this book. It is very sterotypical, and does not portray people from the upper class in NYC fairly. I have lived my life with a nanny and been sent away to boarding school, but that does not mean my mother was a mother like Mrs. X. I expected a book I could relate to, and instead ended up being insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply disgusting","review":"Tried to read this book.

I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I found this book by first time writers extremely funny! I didn't want to put it down. Every chance I got, I was reading! At times the characters seem to go too far, but that is what makes it such a good read, the reader can't wait to see what they do next. Bravo to these two former nannys turned authors for giving us such a good read that is filled with lots of laughs at such a somber time for America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanny Diaries Book","review":"This is a great book. Many times it was hard to put down. I like it much better than the movie because it was so different and I liked the characters in the book better.

So, this book might not be so much for younger ones. Good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it - super funny!","review":"I thought The Nanny Diaries was very funny and realistic.

I would definately recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NANNY DAIRIES","review":"WONDERFUL!! EASY READING-KEEPS YOU SMILING AND AT TIMES GIVES YOU A GOOD LAUGH!!!!! I LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not funny","review":"Before I read this book I had the impression that it was lighthearted - kind of a \\"dish\\" about upper-crust parenting. I was wrong. It's a gripping page-turner, but a story that is very poignant and ultimately tragic. Poor-little-rich-boy Grayer is desperate for affection and attention from his self-centered, shallow parents. He takes what he can get from the series of nannies his mother hires, but he knows each will ultimately leave him to be replaced by another. This \\"fictional\\" family is unbelievably sad, but written by two former nannies, the story rings true. While \\"Nanny's\\" abuse at the hands of Mrs. X is often so outrageous as to be somewhat comical, it's Grayer's plight that stays in my mind. My heart aches for the Grayers of the world, many of whom are likely doomed to end up just like their pathetic, obviously unhappy parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanny gets walked on","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend who said it is super funny. I wasn't a big fan of this book because the main character never sets up boundaries with her employers and does whatever they want, whenever they want. With all the laws we have in place these days it's hard to believe that someone would put up with all of that, and in the end she never even stands up to the parents; that was a big letdown. Also her name is \\"Nan\\" or \\"Nanny\\" so that was pretty weird, I don't know why they didn't pick a more realistic name.It does have some funny parts and page turner parts, so I would still recommend it; I would just say it's pretty good & occasionally funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and cute","review":"The Nanny Diaries is a book about a college-aged girl who takes a job as a nanny for a rich New York family. The book is cute and entertaining. The main character, Nanny, is likeable and it is an enjoyable and quick read. Even her snotty boss, Mrs. X, is sometimes so pitiful and clueless that you can't help but feel sad for her. The book takes you through her time at this job and shows all of the ridiculous things that Nanny must do to try to please the ridiculous Mrs. X while trying to finish college and have a life of her own. I usually stick with classics, but this was a fun and guilty pleasure. It's good, light reading. I recommend it.P.S. The movie didn't do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It was a very well-told story; sad, funny and gripping.

What I can't stand is when reviewers give a 3 page synopsis of their opinion, hey people your not getting paid to do this, so give us all a break!!! There were some typo's in the text, and yes characters who leave alot to be desired. If you bought this book you have no reason to gripe! It is what it is, a story about obnoxious people who have too much money and the people who work for them and are treated like doggie do do. A fun read I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos!","review":"A great read for women! This is on the list of being a must read for all chick lit lovers.I bought this book over the summer and was doubtful that I would enjoy it, but I read it anyway. I LOVED it! I thought the plot was well thought out, and a little autobiographical.This book made me angry, laugh, and cry. As I parent I was appalled at how the rich \\"treat\\" their children, but not surprised. Kudos to the author for giving women a nice insight to how the other half lives (and treat their children)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing writing style","review":"McLaughlin's writing style is confusing, several times I had to re-read her sentences as one does not know who is speaking or if she is just thinking to herself.She should use quotation marks in a clearer manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a mom and former upper east side babysitter","review":"As a mom with 2 small children, I don't often have the luxury to read. I babysat in NY on the upper east side(different from Nanny, as I acted as a fill-in) during college. I laughed my way through this book, and stayed up to finish it in 1 sitting! One can recognize the parody of types, but people permeated with wealth often treat employees like a lower link on the food chain. I was approached in Central Park by several moms asking me to watch their offspring. I was a complete stranger pushing a stroller in Central Park and they were willing to entrust me with their child. This was an entertaining read and I doubt the truth had to be greatly stretched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go home and hug your kids...","review":"I finished this book in one day- It was THAT engrossing. But, unlike some of the other reviewers, I found this novel to be a heartbreaker. I have been thinking about little Grayer X all day; and while I found Nanny's plight regrettable, it was Grayer who had my sympathy.I don't know what self-respecting child development student would actually put up with the abuse that Mrs. X dishes out! Maybe a bit over the top at times, and maybe a little predictable (the \\"other woman\\"), The Nanny Diaries is definitely well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Read!!","review":"Ever wonder how different your childhood would be with millionaire parents? Before you start daydreaming, read this book and then decide if it is all you might think. A must-read for all those who are young-at-heart, this book will warm your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, witty, great book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it very quickly. The author's being former nannies, i know that the experiances of the main character are probably pretty true to life. someone remarked to me that it was kind of rude of the authors to write a book making fun of the kind of people they worked for, and despite the disclaimer, if these kind of people exist then they deserve it! This is a wonderful book, i really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo good!","review":"This book is hilariously entertaining with almost every page of outlandish demands from the Park Avenue \\"Mrs. X\\" for her son's \\"Nanny\\", but it's also hard not to feel sorry for all of the main characters. Depending on how you look at it, they all (including the Xes) have sad situations, money and luxuries aside. Sometimes I didn't know whether to hate the child's parents for neglecting their son and taking \\"Nanny\\" for granted or sympathize with them for not having the perfect marriage they try to emulate. Right or wrong, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is a great book that will make you laugh and maybe even cry. I would not suggest it for younger readers, though, because of some stronger language. But any book that can make me laugh out loud is definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can relate....being a former Nanny....","review":".....since I once worked in the incredibly damanding world of nannying I can completely relate to this book in more ways than I'd would like to admit. The writers do a great job bringing all of the complex aspects of this \\"career\\" into the book. One disappointment I have is the fact that I didn't come up with the idea of writing a book about my nanny experiences first! I suggest this book to anyone who would like to see how a somewhat typical \\"wealthy\\" Upper East side family lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used to be a nanny","review":"I loved it. I was a nanny, and none of the stuff that happened to these characters happened to me, but I still liked it. I can recommend it to anyone that asks me about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous read for anyone (not just nannies)...","review":"I found this book fabulous. There's no need to be a nanny, mother, or child care provider. I'm a father of a 14 month old and I found it amusing. Once I got started, I found it difficult to put down. The relationships developed in this book are priceless. The hidden agendas and the drama that surrounds the heroine of the story line are too extraordinary to believe. I writing style is perfect - humorous and captivating.This novel is very well written. From the development of the storyline to the absolutely hilarious descriptions of the people involved.The only problem I have with this book is the ending. I found it to be rather lacking. With as fabulous as the rest of the story was, the conclusion left me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"I hearrd this was really good ala Bridget Jones. It's not even in the same catagory. Kind of depressing really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I heard all the hype about this book and decided to buy it. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with what I read. You probably know by now what it's all about: a nanny taking care of a snobby NY family's 4-year-old, and all the (mis)adventures that happen along the way.All through the book, I kept thinking \\"Why doesn't she get out of there???\\" or at least \\"Why doesn't she tell these people off???\\" I didn't feel sorry for Nanny, nor did I think she was doing anything extraordinary. A college student should know well enough to get a better, well-paying, higher profile job than that. She never stands up for herself, and she ends up leaving in the wimpiest way possible.OK, it was funny at times, but it didn't really live up to all the hype that went along with it. Very disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guilty Pleasure!","review":"Reading this book was like finishing off a pint of Ben & Jerry's...deliciously wicked fun followed by sort of a sick, unsatisfied feeling.Like many other reviewers, I gobbled this book up in a few nights. I truly became engaged in Nan's mess: how to stop being treated like dirt without losing her job...and thus, leaving poor little Grayer without anyone to care for him. However, when I got to the end of the book, I felt unsatisfied. Perhaps it was because several questions were left unanswered or perhaps it was because there can be no feeling of satisfaction when there is no true resolution or redemption. Perhaps this was the authors' point. So, go ahead and indulge...it's an engaging read that is also suprisingly thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money could have been better spent elsewhere","review":"I purchased this book for light summer reading because of all the hype. Talk about LIGHT reading! The only thing really good about this book is its marketing and promotion. This book should have been rated as a teen book, but did not have enough real substance to make the reader turn the page. I finally saw why so many people are reading this book. Its so boring... but after paying for it you hate to not finish it (but your not in any hurry). Lets hope it pays for the girls college loans and I will consider the money as a donation to their college fund."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down....","review":"I would have given this book 5 star if it had ended better. I couldn't put the book down, but I was very disappointed in the ending. It seemed like they had to hurry up and end the story and gave it no thought. It really made me laugh at what some people think parenting is all about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Summer Read!","review":"This book is such a kick! It's a hilarious look at the day to day life of a Nanny for a (fictitious?) wealthy family of New York City. It's written and inspired by the experiences and observations of two (former) Nannies which really makes this book work so well! You will laugh out loud and also be appalled at how the wealthy interact with their children. It's a quick read that is PERFECT for Summer! If you liked \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" GET THIS, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very talented but true","review":"Could just call the authors original or talanted, but... Being at one point in my life a nanny for rich cannot agree more.You grow to love their kids and as soon as you inconvenience them you are discarded. In overall engaging book but mostly for those of us who had been there, nothing new though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nanny Diaries","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I have to say that it is definitely worth reading. However, I should caution you that, while it might be \\"hilarious\\" on the surface, partly due the the tone in which it is written, it is actually extremely sad-- though good-- novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book has been on my \\"reading list\\" for ages, but always \\"out\\" at the library. I seldom buy books, but spend much time at libraries. I finally purchased it at 30 percent off, and couldn't wait to read it. I am a prolific reader, and read all subjects, all authors. This book is just stupid, stupid, stupid. I am extremely disappointed. Sorry I wasted my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no tears from me!","review":"Reading this book made me feel like I should be feeling very sorry for poor \\"Nan\\" the nanny.... she has to work sooo hard, is unappreciated, and is asked to do things beyond the realm of pure child care (cook a dinner, run errands while Grayer is at his music lesson, etc.). And she only gets paid $12/hour, with no Christmas bonus!! And the employers have the nerve to question why she has not done anything beyond the ordinary in terms of child development (which is her major, after all).Sorry, this sob story didn't work with me. Nanny isn't working in a sweatshop, for crying out loud!Coupled with incomplete side story-lines (what's up with her dad and Collegiate?), one-dimensional characters (Harvard Hotty, the high school friend) - don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nanny Diaries","review":"This was a total waste of time--yes, about 5-6 hrs of my tinme actually, since i finished it in hopes that it would improve--The guy from Indiana had a very articulate review which i completely agree with--don't buy this book-i borrowed it from the library--As a mom who works full time and employs a nanny, I value her efforts more than any of my employees at the hospital where i work. Mr and Mrs. X are real losers, it's hard for me to believe anyone is this self centered, and harder to believe that \\"nanny\\" (the authors couldn't come upwith a name for her?) would continue to work for them. The reason being that she felt sorry for the dear little angel.I wonder, what was the point of this silly book.I'm amazed to see so many favorable reviews, if childcare workers out there are so mistreated, they need to move on to a better job---i believe many employers of nannies truly value their caregivers--I wouldn't bother reading this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun and breezy? No way","review":"Like many people, I bought this book expecting a comedy. But after reading the first chapter, I was deeply disturbed and wanted to return it. Now that I've finished it, I think I should have listened to my instincts.This book is almost unbearable to read for any mother who loves her child. Mrs. X is utterly without any redeeming qualities, which makes her unbelievable as a character. More like a monster. Are Park Avenue moms really like this? I'm sorry; I can't accept that. And the seething resentment Nanny has for her makes me not like Nanny much either. Must every character be so two-dimensional? Nanny good, Mommy bad.This book is marketed as a modern-day Mary Poppins. But in Mary Poppins, the neglectful parents eventually come around and learn to appreciate their children. If only the authors hadn't been so full of hate toward their former employers, they might have allowed the Xes a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better read Mary Poppins","review":"Of course this story could be real. But when you read it it doesn't say nothing. The way the nanny is treated by the kid and by her boss is pathetic. If you want to learn how to be a nanny, better read Mary Poppins than this one. It's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the money and the time for the movie, if you must","review":"I can see why this book has been made into a movie, the NYC setting, the glamorous scenes and possibly quite a few sweet little interactions between the nanny and the child. It can easily be the squeal of The Devil Wears Prada with a stroller, a screaming kid and far less likable adults.Sure, the book does keep you going, and the sentence \\"Impossible to put down\\" isn't untrue. But what's the point of this book when it wasn't even exactly a fun read?I honestly didn't expect much from this book but I also didn't expect that many pages filled with shallow descriptions, typical name-dropping and nearly everyone in the book sharing the same sarcasm.Please, save the few bucks on the movie if you must, at least the movie should be fewer than two hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"I could see how this book could be appealing to some, especially former or current Nannies. It's a fast read, parts of it are funny (I suppose), and parts of it were sad. Great beach blanket book for some! However, I found that personally, I didn't relate to Nanny, Grayer, Mr or Mrs X, or any of the characters in the book. I did not find that the book was \\"a page-turner\\" or particularly well written. And, finally, I didn't feel like I acheived anything when I completed the book. With most other books that I've read, I've felt a sense of completion that was lacking here. However, to be fair, I purchased the book thinking that it would be funny and sad, but mostly funny. Unlike the New York Times quote on the cover, I did not find this book to be \\"Diabolically Funny.\\" In fact, no part of this book made me laugh out loud or even smile. Serious or funny, the Nanny Diaries is my least favorite book that I've read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"A juvenile book about nothing.","review":"First of all, I admit I had moderate expectations for the book, thinking that the topic of being a nanny to the high and mighty might be pretty funny, or at least \\"so true.\\" But this book was a BIG disappointment - it was neither funny nor true. It tries so hard to be cute and smug, but the protagonist comes off as a giddy, witless college student, who wonders, just before a \\"big date,\\" if she's shaved that morning! Then, of course, there is the \\"intrigue\\" of the extramarital affair Mr X is having, but you sympathize so little for anyone in the book that you just don't care. The story here is so hackneyed and contrived, I can't believe the book made the best seller list. Don't waste your time. Keep your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, not that great","review":"This is one of the books that my mom got for me for my birthday, and it was the first I read, but I kept putting it down. It wasn't that the characters weren't interesting (they were, in a surface-level way) or the plot wasn't engaging (it was, in a, well, surface-level way), but I just kept thinking \\"why?\\" Why bother writing it at all? Except it's obviously made a lot of money, so that's a reason, too. Anyway, perhaps a good beach read, not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there","review":"I was never able to fully get into this book. I kept waiting for something to happen it seems like, and then nothing ever did. I hate how Nanny didn't have the balls to stand up for herself. Even after leaving the X's, she still didn't at least give the readers the satisfaction of revenge. The best part of the story was Harvard Hottie, and even that was underdeveloped. I was left very unsatisfied after reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a sad book...","review":"I am not sure how anyone could think of this tale as either funny or a light read. Sure, there are some scenarios that are so outrageous you cannot help but chuckle, especially in the beginning of the book, but honestly the last 1/3 of the book left me wanting to cry for that poor little boy. The scene where Nan leaves the beach house, with G wailing in the background wondering where she has gone, has haunted me. As a parent of small children, I can't bring myself to imagine how that poor child could recover from the systematic emotional abuse he suffers from his \\"parents.\\" It is obvious he loves N so much that to have her \\"abandon\\" him, as I'm sure this is how his parents would explain it, would be beyond cruel and heartless.I think the reviewers who portray this as a funny, light read are reading the surface of the book only, and must be disconnected from the heartbreaking life of that little boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny...for 30 pages","review":"This book was funny...for about 30 pages. But after that, the story of these self-centered, materialistic, and shallow people just became repetitive and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think the premise of this novel lends itself to a much smarter and funnier book than this turned out to be. I found it to be depressing and frustrating when I was expecting a light and funny read. While I don't doubt the depictions of the neglectful parents and their hollow lives, it got tiresome to read about the family piling more and more abuse on the nanny who continued to take it. The ending, although not surprising, was a let down and could have been much more satisfying.This book wasn't written particularly well. The characterizations were inconsistent and didn't ring true. I was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nanny Diaries","review":"The first chapter was brilliantly written, but then it took a giant nose dive. The story became redundant and the lack of descriptives did not help it, i had difficulty really imagining the characters and story's backdrop. The endless use of Mr.& Mrs X, Ms.Chicago and Nanny was just plain annoying. After awhile you just want this book to end. ( However,i did get tearful when Nanny was spending her last moments with Grayer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Funny","review":"As with many other reviewiers, I found this book much more sad than funny. I didn't enjoy watching the emotional torture of this young girl and little boy unfold. It was a quick read, but not particularly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu","review":"For anyone who has ever fallen in love with a child in their care, this is THE BOOK. \\"Nanny\\" comes from a priveleged background, but for some reason decides to undertake the strenuous and mind-numbing job of taking care of a neglected four year old boy. All her college courses cannot prepare her for becoming terribly attached to Grayer. She sees the injustices of his apathetic upbringing, and I found myself so often, while reading, exclaiming out loud. Having worked with upper middle-class children all my career, I saw many of my students in Grayer and his family. Nanny maintains her own counsel, though, and doesn't say a word to the people who pay her pittance of a salary. (The ear muffs blew me away) I would love to read more by these women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype and no plot makes \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" a bad read!","review":"First off, have the common sense to get books from the public library instead of forking over hard-earned bucks for [a book] like this. At 300+ pages, I figured I could finish this book in 3 days but after 100 pages, I knew it was horrible. Maybe it's because I'm a bit older than Nanny but regardless, who in their right mind lets themselves be treated repeatedly like garbage? I found myself screaming at this \\"child\\" to wake up! If this is based on their lives, then the authors have some serious life lessons to learn such as MYOB! Unless it's a family member or a very close friend, it's none of your business! And my personal favorite - three strikes and I'm out! I would have been long gone before the Halloween fiasco. But then, there wouldn't have been much of a story since that happened BEFORE page 100! Like I said, save your money and get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Although I found this book somewhat entertaining, it was not at all what I expected. Frankly I wanted to scream QUIT already. Nanny had absolutely no backbone. I was hoping she actually found the nerve to record the message at the end of the book, but again, that was only wishful thinking. Light easy summer read, but way too much hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get my reading time back?","review":"The book really amounts to very little, just a lot of negative gossip about New York's high society. Sure, that's clearly the fun of it; it's a little like spying. But the book is little more than a mean-spirited extended-play version of Town and Country's society pages. It's relatively well written (of course, as an editor, I know who you can probably thank for that) and not exactly painful, but I wish I'd saved my money--and my precious reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogged down by its writing style..","review":"The Nanny Diaries in theory was a really good idea--exposing the lives of insanely rich Manhattan socialites and their lack of care for their children, etc, and what they put their nannies through. The intro (about the first 5 pages) was perhaps the best part of the book, excellently executed with a style and grace lacking in the rest of the book. The rest of the book really isn't that bad, but the writing style drags it down. It is written almost like a teenage-girl would talk, and it gets incredibly annoying. You find the authors saying things like \\" OH my ..., there goes my Harvard HOTTIE! OMG he is so cute!\\" etc, and it just takes away from the story. This book could have really said something about this secret subculture of ignorant rich parents, but instead is ruined by its show of idiotic language."},{"rating":"1","title":"A study in masochism but a good read nonetheless","review":"Although I enjoyed the writing style used by the authors of \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" I was appalled by the plot. The book seemed to be a study in financial and emotional blackmail. I found Nanny (the main character)'s refusal to stand up for herself disappointing at best and saw her plight wholly of her own making. It was next to impossible for me to respect her, and that made it difficult to enjoy the book. I kept waiting for the book to get interesting, maybe take an unexpected turn, but it never did, the outcome was spelled out at the start. Bummer. Such potential for an interesting story that never got off the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, but touching","review":"It seems alot of readers found this book to be very funny. I didn't. I found it to be very sad. As a parent and child care provider, I felt deeply for poor little \\"Grover\\" who's affections were so manipulated by his mother and ignored by his father. I desperately wanted Nanny to tell Mrs. X to shove off, but loved her for not doing so for the child's sake. Though I was deeply moved by the story of Nanny and Grover's relationship, I found the story to be a troubling portryal of our society. A page turner that left me with much to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single-dimensional characters + lousy dialogue= 1 star","review":"I'm surprised that so many people love this book. Had the characters been multi-dimensional, I might have enjoyed it more. I quickly grew tired of reading about how completely evil Mr and Mrs X were and how perfect Nanny was. Every move the mother made was harsh and cruel, whereas Nanny's every touch was \\"gentle.\\" Puh-leeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a big let down","review":"I was so looking forward to this book. I love satire. I only laughed maybe one time. The rest of the time I was shocked by the poor writing, structure and character development. It was also just depressing. I think the authors have a motive of trying to get parents (wealthy or not, it isn't just the rich who supposedly ignore their kids) to love and spend more time with their children. While I wholeheartedly agree with them, 300 pages of bad writing and one dimensional characters is too tedious. The ending is terrible. The \\"Nanny\\" is so spineless, there is no one to root for here except maybe little Grayor. It's just totally depressing. (didn't I say that already?) Don't waste your time or money, instead, go spend some significant, quality time with a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"we all know someone like mrs x","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was funny and really rather sad. Any one who has sat on a playground with their child knows someone like Mrs. X. She's the one who thinks she is so envolved in her childs life but always seems to be at home resting while all the other Moms are sweating in the sun and running after her kid. you don't have to own the pent house to appreciate this poor child and the daily anguish that must take place in his little heart. Anyone who reads this book(especially a mom whos child does not eat steamed anything) is almost certain to have something to discuss at the water cooler,supermarket, or playground. By the way-if anyone has a tip on how to keep the tail of an oxford shirt in on a four year old,let me know.I'd love pass it along to my 19 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, unbelievable, disappointing ending","review":"I have to agree with the assessments that the neglect of the main child character, Grayer, is depressing. Even more disheartening, though, is that Nanny doesn't have enough backbone to stick up for herself OR her charge. I found it completely unbelievable that a educated person like Nanny, with a supportive family and friends, would put up with such shoddy treatment for $10/hr. I kept waiting for her to say something to Mrs. X about how unfairly she was treated and how unloving Mrs. X was to her son. You have to wade through 300 pages of drivel before Nanny finally stands up to the Xes... and then it's not even to them, but to their Nannycam! Sorry, but as a former NYer and NYU student, you have to have a lot more [gumption] than that just to survive in Manhattan. I found the whole thing ridiculous and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the Nanny Diaries down","review":"Given to me by a friend because I employ a part time Nanny, I was almost afraid to read what I might be doing wrong in the eyes of my Nanny. Quite the contrary - I was entertained enough to read it in 3 days!! The book is light-hearted and well written, but has enough substance to make you go \\"Hmmmm\\".It's a tale of Upper-Class career parents, who really shouldn't have a child and the often difficult relationships between the Nanny and the two of them.After I loaned it to my Nanny - to show her how lucky she was - she commented \\"I am glad you're not like Mr and Mrs X\\" :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure what the fuss is about","review":"I'm not sure why this book is so popular. The characters are all completely one dimensional--the narrator is perfect in her caretaking, has a perfect loving, appropriately quirky family, and a perfect, terrific boyfriend, while the family she works for has not a single redeaming quality. The neglect the child experiences at the hands of his family is sad, not funny, and the narrators \\"doormat\\" reaction to the abuses of her employer are infuriating and not funny. At the end, of course, she gets to sermonize about the importance of loving a child. Its a bit yucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful satire or a true story?","review":"I was a nanny several years ago for about 10 minutes. I couldn't take the ridiculous demands from the parents and the neglect for the children so I left the job and the profession. I never told anyone my stories and I forgot the entire incident, until I read this book. As unbelievable as Mrs. X's demands were, they rang true. Writing this book must have been cathartic for the authors and it is a real kick for the reader. The book won't change your life, but it is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it !!!!","review":"What a great book. As a mother of 5 children I tried to place myself on both \\"sides\\" of this book. I found it sad, funny, meaningful, and true. I wanted to reach out and help Grayer, but for one day I wanted to be Mrs X, if for nothing else then the \\"freedom\\" she had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, Sad and True","review":"After being a \\"nanny\\" for several years, for several wealthy families, I thought this book would be great therapy for me. I laughed out loud, I got really mad, and my heart was broken for the innocent victim (always the child) at the end. Couldn't put this book down at all, and enjoyed every part of it.I hope mothers, fathers, and caregivers, use this book as an important tool.Also, for the record, want to point out that not all upper-class families treat their \\"help\\" in the manner portrayed in this book. There are the rare exceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't think I would but I LOVED this book!","review":"When I first heard about this book, I thought it sounded just plain stupid. Who would want to read about NANNIES? But after reading a few reviews about it, I got curious what all the fuss was about --- once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I laughed, I cried, I ranted, I raved, I didn't want it to end.This isn't the type of book I would normally read but it was wonderful --- fun, fun, fun and extremely well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"hysterically funny and tragically sad","review":"I read this book at one sitting (staying up until 5am to finish it!). While it was really, really funny in many places, I kept reminding myself that it was actually very sad. I wish some of the moms out there who never spend time with their kids would read this and see themselves and be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"At times, heartbreaking","review":"I read this book in less than 2 days- I couldn't put it down. However, the thought that this story is based on true events, breaks my heart for those poor children. Surrounded by every possible material possession and parents who treat them like last year's Prada shoes. These people don't deserve children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun novel","review":"I would have given this 5 stars, but there were parts that drug along. Overall, it was an interesting and fun read, giving great insight into the world of the rich and famous who choose to ignore their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was pretty entertaining","review":"I read this book when I was camping and it was pretty entertaining. I would read another book by these author's if they write again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper than one might think","review":"I was prepared for comedy but found something deeper. There were hilarious moments, to be sure, but there was surprising depth and sadness in this novel. Perhaps my perspective is skewed as the mother of a small son--I can not imagine the cold neglectfulness of the rich women in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A staggering achievement, brilliantly enjoyable...","review":"An 'entertainment' in the highest sense of that much-exploited word, a surreal hallucinatory feast. Their inventiveness never flags. Two of the very few current writers whose works are attempts at the greater Bible, the 'bright book of life.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"Now that was a good book. I read the entire book in one sitting. Although the authors say this book is fiction, when really it's based on their days as nannies. It's disheartening to think that there are people out there like Mr. & Mrs. X. Horrible people. And you wonder why kids turn out poorly. One thing that made me really mad... Earmuffs. Those of you who read it know exactly what I mean.This book is for anyone. I have nothing but great things to say about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child abuse!","review":"Though I despised the \\"Xs\\"in this book, due to sorrow for \\"Grayer\\" and a facsination with what monstrous act the \\"Xs\\" would commit next, I could not get this book out of my hands - I read it straight through in an afternoon. What these mothers and fathers do to their childrent is child abuse. There are no other words for it. It was sickening the way the \\"Xs\\" treated people and animals in this book. The parents should not be allowed to procreate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book!","review":"I couldn't get beyond Mrs. X contining to take advantage of Nanny and Mrs. X's outrageous demands on Nanny to even care about Nanny or Grayer (child supposed to be cared for). Most of the book is Nanny complaining about Mrs X's demands then making up excuses about why she should accomodate them for Grayer's sake. By the end, I felt like Nanny deserved all the rotten treatment because she took it. Overall, I'm frustrated the book never got better & I wasted time reading it. I'll never waste my time reading another book by these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, especially if you're a New Yorker","review":"If you've ever walked through the Upper East Side and spotted a five year old dressed in his private school uniform carrying a lacrosse stick, you'll understand that people like the X'es really do exist. The people decked out in designer bests at Tiffany's and Bergdorf's and Barney's with their minority caretakers in tow walk the streets of Manhattan every day.This book was very funny. I started reading it last night and finished it tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"only mildly entertaining","review":"I found this book to be mildly entertaining at best. It was not well written, had an extremely weak plot, but did make me smile more than a few times, which made it worth a quick read. It was so fluffy, however, that after the first few chapters I was embarrassed to be seen reading it on the train. It amazes me the type of life experiences that people try to \\"cash-in\\" on."},{"rating":"2","title":"What its like to be a Nanny","review":"I haven't read the book yet but I did see the movie and now having read the reviews I am going to read both The Nanny Diaries and The Nanny Returns and I can't wait! I was a Nanny for over 3 years for a very prestigious family in Northern Florida and I am here to say that the horrors of this story are completely accurate no matter where you live be it NYC or Tallahassee. The condescention, passive agressive notes, lack of appreciation or simple human decency are all true. Additionally working in a preschool as a teacher is no different, just less money, more kids, and if possible less respect. All things considered I think the authors portrayl of the affluent American family is exceedingly accurate, all parents particurlay parents with Nannies should have to read these books. Although, I doubt they see comparison even if they did. All in all an excellent view of what it is really like to raise other peoples children."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel bad for children with parents like Mr. and Mrs. X","review":"Wow, well all I can say is that the only funny thing was the ridiculous-ness of it. The part that had me enraged the most was when Mrs. X suggested that Nanny and Grayer eat in the bathroom while she showed off the house.There were times I wanted to give Mrs. X a good hair pulling; I was hoping that Nanny would just rip into her. It must take a lot of patience and commitment to do a job like this. My heart goes out to the Nannies.It would be nice if there was a sequel to this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I read this in two days, which is a huge compliment from me, considering it sometimes takes me a month to finish a book because of how hectic life is. It makes you appreciate daycare/nannies and also aware of how much they are taken advantage of."},{"rating":"1","title":"the nanny in this book is a big loser with no self esteem","review":"I was apalled at what the nanny would put up with more than what the actual parents deigned to do or not do (as the case may be). She needed to get some balls and assert herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your 21 years old and hopelessly self-centered...","review":"Wow, how is it that this book made the best seller list? I'm glad I got a discount on the purchase, otherwise I would be mad that I paid full price. If the person reading is 21 and still in a sorority, she might enjoy this snotty book. But if you are like me, educated, intelligent and hard working, your going to have a tough time relating to the book. It is full of lines like \\"wow, those are Prada shoes\\" and \\"oh my god, that guy is so hot.\\" Wow, baseless and superficial. I don't feel for the characters, nor do I identify with them. I suppose others do, since it is on the best seller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Mediocre book. If the characters are going to be 2-dimensional, then the book should have some other redeeming quality but instead it is cliche-ridden and about as well written as a grocery list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting insights, but not smoothly written","review":"Although Nan and Grayer's plights rang true, I was not drawn into the story at all. I could not follow all brand names of foreign and domestic foods dropped, and found the prose and storyline rather 'clunky.' The book is not 'hilarious.'Perhaps I had expected more from all the hype in the reviews I found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun read","review":"This look into the lives of the upper-crust of society, their \\"trophy\\" kids, and the nannies who raise the kids is a humorous and sad story. Some of the scenes and events are a little outrageous, but it's just to show how unbelievably demanding and unreasonable these rich parents can be. It was grand fun (and sometimes very frustrating) to read about the snobby rich people who are ultimately all unhappy and makes me feel thankful I'm not one of them. The plight of the underloved children is sad to read about. But mostly it was a fascinating and laughable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!!!","review":"\\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is a easy to read, easy to get into, and easy to love book. It was also hard to put down, my son literally ripped it out of my hand!I laughed, I cried, I overall had an awesome time reading it. It was a perfect summer read.Thank you and kudos to the authors for such an outstanding job on their first novel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner!","review":"This book was just so good! I couldn't put it down and I have a 9 week old baby, but I managed to find time to finish it in about 3 days. It made me cry at the end and very few books have ever done that. I was so sad for Grayer, who got attached to nannies and his parents sent them away. I also cried for Nanny, who loved Grayer and would never see him again. And I cried for all the little children who are actually living lives like that. This book is a fast read, very entertaining, funny, maddening, heart wrenching.... I could go on and on... but just read it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Waitressing Nanny-o","review":"The first 100 pages kept me mildly amused and admittedly, it was a page turner for those. And then, it just seemed incredibly trite and devoid of any real character development. I think that if a person *really* likes this book he/she is not terribly bright. I know, ouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected funny, heartbreaking too","review":"I'd heard a lot of hype about this book and I expected to like it for its satire, humor, and dish on the \\"upper classes\\"--I wasn't prepared for the degree to which I thought about this book after finishing it. Even beyond the outrage at the entitlement of \\"Mrs. X\\", I was heartbroken by the portrayal of this pawn of a child and the way he was unable to be protected by the one person who truly cared for him. Although I wouldn't necessarily consider this book a classic, I do think the authors did an admirable job of highlighting the conundrum of being a caregiver in a situation where you have little final power to protect your charge. As a developmentalist and child care advocate, I commend the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very sad...","review":"This book was purported to be very funny and light-heartedly entertaining. It wasn't.It was a sad commentary on those people who birth children and then proceed to neglect them for the next 16 or 17 years. This is all about a nanny and how she interacts with the family she works for. The little boy is very adequately drawn, with his sadness palpable. The nanny and her interactions with him seem to only illustrate his parents lack of interest and affection for their son. (He eats in the bathroom, so he won't mess up the rug... Good parenting skills...)There were very few scenes in this book that were funny or even mildly entertaining. There is, of course, a romantic interest for \\"Nanny\\". This is only vaguely touched on and never fully explored. For a comedy, this book is a real downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER received this book. I was charged for it, but it did not arrive.","review":"NEVER received this book. I was charged for it, but it did not arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Couldn't even make it through the first chapter","review":"Horrible writing style and so BLAH. Why couldn't the authors come up with better names for the characters than \\"Nanny\\" (wow, that's original) and the X family. Come on. Like one other reader said, an insult to my intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Nannies: saints, moms: sinners. I get it. What I don't get is what all the hoopla is about. Merely a self congratulatory story about the fabulousness of the main character. And if she is so talented, compassionate and affluent, why is she doing this kind of work to begin with?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if they name-dropped a little more......","review":"So, I don't live in NYC. I don't even shop in NYC. But goodness gracious, could these authors name-dropped a little more?! What did it add to the story, really? Did the mother's Fendi bag or Gucci shoes really add to the story? NO! And for me, it became more annoying than anything!I found the story sad. Some of the reviewers said it was hilarious...where? I don't think I laughed even once!I felt sorry for poor Grayer. I didn't feel sorry for Nanny...who would stay in that situation, really?Save your money, buy something else. Sorry, not recommended from this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"nanny diaries; incident of the dog.","review":"Both of these items were shipped to the wtrong address. I called and received no support. Dissapointed with Amazon. ( they went to my son in Iraq who as a Navy pilot does not have any interest in the Nanny Diaries!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This book wasn't funny, insightful or even vaguely enjoyable. I was hoping for a humorous look into the upper crust world of nannying- instead I got a poorly written, utterly depressing story about a child that is completely neglected by his parents.ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother Theresa Would Have Belted Her for Being a Doormat","review":"A predictable tale populated by stick figures so shallow, and so binary in their boundless goodness or unbridled horridness, that it makes the characters of TV nadirs like Dallas and Bay Watch seem like the deeply-nuanced creations of 19th century literary masters. The heroic martyr in the middle is of course our narrator the nanny. Her unshakable loyalty to her little charge, and resulting tolerance for comedic levels of exploitation by his vile parents, makes the protagonist of Uncle Tom's Cabin seem like a hotheaded gangsta rapper by comparison.My own experience with nannies has sadly been limited to that of the willful little brat under surveillance, as by the time my own progeny came on the scene the family fortunes had deteriorated enough as to make the help of forbearing young saints like McLaughlin and Kraus unaffordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously depressing and demeaning....","review":"I really thought this was going to be a great book I'd enjoy. It was so incredibly frustrating and depressing. The main character is so willing to sacrifice her happiness for this family, that abuses her and doesn't even appreciate her hard work. All they do is demand more and treat her like a slave! It makes you feel like shaking her and saying \\"wake-up! why are you putting up with this?\\" Reading the book, you just think - she will finally snap and stand up for herself, but she doesn't! Reading about the parents completly disfunctional relationship with each other and complete lack of relationship with their son, is really very sad.I did not find this book funny, I found it infuriating and depressing... Save your time and read something else - anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, inadvertent chariciture of itself","review":"I am surprised this book is so popular when the plot is non-existent and the characters are soooo uni-dimensional. The writing, like it's characters, has NO depth. The main character is the only one with a personality, but they forgot to give her a backbone. I recognize she was struggling with her role as a nanny, but her passivity was a turn-off --not an example of her dedication to her job. The ending is beyond bad. I can't believe that was ok'ed by an editor!!! It's as if the authors got tired of their own story--so did I. I kept reading hoping it would improve, but no luck. don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten to the core","review":"This book can be summed up in one sentence: Spoiled, rich kids complaining about their jobs working for spoiled rich parents. The purpose for this book is so transparent: You can almost hear the authors saying, \\"Let's get rich by keeping a little notebook on everything bad our bosses do, and paint those incidents in the worst possible light. Think how many books we can sell by making them out to be monsters.\\" The authors' smug and sanctimonious attitude does nothing to hide the real point of the book: They were absolutely horrendous employees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast food for the urban brain","review":"I find it hard to resist books set in New York City, let alone books set in my own neighborhood. This one started well, but by the end, the authors' ability to trigger vicarious glee and \\"shock\\" at the antics of insensitive rich people and the too-good-for-her-own-good heroine wore off. After 50 or so funny pages, the book becomes boring and predictable. This is exactly the right book to read while doing something else--getting a pedicure, on the treadmill, at the beach. If it gets left behind before you finish, you won't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At best, this books reads like the novelization of a TV show. Of course, you might want to wait until this book is actually made into a TV show since that's the next step for \\"The Nanny Diaries.\\"This book is terribly written and not much better than something out of a high school creative writing class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"The authors definitely hit a nerve with the timing of this book. We're always looking for new and different ways to expose the foibles and shortcomings of the super-rich. The book offers a unique look into this world, but I mostly found it to be poorly written. It's no better than the type of prose one might read in the typical creative writing class. Save yourself the money and borrow this one from a friend or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanny should get a life","review":"I remember when I was in my early 20s and allowed so many people to walk all over me, having no self-esteem to stand up for myself. Really didn't care to re-live that experience, but in reading \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" this is exactly what \\"Nanny\\" allows her employers to do to her. She's continually amazed at the horrible way they treat her/their child/each other throughout the book, however, she continues working for them until she is (no surprise) sacked like her predecesor. I read the book in just a couple days, waiting for more depth to the story but was disappointed. Reading it left me in a bad mood for several days. An okay summer read, but I don't necessarily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I think the writing is really bad. It was very choppy and just didn't flow well. I am very detail oriented and some of the sentences just didn't make sense to me and I would re-read them and think, \\"What the hell is this??\\" I thought the idea was great and the characters were well portrayed but I just didn't think the writing was good. I don't see what the hype was all about but then again, I feel like it was one of the first books that began the \\"chick-lit era.\\", (which I love). If the subject was written about today...it would be old news. But that happens a lot with chick-lit unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like doormats....","review":"Just like the shopaholic series, another predictable book about a woman who has no spine. What is with these books, and why are they so popular? On the upside, mildly interesting and engaging, but \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" is a much better pick. Female authors: how about some strong female characters who know how to stand up for themselves? No woman in her right mind -- fictional or real-- would put up with the BS in this novel.I had the audio CD, which has arguably the worst reading ever by Julia Roberts, who can't read her way out of a paper bag. The Salvadoran Nanny is read with a Japanese accent, the Maid's voice seems to vacilate between Spanish Harlem Chica and South Side Chicago Soul Sister. Laughable and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read, entertaining but sad at the same time...","review":"This is a good book. It is not the best written book there is, but it is an easy read and gives a very eye-opening look into the lives of some very wealthy New Yorkers. I found myself wondering how much of it is based on reality, because you hope that much of it is fiction as your heart breaks for little Grayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy","review":"If you're in the mood for a breezy, fluffy book that mentions Prada and Hermes and Tiffany's every other page, this is for you. The authors aren't stupid; it's not poorly written, nor boring. Well, okay, it does get boring after 100 pages or so of the same thing. 300 pages = too much.I'm a New Yorker and the references are familiar and were fun at the start. The revenge factor was, in its evil way, fun too. Then I started to feel sorry for the real children whose nannies these were, who will one day read this. Also, just me - I like a book at least to say something about something, even if it is breezy reading.Take this one to the beach, or wherever, and space out - you'll finish in a couple of days and be no different for the experience... just perhaps able to recognize a greater amount of expensive brand names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Diabolically funny at all","review":"I enjoyed reading this, but found it to be a remarkably sad commentary on disfunctional families, more than a satirical pastiche of nanny life. I'm not sure I would read it again, and I'm not sure that I would recommend others read it if you're looking for some dark comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but True...","review":"Coming from a one-time NYC babysitter/ Columbia U. student, I must admit that some parents were kind of loopy. Some of the stories were a bit extreme but not out of the ball park. I thought the book was well written, witty and amusing. It is like brain candy... fun, indulgent and probably not very (intellectually) good for you. Yes, the main character was a bit shallow and did a lot of wallowing for money but remember she was young and a student on a college budget, not a easy position to be reasonable and logical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really great....","review":"There is really nothing great about this book. It's a quick read, partly due to the fact that I skipped through half of the words and yet I don't think I missed anything. I don't recommend buying this book, but it's a good mindless read. definately borrow it from someone or get it from the library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading, although it made me sad","review":"If you have kids, you'll love the anecdotes, but be prepared to be disturbed by the treatment of poor little Grayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a bad accident, it's hard to turn away","review":"This book was a page-turner and I enjoyed getting a bird's-eye view into the secret lives of well-heeled NY socialites. However, as a working parent who has hired nannies, I found that the book punctuates a sad statement about today's parenting and how we treat those who care for our cherished children. The authors make many overt and subtle comments about societal values.Yes, you will laugh at Nan's many passages but, overwhelmingly my heart went out to the child character in this family. Forget the Nanny, forget the X's, forget the endless lessons and schools...what happens with these neglected children? Remember, the story was inspired by real experiences.I like Nan's story which was at times funny in absurd way but, it was eclipsed by the sadness I felt about the way those situations are apt to turn out. You'll go home and hug your child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"journal of complaints","review":"This was like reading the journal of complaints from a college student's summer job. Anticipating humor, I was only dissappointed to find what I felt was a weakly developed main character that lacked maturity and had an over rated value of herself. The name dropping of expensive or exclusive became boring. The final result was disgust with the employers as well as the myopic employee."},{"rating":"1","title":"child abuse","review":"anyone who says this book is funny has a completely warped sense of humor. This is page after page of the cruel torment of an innocent four year old boy by a couple of hateful narcissists (his parents) and an underhanded, sanctimonious passive-aggressive white girl (the nanny). There's nothing funny about these totally awful people or the plight of Grayer, the kid. By the end of the book, I wanted all the adults in the book dead (except for the guy from Harvard, who could perhaps end up with custody of Grayer and they'd live happily ever after). This book [stinks]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsympathetic Character, Uncreative Writing","review":"A beautiful upper middle-class NYU senior who will undoubtedly marry wealth and power and who will have a glamorous successful life decides to work part-time as a nanny for a family who probably lives two blocks north on the Upper East Side from where she grew up. First, this protagonist, with the decidedly banal name of \\"Nan\\" as in \\"Nanny,\\" happens to be neither sympathetic nor interesting, and I could care less if she nails her Harvard Hottie or if she can have a good morning's beauty sleep without being summoned by Mrs. X, the decidedly banal name of her employer. Written by two young beautiful supremely confident women, the protagonist is so completely self-obsessed, incapable of either doubt or reflection. The most annoying thing about the book is that it's supposed to be black satire but has been inundated with so much American saccharine feel-good wholesomeness that it tastes so sweet as to be bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"This was a depressing novel, if maybe close to the truth in some instances. This is shallow and superficial. I like to read 'chic lit' for entertainment, not for reality and not to be depressed. Don't waste your money, or more important, your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but there are better.","review":"I would have given this book two and a half stars, because that's what this book is -- average. The Nanny Diaries is readable and hard to put down, but it isn't particularly well-written or funny. It's okay, but there are better Chick Lit books out there. Pick up the Bridget Jones books, if you haven't already. Those are funny and they're not the least bit pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave Up","review":"Halfway through the book, I gave up. There was nothing in it for me. I'd already been exposed to the rich-people-in-the-city stereotype so there was nothing new or humorous about this book.I don't understand the hype at all. But then, I couldn't understand the hype over Bridget Jones' Diary, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it immensely","review":"I could totally identify with the main character and her struggles as a working college student with a bad roommate. The X family was fun to hate with their upperclass attitudes and feelings on children. While there were no car chases or explosions, this story provided an interesting character study of a young woman's struggles to find her way.If you aren't into that kind of thing...don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So realistic!!!","review":"I really liked this book because it is just the truth!! I am an expert babysitter and i can relate!! I have been babysitting for many different families full time and i found myself laughing when i realised how close to the reality what the author was describing was!!It is a fun book to read and i recommend it especially to people who like me suffered from babysitting for some CRAAZY people!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very well written, but disturbing","review":"I enjoyed this book. The people became real to me. However, being a mom of three children, one a little boy who loves to play with trains with his daddy; it really tore me up inside. I don't know if I would be able to suggest to someone else simply for the fact of how awful to have children for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Or, \\"How to Torture Your Husband\\"","review":"What better way to inflict pain (in classic Woodstock generation passive-aggressive style) than by withholding care and affection and substituting a disinterested third party into the relationship? There is absolutely no question as to the real villain of this piece. The central character spends most of her time trying not to be the screen on which the displaced desires of this sick family are projected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Book!!","review":"I could not put this book down. McLaughlin and Kraus do an excellent job of making the reader feel as if they are right there with the main character, experiencing every emotion as she rides the \\"Nanny\\" emotional roller coaster. You gain a whole new appreciation for your own family and feel that maybe, they are not as dysfunctional as they may seem."},{"rating":"2","title":"These people do exist!","review":"This book realistically captures the \\"High Rent\\" lifestyle of the New York rich-or for that matter the upper crust across the country. I will qualify this by saying that all the rich are not like the characters depicted in the book, but there are some underlying similarities. The young women in this book tries desparately to give some semblence of normalicy to the young boy in the book. His parents are too busy or uninterested to take any special notice of him-except what he will be wearing when he plays with other children. She basically ends up being an indentured servant dealing with unrealistic requests from the spoiled parents. I know some people like Mrs. X in the book who go from massage appointments, to nail appointments to luncheons, but they treat their children much better. I am glad that the book was not too life-like.I loved this book. You can tell by the authors' refrences that hey are very familiar with their subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled The Doormat Diaries","review":"This is a good book to read while you are commuting or on the beach. However, I found none of the characters sympathetic and Nanny was the most pathetic character of them all. If they write a sequel, I hope Nanny will develop a backbone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooting for the NANNIES!","review":"Although this may be considered 'light reading' for a lot of people, it is an extremely well-written novel. Yeah, the plot and characters are a little out there, but DUH, that's the point (it's called SATIRE people!).The Nanny Diaries is sometimes poignant, often funny look at how humans, in general, seem to lose track of what's really important in life. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of a Co-dependent Martyr","review":"I absolutely hated this book. Oh sure, it was an easy, fast read, but the story was awful. How depressing! About how a wealthy Madison Avenue family mis-treats their child along with everyone else who works for them (particularly the Nanny). One would hope for revenge in the end but there is none. This book was a huge, aggravating, disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste your time doing something else","review":"I heard this book on tape during one of my long drives . It was truly terrible. A very whiny book, with frankly not a very good story. For anybody who has lived in New York or in any major city none of the \\"shocking\\" aspects of how rich people live are very interesting. The themes keep on repeating themselves over and over. The character has no backbone. Amazing that this book can be a best seller. At least I got it at the public library for free. I would have kicked myself if I would have spent the money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrarted","review":"I am embarassed to admit that I read this book. I found the narrator and key characters to be incredibly boring and I felt absolutely no sympathy for her. Anyone that allows themself to be treated as such deserves no sympathy. The problems were ridiculous and the charachters were over generalized and shallow. The ending was terrible and the girls who wrote this book lucked out by cashing out - they'll clearly need the money as they don't seem bright enough to do much else. Maybe they can go back to nannying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated!","review":"I took this book on vacation with me expecting to read a fun and mindless book. It was mindless that's for sure! I kept waiting for something exciting to happen...but it never did. I got the point, the rich folks never take care of their kids, the nanny always did, the nanny was treated as less than human...but give me more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Wonderful Book","review":"I selected this book after reading a memoir with a very difficult subject matter. I didn't expect this to be a great novel. I just wanted something light to read. I even checked it out of the library instead of purchasing it at the bookstore. The first few pages with their wonderful wit immediately drew me in. I was hooked and could not put it down. My husband and daughter kept trying to keep me away from it, but I just couldn't stop reading. I grew feelings for Nanny and the little boy. I would find myself angry, then sad, then laughing out loud. I didn't want it to end. It's a wonderful book. I have recommended it to all of my friends and haven't received bad feedback yet. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I liked this book but I did find it sad and depressing. Nanny put up with alot of stress and took on more responsibility then she should oh had to. The family that she worked for definitly was abnormal. The mother, Mrs. X, didn't spend any time with her son, Grover, and the father, Mr. X, was never home. Mrs. X thought that they were a happy family and that this was the norm, meanwhile Mr. X was cheating on Mrs. X with Ms. Chicago. As their marriage fell apart, so did Nanny's job. My favorite part in the book was the end when Nanny went back to the house and left a message for the X's. After reading the book I would say that it was good but not one of the best books that I have read. I felt bad most of the time for Nanny that she was stuck in the middle of all of this drama. I would give this book 4 stars because although it was not the best book I've read it was still good and very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I read it earlier this year and loaned it to two of my friends who also loved it. I really couldn't put it down! I am usually a Patricia Cornwell, thriller, mystery type. So this was a nice little change, although I was constantly frustrated with the nanny character, she was too nice!! I would have smacked Grayers mother!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking","review":"While I found this book difficult to put down, I disagree entirely with reviewers who find this to be a funny story. I find it tragic. What is funny about child neglect, rude behavior, and abusive treatment. My heart ached throughout this book for that sweet 4 year old boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wahhh! I'll show you!","review":"...The basic writing itself isn't bad, but so many of the characters are flat and there are too many loose ends in this book. It tries to have an element of romance-- or does the Nanny just want a romp in the hay? What was the deal with her Dad and the school? Where did THAT come from? And the ending is so depressing. Sorry, I just didn't feel any empathy with the Nanny at all. She should have listened to her mother. Seems like Nanny wanted the prestige of being a nanny to Somebody, was after the great money. After all, what else was the payoff for her to stay in the position? The only thing we seemed to have in common was the pity for the child. But she stayed so long, she let the kid come to love her, when she knew she'd be out on her ear sooner or later.Now, where did the hilarious part of it come in?But the PR firm and agent did a good job. I was suckered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"What a disapointing book! If you want to read about a self-satisfied little miss and her escapades in babysitting go ahead.

Not a book I'd recommend to my best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nanny Diaries","review":"Just notice that \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is on the list of top-selling books this year, so I wonder what's wrong with Americans' taste... maybe the title of the book kind of seduced readers; or dull character, sloppy story, wrinkled prose make the readers trying hard keeping reading, trying hard to see if there is indeed anything in the book worth anything, keep it until the end of book disappointed or far beyond disappointed 'cause nothing worth it... A piece of junk book, don't quite understand what's up with Americans' taste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"kublai khan give me a large break","review":"Perhaps you can crawl out from under the rest of the \\"novels'\\" you read to realize that the people who don't like this book feel that way because it is ****badly****** written, not because of the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with the unabridged version!","review":"When I decided to try this book I went with the abridged audio version, just because it would be easier to get through. I enjoyed it. Then I noticed people and events mentioned in the other reviews I didn't recall from the story. I decided to see how the novel itself differed. Major Difference! Significant parts of the story were omitted from the audio version. Characters and events that really added to the story were just not there. I Don't know how much the abridged version differs from the unabridged version with other novels, but in this case it is best to get the whole story. It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fast Read","review":"I was up til 3 am finishing this book. If you have ever lived in ny you will relate to this book or at least find it funny.

I did get some of that, but for every pound of dish I got 10 pounds of fairly dull story line.I did not find the book that funny, and \\"Nan\\" seems depressed and has a negative perspective on just about everything. Her life doesn't seem fun or interesting, and reading about it definitely wasn't, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmless fluff... if you can spare a few hours of your life","review":"I know modern day novels are no longer trying to be the next Great American Novel, but this is just painful. If you're too old to be caught reading Sweet Valley High but you still want that adolescent \\"ohmygosh-he's-dreamy-even-though-there-are-really-very-few-washed-out-details,\\" well, this is the book for you. The main character, \\"Nanny,\\" is the most generic girl you could dream for: responsible, caring, fun, always doing good but still pining for the cute guy she saw on the elevator. That sums her up completely, and the feeling you have for her now is the same that you will have at the end of the book, which is to say, not much. That's better than the other characters, regardless of how realistic they may have been intended; you won't even feel very badly about the boy, although Nanny spends the entire book trying to save his soul. You will however, feel relief that it ends, and by that, I mean, the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooooooring!","review":"I love to read just about everything but was disapointed by this novel. Unfortunately I couldn't even get half way through the book because it was so boring. I am surprised by the popularity of this book but maybe I missed something. I regret that I paid full price for it! I wish I would have bought the book used or just borrowed it from someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated.","review":"I have 2 small kids and a nanny and babysat myself for years - a sister gave me this book thinking I'd get a few laughs. I couldn't relate to any of it. Where I live, people bend over backwards for nannies who are dedicated and loving because replacements are so hard to find. And the X's fire supernannies in droves because they do things like feed Grayer a muffin in the park? This is simply unbelievable. Nanny's willingness to put up with such dehumanizing treatment is exasperating. I find it hard to believe that this book has garnered such popularity - even the authors' descriptions of 4-year-old Grayer's behavior is totally out-of-sync with reality. Grayer is sometimes 4, sometimes 1, and sometimes 14 in this book. There are much better uses of one's time than reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I admit it, I bought this book because of all the hype. And I read it all hoping it would redeem itself.It didn't. Nanny is annoying and Mr. & Mrs. X should be put out of their misery. Grayer was the only endearing character in the whole book. Why would Nan continue to put up with the rotten antics of Mrs.X - a persona I hope I never meet in my life...what a waste of oxygen. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of literary junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seattle heavy grunge at its absolute best","review":"For people who like the driving guitar/bass lines and angst-ridden vocals of such bands as Soundgarden, Corrosion of Conformity, or (early) Alice in Chains, this album is a must.

It definitely is a Christmas blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but terribly inaccurate","review":"I'm very disappointed in this product. Its beautiful to look at but is extremely slow to react. On a day where the real temp varies from 40 to 70 this thing will never move lower than 50 or higher than 60 and will always be at least 10 degrees behind the real temperature movement, sometimes 15 or 20 depending on the day. The actual mechanism is trapped behind the very heavy terra cotta facia and never really sees the true temperature of the day. Great decor, lousy thermometer. I'm going back to my ugly but accurate mercury thermometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best red nail polish","review":"This is the perfect shade of red. I'm so glad I found this on Amazone.

As A matter of fact I'm junking it the first chance I get. It has a bunch of kids singing. It's geared for 4 year olds or even younger. It's definately a kids CD. I thought it would be like Spider-Man Rock Reflections or Pryde of the X-Men. They put a Spider-Man out as well Don't get that one either!!!!!! I am a adult and made a fatal mistake in getting this.

Let It Be, Yellow Submarine, Eleanor Rigby, and Yesterday to be precise. To think I had not heard of Hey Jude, or any of the other wonderful songs on this album! They were bound to be good. I mean, they were all number one hits after all. This CD has made me a huge Beatles fan. I'm sure it will make others too. I've listened to other songs by The Beatles not included in this album too.

Twenty seven universally recognized number one hits from the biggest band of their time. All of these songs have stood the test of time, and if some of the earlier ones are less sophisticated and elaborate than their younger siblings, it is because the band members were less sophisticated or ambitious. They simply wanted to be the best band on the planet. And by the end of their legendary run, they simply were.And by the way, the CD clocks in at just under eighty minutes, so this is a tremendous value. If you don't already own it, buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe not the best representation","review":"OK upon reading other reviews this CD may not be up to par as a selling point but as an album it does rate well. even if it doesn't have all the cuts from all the albums that would have made the top ten.as a former musician I know what sounds good and what doesn't.This does and also takes us all back to when rock rock n roll was king before rap,newage,ect.every generation has music that represents it.this just happens to be from mine among many others.if you don't like rock then maybe theres another interest for you,maybe it doesn't still rock as well as the stones but I still think its good music like so many others from the era.to each their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"27 TERRIFIC SONGS","review":"THE BEATLES WERE AMONGST THE GREATEST GROUPS AND MADE EXCELLENT SONGS LIKE PINK FLOYD,LED ZEPPELIN AND THE WHO.ANYONE WHO HATES THE BEATLES IS A DISGRACE TO SOCIETY.EACH AND EVERY SONG IS A MASTERPIECE.BUY THIS BUT AVOID ALBUMS FROM NIRVANA WHO SUCK BIG TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY GOOD","review":"WELL,ENOUGH OF THE STUPID IDIOTS WHO HATE GREAT BANDS LIKE THE BEATLES,LED ZEPPELIN AND THE ROLLING STONES.The Beatles are amongst the greatest,best and a classic band of all time.And this compilation contains gems like A hard day's night,from me to you,we can work it out and more.You got to have this in your cd collection.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWERS AND AVOID ALBUMS FROM OVERRATED CRAPPY BANDS LIKE GREEN DAY,NIRVANA AND FOREIGNER."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Beatles Chronology","review":"The best thing about this collection, when it came out several years ago, was that it was the first time that anyone had thought to chronicle the Beatles #1 Hits in the appropriate order. As such, this is a wonderful way to introduce young people to the Beatles. Even though all of their recorded work is terrific, their albums vary in mood and genre. This release, though, allows the listener to glean what a monster the Beatles were for the, approximately, eight years that they were together, making hit records that changed the face of modern music. Personally, I never was a real big fan of the early pop singles, so, for me, this collection starts with \\"Eight Days a Week\\" to the conclusion of \\"Lady Madonna.\\" Even for true fans, this is a unique set because of how it was put together, but more important, it is a lesson in 60's pop rock for the uninitiated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal If There Ever Was One","review":"After buying and then listening to the Beatles' \\"1\\" CD five years ago, I began to purchase Beatles DVDs, CDs, books, etc. I now own all of the 13 UK releases+all the official movies+several Beatles box sets. \\"1\\" showcases the Beatles' awesome musicianship in a nutshell. But it only serves as an introduction to their incredible story. This CD is highly recommendable for any music fan. It might be the best release I've ever heard. But all 13 of their releases (take away the original Yellow Submarine soundtrack) are pure magic. This CD turned me into a Beatlemaniac, even though I wasn't even born when they broke up. I would recommend all their work, but \\"1\\" is the perfect album. It's amazing that it's 40+ years later, and they still had a #1 album called \\"1\\" that sold over 10 million albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good songs on just one CD","review":"I was born in 1959, so the Beatles were on the radio every time I turned it on for 20 years. I have a pen pal on line, and although he is an adult, he is young enough to be my son. He has NEVER heard Beatles. He says his dad has heard OF them, but no one knows what they sound like. This album is perfect to send to them: lots of songs, every song a hit, and it has early and later songs. I can't hardly wait to mail this to his family. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection","review":"A great collection (27 songs) for the price. I guess there are different interpretations of what makes a number one song (on which lists?), but I figured that Please Please Me and Do You Want To Know A Secret would have been included. But I guess it wasn't possible to include everything. Nonetheless, it's a nice selection of most of their well-known songs and the sound is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"The remastering and sound on this album is TERRIBLE.

Best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles are great, but Elv1s is simply the best!","review":"Well, the Beatles are simpy the best as a group, but Elv1s is simply the best when it comes to music!It's simle as this Elv1s 30 #1 Hits is better than Beatles 27 #1 Hits combined!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beat(le)ing a Dead Horse","review":"Let's face it. If you don't have all these songs already, you probably don't like music. But if you buy this CD, which is essentially the record company's mix tape of \\"everybody's favorite\\" Beatles songs, you probably still don't like music. These are songs that most everyone can sing from memory. Why Capitol decided we needed yet another collection of Beatles hits is a mystery to me. Oh wait, I figured it out...THEY DID IT FOR THE MONEY. Why would you even consider buying this rubbish? Save your money and buy the original albums. Or better still, buy something new, by a new band, who need the money far more than Sir Paul, George or Ringo ever will. If Lennon was alive he'd tell you the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles 1 Star","review":"\\"If you don't own this album, then you don't own any music.\\" What an arrogant nonsensical response.

If you want to listen to music with soul and transcendant beauty you wont find it on this cd . You should check out \\" SUNRISE \\" or \\" MEMORIES- THE 68 COMEBACK SPECIAL\\" by Elvis Presley . Now he was COOL !!!.Other artists with wonderful voices and soul you could check out are Tom Jones , Stevie Wonder , Mahalia Jackson and George Michael. The Beatles could have been better if they had good singing voices.All their song writing and production skills couldnt make up for the fact that they had soulless voices. Give em a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally Good","review":"I think the songs they chose for this CD were good except there is one dissapointment: THEY DID NOT PUT LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS ON IT. That is my favorite Beatles song. Also, they put too many of the early songs on it and not enough of the psychadelic songs, which I like better. Oh well, it's still a good CD and does have a lot of good songs on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"This album doesn't contain Strawberry Fields Forever, I Am The Walrus, or A Day In The Life. Full stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"POINTLESS","review":"The band Crowded House had a lyric in a song a few years ago that said something about \\"trying to catch the deluge in a paper cup\\", and that's what this CD reminds me of. Any attempt to distill the essence of the Beatles on a single-disc \\"greatest hits\\"-type thing is to do everyone a great disservice. Trust me folks: the Beatles experience must be heard in its entirety or you're gonna be missing a whole lot of magic.

Don't listen tothe morons who love Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Beatles, and LedZeppelin who suck!!! Dire Straits are really great. And get anyGuns N' Roses CD insted of The Beatles.

And I just don't get it why people like THE BEATLES so much. 25 LAME SONGS....AND TWO GOOD SONGS AND THE GOOD SONGS ARE HEY JUDE (WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS EVER), AND BALLADOF JOHN AND YOKO.

Now that is a true artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally! many beatles hits on cd for the first time...","review":"i gave this 4 stars only because 1) 80 minutes is a bit short to cover the beatles hits (it's a bit jarring to open a cd w/ 'love me do' & close it w/ 'long & winding road' but i suppose that's the point, & 2) the methods used to compile this makes it lean towards paul material (as do the 'anthology' series). HOWEVER! the great news is that this is the FIRST cd release of hits from their early career in their ORIGINAL MIXES! yes, not only was this mastered using Y2K technology so the sound wipes the floor w/ those 1987 masters we were all duped into buying, but gone as well are the 1987 remixes for cd that their catalog up to & including 'rubber soul' was subjected to. for the 1st time in over a decade you can hear 'help!', for example, the way it was released in 1965. the beautiful avedon photos are tossed in as a bonus. now if we can just get them to put out the mono mixes (especially the superior mono 'sgt. pepper'). maybe for next x-mas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"We need such a ONE!","review":"People may think that, true beatles fans will not buy or even appreciate this album. Because they should have collected all of their stuffs. However, I think it's wrong to judge that. Because they need to find some new fans, especiall the youth.We need such a ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SINGLE DISC Compilation","review":"Does this leave out a lot of the Beatles best songs? Yes, it does. But is there a better album to introduce you to the Beatles? No, I don't think so. Sure, the anthology sets go into more detail and have a better selection, but you need to buy all of them, which is quite expensive. This is an inexpensive single album. I don't care for much of there early stuff, and this CD gives you the highlights of them. Then come some of their later hits, but most of their best songs were not number one hits and therefore have been neglected. However, this is the album that got me addicted to the Beatles, and I think it can do the same for you. I would reccommend first buying this CD, then if you like it at all, every album from Rubber Soul all the way to Let it Be. Magical Mystery Tour and Let it Be may not be necessary unless you're a real fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Beatles CD Ever","review":"This is the best Beatles album ever assembled. I will go as far as to say it is better than the infamous \\"White Album.\\" This CD contains all of their biggest hits, re-mastered with superb sound. Also the CD cover booklet contains many photos of their Album jackets, one page dedicated to each song on the CD. If you are a Beatles fan, it will excite you to find all of your favorite songs on one compact disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kids Are Now Big Beatles Fans!","review":"My wife bought this CD for my birthday. I never anticipated it, but playing The Beatles 1 turned my (elementary school age) kids into big Beatles fans.The songs they like most are \\"Love Me Do,\\" \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love.\\" But their absolute favorite is \\"Yellow Submarine\\" which they sing at the top of their lungs in the car whenever the song comes on.The Beatles just prove that beautiful songs are timeless.It always warms my heart to think that I am broadening my kids' horizons (and that we now have something I can listen to on family driving vacations that's a little more sophisticated than 'N Sync and The Backstreet Boys).Show your kids that music did exist before they were born -- by introducing them to The Beatles 1. (It will make you seem, in their eyes, years younger.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying this again and again","review":"There are certainly better qualified Beatles fans to get a review from, however, I must say I am enjoying this CD. The time I've spent listening to it is no longer markable in hours. We are looking at days here now. I am not entirely sure that all the #1 hits are on here but enough are for me to enjoy the whole thing.It is also filling some gaps I have in my newly forming Beatles collection. Some of their songs it seems aren't on the albums and this CD got them in my hands and ears. That shows the value of the CD right there.Very enjoyable and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Songs, bad recordings","review":"I have been listening to this for a while as one of the only Beatles CDs I have, and until 'Sgt. Pepper's' and 'Let It Be' came into my posession and I really got into the Beatles, I thought it was pretty good. Then, after I finished comparing them, I realized, for one thing, that those were definitely not the best recordings of the songs, and for anoher, it sounds like Paul McCartney turned up his bass sound so loud you can't hear any of the song. In conclusion, if you're strapped for cash, and must have the most Beatles you can get, buy it, but if you have a few more bucks to spend, go for albums like 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Let it Be', 'Abbey Road', 'Magical Mystery Tour' and 'Please Please Me'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another useless anthology","review":"I'm a BIG Beatles' fan but I really DON'T like this CD. If you own all the 13 cds + past masters + 3 anthology + ep and singles collections + free as a bird and real love I want to ask you one thing: why buy this cd only to read the (very fine) booklet? No 'please please me' in stereo; no 'from me to you' without harm intro (in past masters 1 there's 'love me do' 1st version with Ringo!). I think they could sell just the cover of this cd. NOT THE CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the albums, forget these useless compilations.","review":"Without a doubt, The Beatles are my very favorite group. I own all their music. The problem I have with compilations is what every true Beatle fan knows; you can't separate or cherry pick their albums. For instance, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields should never be separated. And those songs can't be truly appreciated apart from their friends on the Magical Mystery Tour. Plus, these are not necessarily, The Beatles \\"best\\" songs, only their most popular. If you are interested in getting into The Beatles, buy the Rubber Soul or/and Revolver CDs. Then go back to Help or forward to The White Album or Abby Road. Don't give this CD a second thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"great start for a collection","review":"if you're not a die-hard beatles fan but enjoy the fab four's popular hits, this is the album for you. it showcases all of their popchart songs from the earliest to the last. what makes it better than other beatles compilations (i.e. the red and blue albums) is that the songs have all been remastered and sound fantastic. the only problem with the album is that it could have easily been made into a two cd set with some more songs added on. there are many more great songs that should have made it onto the album.ever notice how the seasame street theme song sounds like love me do? hah."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"This CD has some really beautiful tracks like \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Let it Be,\\" and \\"All You Need is Love.\\" It also has some other classics like \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Love Me Do.\\" I personally love every song on this CD and would recommend it to anyone. It's definitely the best CD in my collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omissions?","review":"Any claims that this cd is excellent despite its \\"omissions\\" clearly fails to take into account that the cd is a collection of the Beatles' number one singles, no more, no less. It's not groundbreaking to suggest that the Beatles had a greater depth to their work than is represented by a cd such as this; any Beatles fan could tell you that. To anyone who feels the need to point out this apparent flaw, in the future please refrain from making such obvious statements in your reviews. They needlessly challenge the intelligence of any amazon.com reader who is unfortunate enough to come across your review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The 1","review":"What is most amazing here is the fact that even if these 27 former #1 songs never existed, The Beatles would still be considered the greatest rock band of all. Twenty seven No.1 songs and what sticks out is what is NOT on here--nothing from Sgt. Pepper (considered by many to be \\"the best\\" album of the rock era), nothing from the White Album (considered by others to be \\"the best\\"), nothing from Rubber Soul (our personal favorite), and only 2 songs (Eleanor Rigby, and the novelty Yellow Submarine) from the classic Revolver. No \\"In My Life\\", no \\"For No One\\", no \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", or countless other favorites.

I got Beatles 1 for a early x-mas gift, I listen to it because I like the music and I do not feel like going threw all my Beatles CD's , cassettes,LP's and EP's,singles, old eight tracks to find that Beatles song I want to hear, so I listen to Beatles 1. But, Songs that I like are missing on hear such, as Strawberry Fields Forever and I find myself have to go threw by big Beatle Music Collection to find it.

So when this compilation came out I thought what could be a better introductin to them? Well, I finally got it and I'm very glad I did.I already knew a fair amount of the music before buying it, so I was most interested in hearng the new (for me) songs. So imagine my surprise when I discovered that all those songs I thought I knew sounded so much more rich than I remembered. I was captivated by the topics and melodis of Paperback Writer, The Ballad of John and Yoko and Penny Lane and many others.I don't like every song on the CD, but it did it's job in re-inroducing me to old favorites and getting me interested in buying more music. I'm now in a total Beatles fixation and have bought Sgt. Pepper's with the plan to buy more. Looks like I'm starting a magical sonic journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories!!!!!!!!!!!

Besides, George and Ringo have their own greatest hits albums if you're yearning for Octopus's Garden or While My Guitar Gently Weeps.If you're already a Beatle-phile, this is a nice one to toss in the car for a long commute, otherwise these aren't songs you don't already own someplace else."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great trip through the Beatles music","review":"If you love the beatles music, this is a wonderful CD that gives you the begining, middle and end (does it ever really end?) of the Beatles career.

In a misguided attempt to remove the tape hiss, the music was destroyed. It even sounds bad on a boom box, much less a decent stereo system. This music could be mastered well, but the guys at Abbey Road are to in love with new gee whiz technology to do it right. Everything the Beatles did was recorded using Electron Tube equipment, and should be remastered with the same kind of equipment. The only way for you to hear the music on CD as it was meant to sound is to hunt down a mint copy of one of their original LPs and burn your own CD or buy a Bootleg sourced from the original vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEATLES RADIO HITS","review":"I bought this collection on vinyl from Acoustic Sounds. It was manufactured in England on 2 Lps with a poster and four pictures by Richard Avedon. The sound quality is supberb! The vocals sound live, the cymbals sound clear, the guitars sound like guitars and The Beatles have never sounded better. Compact disc sounds thin and can never replace the sound of vinyl. I have been replacing my CD collection with new 180GM vinyl Lps and the difference in sound brings the music back. I will never buy another compact disc again. This collection is all the radio songs by The Beatles. I recommend buying The Beatles albums on vinyl and get the entire Beatles catalog on vinyl. Compact disc may be convenient but the sound is poor next to vinyl and CD artwork is awful compared to LP artwork.

Ditto \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" which was the other half of a double-A sided single with \\"Penny Lane.\\" Maybe I'm being paranoid but it seems the living half of Lennon-McCartney, especially in light of his latest obnoxious behavior, may have had something to do with those omissions.Be that as it may, it is an excellent entree into the Beatles catalogue, which is unmatched in the annals of pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The recording is extremely bright!","review":"This is easily the worse recording of \\"best of\\" Beatles I have ever heard.

But, if you are like me with a decent system, you will absolutely loose your head because the sound is so bright and sharp that it will cut it right off.

From the innocent times of Love Me Do and She Loves You, going throug the maturiry on Day Tripper or Ticket To Ride, reaching the psichedelic moods of Penny Lane and Lady Madonna to the emotional sunset of Get Back or The Long and Winding Road, ALL that you need to know is right here.

It sounds like they just found four guys on the street, and told them to sing, without ever practicing. To me, they just sound out of sync, like a Kindergarten play.

There are seminal pieces of Beattle-mania that are not included on this album because they were not number one hits. You can fault EMI for that if you want, but they had to draw the line somewhere, and when a band has enough #1's to fill a whole CD, that is probably a good demarcation point.In my mind, the first comment was more important than the second, enough for me to give it 4 stars.

This CD does not do justice to the music or the performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"true beatles fans will not like this CD","review":"I quite enjoyed a number of songs on this CD, and it may be a good place to start, but trust me, its a total waste of money. Many mediocre at best songs were on the album just because they were their most famous song, and some of their greatest songs such as a day in the life and Strawberry fields are not on this CD. Id reccomend pretty much any beatles album over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Abuse of a Terrific Opportunity","review":"As a die-hard beatles fan, I found this CD quite a letdown. I don't understand how such a great opportunity to rejuvenate beatles popularity was so horribly abused. Comprised mainly of the annoying teeny bopper poppy songs like \\"I Want to Hold your Hand\\" and \\"We Can Work it Out\\" that make up the [rear] end of their music, this album largely bypasses their excellent serious songs, and even the good songs on the CD are mostly upbeat, mindless, lighthearted songs like \\"Yellow submarine\\" and \\"Penny Lane.\\" Let alone depth, there is not even a trace of the Beatles' trademark psychedelia in the entire CD. To anyone who is trying to get introduced in the enormously talented Beatles' music, I strongly urge you not to but this CD, but rather listen to albums such as \\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"1967-1970,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" and \\"Let it Be.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"27 is a MASSIVE number!!!!!!!!","review":"I mean, all those songs that went #1 during their time.

How can they leave out those awesome jams. It's OK, no one can appreciate the \\"White Album\\" by listening to single tracks anyway.

This would present everyone's collection so buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it - great cd, really good price","review":"This CD is great! Lots of the best Beatles songs (27 I believe?), and its a really good price. Much cheaper than a store like iTunes would charge (although you can't buy the Beatles on iTunes anyway). If you like the Beatles even a little bit, you'll like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect introduction to the best band!","review":"This was the first CD I heard from The Beatles back in 2006!

This is what you need to buy if you're new to Beatles music and you want to know why they made such an impact in music history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do I Know What I'm Talkin' About?","review":"I bought this CD because it contains four songs that are hard to find or at least find in a complete studio recording format. I'm speaking of Hey Jude, Ballad Of John And Yoko, Get Back and Long and Winding Road. The first two were released only as singles. Back in the day I bought them as 45's and they never appeared in any LP formats except maybe in compilation albums. The second two were also released as singles I think but also appeared on the Let It Be album in a somewhat shortened version and performed live on a roof top. The Let It Be version of Get Back was especially disappointing because the song is noticeably shorter than the 45 version. It's almost as if they felt obligated to add it to an album to give the popular song more exposure. Say, does anybody know how much my old 45 versions of the above tunes might be worth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL THE # 1'S","review":"I still have many albums on vinyl, my favorite being Hey Jude/The Beatles Again, which is not available on CD. I bought this when it was first released and am now trying to obtain an import copy on vinyl. The remixing/remastered sound brings every song back to life. All of the songs were number 1 hits and are classic Beatles. The songs sound excellent and this is a must have collection for Beatles fans and those who have not listened to John,Paul,George, and Ringo in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mania Never Dies","review":"From the first days of 1964, just waiting for the first appearance of the Beatles on US television, that electricity has never diminished for anyone who ever loved them! To hear I Want To Hold Your Hand today still sends a shiver through the spine and the listener recalls waiting for every week's Top 40 publication.... There they were, with 8 of the top 10 on the charts and you only had to switch from station to station on the car radio to catch one of the Beatles' hits.... And now it's on a CD-- no more AM signals lost.... The Beatles are still NO. 1-- and the times stand still to listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST DOESNT DO IT FOR ME","review":"I dont know what the huge deal is over the Beatles . The music is very yawnsome and they werent great singers.Comparing their composing to the likes of Mozart or Beethoven is absolutely laughable!!!.Their singing comes nowhere close to people like Elvis Presley , Stevie Wonder ,Aretha Franklin or Tom jones .All these singers had a soulful quality to their voices that transcended the listener to musical bliss. The Beatles just dont do it for me in this regard. Sorry.This cd is overrated ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Beatles suck","review":"What I have realized since I started listening to the Beatles albums, is their commercial single releases suck for the most part.

I personally can't see what all the fuss is, or was, about.

Its The Beatles, how could it not be good?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuch!","review":"I like the Beatles, but theres no denying they had a lot of fluff. It was simple, empty pop songs that got them into a position where they had the power to experiment and innovate (for such a large audience, anyway).This hits compilation tracks mostly just the fluff, and it gets redundant before the CD is about half completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment, Total Disservice to the Music","review":"Although this CD release had a huge publicity push behind it, it is a completely disappointing - no, make that a completely infuriating - regurgitory thrashing of some of the world's greatest pop singles. Some mastering engineer should be hung by his ear hairs for the absolute mid-range brash [music] he turned these tracks into. I want my money back on this one! I'll tell you what, I borrowed a Mexican bootleg Beatles collection from a friend, which he bought down there for two pesos, and the thing beats this over-hyped red-covered [cd] all to heck and back.

Although i was a bit dissapointed that it had left out 2 #1 singles: Please Please Me & Strawberry Fields Forever (due to lack of space). But apart from that it's great. I think that they should release another 1 album with the B sides from those songs. NOW THAT'D BE A GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"When I first heard this cd I was very impressed with it but after I started listening to more of the Beatles music I thought it wasn't the best. If you already have some of their music then this cd would be pretty much be a repeat to you of one or two of their songs on other records, but if your just getting into The Beatles and not sure if your really like them and don't know if you want to get more of The Fab Four's music then this would be pretty good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please buy a different Beatles album","review":"Hey, don't buy this one. Click around and buy Sgt. Pepper, or Revolver, or Abbey Road, or Magical Mystery Tour, or Rubber Soul, or The \\"White Album\\". If you want a \\"greatest hits\\" album, buy \\"Past Master Vol.II\\" This collection is not their best songs, it is merely the songs that went to number one on the charts. This is not the way the Beatles were meant to be heard. Do yourself a favor, and buy any other album. DON'T give this album as a gift, either. If you're a parent looking to get the young ones interested in the Beatles, and at the same time recall the music of your youth, put Revolver on for them. Otherwise, I highly reccomend the Glitter soundtrack as an alternative to The Beatles."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So CD","review":"This CD has all of the good songs, sure, but it's makes a whole lot of difference to hear them on the original albums, the way the beatles wanted them.

Their best songs never went to #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to argue.","review":"It's not a \\"Best Of\\", so of course it doesn't have every single Beatles gem you know and love. That would be a 3 or 4 CD set. And it is missing some songs, but maybe they're missing for a reason. I'm not arguing and there's no need to. If you have to just have one Beatles CD (thats NOT an album), this would be it. It spans The Beatles whole career in under 80 minutes and is an absolute pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"go back to cubist castle baby!!!","review":"This album definently lacks the cohesive structure that their previous albums had. It needs some kind of melody that threads together each song like their previous album \\"her wall paper reverie\\".How could the Beatles even think of making another album without John Lennon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"1\\" Beatles album you want to own...","review":"This album is for those who like the Beatles, but aren't necessarily gonna run out and buy \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", or \\"White Album\\" any time soon. This album truly sums up an unprescedented career. They need no introduction, contain no pretense, and were (and still are) an influence and role model to many rock n' roll bands to this day.

Her career has been more fruitful and she's sold more records and lasted longer than the Beatles.The Beatles had one good song, Ballad Of John And Yoko, no more, no less. The Beatles would be a forgotten 60's band like Herman's Hermits and Dave Clark Five if it wasn't for the star power of Yoko to make them superstars in the late 60's.Skip this, and buy Yoko's Walking On Thin Ice cd instead.

I belong to a generation that beatles are not a symbol.

Dont buy this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to get excited about","review":"This music is just to old, you can't constantly like songs 30 years after they were made. If you really liked the Beatles back in the 60's and 70's then you might appreciate this and still not like it. The music was average back then, but still doesn't have a good sound that people can catch onto today. So, the Beatles just don't have what it takes to have timeless music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheep Mania","review":"I grew up hearing the Beatles as a kid & didn't really like them then. As the years have passed & they've bludgeoned my ears on radio, tv commercials, muzak in airports, etc I've grown to HATE them. Even more, I've grown to hate the parrots who repeat each other, \\"The Beatles are the greatest band ever, *Squawk!*\\" Sorry, there's no such thing as \\"the greatest\\" ANYTHING. But since we live in a consensus reality, sheer numbers & repetition can make anything seem true.If you like them, fine; keep buying the same old songs, over & over again as they're re-re-released over & over again. And keep telling everyone that they're the greatest band ever so no one will forget. Squawk.In the future, toilet paper will play the Beatles greatest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overated","review":"The most important thing that the beatles did was to water down and put an acceptable face on the black music that they had been listening to all of their lives. Just ask them who their musical heroes were and are. Now that's not to say that they haven't written some great songs mind you but by and large their music lacks intensity or rhythmic complexity or the purity that their r&b predecessors exhibited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"The Beatles are by far the best band known to man, but this CD does not have the best music by the Beatles. In fact, it gives me a head ache. Now don't get me wrong, they're good songs, and i highly recommend it if you're just starting to listen to the Beatles, but if you're looking for the best Beatles music, buy The White Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Beatles CD you'll ever need","review":"There is not one bad song on this album. It's all the Beatles' number one hits. It has classics like \\"Hey, Jude\\", and \\"Come together\\". All of these songs will grow on you immediately. This is the only Beatles CD you'll ever need. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Omissions were the Real # 1's","review":"The conceit of this compilation is that #1 status can be decided by sales charts alone without any regard as to what stands the test of time as favorites among fans. In this album, second-rate Beatles tunes abound which, in their day, rose to #1 mainly because we were to stupid to care, as long as it was the Beatles. The better songs went over the heads of the fans at the time and had no chance to outstrip the more radio-friendly, accessible lollipops. The Beatles were arguably the only band successfully to straddle the worlds of bubblegum and progressive rock, largely due to McCartney and Lennon embodying these polarities respectively in their musical statements.There is no doubt that the Beatles were the most successful bubblegum act of all time; less known is that they were also the foremost pioneers of progressive music. This album celebrates their most trivial achievements to such an extent as to bury anew their most formidable contributions to rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall a disappointing compilation","review":"To be quite frank, the Beatles were always a better album band than they were a singles band. Despite racking up an impressive string of number one hits, the brilliance of this band would not be realized until 1966 with the release of the \\"Revolver\\" album. That said, the first half of this disc is dispensible, covering a period when the Beatles were catering to the teenyboppers with cookie cutter pop tunes the likes of \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\". Songs like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Ticket To Ride\\" and \\"Help\\" were standard soundtrack filler and are mediocre when compared to their late sixties output. The album suffers immeasurably from the absence of any songs from Sgt. Pepper or the White Album and a scant two tracks from Abbey Road. The Beatles have never been served well by compilations and this album is no exception. Buy Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper first for a more satisfying introduction to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD played fine","review":"Music CD came quickly.

If you can dig up a copy of a 60's British pressing of any of their l.p.s, you will be shocked and outraged at how this material has been ruined and mispresented.

Diehards are no doubt squabbling over the selection of songs, but the collection, which starts with the nursery rhyme cadences of \\"Love Me Do,\\" and finishes up with the gorgeous \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" will have kids questioning their parents (and in my case, a Gen-X'er questioning her Baby Boomer husband) about the impact John, Paul, George and Ringo had on modern pop.

Every track is instantly recognizable and would humble Mozart if he was still breathing. \\"Love Me Do\\" through \\"Yesterday\\" are upbeat classics that showcase the Beatles' ability to master the 50's-style teen anthem or love song, whereas \\"Day Tripper\\" through \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" represent the remarkable upgrade in musical sophistication the Beatles experienced from \\"Rubber Soul\\" through their masterful swan song, \\"Abbey Road.\\" In short, the Beatles' \\"1\\" record is perfect. It outshines any greatest hits collection by Madonna or the Queen of Pop. Not one track on this CD fails to hook and hold your attention, and all of these songs were penned by Lennon/McCartney or Harrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the essentials","review":"It's about time that a complete Beatles' collection spanning their whole career was released and the #1s format was the way to go. Sure, it doesn't contain every essential song recorded by the Beatles but then again, you'd need more than 1 CD for that. But the 27 selections on here are all the biggies. All either #1s here in the US or in the UK.

I've got much older music in my collection where the remastering job is excellent. I don't know what they had to work with on this collection, but the sound is flat and, IMO, mediocre at best. Regarding the selection of music; I think they could have left off many of the weaker songs, which to me are embarrassingly bad (i.e. She Is Still A Mystery) and have not withstood the 'test of time'. Of the 26 songs on the CD, I will listen to only 8 at most and set up my music server so the others don't get played. While I might have grown up with this music, I evidently have outgrown it.

On here are 26 selections from hit singles to album cuts you might not have heard but worthy of getting acquainted with. \\"Rain on the Roof\\" kind of stuck out at me with it's sunny-natured tone even though pictured on a rainy afternoon. The liner notes indicate its B-side is \\"Pow! (Theme From 'What's Up, Tiger Lilly?')\\" (What a silly name. Good fun!)That song is one of the must fun songs on here. There is a big musical montage as you listen to this disc. The band wasn't worried about experimenting. Why, on one of the last songs on the disc, they play on a typewriter! (Cool, huh?) This disc is marvelous overview of an often over-looked good-time '60s band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jugband Music","review":"Somehow or other, the Spoonful have just not had the kindly of lively oldies life that other, lessor bands have had. This excellent collection reminded me of just how many terrific hits and misses these guys had. Some of their less popular songs - such as Jugband Music and Nashville Cats - stand the test of time even better than the bigger hits. This collection contains everything that you might want to hear but does not pad the good stuff with endless B sides and outtakes.

Whereas Buffalo Springfield ventured into traditional country and operatic music (Neil). Spoonful gladly hung out in the Honky tonks and roadside diners that gave them a sense of fun.

Enjoy and have a spoonful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same as Original Hits","review":"I was really looking forward to having this - but some songs are reworked and not the same songs as heard on the radio. Especially mournful to me is the song \\"Younger Girl\\" - it is NOTHING like the hit song on the radio - on this CD it is done by one guy with one guitar.

While there's no disagreeing it very much resembles the Rhino collection, I disagree with the reviewer who heard no discernible difference in the sound. To my ears, when compared, the remastering here is infinitely better than Rhino's (and as someone else noted, to be fair, Rhino most likely did not have access to the master tapes). The tracks are clearer, smoother and warmer. Yes, there are tracks on the Rhino collection not included here, so you can have both, if you wish. This disc, however, is pure heaven. The Lovin' Spoonful were wonderful and should NEVER be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"So few HITS","review":"More filler songs than actual HITS (about three). I did not realize they had so few biggies if the CD is the factual record of their \\"Greatest Hits\\".The filler songs were never really played in USA and for good reason they are not worthy of Billboard ratings. I have these few HITS on Time-Life CD's, this is a CD I should have passed up. This CD is only for the die-hard Lovin Spoonful fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD - It contains songs from Dolly before she became famous, songs that she doesn't have the rights to - these songs and the quality are awful.... so much so that they have been available free in Sunday newspaper give aways!I LOVE DOLLY and everything she does - but these recordings do not even sound like her they are so bad and they are available on lots of other albums.

This book is quite different. The characters lay lifeless in the background of the historical document. It is well written and very entertaining but definitely different from his other very well known novels, such as the Musketeer series, Montecristo, the Black Tulip, and so on.Quite honestly, in my opinion, his novels are much better than his non-fiction works such as this one.Regarding form, I was overwhelmed by how careless the editors of this edition are.

I started to read the book but then decided to read it in the original and recycle this sorry effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumas would be turning in his grave","review":"Typos is an understatement. This is without a doubt the most horribly edited/proofread book I have ever come across. How anyone could overlook this and give a good review is beyond me. Names are spelled in a variety of ways (the same names) throughout the entire book - extremely confusing - especially if the reader is unfamiliar or new to the Borgia and the times. Whoever translated it obviously thought all vowels were interchangeable. The subject matter is interesting, no arguement there, but there are much better books out there on the subject. I also thought the extraordinary amount of words spent counting soldiers, horses, blades could have been better spent illuminating the characters. This may be part of Dumas's style but I thought it was too repetitive and somewhat boring. Save your money or look for it by another publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a history book not a novel","review":"This book as very little about the Borgias and plenty about Charles VIII.

BUDDHA NATURE, NIRVANA ROAD, WIND AND MOUNTAIN, EARTH BLUE, LAND OF ENCHANTMENT, GARDEN OF THE BELOVED, ECSTASY, NADA HIMALAYA, and so on... all of which are pervaded with love and warmth. D is just ugly sound. It's negative, unconscious, full of harsh ugliness.This should never be mistaken for a representation of Deuter's other albums. Meeting Osho seems to have turned him around since, from what I can gather, the albums made during and after meeting him and absorbing his presence and ways express a lot of love, joy, bliss, warmth, happiness which D clearly lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"wicked savior","review":"\\"Wicked Savior\\" is one of the most interesting \\"country\\" records I've heard this year.

The text is not read by a professional botanist (I assume) and incorrect or dubious facts are common. Furthermore, the text is filled with typos and misspellings that could easily have been caught in a simple spell-checking program. The figures are from older literature and are not well reproduced. The aim with this book, to explain botany in a day, is highly recommendable, but I cannot recommend this book in its present shape and quality-level.

But, hey, there are a lot of winning tunes on this CD. I would like, however, to hear a little more variation between singers as lead for the next cd.

The park was once a grand amusement park just outside Philadelphia. During its heyday, the park was a thriving landmark and was the summer home of John Phillip Susa. By the time this movie was shot at the park, it was a moribund faade of its former glory. This just adds to the creepiness of the atmosphere of this film. I grew up in Willow Grove. The park was a large part of my childhood. I watched the film recognizing images of my feckless youth flicker by my eyes. If you grew up in the area and fondly remember Willow Grove Park, do your self a favor and seek out this film. It will give you a rush of memories. The park is now longer there.

Sign me up! But after watching it, I dunno why anybody particularly cares that it was lost. Doesn't make (much) sense, is lacking in plot, is lacking in gore (very important particularly if you've got the word BLOOD in the title no?!), Herve's in it for two minutes or something, has the very common 70s problem of bad lighting... Look people, not having a plot or a very poorly-organized one DOES NOT make a movie \\"surreal\\" or any other big college word like that. It just means it's not good, OK? The best I can say for this movie is that it has a very proto-House Of 1000 Corpses vibe to it and that Mr. Blood reminds me a bit of Bob Newhart and/ or Kelsey Grammar but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heart Wrenching and Tragic Story!!","review":"Faceless is my second favorite Martina Cole novel, and I have read them all.

A HDTV will also have 1-2 components so keep in mind you'll want a receiver with at least 2. I was very impressed that this unit it the 'brains' so to speak. Everything goes thru this unit, it's like a head unit rather then a piece of a system. Even the TV goes thru this. Very nice, the remote can control everything.

In this day of passcodes and entering numbers you will be very frustrated when you can't do it correctly with this phone.Battery has been sporadic and below average. Programming is poor.

In every other country (UK France Australia etc) Buffy Season 4, 5 and 6 have already been released in true 16:9 format, but not here. What they released was 1/3% of the picture cut off on the left and right. Their excuse for doing this: \\"This was the way it was meant to be seen to block out cameras and info that got in the shot.\\" I've seen both version and BELIEVE ME you're missing a lot! The only camera that got in the shot was in the first episode, where obviously they hadn't mastered it yet, but after that, flawless.As for the show itself, it's great. The integrity is always there by Joss Whedon, always taking chances with the characters whether fans like it or not. It's a great show, but a LOUSY USA RELEASE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't agree with the sour reviews","review":"I think Season 4 was an awesome part of the Buffy universe. We saw Buffy humbled by a snotty group of college vampires, but later kicked their bu-tay...we were introduced to the super sexy Riley (sorry guy, I liked Riley)...we were introduced to the quiet and beautiful Tara and saw the first signs of romance between her and Willow in what has to be the best and scariest episode ever, HUSH...and, to me, we saw the awesome appearance of \\"Uber Buffy\\" and sad to say it was a one time appearance only. I won't go on and on, others have given a more in depth review and I don't hold a candle to those guys as a reviewer.I gave it 4 stars only because of FOX's betrayal to fans by releasing it in fullscreen format and not widescreen as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of the End...","review":"Certain episodes were as good as the previous seasons, but most were fillers and didn't meet up with the usual standards. First of all, Willow being gay??? Where did that come from? No offense, but it didn't really suit her personality up to that point, and it seemed that her character completely changed because of it.Also, Angel's absence and his replacement was just no good. Riley was good, but compared to Angel, he was out of his league in dating Buffy (sorry Riley fans!)But the worst thing was the absence of Faith. The season would have been so much better if Faith had stayed. The 2 episodes with her in them were my fav's of the season. But anyways, this season was still worthwhile after all that complaining, but you can tell that the originality was starting to go downhill.

First, the show moved from High School to College. Second, two major characters, Angel & Cordelia, moved to the spin-off series Angel. Many would wonder if the show could move on from different changes.I think it did, though I know some Buffy fans didn't. A lot of folks say that this was the worst season, but I thought it was great. The overall story arc is not as strong as seasons 2 & 3 (nothing in Buffy will ever touch those seasons), but this season probably has some of the best single episodes out of any season of Buffy.

I will tell you Buy Angel Season 1. This is where all the writers focus and attention was at, trying to establish Angel which is a Spin off of The Buffy Series. Which I will say is EXCELLENT. The Angel series is different from the buffy series but it's wonderful!!! The First Season of Angel however does fall inline with the BTVS series Season 4.

But the rest of the season felt as if something was missing or off.It seems that the college experience was avoided because the writers were afraid the show would become \\"Felicity the Vampire Slayer\\". I can understand that but what we got was boring villains and the beginnings of some serious character assassination.Whenever FX shows the reruns, I always quit watching after \\"Hush\\" airs, because it's pretty much downhill from there.However, if you are a diehard BTVS fan, you'll agree, a bad episode of \\"Buffy\\" is still better than most of the other dreck on TV.

This was the season when the series, already amazing, matured.I'm disappointed that there doesn't seem to be any reflection of Riley and The Initiative on the packaging (as they did with the Season Three discs, will Fox try to shove Spike to prominence over everything else?), since they were a major part of the season, and since the contrast between the supernatural and the scientific was the driving force.

When I found it was only 1, I decided to hold off and just listen to my old albums, since so many great tunes have been left out. For example, everything from Wizard Island and Lift Off should be here. Kenny G? Please - some of Jeff's best stuff had little if any Kenny G on it (\\"Reflections,\\" for example).

This book is among the litany of self-help books that are offered up on the snake-oiled palms of tricksters like St. John who suck money from the suffering masses.The inauthentic imprimatur of St. John can be summed up most effectively as an undifferentiated mass of useless blather.The self-help field is riddled with self-annointed experts with no formal education or personal experience in what they preach. As with most overzealous self-help proselytisers, their own background is incongruous with their message. For instance, John Gray, author of \\"Men are From Mars Women are From Venus\\" has a history of failed relationships as does the co-author of \\"The Rules\\"How can someone lead others to the well when they haven't found it themselves? More importantly, how do they sleep at night deceiving others?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ironic juxtaposition","review":"What an ironic juxtaposition that St John preaches success yet his book on success ranks 32,670 among Amazon sales.

The book is poorly written and is something that a teacher in junior high or high school would give some fine editing to. I am trying to figure out how one with a Ph.D would be able to create such a terrible piece of work. Mr.St.John does not seem to demonstrate anything about any success that he has had in the world or in life. It all just seems to be a bunch of psychobabble taken from previously read self-help books. What is there that is tangible proof of any success in any arenas of life except that of being a self-proclaimed guru and speaker on success?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Authority on Success?","review":"I should have known this book wasn't the answer when the author begins the book blaming his Dad for his lack of success. Not holding oneself accountable, shirking ownership of failure, and blaming parents for his problems, St, John is hardly the success guru.He then proceeds to guide others into success even though it is not clear whether the author has actually obtained success for himself.If you measure success by independence, financial freedom, academic achievement, or social acceptance, you may want to read a book by an author who has acquired the above - (Lance Armstrong, Lee Iacocca, Donald Trump, Condoleezza Rice...)

It's a well balanced sound with no notable features (I'm not into megabass).Two other positives.First, it can drive A and B speakers simultaneously (or one at a time). But the great advantage is that they are driven independently: turning on the B speakers creates no dip in the volume of the A speakers, and vice versa - even with the very different speakers and cable lengths that I use on A and B. Not something you see every day.Second, it has robust quality. For instance, during a recent thunderstorm it went into \\"protect\\" mode when there was a dip in the power supply, rather than continue to operate and potentially die. And that was behind a surge protector, so it's pretty conscientious.Amazon are no longer offering this unit, but if you can find it elsewhere it's well recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value.","review":"Bought this model about ten years ago, and mine still looks and sounds brand new - and it has been used a lot.

My main system comprises Lexicon and Adcom separate components at many times the price of the Sony. This Sony is part of a tertiary system and has been an almost daily use workhorse powering small speakers. It's 100wpc output is not as robust as those found in pricier units, but will be adequate for most users - I certainly disagree with the reviewer who characterized it as 20wpc, but do agree it is not a high-current design; nor does it cost like one. It is a competent, reliable receiver with a fairly sensitive FM, great remote control features and competes very well in this price range. I do not use Megabass, either - way too phat.

In less than 1 year, the rubber plastic vacuum cap developed a hole in it and the pump no longer had adequate suction.

It is also no longer under warranty - warranty covers 1yr from date of purchase on this part. Although I had not used it for one year, the date of purchase is what's important. I called Medela and they offer no assistance. This is obviously a product flaw. I am extremely disappointed that I have to purchase a new pump, which is a big expense. I am also currently renting a hospital pump which is also expensive and not a long term solution, especially if we choose to have another child.

With the pump set at max settings I could not get any milk to come out. Fortunately when I contacted the Supplier I bought it from they allowed me to send it back to them and upgrade to the Pump in Style Advanced. That is a wonderful pump.My best advice is, if you try renting a hospital pump and want something similar get the pump in style ADVANCED. It is more similar to the hospital grade one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate breast pump","review":"in my opinion there is no other pump out there that can even compete with this one. in addition to its compact size it is perfect for an on the go mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pump","review":"I love this pump, I just started to use this regularly when I went back to work.It's fast, easy to set up and keeps the milk nice and cold for when I get home. It is bulky, but it needs to be to have all those things included. I purchased the cleaning wipes so I can wipe down the sheilds and let them dry, it's perfect. It's hard for me to get to water so the wipes work great. I would definitly reccommend this pump to ANYONE, even though it's really expensive. Defintly get this pump if you are a working mom and want to give your children the gift of breastmilk. I also purchased the car adapter to make it even easier to pump when I am away from the baby, and it makes it more sanitary to express milk. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Skimp on your Breast Pump","review":"Hi Ladies, (and Gentlemen)This is a very good and efficient breast pump. Once my milk came in I could fill up one of the 6 oz bottles with my pump in a matter of minutes. This will become and invaluable asset to you if you are breastfeeding.My Son would not latch on correctly at first. It took him 3 wks for us both to start to get the hang of it. The entire time I had to express my milk while trying to get him on.If I didn't have a good pump that at least made this extremely difficult and tiring situation as easy as it could be, i honestly may have given up.When son was 11 wks (just 2 wks ago), I had to go back to work. now i pump in my office.

I went out and bought the home version \\"In style\\", which is easy to use, clean, and does not take forever just for a few ounces. I noticed in other reviews complaints about suction, and all I have to say is get the owners manual out and review the \\"Troubleshooting\\" section title-If there is Low or No Suction.

I'm confused because she already producing a lot of milk when she's using her madela manual harmony pump but when she start using this electric one her milk barely come out because the pump is really low speed even she adjusted it in high speed dial. She don't need 30 minutes to an hour to get only 1 Oz. of milk because she doesn't have that much time to wait for a very slow pump like Madela Pump in style.

It's so light and portable, I can't imagine not having this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost suction quickly.","review":"I actually recieved this breast pump system free from my insurance company. I had purchased a $35 system from Babies-R-Us before my son was born as a cheap option. My son had trouble nursing and by the time he was 3 weeks old, I had to pump my milk and feed it to him in a bottle. I used this pump at first, and had a hard time. It wouldn't express much milk when I had it set up to do both sides at the same time. No matter how high I turned the suction, it wasn't enough to express my milk. So I used it one side at a time, and that seemed to be better, but only for the first maybe 10 times that I did it. After that it seemed to loose suction completely, and I resorted to my $35 electric one side pump, which had at least twice the suction this expensive pump ever had. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this pump, because it would have been a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump","review":"I did not have to buy this pump, as I borrowed it from my sister-in-law. It is pretty expensive, but in my opinion it is an item worth the price if you work full time and want to keep breastfeeding going. I did not give it 5 stars because I think it could be much better if it wasn't such a hassle to set up. There should be a way to make the clean up and set up easier. Nevertheless, I believe the motor is powerful enough for constant use and it keeps the supply pretty well. I also like the convenience of Medela freezer bottles that you can purchase and use to pump directly into them."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 months and still nursing while working full time","review":"This pump worked great. I went back to work full time when my daughter was 9 weeks and at 6 months, we're still going strong. I pump twice a day with the Medela Pump in Style. I like the way everything fits in the case, and the battery pack is great for when I don't have access to an outlet. I also HIGHLY recommend getting the microsteam bags so you can clean all the parts in the microwave after each use. This saves so much time!Also, for anyone who wants to breastfeed but is concerned about going back to work: I read these reviews before my daughter was born and it was such an encouragement to see so many moms who had done it. You can do it, too! Use all the resources you can, and don't be discouraged!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"I use this pump everyday..

I honestly didn't even think I'd use it more than once every couple of weeks. However, our baby would not latch on to the breast for his first five days of life and I had to pump every two hours to assure that my milk supply would come in. I was so glad that I had the pump!Now, I use it sometimes at the end of the day if my nipples are really sore and need a break. (We finger feed him with a supplemental nursing system.) It's also handy to relieve engorgement when your milk comes in. (Although hand expression works just as well.)I'm only giving four stars because I wish the funnel mechanism had more of a downward slope so that I could slightly recline while pumping. As it is, I have to pump sitting straight up or occasionally hunch over to get the milk to drop into the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth the money!","review":"We originally started off with a cheaper brand because I wasn't sure how long I would be able to pump or if I could and figured the $80.00 was going to be good enough. Boy was I WRONG! If you are going to pump and pump for any length of time do yourself a favor and pay the extra money. The originaly pump I bought was the First Years one at Babies R Us and it was not very comfortable and the breast shields left marks on my breasts. I came back to work and decided I needed a double pump to make the process faster so we went ahead and spent the money to buy the Medela and it was truly a god send! I have no pain when I pump and it takes me only approx. 10 minutes to pump 6-8 ounces (which is good for me). So my recommendation if you are looking to pump for any length of time is to definately save yourself the $80 and buy the Medela. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss mine now that I have another newborn...","review":"This is a wonderful pump.

As a working mother who has been nursing for eleven months, I can honestly say that this pump is the reason I'm still able to breastfeed.

I've even used the battery pack to pump while driving twice in a pinch. Everything you need is included! I was even able to use other brands of bottles with the pump.

It is worth the price if you are a working mom who will need to pump often. I went back to work at six weeks post-pardum and this pump allowed me to continue breastfeeding my son until 8 months old when I gave it up for health reasons. The pump is not hard to use or assemble and it is much more efficient than a manual or single breast pump. I have the backpack style model and I didn't feel like people could even tell what it was when I would cart it in to work on my shoulder.

The seal is so bad that the only thing keeping it on is its own weight and if you're smart your hand our you'll have a huge mess.

The script, based on a novel of the same name by Helen MacInnes, just bustles along, never pausing long enough to be terribly scary, but always with a sense of urgency and lots of clever lines and scenarios.Fred MacMurray and Joan Crawford are at their comic best in this, while never letting us forget the mystery/suspense at hand.

If that's your need to fill, pick it on up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and unconvincing either way","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be interesting since my Husband, soon to be ex btw, is a Muslim and I'm a Christian. This book did not flow, was beyond boring and didn't convince me one way or the other (not that my faith is at all shaky). I am convinced that believing in Jesus has nothing to do with, historical evidence or intellectual debates(no jokes please). Instead its the Holy Spirit that reaches out to those that were already going to be receptive anyways and therefore the elect who would be saved. Now if what I'm saying sounds unscriptural or just plain wrong consider John 6:37, John 6:44, and John 6:65. Those who will be saved have already been chosen/known but the Gospel must go out because WE don't know who or how they will come to the Lord.I was expecting something deep and profound from this book but was sorely disappointed. I'll keep looking for something that compares Christianity, Islam, and Judaism for education sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lame attempt","review":"Licona tries - he really does. But he fails, because it's impossible to prove blind faith. Unluckily, Licona comes across as almost as idiotic as James Patrick Holding. Luckily, he comes across only ALMOST as idiotic as Holding. Reading a book like this one may raise the question as to whether or not Christianity really is dead, as there seems to be no intelligent defense of the religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"liconas christian blunder","review":"This of course fails to consider that the origin of the crucifixion is a myth, not history, and that mystery gods were often said to undergo embarrassing deaths, i.e. castration of Attis or just being hung up to rot as Inanna. The Roman Empire was host to many mystery cults, each with its own savior god or goddess, such as Dionysos, Osiris, Attis and Mithras. Each of these mystery gods had experienced death in some way to the benifit of the initiate.the daughter of god dies for the sins of mankind by incarnating into lady jessica.before lady jessica dies,she gets gang banged by 4 jewish men.why aren't ideas like this acceptable for christians?"},{"rating":"2","title":"you have to have it","review":"You simply have to have it if you have one of the porter cable circular saws. My complaints are (1) it doesn't have any measurements marked (2) the tightening screw is hard to adjust.Also, it makes more sense to simply include the rip guide in the saw kit instead of having it as an accesory. Actually, there's a groove on the inside cover of the carrying case, that fits the rip guide perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Not Last","review":"I owned and utilized this product on a PC circular saw for over 2 years. The metal is cheaply made as well as the set screws. The metal will bend when you attempt to tightened the screws enough so they will not vibrate loose.

The movie's major sounds come, endlessly, loudly, from a construction worker drilling floors, crushing walls, fixing windows. The scenes alternate between the said construction worker, staring at the mademoiselle, and the mademoiselle, staring at the worker. How much can two people keep looking at each other, expressionlessly, without falling asleep, is probably the most impressive achievement of this movie. Excruciating! And so predictable: You know where the camera will land, for the next shot! This \\"love\\" story is totally devoid of love, passion, poetry and vibrance. Some viewers might feel transported to the heavens, watching this movie. I never left the ground. Bravo for the kid, though, he acted wonderfully. As for Mademoiselle Chambon, alas, I couldn't fall in love with her, her violin or her life.

Then, after one bounce off the concrete parking lot versus the grass, the LCD display stopped working.

So, if you don't get any instructions just look for the on-off switch on one of the edges and find the screw at the end of the purple panel.

I am a music teacher, and I think these are just really cool musical toys for young children. The sound is much better than I expected, and my daughter loves them both. I give this one 4 stars instead of 5 only because the songs can be kind of hard to sing with because the music is a little elaborate. It's easier for kids to sing along with simple arrangements, and the cube's songs have lots of notes...which make them great to listen to, but maybe a little tough for a child to sing along with.

When I received it, I filled the containers and hung it. To my horror, all three contained constantly leaked the sugary liguid all over my porch attacting large numbers of ants. The containers would not seal properly. I would not recommend this item to anyone. Instead, I purchased several Hummzinger feeders, a much better design, and am completely satisfied with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't attract hummers","review":"I bought this because it was so pretty, and I found it to be quite durable. However, the hummingbirds wouldn't eat out of it! I tried everything. First I hung it up but the hummers ignored it. So I hung a standard feeder it its place and when I had a lot of hummers coming to it, I put this one back up instead. The hummers went away. I even taped yellow cut-out flowers around the feeding ports, thinking they might find them better that way. Nope. Sadly, I finally just threw it away. I didn't want to--it cost a lot and is indeed so pretty--but useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pretty but it leaks","review":"I love the look of feeder and unlike some other reviews, I did not find the feeder delicate. I love that I can just put the pieces in the dishwasher.

I've had this feeder for 3 yers now and a month after I had it hung, I noticed that the patio ground underneath was always sticky. Upon investigation I noticed that liquid was leaking out of all the ports from all the glass jars. I ordered this item from another place, but thought to share my experience here. After 3 years, I'm ready to switch to another feeder and throw this away! I wouldn't really recommend this as a hummingbird feeder, maybe as a decoration but not a functional feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too delicate & not easy acess for hummers","review":"I would highly suggest you DON'T buy this feeder if you want to attract AND FEED hummers. It is just too delicate, cannot withstand any wind, cheap hooks and hummers have a difficult feeding from it because the holes are hard for them to find. I have scads of hummers in my yard in the summer and they don't like this feeder(they will go to my other feeder and avoid this one). They like my strawberry feeders best and my larger red feeder with yellow flowers on it because they can see where the flowers are and they like to sit down. So two thumbs down on this feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible idea!","review":"This is a terrible feeder that does not take into account the actual feeding habits of hummingbirds. Hummingbirds are highly inefficient fliers, and they prefer to rest frequently while feeding. This feeder offers no place for the birds to rest, and in the slightest breeze, the constant movement of the hanging globes makes it even more difficult for the birds to feed. Although it looks nice, the feeder is terrible for hummingbirds. Opus makes a different feeder that presents the birds with a ring on which to rest while feeding. That feeder should be purchased without hesitation over this \\"mobile-type\\" feeder. Please remember--do not add red dye to your hummingbird food! These wonderful little birds can be highly sensitive to such dyes, and you could inadvertently hurt the very creatures you are trying to attract. The red plastic is enough to attract them. Also remember to change the food every few days, especially in the heat, as the sugar will ferment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than I thought","review":"First of all, this is more of an art piece than a bird feeder. The birds do seem to enjoy it, but it isn't the easiest for them to find. This was a bigger feeder than I anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise. Make sure you find a good place where there is plenty of room to hang it, but that it is still easy to reach for refilling. The only drawback I found was the filling isn't as easy as I had hoped, it's a little bit more tricky than other feeders. Still a wonderful feeder, and a joy for the garden regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"hummingbird Feeder Mobile","review":"Although this is a very pretty feeder and does attract hummingbirds it is very messy - leaks nectar almost constantly (and I have hanging in front of my kitchen window over the porch - so makes a big mess on the porch) The guidelines say to hang in a protected area but needs to be where the nectar will not make such a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent feeder!","review":"I have had great results with this feeder all summer! The hummers found it immediately and many, many hummers come here to feed.The multiple ports seem to make the difference, and the glass orbs are easy to remove, fill, and keep very clean; I prefer the glass to plastic. This feeder is whimsical, fun to look at, and as for our local hummers; they seem to love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely feeder","review":"I got this feeder for my husband for Christmas last year, and recently purchased another as a house gift.

It's amazingly simple to clean. (Responding to another review: you have to clean *all* feeders at least once every 2-3 days because the syrup ferments in the heat.) The feeder stands up to wind (I've hung mine with the chain that comes with it, rather than fishing line), and the globes and plastic basins come clean with hot water, baking soda, and a toothbrush. Most importantly, the hummingbirds fight over it. I'm having to order another one to appease them. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Art over functionality","review":"This product is lovely to look at but as soon as the wind blows all the liquid spills over the edges.

Quite frankly, the sound is surprisingly poor. Even my 5 year old Sony sounds better than this.1. Hiss: Listen to the radio and you will get this when the volume is turned on above 3. 2. Bass: It has XBS, but once you turn it on, 'bass' is going to dominate the music. 3. Clarity: For instrumental music such as jazz or classical, this does a decent job. However, when listening to vocal music, the high octaves sound as if someone recorded it using a very dull microphone.All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I think you could spend your [price]on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appears good, but...","review":"I like the compact size and the fact that it performs for a long time on 1 AA battery. But the sound is not that great, and occasionally flickers in and out, which could be the headphones, but they are the ones that came with the unit. My main reason for purchasing a walkman was to listen to the radio on my train ride to work, but the reception outside of NYC is terrible, there isn't even any fuzz, just silence. I have only had this player for 2 months, and just recently when I try to change the band from FM to AM the LCD screen goes blank, and all the stations I programmed into the memory disappear. Very annoying. I am considering sending it back to Panasonic, but that is usually more trouble than its worth. Stick with 2 AA batteries and maybe you will get hear something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"This birdfeeder was not built with quality materials.

It took the birds, including a pair of nesting Cardinals, about one month to become comfortable with it before they began to feed regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squirrels got a good laugh","review":"If you don't have any squirrels at your feeder then this is probably a good buy. The poles are a bit loose when you push them together, not real snug. The plastic feeding tube covers get stuck, those the squirrels have not eaten them off that is.

They easily climb up the metal poles that are included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - breaks easy.","review":"At first glance, this is a nice big feeder with the ability to put 3 different types of seeds in it to feed different types of birds. The birds loved it! But, within 1 week of owning it, the lawnmower knicked it and the pole buckled and the entire thing fell to the ground. I was able to straighten the pole and put it back up (at a crooked angle). Our lawn man knicked it again and this time, when it fell, it broke into many pieces. I had to throw it all away. The lawn guy didn't hit it hard either time. The pole is made very cheaply and will not withstand any time of damage. The feeder itself is cheap plastic and will crack if dropped.For the amount of money this costs, you would think you would receive a better made product.

Far from remastering this album from the orginal tapes- they just ripped it from a vinyl record (and a poor quality record at that!)and threw it on the CD. I swear, if you listen hard enough, you can hear the needle skip and pop. Compare this to Wounded Bird Records,which has just released Grinder Switch's Redwing album, remastered from the tapes with great sound. It's a shame that Cherry Red cheaped out on this release- what other concert has CDB, Willie Nelson, Grinder Switch, Winter Brothers Band and part of Wet Willie?

The answer is, Easy, when it is a smirking anti-Catholic screed like Alan Isler's CLERICAL ERRORS. Mr Isler's protagonist in the book, a rather insufficiently converted Jew turned Roman Catholic priest, misses no opportunity to libel his new religion (although it provides him with a comfy livelihood)and bewail the wrongs done to the people of his birth. Believers are portrayed as ignorant bumpkins or malign pederasts. CLERICAL ERRORS will find its audience among those who want their worst assumptions about Christianity reinforced.To his credit, Mr. Isler has managed to develop a style that is cut-rate Nabokov, although lacking the broad intelligence behind the model.

After I realized this I put light weight oil in the other one which helped but it still burnt up with a fine cut high tooth count blade due to low motor power.

Tough to control with a lightweight hand held drill. Makes a rough hole and does not cut very well in engineered wood like MDF or oriented strand board or even plywood.

The feeder is pretty, but not worth 1/2 star for performance. I purchased 3 of these, 2 for gifts and 1 for myself. I hung mine up in December and it is now the end of March and I am still waiting for the birds to eat out of it. The seed holes are at the bottom and the birds would have to hang upside down to eat. Once the outside seeds are gone, the other seed is stuck in the tube. This is the worst bird feeder I have ever seen and I am sick that I gave them as gifts. One gift has been returned to me becasue the person I gave it to figured out that the birds couldn't eat out it so he never bothered to fill it up. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Feeder is not a Squirrel proof cage...","review":"Unlike the photo, this bird feeder works best with sunflower seeds only (unless you like seeds all over your lawn). Secondly, and most important, this item looks nice but it is not a Squirrel proof cage as advertised in it's name. This is very misleading!!! Until I took elaborate measures, the squirrels had a field day eating the seeds. This made things very frustrating. If this item had some sort of lock down mechanism for the top cover, it may have been more effective. However, the squirrels could simply lift off the top lid and eat to their hearts content. I would have had lower expectations and higher product satisfaction if it were not listed as advertised. The instructions state that you can make this cage squirrel-proof by placing squirrel barriers above and below the feeder, BUT this would be true of any bird feeder!!! In short, false advertising....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!","review":"I purchased 2 of these feeders. First, the squirrels can get into them.

So I fought it continually falling over. Because of an arm injury, I had to use it, so I went to the athletic store and purchased a 5 lb weight which sits on the base and keeps it upright -- inexpensive solution, but a pain. Secondly, when you raise or lower it, the catch doesn't hold well. So when you reach to adjust the angle of the dryer on the flexible neck, the extension rod regularly gives way and collapses. Works in a pinch like I'm in where you only have one arm.

When her relationship with Reyne is more emotionally satisfying and physically arousing she has to accept that she is a lesbian. But even with Reyne she can't find release.It is only with Reyne's support and willingness to wait that Victoria finally finds the courage to shine a light on her repressed past. Victoria's healing happens far more quickly in fiction than real life, which is my only quibble with the story.This is a stirring, emotional story that goes to dark places. But in the end love brings out all the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow going but worth a look","review":"I bought this book as I am a fan of Clare McNab's mysteries and I wanted to see what she could do with a straight romance novel.I liked the book, but wouldn't have called it the best McNab novel I have ever read. I found the story difficult to get into, and the characters were quite unsympathetic for me at first, but I decided to persevere because of my liking of this author.I agree that this book covers issues that most romance novels don't go near, and it should be applauded for that, but I was left, ultimately, unfulfilled by the storyline which closed in too much of a rush for me.That said, I still give it four stars. I think it is just a subjective thing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells good but pricey","review":"I like the natural ingredients and the smell of this product.

I bought this model because there are no zippers, which tend to need replacing every couple of years. Keep in mind that this boot requires breaking-in. You will get sore feet the first couple of times that you wear it. Once that is done, however, you will end up with a unique and personal item that is clearly a cut above the made-in-China stuff you find everywhere else.

The belt centering knob works perfectly, and is very convenient. Everything about this sander seemed to be perfect.Until I changed from a 40 grit to an 80 grit belt. What happens is the chute that the sand dust is fed into clogs. This causes the sander to perform poorly. So the sand never reaches the sandbag, and it dumps out onto the floor or into the belt of the sander. In order to unclog the sander, you have to remove 6 screws, take off one side of the sander, and then clean it out with a wire. What a pain. I am going to take this one back and buy a DeWalt from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belt Sander","review":"Love this belt sander--heavy enough to do a lot of rough sanding but easy enough to manage for smaller and lighter projects too.

These are my admittedly novice impressions of this tool:- A bit difficult to control- Prone to unintentional \\"sanding\\" of objects (e.g., the power cord)- Very, very loud (a high pitched scream)I don't really understand the last one, as my stationary sander is a relatively quiet tool.Needless to say, I have ended up not using this tool as much as I had hoped, but if you have the right application for it, it's probably worthwhile. I generally have the highest regard for PC tools, and this has done everything it claims, and is relatively easy to adjust and change belts.The most memorial moment I've had with this tool was plugging it in once with the switch turned on.

This sander is proof that things get better over time.The power of this sander is perfect. I especially like the variable speed feature. This feature makes it possible to reduce the speed on soft woods to minimize the problem with removing too much material, yet have plenty of power to work quickly on hard woods. The balance of the machine is such that you realize you don't have to hold this sander with a death grip, which reduces arm and shoulder fatigue. It glides over the work. The belt tracking is the best I've ever seen. Put a new belt on, make a minor tracking adjustment with the side knob and forget about belt tracking. This PC sander is of the quality to make this reviewer wonder why I waited so long to get this sander, and convince me to make my next tool a Porter-Cable. I honestly can't imagine a 3X21 belt sander that performs better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to work with","review":"I have spent the last year working on my house, sanding the outside and building a deck in the backyard. This sander has worked great for me. The belt rides very smooth and is easy to change.I have only had one problem with the sander, other than running over the belt which really has more to do with user error. When I have used the sander with very coarse paper, 60 grit, I find that the pathway to the dust bag becomes clogged very easily. It appears that it just gets overloaded with material. Cleaning this out is a fairly involved operation. Almost the entire housing assembly has to be taken apart to clean it out.On the positive side the weight of this sander is not so great that you can't sand vertical surfaces. It worked great on the redwood panels of my house.I would highly recommend this sander for someone who needs a belt sander for home improvement projects. The construction is very sturdy and I expect to get years of service from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"352 sander","review":"My 352 belt sander needs new armature bearings after very light and infrequent use.

Recently I needed it to sand a counter top I was building, so out it came from the tool cabinet. I cut the plastic bands from the box ,hooked up the dust bag ,adjusted the tracking and started sanding. In about 15 minutes the sander began to slow down and sparks were shooting from the brushes. I also was getting an electrical shock from the trigger. I check the Internet for solutions and decided to change the brushes. It destroyed 2 sets of brushes and sparks were still shooting out of the motor. This sander is a piece of crap and I think the dust collection is garbage. The entire motor housing was filled with saw dust when I was sanding. I'm really starting to doubt the quality of porter cable tools. For $200 dollars, I think their quality control should be a lot better. I think I might try a makita next time. Always try a new power tool when you get it before you put it away.

Effectively, the 9444VS kit is now the same as the 9444 with the exception of the tool itself. I was lucky enough to purchase the last kit in the store that was not down graded.Upon taking the tool to the job site, I have been pleased with the tool's performance and versatility. The variable speed plus the lengthened stroke found in the VS model warrants the 30% increase in price over the 9444 even after the kit down grade. I was able to get into all locations by changing the profile accordingly.

Makes a good night light for the kitchen during, but that is about it, haven't even caught a mosquito yet and it is close to a outside door."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"I had a phorid fly problem that seems unsolvable up until I started using this product. after just one week, the phorid flies living inside the house disappear and the ones that keep coming in were being trapped immediately. I strongly recommend this product. It traps a wide variety of insects -including ants!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT attract fruit flies","review":"I bought this trap because I specifically have a problem with fruit flies, especially around my parrot cage, and was sick of paying $7 ea for the fruit fly lure traps (which DO work). It says in the product description that it attracts fruit flies. It does not.I put this trap mere feet away from my bird cage where every morning I see dozens of fruit flies in a cloud flying around the cage. Yet, close inspection shows that not a SINGLE fruit fly has been attracted to and caught in this trap. It has, however, caught probably every fungus gnat in my house.I'll give it a couple of stars because it does attract some pests however I'm very disappointed that it doesn't attract the pests for which I bought it and for which it is listed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-toxic and very effective","review":"I was looking for a solution to the gnats and flies that seem to find their way into the house. Because we have a dog and two cats, I didn't like using airborne sprays and have to be careful about general pest treatments.The Fly Web Fly Trap was the perfect solution. Odorless and non-toxic, any gnats or flies that come into the house seem to head right for it. We use it as a night-light in the bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near Light","review":"No where in the product description did it say to place this product away from windows or light. I have had this plugged in for 4 hours and haven't trapped even 1 gnat ! And, we have them everywhere.We had to wait a couple of weeks for this to arrive and it's going right back. I guess that is why it only came with 1 sticky board. You won't need anymore than 1, if even that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recomend!","review":"I purchased this lamp having great hopes. I turned it in last night for the first time as there was some mosquito in my bedroom. But he was just careless!!He was bitting around and i was trying to sleep with that and with the fact that this lamp has so bright light it makes a day light in the room! There is no way that you can sleep that way.It's not worth for the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"The Fly Web Fly Trap did not work with miraculous results for me. Some flies were stuck to the paper but certainly not all of them. I was rather disappointed with the poor results after reading all the other positive reviews. Its poor performance coupled with the fact that it then cost nearly forty dollars (it has conveniently been reduced to $29.95) does not warrant a stellar review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fruit Flies, Maybe, Fly-Flies, Not So Much","review":"I bought this and set it next to the trash can, but it doesn't seem to be able to lure or catch house flies -- perhaps the glue is not strong enough. It does catch fruit flies and other tiny flying things, but it's not doing the job it advertised and is not worth the money it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price - big design flaw","review":"So far I haven't caught any flies with this device. My main gripe is that since you should put it in a dark room to attract the flies to it, I wanted to put it in the kitchen at night. But in any room, you probably wouldn't want to run it all day as they recommend a darkened room. Also, you might want to conserve the bulbs for use only at optimum time (night). So WHY IS THERE NO ON/OFF SWITCH???!! This device is bigger than it looks in the picture and a little bulky so you really don't want to be having to plug it and unplug it all the time. For the price, they should have included a basic off switch. They could have included more than one glue board as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"I have had this trap/light on the wall for about2 weeks and It hasn't trapped ONE FLY!Meanwhile the flys are taunting us for being so dumbas to buy this thing.I contacted Pest Mall but have not received an answer.Their service was fine - arrived quickly and packagedwell and it lights up.Too bad as it just does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of money!","review":"This product is a huge waste of money.

Not burnt out. Not broken (at least not the glass). The bulb plugs in with two pins. Those pins are soldered (or crimped) to the wires on the bulb. Someone obviously was asleep at the wheel when this one was made and inspected because the leads were pulled completely out of the pins which are intact inside the socket. No way to extract them and reconnect them to the wires on the bulb. Can't replace the bulb because the pins for the original bulb are stuck in place. So basically this thing is COMPLETELY useless. Also, the internal workings of the lamp are loose apparently. I can feel them shifting around whenever I move this thing. Totally unacceptable work.This is going straight back to Amazon for a refund. I'm not giving this company a chance to send me another shoddy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really work...","review":"We had a TON of flys in our home and they were driving me crazy! This product had the best reviews and so I was excited about getting it and ridding my house of flys. Well after two weeks of having it in the home it has only caught 1 fly, 4 fruit flys and a moth. This is a pretty pricey fly trap to end up not working. It also is SO BIG and awkward to find a plug for. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to its billing","review":"Didn't work- few bugs here and there but nothing to get excited about.

Should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. Per advice of other reviewers, I put it in a dark place where the problem is worst, but after several days it hasn't caught a single fly. Will try it in another location and update this review if it works better there. I'm not optimistic, though.

In the first couple of days the fly trap has taken care of 90% of the gnats, but we still have a few around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical, but it works :)","review":"It works AT NIGHT. If it worked during the day I would give it 5 stars... but obviously with all the clarity the lamp doesn't really have an effect on the insects. Anyway, it's a GREAT way to keep your house off bugs, specially if you don't want to use poison/sprays. I even took a picture of mine full of bugs but I guess Amazon doesn't let us post pictures. It also works as a night light, which is nice. Anyway... I would definitely recommend it.PS. Don't make the same stupid mistake I did and just place the paper there without removing the cover so it exposes the adhesive part. It took me a couple of days to realize that was why bugs weren't sticking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work.","review":"In theory, this should work amazingly. I live in a house that sits directly on the water, with eleven sliding glass doors that let bugs in constantly. In fact, I annoyingly have two flies dancing around my head as I write this.At night, if we leave a light on, we usually get about ten bugs all competing to get close to it. However, we plugged this blue light in and the bugs don't really seem to care about it.We leave it on all day and especially all night. We are careful to turn off every other light so that the bugs only flock to this light, but it's only caught a few mosquitos. Laughable really, considering the amount of flies and bugs that get inside and annoy us all day.All in all, it's been up for two weeks and I'm still swatting at these annoying flies with my electric tennis racket that I picked up at Ocean State Job Lot for five bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the chrysanthemum juice instead","review":"By chrystanthemum juice I mean pyrethrum products such asCB-80 Extra Contact Aerosol 17 oz. DDT is not very toxic to humans, but this stuff is much less toxic, in fact less toxic than caffeine or aspirin, more potent as an insecticide, acts faster, and unlike DDT does not threaten the environment. It is a highly biodegradable natural flower extract which does not accumulate in tissues or the environment and causes no harm to mammals or birds. To me it smells like an old floral cachet, but flies seem to hate the smell, and they not only die very quickly, without spasming and buzzing on the floor, they run for the exits and stay away in droves. As an inside spray, the stuff is magic. The Fly Web Fly Trap will catch a few flies, but if you have a big enough problem to buy it in the first place it's probably too big to help you much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insect killer","review":"The thing is bigger and brighter than I expected, but it catches flying insects, and does it well.

This takes care of most flying insects, no matter the size. The refill strips are pretty cheap, and they last about a week and a half during the summer (Because they fill up).

I plugged one in the library and another in the kitchen on the main floor. These flytraps caught a few the first night then they really went to work (I have attached my photos after three weeks of leaving them plugged in. The gnat problem is solved thanks to these flytraps. They lean slightly when you plug them in, but nothing that stops them from working great. They also serve as a night light.

I would definitely recommend these since I am about to order two more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one works","review":"We were bothered by little fruit flies and gnats in our house for months.

Consider Nothing Else!","review":"If you've got fruit flies, we've tried a lot of stuff and wished someone had told us to get this first. It's simple -- just put the fly paper in and plug it in. It's like a night light for the kitchen too. I'd write a longer review but it's just that easy and we all know what a pain fruit flies are.

No big deal, I thought, I'll just put it back in. So far all attempts to reinsert the bulb have been fruitless, rendering this product completely unusable. I'm returning it now.Read the other negative reviews, this thing is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the flypaper worked","review":"After reading the great reviews I purchased this to deal with a fruitfly problem in my kitchen. The Fly Trap turned out to be pretty much totally ineffective -- we set it up so it had a place as far away from natural light as possible (though during daytime our kitchen gets enough ambient light that this wasn't really possible) and left the light on all night & day for a week. The trap caught a total of 4 fruit flies which given the number of flies we had at the time was pretty much random chance. The unit was expensive, much bigger than I imagined, and didn't help me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time on this...","review":"After reading the 40+ positive reviews and seeing pictures of peoples' success with the product; I thought this might work.

Definitely going to return this since I am not satisfied.*edit*I also wanted to let you folks know that it only comes with one sticky card.

Fly Web may seem expensive but it was well worth the cost! Within 3 days, 99% of the fruit flies had been caught. The entire glue sheet was full and we had to replace it and order more that very week! We also caught mosquitos, beetles, and house flies. However, there is a trick. As the instructions state, this fly trap works best in complete darkness. You need to attract the flies to the trap with the uv light and if there is a competing light source, even if it is outside, you will not catch the bugs as quickly. This will also not work during the day unless it is in something covered (we used placed it in the glass bottle recycling container)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for house flies","review":"I bought this fly trap after many house flies (not fruit flies) suddenly appeared in my New York apartment.

Looks ridiculous in the apartment. AND lights up the entire room, which is pretty annoying in itself.Only comes with one sticky sheet, which is really unfortunate.

It's also an enjoyable quick read that will make you think differently about what you do in your own mind as you go about your day to day life. The author's vignettes are not made up (as the first reviewer says), just disguised so that individual patients are not exposed and identifiable.

First, I needed to go buy 2 \\"watch-type\\" batteries for the counter to work. Also, you need a pretty small screwdriver to be able to remove the screws holding the counter mechanism onto the ball.The battery cover doesn't close securely, so a medium hard bump will move the batteries, and shuts the counter off. You then need to remove the counter mechanism, and open and close the batter cover. I regret spending the $[...] for the batteries.We thought that even though the counter mechanism doesn't work, we could use it as a small soccer ball just to kick around. Even that didn't prove to be an option. There is a foam \\"frame\\" on top of the counter mechanism (I guess to protect the counter). But, it ends up coming off once the ball is kicked. Once that happens, the ball wobbles when it rolls over the spot with the missing foam frame.Unfortunately, this is heading right for the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thomas jefferson and sally hemings","review":"REED DESPERATE FOR IDENTITY.

While this is not a book aimed at programmers, you should be interesting in learning more about HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).If you're a technical writer, I think it's worthwhile to learn these technologies. Think of it as an investment in yourself. Even if you do use a HAT, the knowledge you gain from this book will help you to produce better results with fewer headaches. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product !","review":"My 7 year old daughter has wheelies but has wanted inline skates for awhile. She loves the versatility of these.

It looks like a direct transfer from a crappy video copy. Plus numerous killing seens are completly butchered and censored!! I love this film but if you are planning on buying it buy the one with the original cover of the girl with the backback. Solid widescreen transfer looks excellent and all kill scenes are fully intact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP COPY OF A GREAT FILM!!","review":"Not only is this a crap still shot on the cover from Sleepaway Camp 3, not 2, but the film inside is edited.

Tits and blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"*COULD NOT WATCH-VERY BAD QUALITY!*","review":"This might have been a good movie,however I never got to find out cause the darn dvd is junk.You can not hear the people talking in the movie but you hear the background noise.So I was very disappointed.Stay away or you might get one that is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Music Note in It!","review":"Be aware that this book does not have a single musical note in it! I ordered 30 copies for a production I am directing and when the book came, it is only the dialogue and the lyrics to the music. You can download that much from the internet! I don't know why the other reviewers talk about it being a vocal score. It has no music in it. If you want to get a vocal score, this is not your ticket. Besides, this book is a copy of another book. Amazon says the book is 48 pages long, but the script is only 20 pages and the other pages are blank. I am sending this back and getting the Shirmer edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really a book","review":"Just so you know before you buy, this is only the chorus book.

The author, whose Malice Towards None was brilliant, takes terrific poetic license. Reading his book is like learning Plain Speaking (about Harry Truman). We later learned that the author was not even working from audio tape, just his impressions. Also, be careful reading the above reviews. Juxtaposing the abortion argument with this book is to miss the point of the buildup to the war. The abortion/civil war analogy is silly and unsupportive. Don't get caught up in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a real page turner!!","review":"Oates has been able to seamlessly combine historical facts with well-reasoned, insightful extentions of the speakers thoughts and motives.In order to understand one of the most important chapters in American history, it is imperative to not only read the documents left behind, but to delve into the thoughts and motives behind those documents. Oates has done this in an easy-to-read, yet historiclly accurate tome.This is a must read for all those wishing to know why the Civil War was an inevitable chapter in American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good on the politics of ONE of the causes of the WBTS","review":"I was skeptical of this book when I read in the preface that Oates was going to tell us what the key players said and what \\"they might have said\\". However, I was very pleased with the even handedness and accuracy of his content. The style of the book proved refreshing and placed the chronological events into an interesting weave. HOWEVER, he leads the reader to believe that slavery and its politics was the ONLY reason for the eventual conflict. The resulting carnage was a product of many more and very complicated factors of which we should all be aware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cleanser","review":"I actually got this for my dogs.

Her partner, Rosanna arranges mostly classical PSB tunes with a modern flair and tempo which still shows deference to the originals.All of the songs are worthy tributes, but those that rise above mere reproduction are Domino Dancing, Jealasy, and Love comes quickly.

At first look the Porter-Cable Profile sander looked like it would fit the bill. After 4 months the sander died. I sent it off to be repaired but had to have a replacement quick. I stepped up to the plate and bought a Fein detail sander. What a difference!! The guy at my local tool shop (and repair shop) said they do not sell the Porter-Cable anymore due to all the problems they were having!! I will keep mine for a backup but I love the Fein. Another problem I had with the Porter-Cable is that the pad that holds the sanding paper on wears out quickly. I realize I may use mine more than a weekend sawdust maker but I have found it is worth buying the best...and for a detail sander..in my openion, isn't the Porter-Cable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful sander","review":"I have been using this sander for the last eight months. It has been a tremendous tool in many ways. The many different fittings for spindles, corners, tight spaces etc.. have been great.

While the song selection is fantastic, it leaves something to be desired. If you have all of his previous releases, you already have all of the songs on Wild Birds. This is definitely a great album for someone just discovering the talents of Peter Murphy - or for a situation that your cd amount is limited - like when travelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get me wrong!","review":"Some supposed fans did not buy the album for sure as they did not see \\"All night long\\" song on the album?? It is on mine (track 11) and was the major reason why I have bought it. This song is really awsome with french speaking in it (done like an extract of Zelda game). Also, there is not 5 but 4 songs from \\"Cascade\\" album.His major songs are on there \\"Cuts you up\\", \\"Indigo eyes\\",\\"Subway\\", \\"Roll call\\" and a new \\"Jemal\\" version. Unfortunately for me,\\"Marlene Dietrich's favorite poem\\" is missing.All his artistic talents on one album."},{"rating":"2","title":"wild birds takes flight....","review":"this is the album to buy if you are a hardcore peter murphy fan or even remotely curious about the work of this goth king. here we find some of the greatest solo work ever recorded by ex-frontman for the famous goth band bauhaus and it should come as no surprise his work has been highly underrated or overlooked. at times, his voice reminded me of neil diamond perhaps or perhaps even david bowie at times. here we have every song which in my opinion could've or should've received massive play on mtv or radio for that matter and even the oddities which may not garner much attention but nevertheless are extremely beautiful and deep. only slight disappointment i have here is the absence of great songs like strange kind of love or perhaps marlene dietrich's favorite poem. having said that, i do love this cd and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbearable","review":"The story of Paddy Doyle's life is unbearably tragic. The book is well worth reading. While I believe the story is true, I do question some of the facts. Mainly -- the book implies that Doyle's physical problems are the result of the surgeries performed on him. However he writes on his website that he suffers from generalized dystonia. It just made me question some of the book.However, it appears that he does many good works for those with disabilities and is an inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The God Squad","review":"\\"The God Squad\\" by: Paddy Doyle is an extremely well written book that took me through the whole range of human emotion. I laughed, cryed, was angry and happy as the author led me through his life from 4 1/2 years old through the epilogue. It is a book that I could not cast aside to finish later.....the 236 pages were rapidly devoured in a few hours. I recommend it very highly to everyone. The education, alone, is very well worth the price that one would pay for ANY book!....No wonder that it was a best seller in the United Kingdom. It will hit the USA in a big storm too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Coming from a Engineering background, a lot of the examples in other texts were a bit dry. What I needed was a book that I could use to solve Engineering type problems. This book did not disappoint and I would say that not only is it the best book for Engineers to learn C++ in, it is the best book for anyone to learn C++ in. If you need a good Engineering applications book for C++ this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not address needs of engineers and scientists","review":"Engineers and scientists use multidimensional arrays extensively. One of the real deficiencies of C and C++ is that multidimensional arrays are not built into the language (at least not in the sense of Fortran or Ada). Because of this deficiency, you must use frequent workarounds when trying to write functions that handle multidimensional arrays in which any or all dimensions might vary. Unfortunately, the Bronson book does not even indicate that such a problem exists, let alone address workarounds. The Barton book, Scientific and Engineering C++, although it is somewhat dated, is a much better book for engineers and scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"The order took a month to arrive","review":"Hate the seller (textbooksnow) and strongly suggest everyone not to purchase from this seller at all.

I found it lacking in questions I needed answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"characters have no morals","review":"I was so disappointed in reading this book! As a native of Alabama, I almost took it personal when reading about the ladies in the sewing circle. In my experience with quilt guilds and sewing circles, the ladies I know have always been LADIES, not like the women portrayed in this book. I know this is a work of fiction, and I say...Thank Goodness. I think the author could have done a much better job in the women's personalities. I regret that I spent the money to purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This book is an outgage to anyone from Alabama and the south. This author should never be allowed in the state. The books principles are outdated as well as the characters ways of thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, but could use a re-write","review":"I have read Lois Battle before, and thought her a very good writer indeed, but she needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. From characters who slip in and out without being well developed, to stating that Agnes Scott College, one of the finest women's colleges in the country, is nothing more than \\"a southern ladies' school...that's not a first-rate college\\", Ms. Battle shows that she has not taken the time necessary to write a really good book. The bones are there...she just needs to put some flesh on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I loved this book. I could not get enough of these characters. This was my first Lois Battle's book and I look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful, spirit-lifting book","review":"As a 44 year AL native, I'm astounded at the negative reviews from other Southerners! I found the characters and events genuine and lovable. I recognized so many of the characters from my years of living in Birmingham.....the Duke, his superficial, stunted wife, the tough factory women, the oppressed divorcee learning to take care of herself for the first time in her life! I've known them all! This is a great read no matter what your choices in life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny southern girl stuff...","review":"If you are a GRITS (girls raised in the south) you have to get a kick out of this book. It is well written and funny. It may seem offensive to someone who's not a southerner, but I think the author presents an honest look at her subject matter. Almost as good as Bed and Breakfast, but not quite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for this book to end","review":"This book was nothing like I thought it would be - very disappointing to me. I expected more interaction between the main character and the women she was trying to help. I thought the writer spent way too much time on Bonnie's love life. And like another reviewer wrote, it was bothersome that she left the dog alone so much. The only reason I finished it is because I bought it - if it had been a loaner, I would have put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern women in Alabama","review":"Bonnie Duke Cullman had it all - a wealthy husband, beautiful Atlanta home, and smart children. Then one day her husband Devoe decides to take a walk and the dream life she had is over. In Florabama, Alabama a group of blue-collar ladies in the local manufacturing facility, Cherised Lady, is hit with a plant closing. Bonnie Duke Cullman needs a job and the Florabama, Cherished Lady women need jobs too. Bonnie heads to Florabama to work as a career counselor at a local college and the Cherished Lady women head to the local college to retrain for new jobs.The Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary & Sewing Circle is born under Bonnie's tutelage and slowly Bonnie and her ladies come full circle in their lives. This is a good southern story about strong women who don't know they are strong until adversity strikes.Enjoyable and fun reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author needed to consider the canine character","review":"Ok, for the most part, I liked the story and the characters. I enjoy Southern stories and Southern women. What I had a hard time with was how Bonnie's dog, a PUPPY, no less, was left for hours and hours ALONE. And I just read on page 300, how the dog, Nesha, \\"gave Bonnie a tail-wagging welcome\\", and Bonnie snaps at him saying, \\"Oh, just shut up and sit down.\\" This makes me angry. If one is going to use animal characters in a novel, one should respect the animal character as much as the human ones. I currently have this at 3 stars. I'm going to change that to 2 and not buy this author's books again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted more closure, but good book.","review":"This was light reading, and kept me interested all the way through. It's basically a story about several ladies who have been laid off and they are all having a tough time financially. The character who helps them is a divorcee from a rich family who doesn't want to rely on her father for income. So she takes a job as an adviser at a small college that has received grant money to enroll the jobless women in college courses.Like any story, there are personality differences and some tough times along the way. But most of the ladies get along well and the ending is fairly satisfactory. There were a couple of loose ends that weren't quite tied up though, so that's the reason I subtracted a star. I would be happy to see a sequel to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the South Alabama I know","review":"I really wanted to like this book. When I started to read it, I was shocked to find that the setting was the community college my mother and I both attended. My mother, my grandmother and I were all born in this area. My aunt ran a sewing machine in the mill that moved to Mexico. In short, this book hardly rings true. It read like the impressions of an outsider looking in. This is not the book to teach someone about women in the South, especially not women in the new South. It sells short the fascinating and colorful women of the Alabama Gulf Coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but dull...","review":"I read this novel with a lot of anticipation because I had read positive reviews in the newspapers. Lee writes gracefully but I just got tired of Hara's carefully-wrought observations and the generally quiet, monotonous pace of the narrative. I began sympathizing with Hara's daughter. I wanted to get away from him, too! I also found the melodramatics near the end a bit too heavy-handed. The tale within the tale was intriguing but I felt I entered a totally different novel. I finished this novel out of obligation, as I try to read all new fiction by Asian American writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations Dashed","review":"I had very high expectations for this book. After meeting the author at a book signing in Boston a year ago, I eagerly awaited for the arrival of his follow-up to Native Speaker. A Gesture Life seems fragmented in its goals and I had trouble getting into the narrative. I found the main character unsympathetic and the overall plot wayward and unfocused."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpraised","review":"Gesture life gets my nomination for the most overpraised work of literature in recent years. P.C. or not, I question whether the work would have received a fraction of the accolades had it not been written by an otherwise very talented Asian-American man, but admit it: gesture life is ponderous and rather dull. One can sympathize intensely with the suffering of the type of people portrayed without agreeing that the book is particularly entertaining. A must-read only for those who feel they \\"must.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed","review":"Like pulling teeth, \\"Gesture Life\\" is a book that has garnered many accolades from both the press and my book-loving friends. Save your time! This story is so disjointed and obtuse that making sense of it will give you a headache. Sunny is the only believable character in the story, but he seems a mere afterthought until the metaphors are finally played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Shockingly overrated. Gesture Life has been garnering accolades from so many critics - this reader has only one question : why? There is nothing exceptional about this story. It is pretentious, self-righteous, and sanctimonious. The characters are amazingly one-dimensional, and the self-congratulatory structure makes it almost painfully difficult to read. From a thematic point of view, it explores almost nothing new and lacks originality. Overall, an irritating novel which doesn't deserve a single measure of the superfluous praise it has received"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"This book is stagnated with slow pace and overly crafted form of writing. The character are sparse and non physical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee is a masterful storyteller!","review":"\\"A Gesture Life\\" is told in such simple language, that one hardly realizes how deliberately it is written. The book draws you in from the first instant and keeps you there. It is a heartfelt tale and \\"Doc Hata\\" is a very sympathetic character. The only part I couldn't quite accept is the Doc's level of language--as a Japanese immigrant he speaks a little too American. Other than this, I find \\"A Gesture Life\\" flawless. It's a very satisfying and thought-provoking read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gesture Life - A Nod in a Hurricane","review":"(On behalf of the Revolving Door Book Club) He had a capped life with proper gestures, but look how desolate his life really was by never reaching out with his feelings. However, some strong insights to a sometimes closed culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonished","review":"I thought this book was astonishing and in fact came to the reviews to see what others thought. I was surprised at the discrepancy in views. For me the book was like living another person's life and a very profound and moving experience. I will recommend the book highly to others and will be very curious to see if the experience of those who read it parallels my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"'A Gesture Life' compares favorably with recent releases set in the WWII era. It is as fascinating as 'The Triumph and the Glory', every bit as insightful as 'The Emperor's General', yet written is a fresh style from a rare perspective. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carefully crafted work of art","review":"I have enjoyed this book and admire its author for the stimulating plot and vivid depiction of both what was witnessed and what was felt by Franklin Hata.This kind of novel must be treated with care however. Issues surrounding the \\"comfort women\\" - those Japanese, Korean and other Asian women recruited to work in Japanese frontline brothels during WWII - has been hugely politicized and sensationalized. The issues, and books/films about them, have been used not only as legitimate guide into this tragic event in history but also as a way to vent prejudice and hate against today's Japan and Japanese people. We must not succumb to the temptation of racially-charged Japan-bashing again. We must, however, ensure to keep \\"comfort women\\" part of our historical remembrance and vow to respect the human rights of every individual at all times - even during the most bitter and bloody war.Overall Lee has written a book worth reading -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written!","review":"Downside is that it is less a cohesive novel with a plot and a beginning, middle and end and more a collection of exercises in writing, albeit beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I don't understand why so many people found his writing style so interesting. Lee writes in fragments; it's like listening to Dan Quyale! I grew tired of having to re-read paragraphs to figure out what he is trying to say in her muddled dribble. This is not unique and interesting; it's a total disregard for correct grammar. Other than the awful prose, the book was painfully boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"too laboring","review":"There are books that you can just eat each pages off of and there are books like A Gesture life, where every page is a painful reminder that you just wasted your time and money. I really wanted to like this book because i liked Lee's Native Speaker, but this one proves to be a curse of the sequel projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love it or you hate it","review":"Chang Rae Lee did an excellent job in what he set out to do. The story that revolves around an aging Korean/Japanese man might not involve an action packed plot like Tom Clancy's novels, but that is only understandable. I feel that Lee has written a remarkable story that interjects some very important insights to Asian American sensibilties. It certainly can not and does not claim to represent Asian American life in a nutshell, but some of the aspects have been seemless addressed and shared and he comes across very honest. And, it is not surprising that some people just really don't like the story. This usually happens when people don't like a particular subject matter no matter how it is written."},{"rating":"2","title":"lot of comments, that's good","review":"Lot of critics on this book. It's like kimchee, you either love it or hate it. It amazes me though that most of the low comments are from Japan. Calling comfort women history- over exaggerated. Does that tell you something of how Japan views WW 2 history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Memories","review":"A Gesture Life describes a painful secret life of Hata, whose life is a series of varnished externalities. Like the protagonist, this book is nothing but a series of polished sentences and emotional triggering events. I bet Harlequin Romance reader would enjoy this sappy attempt at a historical subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Talent","review":"I must confess that I started reading the book because it waswritten by a New Talent Prize winner. After I finished the book I am still trying to figure out which are the artistic merits of the work. Sadly this is the type of book which you can leave to rest in your night table for weeks without feeling any particular need to end it, nor any particular desire to make it last. All the characters are surrounded by an overwhelming sadness, which is certainly understandable due to times in which they are living, so all of them are rather gray and dull. The author in order to compensate for this lack of \\"spark\\" within its novel, places a sex slave which becomes the center of the action, with such a bad luck that the only parts of the plot which are good are those which have nothing to do with the story. Its a pity, I hate to loose my faith on the taste of the Jury who chooses the New Talent of Literature. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book","review":"This is the worst book I ever tried to read! I just don't get it. Maybe it is a sign of my literary ignorance. I tried to read , but it was too painful to endure. For me, the book had no redeeming qualities - not the characters, the plot (or lack thereof), or the writing style. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a short story","review":"Franklin Hata was a profoundly annoying and pathetic character. I think that the author is trying to portray him as a thoughtful, sensitive, good man yet his actions portray him as one lacking strength of character and the ability to love. He let so many opportunities to love and to understand others pass him by that I found him to be a pain in the neck. Maybe a focus on plot instead of character would have saved this book - that's why I would have probably enjoyed it in a short story format."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"I found this to be one of the worst books i have ever read in my life. It is almost impossible to follow the storyline as the main characters perspective is amazingly introverted and scenes are sometime fragmented causing confusion.

Yukio Mishima is immeasurably superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"hearsays","review":"this book was on the libirary selections so me being an Asian and the writer himself being one, i immediately picked it up and read it. i was very dissapointed with his use of bad history to write a novel based on total hearsays."},{"rating":"1","title":"I resent being called an \\"Asian-American\\"","review":"It's just like being called a 'minority'. These phrases are used to further balkanize human beings into little tribes. I may have Asian descendants, but who cares? Mr. Lee does not speak on behalf of me nor do other self-appointed Asian-Americans. I'm a Human Being, first. An American, second. And probably a Basketball Player, third. (I'm 6'3, which is too tall for some tribes)If you are going to label me, label me this: TALL-GOOD-LOOKING AMERICAN OF ASIAN ANCESTRY WHO HATES BEING CALLED ASIAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel Which Provides Welcome Cultural Insights","review":"Lee has managed to produce a skillfully written novel which contains riveting flashbacks to the major character's moral conflicts as a Japanese officer in Asia during the second World War but which, for the most part,focuses on his subsequent triumphs, after relocating in the Ubnited States in a suburban town as a small business man.However his business successes are tainted with personal disappoinments and agonies as a father of an adopted multiraciasl daughter. What emerges is a life with various successes and defeats of a highly principled but fundamentally lonlely man and his triumphant final gesture in a country which offered him refuge from the personal pains he would have endured in Japan as a native born man of Korean ancestry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling story skillfully told","review":"With tender descriptive words which flow almost effortlessly but with great skill, Lee has written a moving story of cultural alienation, loneliness and pathos of a transplanted Japanese-Korean who starts life anew in a small town in America. Treadng lightly,as if sensitive to possibly unleashing the full fury of prejudice against Asians, his main character, Doc Hata, succeeds in business but fails as an adopted father and in his latter years, while recovering from an accident, has to cope with his morally questionable role as an officer in the Japanese Army during the war.It is easy to see why this novel has received such high praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfying","review":"I really wanted to like this new book by Mr. Lee because Ienjoyed his previous book The Native Speaker. Unlike his earlier work,his vision and insights are unclear and meandering in this one. Ithink this is due to Mr Lee's tendency to rely soley on his writing technique of invoking reader's emotions by his subtle style of writing. These techniques can only go so far to satisfy a literature lover like me. It's like painting a bright color outside of a house yet inside it's a shamble. As this book shows, the novel can not be soley dependent on techniques and execution of styles but also requires the innate talent and insights of bold new imaginations, which along with this book and many other books lack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peculiar","review":"Gesture life is an akward follow up to his previous book, the Native speaker. The protagonist of this book spent his whole life as an outsider to his country and his residence: the theme follows the dull retrace of Hata's conflicting psyches. This book might have worked if it were a spy novel, but as a literary tryout, i found this book to be a total time waister."},{"rating":"2","title":"explosion of trauma","review":"Lee's book is so quiet--there's a quiet store, a quiet house, a quiet neighborhood, and it seems even quiet inside the mind. The quiet is described and depicted with grace, so it is a very complex and interesting zone. I wondered how such peace was maintained--what was the price of this tension. One reason I found the book so powerful is connected to how the tension is exploded and what the tension ends up being. As a person interested in trauma and war, I found Lee's development of those themes among the best I have read. It has a completely different feel from D.M. Thomas's White Hotel, but something of its shock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help and the correct derailleur hanger. thanks","review":"My bike is a k2 ZED sport and the number on the derailleur hanger was the one that the books say needed a little diferent derailleur hanger from the one here.I used it anyway and it works great. the only diference is that it makes the derailleur set a little bit forward. this works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but big","review":"I won't rate it badly because its a beautiful, quality product, but size was an issue, this thing is 6 inches around! only for those with experience and looking to test limits, i'll hold on to it but for now i'm content with the slimmer niagara. still, a quality product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly overpriced!","review":"I have the UR3 strap on dildo from Doc Johnson and I like it a lot because it's super soft and feels like real skin (I think some brands call it cyberskin). The only problem is that it's not stiff enough, certainly not as stiff as the real thing. This dildo says its made from 2 different kinds of silicones, so I thought it would be just like the UR3 but with a stiffer core. It is stiffer, but the outer layer of silicone just isn't soft enough for me. I also wish the dildo was a little slimmer with a more pronounced head. I thought I was a fan of the Tantus brand, but so far the only product of theirs that I love is the Feeldoe. Oh, one last complaint...our revolution dildo had a small nick in the silicone when we got it and I'm afraid that bacteria may hide there even if I wash it thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big","review":"Liked the feel of the material of the product, but the circumference was larger than expected (seemed to be larger than avertized)6 inches around.

It was purchased as a gift, arrived damaged and, after going around a bit and being told it was our responsibility to swallow the shipping, it cost us quite a lot to send it back.So it was never actually used - which is why the rating isn't really fair to the product.

Fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most underated soul singers of all time","review":"Bobby Patterson is like so many other soul artists from the 60's and 70's who never got their due credit. This CD contains all of Bobby's work while he was with John Abdnors Abnak/Jetstar label in Dallas, TX. The CD is full of very class 60's soul sides that cover the many different styles of the era. What is so unique about Bobby is that not only does he sing but he also writes his own material, something quite uncommon of the era. One track was a minor hit in 1969 \\"TCB or TYA\\". What is even better is the flipside of that single \\"What a wonderful night for love\\". Other good sides include \\"I'm in love with you\\" and \\"Till you give in\\". This CD is a must own for any fan of the genre, or for anyone who would like to dig a little deeper into soul music than their uncle's Otis Redding collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless...","review":"The product description above is very misleading, because it suggests that this product can replace a jump-start.

What it can do is to slowly charge your car battery and let it store enough power to give high current for a second.Apparently, if your car battery can't hold the charge, it wouldn't work; if it's very weak, it takes longer to charge. And if you try to turn on the engine before the car battery is ready, you've just wasted all the juice from the jumper to the car battery, and may well blow any chance for this thing to work.There's nothing on the market that you can plug into the cigarette light socket and start the car instantly.

It is sad that a series and characters that I once liked has become so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad day","review":"A very sad day to report a Patricia Cornwell book is not worth the effort of even finishing it. I love this author and the charactors - well I can't say that is true anymore. I could not get past the first 3 chapters without shuting the book in disgust. The characters I loved are now so unrecognizable to me now. Cornwell has taken the most interesting aspects of each one of them and twisted them into bloody pulp. I was going to give this book away, but do not want to inflict it on anyone - so will toss in the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Scarpetta please stand up???","review":"What is going on with Patricia Cornwell and her last few books? I used to love Scarpetta and Marino but I don't even recognize these characters any longer. Everyone is always out to get her...someone is always holding a grudge...she is whiney and moody. And, Marino?? Where did he go? I never really liked Lucy a whole lot but at least she used to be normal. She now seems more psychotic than the people that are after Scarpetta all of the time.I know she has a more recent Scarpetta book out than this one but I just don't think I can go through the motions of reading any more Scarpetta books. They used to be some of my all time favorites but she has really gone downhill. Don't spend your money. I sincerely hope that Patricia Cornwell and her camp read the reviews of her books because if she isn't going to put out another good book, she may as well stop trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad beyond words!!","review":"I've read every one of her early books and loved them all. She's obviously run into a really bad wall. As much as I enjoyed her before, I couldn't get past page 37 on this one. I'm done readng Patricia Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsessively self-critical","review":"Cornwell's books were ground breaking. Gorey, but fascinating. Scientific and well-written. A precursor to CSI...but her more recent books, and Predator in particular, have degenerated into a confused plot of unreasonably intertwined and obsessively self-hating characters. Why does Cornwell think that her characters are so special that all the kooks would be after them? Why does Cornwell have to let us know every unhappy, angry, twisted, and often irrelevant thought of each character? Cornwell seems most interested in the uniform psychology of these damaged and self-destructive has-been characters. The book is painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While the elements of a great novel are here, they just don't come together the way that they do in earlier Scarpetta novels. The main storyline is interesting and there are many intriguing connections between various subplots, but this time around, these elements are largely left hanging for a rather dissatisfying ending. We have loose ends and unanswered questions, vague gestures at both things that happened before this novel began (and after Trace ended), and few suggestions about where things are going, but the the book just stops. I actually wondered if my copy was missing pages.Not Cornwell's best work, to be sure. The novel needs to actually resolve all the issues that are raised instead of just leaving us with what feels like a slapdash ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"This books is terrible....I could barely keep my eyes open while reading; as a Scarpetta book you would think that it would be a spellbinder this book stunk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Kay Scarpetta?","review":"The last few of Patricia Cornwell's books have left alot of us who really cared for Dr Scarpetti and her fictional family wanting to see her regain a little of her old self. This book jumps around and leaves us wondering what happened to not only Kay, but Marino and Lucy as well. I see Kay as someone who would not let Lucy hang in limbo and she would also get Marino back on track. I finished it only to see if I'd change my mind. My mother and sister agree with me. So hopefully the next one will show more intereaction between the main characters. Here's hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"What a bore. I couldn't be more happy now that I am finally finished reading this one. What a waste of time. Nothing made sense. Everything was left hanging in the air. And there was too much going on at once.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"...leaves this reader wishing money better spent\\"","review":"Loved most of Cornwell's books since Body Farm....with the exception of Isle of Dogs, Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross...all below par.Predator is the worst Scarpetta one so far. All her characters are losing their identities as though some alien force is at work. Never liked Lucy anyway but now she's a robot. How far can Patricia Cornwell go before she reaches bottom? One more Scarpetta relapse and that'll do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm outta here","review":"Predator is somewhat better than Blowfly, but I am done with Patricia Cornwell. I sent Blowfly back to the publisher saying it was a disgrace. No acknowledgement or comment. Predator is a poorly written book to say the least. My suspicion is that the few 4-star and 5-star ratings are likely to be by staff members at Putnam's Sons or relatives of Patricia Cornwell. Thank God I got it from the library. I am thinking of suggesting that our library system not waste their money on Cornwell. Amazon really needs to offer the choice of zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and confused","review":"Have read all of Cornwell's books and unfortunately she does not get better with age. Kay Scarpetta is enjoying a permanent anger and unhappiness with her world and her associates. Not clear why she and Marino are at odds, not clear why Lucy can't confide in her aunt anymore and truly not clear why Scarpetta has to take offense at everyone. Gone is the caring ME she once was. Added to all that, the story has too many holes and no explanations. Who ultimately put the hand prints on the body and why. How did this one character manage to travel back and forth between MA and FL so quickly and what happened to John/Laurel Swift?? Case not solved. Would not buy a hard back of Patricia Cornwell again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to character depth?","review":"The switch to 3rd person has reduced Patricia's novels to \\"ho-hum\\" as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to read ...\\"says Kay Scarpetta...\\" \\"...said Pete Marino\\", etc. I want to know what goes on in Scarpetta's head as she moves through her books, and that's only possible when we hear how SHE feels, what SHE thinks, in her own words! Even if the plot is weak, I can deal with it if it's first person. But, alas, with Trace and with Predator, Cornwell's 3rd person presentation doesn't draw me in at all. Maybe new readers won't miss the original presentations as much as I do. But for me, an avid reader of the Scarpetta series since the beginning, it's been over for me since the last \\"real\\" book, Black Notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful writing","review":"I usually enjoy books by Patricia Cornwell... but this one must have been written by someone else. Normally, I can't put one of her books down until I finish. THIS one, I put down before getting past a couple of chapters. VERY choppy.

The bad news is I got the book and read it before reading the customer reviews here--otherwise, I may not have spent my time reading it.The last couple of books in this series have been mediocre at best. Predator however is the worst! The 'plot' is disjointed and the story vis-a-vis the primary characters is not well developed.

Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator (Kay Scarpetta Mysteries)","review":"I have to agree with all of the other reviews I have been reading about this book.

This I only give 1 as it was awful. I agree with the other critical reviews. The characters are more narcissistic and insensitive, the plot is choppy. Lucy continues with her attraction to psychopaths. Too much time is spent with the torture of the victims. It seems as though the book is an attempt at a depiction of hell without relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I am a long time Cornwell fan but I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is not up to the author's standards. I have enjoyed the Scarpetta series from the start. Here the complex character of Kay is lost to the rapid pacing and short chapters-I felt like I was reading a James Patterson Novel (who I can't stand!). All the great descriptions of Kay working at the crime scene, the great CSI stuff is all missing. I hope this is just blooper and not indicative of future works. I sometimes wonder if authors are being pushed to hard to produce and this might be the result?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this, read Kathy Reiches","review":"I have loved PC books for years but can not believe the drivel she is now printing. This book moves along like a choppy river. It is a disappointment to all of her fans.This book starts out with alot of questions and the same ole characters being completely different people. Lucy has let herself go and just doesn't care, Pete is more of a paranoid jerk, Benton and slightly psychoatic and Scarpetta is a push-over.

It was so bad that I can't believe it was published, despite the author's fame. There were frayed plot threads all over the place. I was offended by the sickening cruelty- it was like reading Dean Koontz.I was once a Cornwell fan.I actually threw this in the trash because I didn't want to inflict it on anyone else. I see that others did the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a new novel","review":"This was sold as a new novel by Patricia Cornwell and it most certainly is not. It is in fact a re-release of a novel with no real addition to the original and for that reason I have given it 1 star. The plot is typical Scarpetta but a bit strained and certainly not one of her best. Had I realized that it was a re-release I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREDATOR (KAY SCARPETTA MYSTERIES)","review":"What a mess!! I have read all of the books in this series and this one is just sloppy and badly written. There are several story lines that just end, no conclusion or explanation. The old characters are all out of their minds or sick or both. I will be very careful before buying another Cornwell book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"Patricia Cornwell's series has been on a downhill slide for several years. The characters in this book were so dysfunctional and nasty that I was hoping that the bad guy would win and put them all (and any future books in this series) out of their misery. I hesitated to buy this book because of the more recent unsatisfying predecessors. I won't hesitate when the next one comes out--not interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop the pain!","review":"I couldn't wait for the book to be over! Scarpetta, Marino, Wesley, and Lucy are churlish and tired; no one seems to like each other anymore, and I didn't like any of them anymore, either! The forensic detail, which used to be interesting in previous Scarpetta books, became overwhelmingly tedious and the book turned into a technical showcase for Cornwell's scientific knowledge rather than an entertaining read. Excrutiating to listen to, and quite unsatisfying when it finally concluded. As my friend, another avid Cornwell listener, commented, \\"I didn't even know they had solved the crime!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"Both the dialogue and plot often felt forced, and failed to hold my interest. The lead characters seemed two-dimensional caricatures who were chronically angry and almost as unappealing as the villains. This contrasts with early books in the series, where Kay Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy and Benton Wesley showed a more believable mixture of human shortcomings and positive atttributes, allowing the reader to care about what happened to them. I wonder if the author herself has grown bored with the characters and story-line, but feels obligated to continue producing Scarpetta books due to the series' best-seller history.Too tedious to be a thriller. Stick with earlier books in the Scarpetta series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Happened to Patricial Cornwell?","review":"Particia Cornwell's Scarpeta series has become increasingly twisted and boring. Her characters, once interesting and intriguing in their unique personalities, have become distant with each other and in fact at times seem to despise each other. They all seemed pathetic. The book didn't seem to have a plot, a poor beginning and an abrupt ending. I finished the book but I wonder why? It was a waste of time and money and I won't be buying anymore of Cornwell's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"I too had decided not to buy any more Cornwell books, but found myself purchasing this anyway. This was the worst of the worst. The violence of her \\"predator\\" was so over the top I found it really unpleasant to read. The book had a very poorly constructed plot and never developed anything leading to an interesting ending. So bad was the ending that I found myself wondering a few days later if I had finished the book or not. The character of Kay is so full of herself, Lucy is so not likeable and whatever is going on with the cop....I have no idea. Save your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad!","review":"Patricia Cornwell has written some terrific Kay Scarpetta thrillers. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The plot is impossible to follow (even though I really wanted to) and the characters have morphed into extreme versions of their earlier selves. What I believe made Corwell's books initially unique was the inter-relationships of the characters (they actually spoke to each other) and the interesting as well as exciting stories. Now Marino is hateful and I have no ideas why, Benton Wesley is a zombie, Lucy ia a manic depressive looney and Kay Scarpetta is sleep walking through her private and professional life. Oh, and one more thing, no one EVER answers their cell phones when the calls are important. It's like the characters are even physically prevented from speaking to each other. Its absolutely laughable, particularly given the high tech nature of Lucy's company.All I can say is that I am begging for Cornwell to bring back the characters she has effectively killed off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I have been reading Patricia Cornwell's books since the mid-90s, and have always eagerly anticipated new releases. However, I have to say that I have been pretty disappointed with the last three novels. I really wish Ms. Cornwell would go back to the first-person narrative that always set her work apart from other authors in her genre. I don't like reading about the killer and what he/she is doing. I like to find out through Scarpetta's investigation who the perp is. I also have to agree with some of the other reviewers about Lucy, and how she has really become somewhat of a laughable, comic book character. Also, I am tired of every crime having some motivation involving Kay Scarpetta, Lucy, Marino, or Benton. Remember the old days, when every killer wasn't obsessed with Kay Scarpetta? I just can't pick up her new books with that old enthusiasm anymore. I have borrowed the last two from my local library, because I know they won't be good enough for me to shell out the dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell please stop now!","review":"I have been a true P. Cornwell fan for over a decade. Predator was the first book I borrowed from the library instead of buying. I was right. After briefly skimming other reviews, I want to echo every negative thing that was written about this book. The book ends so abruptly, that like several other readers, I flipped back a few pages to see if I missed something or if pages were actually missing from the book. The character development was worse than non-existent, it was like a completely different author wrote the book. Who are these characters? Reread the first 5 or 6 books in the Scarpetta series and you will know why you fell in love with them, do not read the rest. I was so disappointed with Predator that I felt cheated, used, lied to and flat out angry at P. Cornwell for writing such crap. And I don't even know this lady! Please stop. Seriously. It's past time to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best but ...","review":"Come on now! \\"Predator\\" is certainly not Cornwell's/Scarpetta's worst! (That dishonor still goes to the creepy, dopey \\"Blow Fly.\\") Sure, the plot bounces around a lot. So much that there are still a plot point or two that I still don't get. And yes, Lucy sure is tiresome. No, make that \\"Shakespearean.\\" I live for the book where Cornwell gives poor Lucy a break and makes her biggest problem a bad hair day. But there was quite a bit I liked. Marino actually seems to be trying to build a life that doesn't necessarily revolve around \\"the Doc.\\" The ending, while it came suddenly, is very well written. Remember the pink shoe. The way Cornwell works it into the story is moving and important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful.","review":"This book was like half a book -- something Cornwell sat down and spewed out over a long weekend or so. In general, authors would then go back and edit their work, but it appears in this case that her half-baked manuscript somehow made it past all the editorial gatekeepers, straight to hard copy.I hate how everyone in Scarpetta's life is so dysfunctional, grumpy, and repetitive. And I hate how Cornwell left us hanging with so many unanswered questions and incomplete plot points (what the heck happened to Joe???). And I hate that I spent money on this awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too gross!","review":"I have always looked forward to a new Scarpetta book, and I don't like to rate a novel too quickly...BUT....Once Predator came out, the forensics and the torture were too graphic for me, and I work in an ER.I got sucked into buying \\"Book of the Dead\\" and already I am revulsed. Why does the torture always have to be sexually related, Is there something in her makeup we don't know about? I believe in graphic explanation of scenes and events, but her written sado-sexual-masochism is way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This book was boring and a horrible read. I didn't even finish it and felt it was a waste of my time. I thought it would be totally different after I saw the author talk about her book on one of the news shows. I gave this book to a neighbor....they didn't care for it, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREDATOR","review":"NOTHING I CAN ADD TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID. THE BOOK WAS TOO OUTRE, FRAGMENTED. I COULD NOT FOLLOW ANY LINE AS EVERYTHING KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE FLASHBACK TO ANOTHER. THE CRIMES WERE WAY BEYOND REALITY.LOUSY WASTE OF MY MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not...","review":"I thought Patricia Cornwell's book Predator was pretty good given the only other book I read of hers was Post Mortem, and I found that one to be very slow and dull.The story starts out with some killings that appear to be linked to Basil, a killer that is currently in a mental institute being tested by Benton Westly for the new project Predator.The book reminds me in a way of a Tarantino film, in that a lot of stuff is happening, so you have to be paying attention.The book is overall interesting, but a little slow at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy and sordid","review":"I read several Scarpetta books from the beginning of the series, but after the niece, Lucy became an adult, the books got weirder and creepier. It is possible that if I were in the kind of business these characters are in, I might find that to be a realistic way of life. I don't really want to hear about people getting aroused over dead women's naked bodies. That just creeps me out. I also don't like any novel that tries to get into the mind of the serial killer. Yuck. I prefer the kind of detective novels that focuses more on the people who are following the clues to solve the crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she write this just becasue she had to?","review":"I am a big Cornwell fan...have read almost all her books...this one was very disppointing! Felt as if she didnt really put much thought into the book and just wrote it to get another one on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a zero star rating","review":"Usually enjoy Cornwell's books but this is awful. I put it down, half read and went to another one. Picked it back up and wondered why. What was Cornwell thinking? It gets zero stars in my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not happening","review":"This book is flat, dull, confusing and convoluted. With each new novel by Cornwell, I swear that I'm done- yet, like many others I'm drawn like a moth to a flame to read the latest- if only to confirm how bad it is. this series needs to end. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story Ruined By Irritating Present Tense","review":"Even trapped in a hospital bed, I had a hard time getting through this story. I do not remember Ms Cornwell using present tense in her earlier books, but as soon as I read the first paragraph I knew reading this story would be a chore. I don't know if she is just being experimental, or her editors or agent are pressuring her to make the story more \\"active,\\" but I, for one hate it (present tense).Still, I managed to get through the story (didn't have anything else to do) and it got somewhat better toward the end. The characters are well drawn out and the plot is complex. I would have rated this much higher if it wasn't such a chore to slog through it.Please Ms Cornwell, use past tense!Can't recommend it, sorry. Try Kathy Reichs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"It seemed okay in the beginning and then it just unraveled. Too much in one book. Lucy's sexual orientation seems to lead this author into not knowing where to go. Marino is what - at this point? I used to like him. And the last few pages - too much happening. I think it is time for Cornwell to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I used to love the Kay Scarpetta novels. Blow Fly, the Body Farm, etc. were revelations to me. This was before the mega sucess of CSI and all the attendant other tv shows that detailed forensic work. The strong character of Kay Scarpetta and her contrariness, her complicated niece and streetwise cop friend were all characters that, maybe not loveable, were definitely intriguing. Now, I find myself repelled by all three of them. Kay is whiny (the worst is when she carps about hating coach class and having to ride in it ALL THE WAY to Los Angeles). Lucy is so depressive, she could be forcefed prozac and still jump off a bridge (\\"is it me? is it my body? is it my lack of a love life?\\"). The worst is what Cornell has done to Marino, he's become a junkyard dog instead of the streetwise cop that's seen and done most things. Ugh. My biggest question is: What happened?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!!","review":"I stopped reading Cornwell's books a couple of years ago when she started emphasing homosexuallity so much in the niece of Kay Scarpetta. Then thought that I'd try again because I did enjoy the Scarpetta mystery series if not for that. Was terribly disappointed with this book. Won't waste my money on any of her books from now on. She's lost a good customer. There are too many other good writers out there. What has happened to her??"},{"rating":"1","title":"anticlimatic -","review":"I have read all of Cornwell's books, and have enjoyed them. I feel that she was trying to hard to be clever. The Marino has a hard on for Kay story line is a bit over done, the Lucy is loosing it is also over done. The entire book dragged till the last chapter, then it was just over. Done. I was left feeling that I wasted my time reading this book. She had lost her touch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I ever heard-Part 11","review":"How I managed to listen to 5 discs of this trash I will never know. Actually it is because I had nothing else. This is my second Cornwell book. I somehow managed to get through At Risk. Both are awful. No more Cornewll for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! What a turn-off.","review":"Let me just say that while Ms. Cornwell was once one of my favorite crime novelists, this one sux. I don't need torture and hideous descriptions of child abuse to make a novel enjoyable to me. Quite the contrary. I didn't even finish this one, but turned to the end to see the outcome and then donated this hardcover book to a patient library in a nursing home. Since I bought this book at a clearance sale for $1 at Half Price Books, a used book store, there are apparently other readers who feel the same way I do about Ms. Cornwell's later works: Enuff already! Get a grip, Patricia, or you'd better start saving your huge fortune for your (enforced) retirement. JMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had enough!","review":"I was one of Patricia Cornwell's biggest fans but her last few books have really disappointed me. \\"Predator\\" was by far the worst one yet. I couldn't even follow what was going on most of the time. Pete Marino is a biker? Where is the forensics? Lucy is a rich spoiled girl with too many toys. Kay Scarpetta?I didn't even see the real Kay Scarpetta in this book. Don't waste your time reading this one! I'll not buy another Cornwell book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"In her earlier writings, Ms. Cornwell's books could not be put down. It is sad to see her talent vanish from the publishing world. Predator is simply not entertaining in any way. I kept reading hoping that it would turn around, but to no avail. Don't waste your time and money or at least wait until the book comes out in paperback. Come to think of it, it would be a waste of valuable trees to even bother printing Predator in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I've read every book that Patricia Cornwell has written and I look forward to when she comes out with another novel....or at least I used to. This book was so bad that I just put it down. I'm very very disappointed, there was no flow to the story, and all the characters including Kay Scarpetta had a different feel. I'm done reading Cornwell, this is the last book I'll buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"just disappointing","review":"I've read every book Cornwell has ever written, and used to wait impatiently to buy the newest one the first day it came out. After the last one I swore I'd wait and get the next one from the library and I'm really glad I didn't shell out $25 for Predator.Cornwell seems to have lost interest in all her characters, and that's been building over the last few books. In Predator, however, she loses interest in her plot as well, preferring a cheap \\"solution\\" and unbelievable coincidences to the carefully crafted mysteries she used to do so well. Even taking these shortcuts, she still doesn't answer all the questions she's created.I read Predator immediately after reading Gone, by Lisa Gardner, and Predator suffered even more by comparison. This was my first Gardner book, and I would recommend it to others who are missing the Cornwell of past years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ridiculous","review":"Particia Cornwell has been on a steady decline for a while but this is the worst yet. I am unsure of where to begin but I can tell you that I felt (yet again) that she ran out of pages at the end and decided to wrap things up quickly to meet a deadline.What happened to her niece? What about Joe? Where did he go? What was his motivation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure why I'm finishing this book...","review":"I'm in the last quarter of this book, and out of sheer momentum, I'll likely finish. I doubt I'll read another in this series, and that's a shame. They were so good, once.The characters have become -- ALL of them -- utterly unsympathietic and distasteful. The plot, while not as incredible as the amazing back-to-life soap-opera plot device in earlier books, is weak.I'm off to find a new author to follow. Wish me luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read just about all of the Kay Scarpetta series and I can say that this one cannot hold my attention. The characters personalities have completely changed, almost too drastic. I was extremely disappointed that I had to stop at about 150 pages into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring;as if written by a twelve year old....","review":"I'm sorry;I hate giving Ms. Cornwell a bad review but thisstinker deserves it. The Predator is so simply written,I would have passed it by when I was twelve. Just like the scene whereluminol(isn't there anything more interesting and up to date?It's like Scarpetta & Lucy are carrying around a box that says \\"Junior Detectives Kit\\" on the side),shows up splattered blood and \\"maybe or maybe not bleach\\" in the Beach Bums storeroom. Maybe it's got a plot,maybe not.Scattershot plot,characters no longer interesting- I just don't care about them anymore.Can the idea be to slowly show how each once younger and heroic character slides into despair,redundancy,and finally obscurity because of the criminal element they have worked with for years?If that is the case,could I respectfully suggest an entirely new series?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought with hope - won't buy the new one","review":"Found the story confusing with story lines not tied up. Still not sure about a lot of the \\"plot\\" but the one that is driving me nuts is what was the reason for the red hand prints?"},{"rating":"1","title":"wha??","review":"The biggest problem with this \\"Scarpetta\\" novel is that there isn't much Scarpetta!!! And who is this new Marino? And was there any need to tell us about his latest relationship?? We get it--he's in love with Kay. And Lucy--whoa. Benton--whatever! And, violent death is gross--we get that as well. No need for the graphics, Ms. Cornwell.You're such an amazing author--please get back to the good stuff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"This is the worst story I ever read. I was keeping up with Cornwell even after she brought back Benton to live, but the story in this book is just horrible. I would say there is no story at all. It's only confusing and the characters are at their worst. Scarpetta, Lucy, Marino are all going down the drain.Keep your hands of this book it's not worse the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to worse - I didn't want to give it one star, they made me do it.","review":"There's a good reason why I hesitate to keep reading a once-popular writer - because inevitably they succomb to success and start turning out drivel. It happened to John Grisham and it happened even sooner to P. Cornwell. Only her first 3 books were worth reading. Yet somehow Reichs and Fairstein keep turning out fascinating forensic mysteries. Maybe it's because they really care and it's not just about the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I used to love reading the Scarpetta series and looked forward to the next one. I don't know what happened but the last three have not been up the the standard set by the earlier ones and the most recent, Predator, was frankly awful. I am so sorry I bought this book. The next one can sit on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stop writing","review":"I have been very disappointed with the last few Kay Scarpetta books.

Trace was such a good book, then Predator was so full of holes, it was a huge disappointment. There was no solid storyline and very disjointed. I was very, very disappointed. Her usual characters were shallow and there was no follow through as to their fate. I speed-read the book, I was so disappointed but felt I had to read it through.Syd O."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer a Cornwell reader","review":"This book was a real disappointment. All of the characters need intensive counseling/therapy. A real downer. I no longer find any of the characters sympathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATRICIA'S PLOT NEEDS SOME FORENSIC WORK","review":"As a longtime fan of the Scarpetta character and the many novels she appears in this book was a bit of a disappointment. The succsessful formula of previous books has not found its way into this novel. The plot is somewhat disjointed and the focus has turned away from the tight forensic mysteries of previous efforts and more to personality conflicts and even stranger than strange personalities that simply do not carry the story. An unfortunate effort that I hope will not be repeated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"This series has been going downhill for awhile. I kept hoping it would improve but I see that's not going to happen. I'll never read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Unfortunately, this is not a Kay Scarpetta book like the others have been. Cornwell's writing and what she has done to all the characters is extremely disappointing. For those of you that have read Scarpetta books over the years, it will be hard to even recognize these characters. They all seem to be miserable, self-destructive people with no connnection whatsoever. The ending made absolutely no sense at all.Although this book is appearing on bestseller lists, it is only by virtue of Cornwell's past work. If this series continue to die a slow, painful death, I will be unable to continue to be a fan.I can only hope that Ms. Cornwell wakes up and returns to the kind of writing she is capable of and that we have all come to expect. No more of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the @#x%?","review":"Well, I was a Cornwell fan. I finally put this book down for the last (of many) times. It wasn't \\"couldn't put it down\\" but rather, \\"couldn't pick it up\\". Total waste. There was so much jumping around, I had to refresh my memory on who's who and who's where every time I picked it up. A marathon race to a vague and inintelligible finish line. Whatever happened to Amos? The shotgun? What about the body paint? Or, was I so bored I missed those answers? Too many characters, not well developed (especially the bad guy, er girl, er...); Scarpetta was a non factor; Lucy has become a pathetic ankle weight to Scarpetta, while living in a fantasy world of cloak and dagger toys and lottery-like wealth; Marino is the stereotypical washed up, loveless, out of power cop; and on and on...Will the real Patricia Cornwell please stand up (and write again)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's Corn","review":"I am mystified by this Author's success in selling the trash she writes. I aquire her novels from libraries and friends (I will not buy one). Each Book seems to have fewer pages and bigger letters. Her first Novels were insightful and entertaining, even though she followed the same formula. Her Kay Scarpetta character is ready for retirement. Perhaps Ms. Cornwell should consider the same option.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I agree with most of the other 1 star ratings here:Why all of a sudden are these books being written in the third person?All the characters have morphed into new ones...Scarpetta isn't an intelligent woman, she's just a whiney shrew? Marino isn't overweight,scruffy and lovable, he's now a buff biker dude who loses his temper like a 5 year old little girl? Benton, back from the dead, is not a briliiant profiler, but now is part of some study where they MRI psychotics' brains? And Lucy has always been dark, but a genius. Now she's suddenly stupid?It used to be that I couldn't wait for a new Scarpetta novel. Trace, followed by this mess, has pretty much finished that.PC, PLEASE go back to your old style, return the characters to those who we love, and give us a story that's worthy of this crew!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Awful!","review":"I liked the early Patricia Cornwell/Kay Scarpetta books. No doubt, Cornwell can be a very good writer. She isn't in this book. It is gruesome way over the top, brutal (unnecessarily so), too sexual and blasphemeous, for a start. Frankly, I am wondering about the state of Patricia Cornwell's mind. I'm also sorry I read the thing, and wish I had stopped sooner. Never, never again! This series is over for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formerly great characters turned into annoying caricatures","review":"I used to love the Scarpetta series, but she started on a downward trend with Black Notice, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. You used to root for Kay and Benton, now you find yourself mentally telling Benton to kick her sorry butt to the curb.

I would rate it as an average thriller, but it definitely missed the mark in the ongoing Scarpetta series.

She has a plot to her stories. This book doesn't even have the substance of an outline. I hope the publisher is reading these amazon reviews because mystery fans are putting their feet down and refusing to pay exhorbitant prices for such inferior work. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the 4 and 5 starred reviews have to be from Cornwall's family. They are too well-written to have been submitted by the author herself.

Joe the goofy path fellow was interesting for a while but the regulars should have caught on that he was poking his nose in places where it didn't belong. The book would have been much better if all of the all the back biting and temper tantrums were cut out of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book!","review":"Wish I had read other reviews before I bought this book.

I enjoy a good mystery; a good one makes you want to peek at the ending, just to see if you figured everything out correctly. I plowed through this book, just to finish it. I didn't get the feeling of genuine surprise or verification as I do in other mysteries.I am an avid reader. I have noticed over the years that books by Cornwell and her ilk are becoming smaller and smaller.

I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end.I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live).

I sure hope her next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Read","review":"As an avid Cornwell fan, I am disappointed to say that this book is terrible. I think the Kay Scarpetta series is becoming old and tired, and it shows in this book. Since \\"Black Notice\\", I feel Cornwell's writing has become stale and predictable.

Nothing flashy but generally a decent story line and a lot of criminology thrown in.

I have read all of her novels and the first ones were great, very suspenseful books that you couldn't put down. Predator didn't even have an ending after all the convoluted story lines in the book. Marino used to be a sort of grumpy but likeable character, what happened? Lucy needs to get over herself and become a responsible person instead of a rich brat, I am really tired of her character.

The series took a marked hit after Point of Origin and went completely into the trashcan with Blowfly. Why the sudden switch to third person? The last three books have been less about forensic science and more about how much the characters can put the mean in dysfunctional. It's almost as if a different person is writing these books.

In addition, I'd just like to mention that if you DO manage to slog through this dumb book, you will want to ask for a refund when you reach the end.

If Scarpetta headed any crime lab I would have serious doubts about their effectiveness. I don't buy her books to read about the angst in Scarpetta's relationships with friends and lovers.

I will not waste any more money on Cornwells books, they are uninteresting, all the caracters are in a constant state of fugue.

I have been a faithful Cornwell reader throughout this series and have only seen the storylines and character development continue to disintegrate over the past few books. However, Predator takes the cake. This is positively the worst attempt by this talented author in her career. The storyline was confusing and frustrating and did not engage this reader at all. The stagnant relationships among the characters need to either terminate or move on. Sorry to say, I'll never determine if this happens in the next book because I won't be buying another Scarpetta mystery. I do have one question for the publisher - did anyone actually read this book before it was distributed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I officially give up on Cornwall and Kay.

That said, I am only half way thru and have put it aside to read the book reviews - out of curiousity and to make sure I have not lost my mind (btw, I will finish because at this point I am committed). Predator is not an \\"easy\\" read, it's difficult to follow with different simultaneous scenarios. I thought perhaps (I have kids and no free time) because I was reading it in short bursts and not longer sittings that I was losing the continuity in my head. However, after now reading the reviews I know it's not me (at least I hope not) and this book is simply all over the place, characters are a little sad and depressing.

I waited for the paperback, read it, and decided that I don't need to waste my time reading Cornwell any longer. I don't enjoy all of the angst - I kept wishing that Kay & Benton would just TALK to each other, for goodness sake! I used to like these people, but not any longer. The mystery itself was okay, but for me all the sturm and drang outweighed that part of the book.

I don't know what has happened to Patricia Cornwell. She used to be my favorite author, and I used to love the Kay Scarpetta books. Now I have to slog my way thru one of her books. She needs to get back to her basics. I know authors are supose to evolve, but I don't see that happening here. It just seem like she's trying to get thru the book. The writing isn't as fun. I hate what she's done to Pete Marino, and Lucy just keeps getting more and more whiny. I personally wish she would kill her off, and Dr. Scarpetta just seems self righteous.

I found this on a discount table at a bookstore while I was traveling and looking for a book to read. For someone who can go through a book I enjoy in a day or two, this took me months to finish. Cornwell's books have been on a steady decline. She no longer is intriguing or even interesting and her characters are now worse than reading soap-opera scripts.

I enjoyed Predator and couldn't wait to finish reading it.

You should have kept Kay in Virginia. I got as far as the scene where the cat was killed and closed the book. If this is where you're at then stop writing. What happened to Lucy to make so nuts? Has Marino lost his mind too? Benton should have stayed dead. Your charactors are all over the place and yet no where at all. I enjoyed Scarpetta and the gang, I couldn't wait for the next book. THE LAST PRICINCT was still good, but not as good as when she was in Virginia. BLOW FLY and TRACE you wasted your time writing.

What is going on? People save your money, don't buy this book. If you must read it (and I suggest you read something more entertaining), borrow the book. Ms. Cornwell's writing has been going downhill for sometime, yet I always give her the benefit of doubt and buy her new book the first day it's released. My library has everyone of her books, sorry I'll close off that part of my shelf. I was really confused with this book and then the end was like...what?

The idea that all three cases can be connected is beyond absurd, it's clearly a desperate author plot to keep such far-flung characters together. And I honestly didn't care what happened to anyone by the end of book, finishing it merely to see how bad/rushed/pointless it would become.I LOVE her old books and recently re-read a few to see if my tastest have just changed. Nope, it's the quality of the Cornwell books that is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted plot","review":"This is an extremely convoluted novel.

Her prose is floundering, a massive mix of as many suspense themes as possible in an attempt to cover up the fact that she has no \\"novel\\" (pun intended) ideas. One feels that she really doesn't like any of her characters. It's all rather sad. And Marino's corny characterization comes across as though a little old maid were writing about what she thinks a macho cop must be like. It's really sad to see a once-interesting group of characters devolve into the depressed malcontents that populate Predator."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL...JUST AWFUL","review":"(I would actually give this book 'no stars', but that is not an option.)Of one thing I am certain after reading this latest Kay Scarpetta novel: I will never waste my time on this sort of rubbish again. I have read several of Ms. Cornwell's, books, and even enjoyed the first two. Her characters, however, have become stale and unattrative. I just plain don't like them, nor do I care what happens to them in the plot. (Actually, I think it is time to REALLY kill off Benton and Lucy. Marino, I'm not sure, he may be salvagable. The characters' interrelationships are irrational and pooorly conceived. Also, Ms. Cornwell's most recent efforts are 'over the edge' in terms of the gruesome, fixation on the horrid details of the crimes portrayed. This book has set me free to pursue other more capable authors of this genre. (Like Michael Connelly, for example)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened????","review":"I loved the early Scarpetta books, and I've read everything that Ms. Cornwell has published. I found \\"Predator\\" very disappointing.The charm of the earlier books was that they were told in Scarpetta's own voice and we were able to share her feelings and thoughts. Since Ms. Cornwell shifted to a third-person storytelling style, the charm has gone and Scarpetta has much less depth.With the loss of this insight, the books have become the same as any other piece of crime fiction.I understand that it's important for an author to change styles and topics occasionally to keep things fresh, but I wish that Ms. Cornwell had dropped these great characters entirely, rather than turning them into the vaguest shadows of their former selves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, I agree","review":"I just finished Predator. I had to read it all, kind of like the way someone can not keep from looking at a train wreck. I really enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels until Blowfly, when she started writing third person present tense - my least favorite style of writing to read. I feel like suddenly her books are some sort of writing assignment because they are that weird. All of her characters are broken, miserable and depressing to read. I actually had a hard time following the plot. And this is a Scarpetta book not War and Peace. The predators were trite and the ending was sort of pulled out of,well, I don't know where.

Why???","review":"I was terribly disappointed by Patricia Cornwell's latest book, Predator. I have been a big fan of the previous novels, but this one made me wonder if Cornwell hired a ghost writer. Without spoiling the plot, for those I can't dissuade from wasting their time reading this, there are plot lines that seem to be very important that peter out without any further mention, or resolution. Pete Marino, a character I have always liked, that seemed street-wise, if predjudiced, comes off as a brutish bufoon, and hints are given as to the nature of his moodiness, but again, no resolution. Her attempts to give us the criminal's point of view come off as silly and repetitive, and I guess I now have a very good idea what an MRI machine sounds like, but have no idea why it was so important.My advice: if you love Kay Scarpetta, Benton Wesley, Pete Marino, et al, let them rest in peace in your memories, but let them go. They're dead now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good effort","review":"Any Cornwell work is better than some other books, but...I have NEVER liked the way Marino has been handled in the entire series - now he is like a caricature- before he was street wise liasion to Scarpetta, then he blew up to a large smoking drinking person who had health problems, and now he is aloof big muscle bound biker guy who is at odds with Scarpetta and knows something funny is going on with the misinformation -The series and this novel does not have the BITE it did - if you would reread the first books that made a wave in the thriller genre you will understand what I mean.We've gone through a lot with the regulars of this series - they have not progressed in the way the folks who pay hardback prices would like. Not so sure I will pay hardback prices again for this series again. and that's sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta scrambled","review":"I used to love Patrica Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, but as time goes on she has lost a plot in a big way. The relationship between Scarpetta / Lucy / Benton becomes gradually more disfunctional and bizzare. Marino has gone so far off the rails that I seriously expect to see that he is in fact a serial killer himself. These flaws could be excused if the plot was solid, but unfortunately even there we are let down. Once again Scarpetta, Lucy and Benton are all investigating different murders which bizzarrly are all coincidentally related (this has happened too many times before to be interesting), and the killer is once again playing a game that sets the main characters against one another.My advice to a reader - don't waste your time reading this book, you've read all the component parts of the story in other Cornwell books.My advice to Cornwell - go back to the original format of simple death investigation and quit slipping off into the realms of psychobabble"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust the Reviews","review":"Amazon critics generally fall on the favorable side of the review curve, maybe because favorable ratings tend to get more positive responses. In this case (1.5 stars average) they are right on target. This is an appalling performance by a writer who used to know how to write believably, who used to know how to build suspense, and who used to know how to construct a plot. It all began to go downhill when \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" won all those Oscars and Cornwell decided she wanted a piece of the serial killer pie. The plots became increasingly outlandish, the characters became irritating, and the violence became nauseating. All these trends coalesce in \\"Predator\\" and Cornwell gives us the perfect storm of bad suspense fiction.

Benton is a shell of his former interesting self. I have struggled through the last 3 books now and have finally given up. Maybe if the next one gets decent reviews I'll try it, but I'm thinking no!

However, I am compelled to say that the ending of this book is so wretched, sloppy, lazy that it is shocking. My first thought was that I had received a botched copy of the book from the publisher and the end was missing! The book literally ends in the middle of a crime scene. Where old Cornwell books would be just jumping in to dissect a crime scene, Predator abruptly ends. It's like Cornwell left her desk for moment and someone absconded with her manuscript and published it midstream. If you must read this book, hit the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Satisfaction","review":"I really looked forward to seeing how these characters had progressed and it seems none have. That and the story being tedious, confusing and very unsatisfying has left me to wonder what has happened to one of my favorite authors. The characters and plot were all over the place. Maybe it's time to put the characters, at least, to rest. There's no life to any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down","review":"I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator. Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess. If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about. I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Wow, this book really stunk. The plot was too convoluted, which meant that ultimately there were dozens of loose ends when the book was over; virtually none of the mystery was resolved. I've totally lost interest in the main characters (Scarpetta et al.) because they have all become sour and tired. If Cornwell can't do better than this she would do well to start a new series (although I can't say that I liked her non-Scarpetta novels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I used to be a Cornwell zealot but, the last 2 or 3 I've picked up reluctantly, thinking \\"I'll try one more\\". It's not fun to feel like you've just wasted precious hours reading, and that's the feeling that prevailed after finishing this one. Her \\"Isle of Dogs\\" was well-crafted and funny in a very low-key way. It took a bit to get into the swing of that story, since it was so different from her Scarpetta books. Predator seems to have some of that caricature-ish feel as far as the characters are concerned. Not what you want in this series. Other reviewers have tried to explain the story line. Well-intentioned attempts, but Cornwell's continuity is pathetic at best. Pete, Wesley, & Lucy are no further along han they were in the last book, so you're not missing anything if you skip it.Where was her editor for this one? It looks like she's coasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this garbage?","review":"I'm not done listening to the CD version of Predator, and I haven't decided whether I'm going to finish. What happened?! Admittedly, Cornwell went a little wonky with the werewolf story and the \\"death\\" of Benton, but now we're completely in left field. I don't even recognize these people! When did Marino become so stupid and Scarpetta become so mean? It's like Patricia Cornwell decided to hire someone else to write this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is another disappointing Patricia Cornwell book. Her older books were wonderful and I could hardly put them down. But lately they leave much to be desired. I also notice that James Patterson's books have become poorly written as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed; confused","review":"Kay Scarpetta was one of the best charcters ever and I've read every one of the books but as already mentioned, the Patricia Cornwell books have gone downhill. They are much darker, depressing and gorier than at the beginning of the series. Predator was hard to get into because of the disjointed, jumpy style of writing. Also, at the end many plot points were left up in the air regarding who actually did what killings and the motive. I normally don't mind that Cornwell doesn't tie up everything neatly at the end but if you've invested a number of hours in reading the book, you'd at least like to be able to figure out what happened when it was over. I ended up confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO PAT?","review":"I've been in love with Patricia Cornwells' characters for many years and I don't understand what she's done with them. All of a sudden they are paranoid and nitpicky and backstabbing. I'll stick with the previous years. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I'm about halfway through this book and have been wondering if it's just me or is this book not very good? I see now by the reviews here that it's not just me. This will likely be my last Cornwell Scarpetta mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I haven't been reading Cornwell novels since they kept getting progressively worse. I hoped she had improved so I took a chance and bought the book. I should have put my money on a lottery ticket. This book was dreadful. It jumped around as though Cornwell was writing as though each chapter was another book. The characters were all depressed and unhappy and the story was totally and completely unbelieveable!! I could go on, but I just want to forget I wasted my time and toss this one in my trash bin. Final comment - Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you really and what have you done with the real Patricia Cornwell","review":"The last three books that have come out have all been bad. The only \\"plot\\" I can find is Dr. Kay's on going saga of being in the grips of a terminal level of \\"poor me\\". There is none of the drama found in the previous books. I kept waiting for the story to start, but it never did. In fact now her niece,Lucy,is following her aunt down the slide to \\"poor me\\". I liked Benton better before we thought he was dead. I think that I liked him better dead than how he is now(wimp}. Last but not least,our favorite \\"I'm in love with Kay, but, I know it will never be,so,I will settle for being a pain in the butt and never get my own life ex-cop person. I hope the next book is back to the quality of her earlier books, I don't see how the next one can be any worst. At least I hope it is not worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"I always wait eagerly for the next Kay Scarpetta novel to be released. After PREDATOR, I'm not so sure I care if Scarpetta ever shows her face on the bookshelves again. In spite of their flaws and quirkiness the main characters have always been at least likable human beings. In PREDATOR they were flat and one-dimensional,leaving this reader not caring whether they live or not. Come on, Cornwell, your early Scarpetta books were spectacular. Your faithful fans deserve better than PREDATOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Scarpetta and her crew have lost appeal...the characters are angry, bitter and secretive. What happened to those the relationships? Will wait for paperback and hope for the best in Cornwell's next..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I note that several reviews suggested waiting for a library copy, rather than purchasing this book. Well, don't count on your local libraary buying a copy! This series has become so bad, that libraries are saving their money for titles that are readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Present tense?","review":"Why write in the present tense? From the beginning, I knew it was going to be different, but not this bad. The poorly constructed plot lines made it seem like it was put together with little thought. My advice would be to stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dysfunctional and gloomy","review":"I have read all the Kay Scarpetta books. The earlier ones were enjoyable. I like following a series where I get to know the characters. They become like my own family. Unfortunately, the characters have become all dysfunctional in this story. If I had never read any of the previous Kay Scarpetta books, I would not have gotten past the first hour of this one.I also enjoy a good whodunit, but I don't care for serial killers and Cornwell seems to be getting more and more into the minds of kinky serial killers. I can't relate to that and don't want to. Whatever happened to a good old fashioned murder mystery where the motive was greed, jealousy or blackmail?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"The sudden jump to third person strikes me as indicative that this franchise is simply a business for Cornwell. She has completely divorced herself from the characters when she used to be deeply involved in all aspects of their development. The forensics are non-existent, since Scarpetta is a consultant rather than a practicioner. I read this not too long ago, and I hardly remember what it was about.I keep buying these, hoping that the author will revert back to her old form, but like everyone else, I continue to be disappointed. I probably won't stop reading them, but I sure won't be paying full hardback prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"the thrill is gone","review":"The last several of Cornwell's books have been awful. Trite plotlines; too much personal angst; missing forensics and mystery. I have sworn not to spend another dime on her books because there are too many other great writers out there that still give a good bang for the buck - Connelly, Sandford, James Lee Burke among many others. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Do not be sucked in by the \\"smear campaign\\" theory. These reviews have been written because her work has become poor quality. Perhaps it is time for Ms. Connelly to either retire the series or get focused on what made her early works so wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is still not up to Patricia Cornwel's previous work","review":"It is a long time since she shocked with; \\"From Potters Field\\"There is a lot of psykobabble here and verly little story. The jumping from place to place with litllecoherence just makes this book a bad read.I still give 2 starts for the effort, and being a Patricia Cornwell fan, I am willing to forgive a lot.If this is your first meeting with Scarpetta... Dont't.Pick up \\"Post Mortem\\" and read the first few books first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have (had) been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for many years. I would eagerly await the new novels and especially the Kay Scarpetta series. The last 2 in this series have been so disappointing that I will not buy another of her books. I will try to get them at the local library and see if my disappointment in her writing these last couple of years is unfounded, but will not spend my money until I am reassured that the books are worth my investment. Her characters have become weak and her plotlines trite. Her main character (Kay in this book) seems to have lost her edge and the lesbian situations in these last few books are just not my cup of tea. I would like for her to go back to the \\"medical examiner\\" situations and storylines. I learned quite a bit of forensic science when I was reading her earlier Kay Scarpetta and would like to see the return of this aspect of her writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be a masochist","review":"I keep on reading Scarpetta novels to see where Cornwell takes Scarpetta and Marino even though the last few have been awful. Sadly I have stopped expecting to like them & will only check them out at the library.In my opinion, once Cornwell switched to third person, everything went downhill.I wish Patricia Cornwell would retire this series. Maybe the final installment Scarpetta, Lucy & Benton are somehow all blown to bits. The end.Don't waste your money on this Bk.. If you really want to read it, go to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Precinct is the Last good novel","review":"Kay Scarpetta's last good adventure was \\"The Last Precinct\\".Bringing Benton back........... BIG MISTAKE, reminded me of how they brought back Bobby on \\"Dallas\\".Worse, when it was written in first person, She WAS the character.The whole series has ground to a halt. From Body Farm to Last Precinct, it's a GREAT Series........ since then, a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell is losing steam","review":"Like many others here I used to be Scarpetta's biggest admirer and PC's biggest fan.I could hardly finish this book, it was so bad. I think she is simply losing her steam. She's worn out her characters, her plots are boring and when I read this I felt that it was written simply to maybe fulfill contractual obligations. She certainly did not write with the same energy as her past Scarpetta novels. Maybe creating a new series would be better than endlessly milking these by now very sad characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry","review":"I am a long time reader of Patricia Cornwell's work. I'm totally shocked at this book. Not only is her book out of character, I suspect it has resulted from a weekend project that was late for a publisher deadline.A critic of grammar is not my forte, but even for the untrained this book is loaded with grammatical and spelling errors easily noticeable by laymen. I certainly hope Patricia is more inclined to produce better work on her next book.Patricia's past writings have always been known to be very descriptive with the ability to whisk a reader away into another realm, leaving them captive and feeling it is hard to put a book down midway through reading. This one sorely lacks imagination and makes it hard to pick up after each chapter and makes it difficult for a reader to commit anything in the book to memory and to follow what exactly what they are reading. To finish the book is more an obligation than a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were there pages missing?","review":"I have read all these books and for the first time in my life, I actually looked at the page numbers to see if some were missing!!I wasted a lot of time and money reading this book. I know nothing about these characters that I didn't know before. I don't understand the plot (I don't think there was one). I don't know how it ends..it simply didn't. What an absolute disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"I have read all of the Scarpetta series and this latest one, unlike many of her previous, is, in a word, is \\"putdownable\\"I think Ms. Cornwell is bored with Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" Predator \\" Poor at Best","review":"I was a huge Patricia Cornwell fan until this book. I noticed in \\"Trace\\" she was not writing in a true early Cornwell flare... but, I just chalked it up to difficult writing.Predator goes no where quickly! it has lost the background of it main characters and P.C is leaving off main elements of the story that leaves the readers with questions. A writer can do this with screen plays (directors will fill in the empty spots) but, in a novel the reader must feel they are there right beside Dr. Kay Scarpetta.I am sorry I wasted my money on this novel. I think Ms. Cornwell has just about burnt out the Dr. Scarpetta stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Characters/Depressing Book","review":"This series has run out of gas. I don't know how the characters go from day to day their lives are so empty and miserable. The villains are so over the top evil that they are ridiculous. We've bought our last episode of Kay Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst she's written","review":"I used to be an ardent admirer of the Scarpetta series...but Trace and Predator make me believe that they have been written by a different author altogether.The plot is incoherent and forced, lacking suspense and logic - real disappointments. It really hope that the series is not continued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some research...","review":"I'm sorry to say this, but, for me, too, this series is going in the clunker. The characterization has already been discussed by others, so I won't go there.I'm a computer professional, not a forensic pathologist, so I can't comment on that science. However, this is the second book in the series that I can think of offhand where the whole plot has hinged on the \\"brilliant\\" Lucy doing stupid things that would get any professional in the computer field fired on the spot for incompetence. Maybe I'm a geek, but I can't maintain suspension of disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly, a waste of time and money","review":"Most of the Scarpetta series have been good reads, with a few exceptions, and I always look forward to Cornwell's new books. This book is beyond being an exception to her normal standard - it is simply a waste. The plot is weak, events and people take up pages for no apparent reason, the ending is a disappointment, Lucy and Marino are both overblown and are distractions, and Scarpett herself is virtually irrelevant. Save your money and time to invest in something more entertaining and engaging, and hope that Cornwell gets back on track with her novels in the immediate future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth every cent, i.e., zero.","review":"I belong to a book club where for every three books you buy that you didn't particularly want but forgot to turn down, you get one book free that you didn't want at all. This was the book. There are traces of the author's former excellence, but they were hard to find, even with an ultraviolet lamp. I wonder whether she is taking the approach adopted by some authors in later life: providing plot outlines and letting the munchkins fill in the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Scarpetta","review":"I have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series and recommended them to many friends; particularly good for a summer read. But the last few books have been flat, lifeless and lacking in plot. I can't believe this is the same Cornwell who wrote Body Farm and others that were so readable, I couldn't stop long after midnight. I had to force myself to finish this one - can't be a real Cornwell, can it?? Where oh where did Scarpetta crawl off to??"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet!","review":"I used to enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell in the early days. I now find her books to be extremely tedious to read. This current book, Predator, was the worst one yet. I am quite disappointed in Cornwell as an author. She needs to spend more time on the meat of the story, than hopping around from character to character. Speaking of characters, I think she gives me far more information than I need about her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"I have really enjoyed Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series... up until now. This book was so scattered with too many characters, side stories trying to bring together Kay, Benton, Marino, and Lucy. This story was dark, gritty, smutty, and very confusing.Normally, the Kay Scarpetta series covers Kay's life... but PREDATOR used Kay as an almost unimportant side character. All in all, it was a very disappointing effort by Cornwell.I would only recommend purchasing this in paperback if you must... or borrow it from your local library. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking this to the used bookstore - hopefully they'll take it","review":"I wish I didn't have to give a star at all!This book was truely awful. The Last Precint was also the last book she wrote that was decent.The story was disjointed and the conclusions that it came to made no sense to the rest of the story.I think that Ms. Cornwell should go back and read some of her previous books to see why everyone is hugely disappointed with Blow Fly, Trace and now Predator. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm done with the Scarpetta series.I think I'll just continue my move to Kathy Reichs and Linda Fairstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator","review":"Thrilling and fast-paced, leaving lots of unanswered questions and a desire for the next Scarpetta novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book as you judge","review":"I disagree with a lot of the readers reviews. The book was a bit choppy at times, but I thought the plot was great. The one thing I would agree with everyone on, the new academy is a bit over the top. Basically, read it yourself. I'm looking forward to the next in this series and I hope she goes more in depth with Lucy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better... gorey","review":"I have read several of this author and this on just seemed more GORE and HORROR than she normally gets into. The premis was good.. just the expounding of it was bad. There is only so much my mind can take of the depravity of others before it really gets to me. And there were several sub plots that never had any endings. I am sure that is because she writes other books with some of the same characters.. but sometimes i think there should be certain endings.. with some themes. That didn't happen here so it left you hanging to a certain degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Hit on this reading list","review":"Something just isn't right with how Cornwell has laid the work for this latest Scarpetta thriller. I can't put my fingers on it. I'm sure all the other reviewers have given a good analysis of what's missing, but I don't know. I'm still hoping for more. Here's wishing the next chapter to the Kay files is a better read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a zero star?","review":"I was a true Scarpetta fan at the beginning of the series, but with each new book it has gone downhill. I have grown to dislike the characters, they are boring and irritating. With this book I didn't make it past page 80. Especially annoying to me is the present tense story telling. This was my last Cornwell purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"The last three books, in my opinion have not been worth the time I spent with them. I hope she can capture her old writing style with the next one. I enjoyed all of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator - certainly not her best","review":"Patricia has gone off the deep end with this book. Her earlier books were incredible, but these characters that we have come to love and enjoy are so disfunctional and the plot so convoluted that it left me feeling wrung out and wishing I hadn't bothered to take the time to read it. Patricia needs to get back to reality with real characters that do some good old fashioned sleuthing. I'll try one more of her books, but if no better, sorry that's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this out of sequence","review":"I got this accidentally from a book club and since I normally enjoy the Scarpetta books I kept it. I finished it last night. Don't ask me what it is about, because I have no idea. I missed several books in the series, and unlike some mystery series writers, Cornwell gives little back story to catch you up. The changes in some familiar characters were baffling to me. The whole set-up is more like a poor-man's James Bond than good a forensic exploration (maybe she thinks there are too many forensics shows on TV for us to be interested in that anymore). The loose ends are numerous, and the denouement ridiculous. I gave it two stars because the writing was still good enough to keep me engaged, and I kept hoping it would all make sense in the end. Unless you are a hard-core fan, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"Like many other reviewers, I've been a Scarpetta follower for some time. I was disappointed in \\"Trace\\", but couldn't help but request the latest, \\"Predator\\", from my library anyway. Right away, something seemed amiss. What happened to the 1st person perspective? This present tense 3rd person is irritating to read, and I feel as though I missed something. There wasn't a whole other book in between, was there?? When did Marino become a Harley guy, and what's the deal with Lucy?I tried to stick it out for the first 100 pages, then decided to see what the reviewers said. Now that I know it's not just me, I'll move on to another book in my stack and say so long to the Patricia Cornwell series."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU MUST READ IT WAIT FOR A LIBRARY COPY","review":"FIRST OFF: IF YOU MUST READ IT WAIT FOR A LIBRARY COPYI'm wondering what happened to Patricia Cornwell's fresh clever perspective.

[I did, but my mind really started wondering after about 40 pages]IN THE END:I won't buy the next Kay Scarpetta Mysteryby Patricia Cornwell on faith. If you must read this, avoid my mistake, and reserve this book at the public library. At least then, you'll avoid wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real clunker","review":"Wow, this one may be the one that does me in. As if returning Benton from the dead weren't bad enough, as if putting Marino on the South Beach diet weren't bad enough, as if destroying Lucy's career with the Federal government weren't enough, Cornwell's characters, formerly thoughtful and three-dimensional, have become faded copies of copies of themselves. The plot thumps painfully along like a Buick with a flat, the story is as dull as dishwater, and the suspense...well, there isn't any. Poor Dr. Scarpetta--will we ever get a read where one (or more) of her faithful, trusted employees DOESN'T turn on her again? This book's going in the \\"Friends of the Library Sale\\" box. Like one of Scarpetta's cases, Predator is a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell's endless loop","review":"Cornwell's latest effort continues her lackluster performance. Cornwell never met a plot twist she didn't like; unfortunately, though, she's only ever met one or two. This latest relies on devices she has used, and overused, before. Lucy's inpenetrable computer security system penetrated by one of her self-destructive flings, Marino's boorish behaviour, and Scarpetta's inability to have a meaningful relationship with herself, let alone with another human being. Add to this the fact that what little there is new in this story Cornwell \\"borrowed\\" from the real-life National Forensic Academy, and you'll find very little new or original in plot, character development or technical details. Altogether a great disappointment - save your money for the next Kathy Reichs book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I read all the Scarpetta novels as soon as they are released. to say this one was disappointing to say the least .

I was amazed at how poorly this book was written. I kept reading it hoping it would finally start to flow the way a book by an established author should flow, but it never did. The ending, consisting of about a dozen pages at best, wrapped up every story line in the book - One sentence for each plot twist throughout - and stupid, unbelievable conclusions at that. I will never read another book by Cornwell again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"This is my first Scarpetta book and I must say that it was absolutely awful.

It is a shame because Ms. Cornwell is a gifted writer and story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peevish cardboard cutouts wander in pursuit of plot","review":"Have been growing increasingly disappointed with the Kay Scarpetta series, and this one continues the trend. Without the context of the previous books of the series, the characters behave in pointless and confusing ways. Why are Marino and Kay angry at each other? What is the Academy? Who is Benton Wesley, and what on earth is Lucy's problem? Even with the history of the previous books, the characters are flat, and their behaviour bizarre without being interesting. Even the new characters, Joe, Dr Self, Hog and Basil, are dull and shallow. The lack of a credible back story, the overly complicated plot and the reliance on characterisation set out in previous books to explain behaviour in this book is just plain lazy. A novel is supposed to be able to stand in its own right as an independent work, not just as an episode in an ongoing soap opera. Who really cares about citrus canker, anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the bouncing ball","review":"I was once a huge fan of the Scarpetta books, until all of the main characters just became more and more unhappy. But this book has an even bigger problem. It bounces from one character to another, from place to place, back and forth, and is almost impossible to follow.

I received the book from a friend - we share books given the high prices these days. I must also state my resentment about being pulled into Lucy's alternate lifestyle. If I wanted to read about the lives of lesbians, there is plenty out there to choose from. They can live however they want, but that doesn't mean I want to read about it any more than they want to read about straights.

Why Miss Cornwell thought fit to throw away a winning formular, I can't imagine. Her books used to enthrall, now they are laughable. Her murderers imitate something out of Frankenstien and her writing and plots are pathetic.There used to be something endearing about Dr. S when we were privy to her personal life and feelings. We could live her work and emotions with her now she's just a 'fill in' charecter. Lucy, never an appealing person, is now sad and bitter for no apparent reason, so is the, once excellent, Pete Marino.And if someone could teach PC how to construct a plausable ending that might lift the dismal picture.No more. No More!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could be the last Cornwell book I'll ever read.","review":"This is one of the most depressing works of fiction that I have ever read. I can't believe how the characters I loved and the complicated stories I couldn't wait for from year to year have deteriorated so terribly. It was dark in the way a deserted coal mine on the darkest night of winter is dark. It is as sad and depressing as ... I can't even think of an image that is sad and depressing enough. I grieve for the Kay Scarpetta I knew and loved. I grieve for Lucy and Morino and even, to a small extent, Benton. If they were real people that I met somewhere, I'd make a point to avoid them in real life, which is what I will do to Cornwell's books until someone else who has read them tells me that the smart, savvy and entertaining characters I knew and loved are getting their lives and act together again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta getting stale or is it Patricia?","review":"Next time I may not even bother with Kay and the gang, but maybe I will - who knows? People are always drawn to a good car crash. I found this book to be first and foremost a difficult read. I have read every Scarpetta novel, I know the charachters and their histories, but I found this book hard to follow. Kay, Merino and Lucy were very unlikable - cold, even cruel. Benton, poor man, I to, would be confused by Kay.I know a mystery novel isn't supposed to give away all the clues too quickly, but this book was like a flea, jumping from subject to subject, hardly completing a sentence, much less a thought.Mostly, I was again disapponted by the very rushed, not completely explained, ending. But this is Miss Cornwell biggest fault, and I think it is just getting worse with time. I don't know about anyone else, but after I invest the time to read a book, I would like a nice fact filled, satisfying ending - doesn't have to be happy - just without questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Wasted","review":"I had read most of the reviews here before tackling Predator. It was given to me as a gift so Ireally had no choice but to read it. Now, I can tell you that the reviewers were right; don't waste your time. This is no longer Patricia Cornwell writing...at least it's not the old Patricia Cornwell I was devoted to. I don't know what's happened in her last several books, but other than those that might be given to me, I won't waste time or money on another Cornwell novel. This was the worst one yet. I did try a book that was suggested by someone writing a review on Predator. The book is called Thirst and the person knew what they were talking about. It is a gripping book that I read in two nights...didn't want to put it down once I started it, ans it didn't disappoint. The only way to describe the ending is to say, \\"wow.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell loses her edge","review":"What happened to my beloved characters? Strong, enigmatic Marino is impotent (literally), Kay is skittish and unconfident, Lucy is weak and emotional, and Benton is distant and noncommittal. Oh, Ms. Cornwell, we have come so far together over the years, but this book was almost unreadable. Terrible, disjointed plot, boring prose, and silly dialogue. Kay Scarpetta and company NEED to return to power, not run a foundation like Knight Rider or Charlies Angels. Make Marino a REAL COP, make Kay a REAL ME, and give Lucy her balls BACK Dammit!!! The out of control spiral your characters are in is sad and disappointing, just like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer gone??","review":"this is not a good book...period!! if it makes the best seller list it is because someone bought the space.

The feeling that she was losing it has increased until, with this book I can only assume she needed the money and though rushing a book to market would solve her problem. There's is no other logical explanation for such a badly constructed book...the plot is a thin thread woven between explanations of how miserable her characters are feeling - about themselves and each other. The ending gave me the impression that she got tired of writing and quit after a brief(and strange)chapter in which she attempted to explain and end all of the subplots. When compared with her earlier books you're forced to wonder if she doesn't need a vacation from writing. I'm really disappointed that Ms. Cornwell is using her considerable talent to produce this type of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and disappointing.","review":"I agree with so many of the posts that the third-person narrative is not an addition to this series. A great deal of the strength of the earlier novels was Scarpetta's first-person narration. It is now lost in favor of a story that is told by no-one, and so has no particular voice or perspective. The plot is disjointed and the main characters spend far too little time interacting with one another. Cornwell's last few novels have asked us to believe in coincidences. More far-fetched, though, they've asked us to believe that Scarpetta et al are some sort of national celebrities, and that everyone knows who they are. Many of the crimes committed in the most recent novels are committed solely to get the attention of one of the main characters. Please, Ms. Cornwell, let Scarpetta tell her own tales, and return her to solving cases that have nothing to do with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I'm almost embarrassed to admit...but I read several of the reviews and STILL read the darn book. I've been a fan of Cornwell for so long and have enjoyed just about every book. The last 1 or 2 have slipped a little but this one was a real disappoinment. The story was very hard to follow and even the writing was confusing and didn't flow at all. I found myself wondering if she had even written this book...it's really different from her usual style. I just don't get it...I hope you or your publisher at least read the reviews and give us something we can brag about next time. We just want Cornwell back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Mishmash","review":"I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky. This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere. Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows. This is my last Cromwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to be done with it.","review":"Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books). It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events. The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books). The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: \\"HUH??\\"This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read. It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and \\"Forget about it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I should have listened to the other reviewers--this book is horrible! While the author has written great reads in the past, she seems to have forgotten that, even in this series, people need at least one person they can like--the characters are so awful--as twisted as the people they are supposed to catch, that reading it is totally unsatisfying--it's more fun to root for the \\"bad\\" guys than Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy, etc, although, in this case, it's more fun just not to read the book at all! As if that wasn't enough, it was ridiculously hard to follow--it skipped around so much you couldn't figure who was supposed to be where, doing what, with whom! Save your money and try a new author--Cornwell is past her prime with this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, 0","review":"I recently re-read her first book, POSTMORTEM,a masterpiece. Then I got this... well, abomination. Patricia Cornwell was one of my top 3 favorites for years... but her new stuff is unrecognizable. Gone is the pace, the suspense, and the character traits (affection, decency, dry humor) that made the books meaningful and interesting. Like Robert Tannenbaum, my other big favorite, whose books WERE apparently written by Michael Gruber.. when Gruber took a hike, the stories took a dive. I think Ms. Cornwell writes these books but just got bored with the series. Time to find some new authors, especially since book prices seem to go up 25% every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"These books just must write themselves. Uuumm...let's see...Marino is still angry and in love with Kay, Benton and Scarpetta are still workaholics and Lucy, the stone butch niece, is still having shame-filled, debasing sexual encounters with psycho-serial killers. I'm thinking Cornwell ought to title her next one, \\"Self-loathing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwall's books. \\"Predator\\" was a disapointment. The characters with whom I have become acquainted, and enjoyed just didn't appear present in this novel. I kept turning back through the text trying to find answers to many unanswered questions. The plot was more like reading a Dean Koontz novel, in fact, I turned to the book jacket to make sure it was Patricia Cornwall that I was actually reading. Her earlier books were spellbinding, this novel, just not enjoyable, not engaging and not worth my reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited months for this????","review":"How am I disappointed?......Let me count the ways!!!! First, Kay Scarpetta has been turned into a robot in a skirt! She has become a cold unfeeling person except where Lucy is concerned. I am not sure that she was that upset about Lucy's secret except that she hadn't been in on it from the get-go. If I was Benton or Marino I would tell her to go take a \\"flying leap\\". When I went from chapter 63 to 64 I was sure I must have skipped a chapter or two. I hope she stays happy with her \\"job\\" 24/7 because at the end of the day thats all she will have. If Patricia Cornwell is tired of Kay Scarpetta then she should give her up instead of making her loyal readers despise what Kay has turned into, a self-absorbed, workalcholic who has no need for anyone. SAD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop, Patricia Cornwell","review":"Again, why is she continuing this series? I really hate that she doesn't tell the story from Kay's POV. And come on, Lucy's storyline was right out of a soap opera! These characters are nothing of what they used to be. I understand people change, but this is just rediculous. I only finished it because it would annoy me not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves the reader unsatisfied","review":"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta series and have really enjoyed most of them (the earlier ones more than the newer ones). I don't understand Cornwell's direction with Predator. It was too choppy and once it got to the solving of the \\"mysteries\\", it was very unsatisfying. Especially the ending. I wondered if I was missing a chapter!I miss the old Kay and I don't like the new Marino at all. Lucy seems to be too complicated and the Kay/Benton relationship is wierd. They seem to have unreal relationship issues when it comes to being mad and breaking up. I really preferred the more realistic times with Kay as the coroner, Marino as the detective, and Lucy and Benton with the FBI. This new academy is a stretch for these characters.Maybe this is a way for the author to \\"write off\\" a series and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Having read all of the Kay Scarpetts series I have found it has really gone down hill. Cornwells last book was a slight recovery from a long downhill slide so I had high hopes for this one. Although all of the main characters are becoming so disfunctional that I am losing any interest I had in them the book is fairly good until the end when it totally falls apart. It seems as though Cornwell ran out of time and had to write a quick ending. The only way this ending can be saved is if there is a sequel which goes back and explains in more detail what happened and continues from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sad","review":"It just didn't seem like it was written by the same author. I think the 3rd person point of view that the series has now taken the mystery out of the story all together. Every character I have come to like for example Marino and Benton, were now portrayed as entirely miserable people with no hope. ALL protagonist characters were portrayed in a negative light from chapter to chapter showing nothing but human weakness. That's usually ok for a book but, those portrayals of the protagonists are usually backed up by their strengths in the end.I hope if there is another one, it will revert back to style of the Body Farm and Potters Field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"I have read all her novels and really enjoyed most. Predator is not her best work, it is still on the coffee table half read. I wish I had spent the $25 more wisely.

I was really disappointed in the ending of this one. It was so vague that if you weren't familiar with the author's style, you would not have gotten the ending. And it seems like the relationship between Kay and Lucy never changes. It really needs to go somewhere so we're not reading the same lines in every book. Hopefully if there is a next Scarpetta book, we'll see some much needed changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the barrel","review":"I had hoped that Cornwell, once one of my favorite mystery writers, might have picked up her socks with Predator, but it was not to be. This is by far her worst book. She seems to have developed an intense dislike for ALL of her characters, with the result that the book seems little more than an exercise in misanthropy. I slogged through it, in the vain hope that it would somehow improve, but it never did. Save your pennies for something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is Enough.","review":"Even one star is too many for this book. I always liked Kay Scarpetta and looked forward to each new book. The last few were below par, but most 'series' have up-and-down cycles, so I went ahead and bought this one.

Cornwell wallows in the violence of her sociopathic characters and makes the \\"good guys\\" more and more unlikeable. I keep expecting the misogynistic Marino to go postal and start committing serial murders on his own....Maybe that's Cornwell's next plot line. Scarpetta is cold as ice, Benton is too wrapped up in his ego to see through his evil \\"pet\\" patient. Lucy falls for a lesbian serial killer. All in all, just another atrocious waste of time. Turn the lights out when you leave folks, I'm outta here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I've never read Patricia Cornwell and received this as a gift. I couldn't even finish it. It seems there is no suspense and no real story that is easy to follow. I almost forget that there is supposed to be an investigation.

Perhaps I will try one of her earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Downhill","review":"Patricia Cornwell's \\"Scarpetta\\" series keeps going downhill. It took me weeks to finish \\"Predator\\" because I kept dozing off when trying to read this boring book. Cornwell's early novels stuck with medical facts and interesting pathological details. Now she seems to be relying more on psychobabble and pseudoscience in her books. The characters are less and less believeable and she also appears to be trying to become more politically correct. I was able to finish this book, so I rated it two stars. However, if you want to read \\"Predator\\", I would recommend borrowing it or checking it out from the library. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing and boring","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, but they are getting worse and worse. This will probably be the last book of hers that I will read. It was the worst one yet. I have just given up on believing her books will get better again. This one was too technical and kept going from one place to another and was very confusing to me. I really used to like her books, but I guess she has used up all her good ideas and now is just writing anything just to have a book to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"I find it hard to believe that Patricia Cornwell wrote this book. I think the average high schooler could have done better. The many twisted story lines went in so many directions that it was just confusing. I kept waiting and waiting for them to make sense, but they never did. The ending was so disappointing that I wanted to throw the book in the trash! I think Ms. Cormwell got tired of the book about halfway through but had a deadline to make. Don't waste your money or your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Cornwell's name in the obit column","review":"Who or how many different people wrote Predator? It surely wasn't Cornwell. If this had been her first Scarpetta novel, she would have had to self-publish it because no major house or distributor would have carried it. Her novels have become increasingly bad; this one is definitely recycle material. Terrible writing, no pace, disconnected story line, dis- and unconnected characters (comic book type) who are unrecognizable from Cornwell's earlier works including Scarpetta. This book is a sick scheme to bilk money from a previously loyal following. Well, that's it, I'm done with Cornwell. Can't wait for the next Kathy Reich's novel; now that lady can still write good forensic/psycho thrillers. Bye bye, Cornwell; you'll not fool me anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Awful","review":"I'd seen Cornwell's books around and when a friend gave me this one, I tried reading it.

It was still a good read but not her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator by Patricia Cornwell","review":"This was the worst. Not only are the characters more and more unlikable and even disgusting, the story was not there, either. I wish Ms. Cornwell would drop this whole Lucy character, the Acadamy (too outlandish) and her relationship with the rest of her recurring characters. I really do not need to spend my time reading this trash. I used to be a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"As usual with the Patricia Cornwell books, I went out and bought Predator the first day it became available. I've loved her books and didn't have an agenda or negative feelings of any kind as I started this one. I found after the first few chapters that I just didn't care to read on and put it down to read the latest Sue Grafton which was excellent. I haven't been inclined to pick it up again and decided to read some of the amazon reviews to see if any of the other readers had found it a slow starter which eventually picked up momentum. I'm disappointed to read that this isn't the case so I won't bother. Maybe Cornwell needs to start a new series with fresh characters. I hope this doesn't happen with Sue Grafton and her 'alphabet' series or Linda Fairstein who's Alex Cooper books just keep getting better. I highly recommend S is for silence and the brand new Fairstein book Death Dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is by far the worst Patricia Cornwell book.

I don't believe I'll ever again pay full price for anything she writes. This book was a mess. The plot wandered, the characters were unappealing, and the only reason I finished it was because it is set, primarily, in my hometown of Hollywood, Florida, and I know a number of people who actually work in the Medical Examiner's Office. Turns out, that wasn't reason enough to have wasted my time. What a disappointment. I don't know what has happened to Cornwell to turn her writing so sour, but I hope she recovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not her best Scarpetta novel","review":"I, too, have been reading the Kay Scarpetta novels from the beginning. Unfortunately, Predator is not like any of her others -- I had difficulty tracking the characters and the clues -- she was also extremely detailed in her description(s).....I have followed Lucy from the time she was a child, and it was disappointing to see such a brilliant character take such an unsuspecting turn for the worse. I'm not sure of the direction Cornwell is taking with Lucy, Marino and Scarpetta -- but it would be nice for the next novel to pull them all together again and have Lucy and Scarpetta become the strong, independent, capable characters they once were. This book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell tries to copy Dan Brown","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in the lastest installment of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series ... mainly because there wasn't enough Scarpetta in the story.Cornwell takes on a Dan Brown-like pacing -- short chapters, jumping from plot line to plot line -- that doesn't suit the complex character that is Scarpetta. We've grown to love her work at the crime scene, at the autopsy table and in the kitchen.

I have the feeder in the shade but the nectar still seeps and I have not seen a hummingbird at this feeder. I plan to take this feeder to Michigan where my mother has active hummers and will see if the design works better there.

I haven't had a chance to play around with it to see what's going on. Also note that the minimum focusing distance is 5 ft, so if you're buying it for macro work, keep that in mind.

With my A-1 I had a Quantaray 85-300 Zoom with macro lens. After looking at lens, the Sigma was a great deal. It operates well on auto zoom and I get impressive photos even at 300mm. Being new to the digital SLR, when I switch the lens to macro, the closest you can be from your subject is 4-5 feet. With my Quanataray I could get as close as 3-4 INCHES and be able to focus in.

Nice bang for the buck try it and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable bargain!","review":"I wanted a cheap telephoto lens for those times I need the reach. Since I don't use it that often, I felt no need for a large or expensive lens. I debated between this lens, the Tamron 70-300 Di, and the Sigma APO of the same type. This was the cheapest so I went with it. Frankly, I can't believe how good this lens is for its price. At 70mm, it's tack sharp corner to corner. Even 200-300 it's quite good. And the Macro mode is just icing on the cake--1:2 magnification means you can get quite close.It's true, you need a fair amount of light for this lens to shine--no argument there. But for the individual who only does this sort of stuff for fun, this lens is hard to beat. I can't imagine the APO variant is worth $70 more--I cannot detect any difference from sample pictures posted online.

I even ck'd out some photos people had sent in, esp the sports photos. I couldn't believe the clarity! HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE. Firstly, no one person mention they ever used a tripod for the longer length. Some even mentioned the camera was 'handheld'. Well I found I could not take NOT ONE decent shot over 200 mm and not have it out of focus. Certainly setting up a tripod each time is not practical unless you're into nature photography. Thats why the pictures of sports interested me. So I sent it back and determined to stick w/ a max of 200 focal length. Seriously considering Sigma 18-200 but would like to come down in price. I applaud those that took shots at 250-300 mm but apparently thats not for me.Well constructed. Sorry it didn't work out for my Canon 350D.

It's very noisy and the autofocus is poor, even in good light. The lack of an image stabilizer means that, unless you have surgeon-like hands, you will probably need a tripod to get a clear shot when fully zoomed in. And you can pretty much forget about action shots.That said, it's probably the least expensive lens of this type you can get and it's more versatile than a point-and-shoot. If you're brand new to SLR photography it's a good tool to experiment with. If you're a bit more seasoned, save up and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for macro, not tele.","review":"The price was low, so I thought I try it.

The AF is a bit slow, average 1 - 2 seconds compared to the kit lens my D3200 came with (0.5 secs). You definitely need a tripod for 300mm zoom. The lens is not very fast in terms of aperture size, so the shoots need to be adjusted accordingly. The macro mode is great!

This was done straight from the camera. Rodeo footage was shot at 60p outdoors at sunset, politics were done at 30p indoors.* The political event was great, had a nice backdrop. I was in as a video journalists covering the candidates. I was about 110-120 feet from the stage.

The zoom and focus rings move very smoothly, and I had no problem getting great macro shots after only a little practice switching between modes. Another example of expected Sigma quality at a great price.Cons: Don't expect clear shots if using it hand-held unless you're shooting faster than 1/1000 shutter speed, hand shake is very noticeable even in the 70-100mm range. Mounted on my Canon 350D, auto-focus only works 50% of the time, often it could not find the subject in the 200-300mm range.

If you have burns, cuts, hemmoroids, dry skin,just about anything. It doesn't have a good smell, not bad either so it's not like a strong medicinal fragrance that people will notice or perfumy. It absorbs pretty quickly, it's kinda creamy not runny, a caramel color cream/paste type.

Incredible vocal harmonies and guitars. The lead guitarrist(playing the requinto) has to be heard to be believed. I have never heard anyone like him in this genre. I am also a musician so I have heard a lot of them. I hope we can get a CD version of the original. The real McCoy has a white cover with three guitars interlocked and the faces of the musicians showing thru the sound holes of the guitars. The original LP that I have is @ 40 yrs old and in near mint condition.

Gene Hackman, James Coburn and Ben Johnson are each at their finest. And who knew Candice Bergen could sit a horse so well? This grueling endurance race, based very loosely on a true story, pits Thoroughbred against Mustang, Arabian against Quarter Horse. The riders are no less a mixed bag than their mounts. The savage terrain takes its toll on man and beast, creating enemies and reluctant allies. The brutality depicted in this race was not unknown at that time and one hopes that the Special Effects Department was responsible for bringing it to the screen.

It almost felt like the speakers could not handle the load.That turned out to be real, one speaker died after a month, then the other. The plastic that the unit was made out of would break off into small pieces, it didn't last even 2 months.This is just not worth the money and is not convent in any way.

She said that the push to eliminate grain, and aim for pure meat is mainly driven by marketing and not dog biology.

The book really comforted me in this time of grief and got me interested in researching more the afterlife.I thank Sylvia for putting this out there.

I've read it once already and am reading it for a second time. It really helped me to deal with the breakup of my boyfriend and I, and it gave me a lot of hope for the future. I've read many of Browne's other works, and I didn't find this one too repetitive. Sure, she covers some of the same ground as in her other books (mainly to benefit 1st time readers), but she does so very briefly. I can't say enough good things about \\"Wisdom and Comfort...\\" It really is inspiring. Even if you don't believe in her theories, her advice is practical and helpful.

He then proceeds to outline his understanding of various Old Testament books and groups of books: Job, Deuteronomy, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes and The Prophets. This is not an academic work, nor is it really a meditative book. It is a highly readable work that I would suggest using as a bible study aid with the goal of enriching one's spiritual life.Yancey never ceases to amaze me with his spiritual insights -- especially given that I am a self-styled \\"liberal\\" and he is a self-styled \\"evangelical.\\" This book is yet another very worthwhile read by this truly excellent Christian author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Slightly Flaky","review":"I have never read one of Philip Yancey's books before. If this is an indication of what the others are like, then I've not missed anything.I flipped over his protrayal of Moses as feeble, and with cataracts; the Bible explicitly speaks of Moses at his death as being strong and not having cataracts.The author also is a bit depressive for me. Life isn't as black and depressing as he protrays it, and the Old Testament isn't just full of people ranting and questioning God because they are depressed with life. This book leaves us with very little hope in the end. It even tells us, \\"Do we matter? Does god care? We must live in faith, aware that those questions will lack a final answer until that decisive day when God does act, spectacularly, in Jesus' Second Coming.\\" We have to wait until the Second Coming to find out if God cares? If so, then I want nothing of Christianity. Jesus dying for us obviously shows us that God cares.Read another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"Yancey's problem is that he follows fads. It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting. Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad. That's what Yancey does. The title, \\"The Bible That Jesus Read\\", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity. The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity. Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating. It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble. Ordaining homosexuals? What do you think about that Yancey? Is that a part of the \\"Bible that Jesus Read\\"? Ridiculous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible Jesus Red","review":"Yancey did a nice job of discussing the difficult books of the Old Testament.

It also collapses very easily and is very short (my 3 year old is too tall for it and 75% of 3 year olds are taller than he is). The flags fall out easily, too. My 3 year old says he likes it, but he never plays with it other than to kick it down to get past it to the toys behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely average whodunnit thriller","review":"This is a below-average whodunnit thriller that stars a pudgier Tom Berenger. Not much action here, it's a thriller that relies a lot on the dialogue to carry the story. The plot is somewhat convoluted, as many important characters to the story are mentioned only by name, and some aren't seen until late in the movie, so it's important to pay attention to the dialogue in detail. It's somewhat hard to keep the plot straight in the 1st viewing, but makes a lot more sense watching it the 2nd time.Berenger is ideally suited as the veteran hard...cop who takes no gruff, Lori Heuring provides nice eye candy as the damsel in distress, and there is a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming that helps make up for the rather slow-moving story.Barebones DVD, with just 3 trailers as the only bonus features..."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISING MOVIE","review":"I always did think that Tom Berenger was a good actor. He's one of those character actors that always adds spice to whatever movie he might be in.In TRUE BLUE, he gets a starring role, and he delved into his character excellently.He plays a beaten down and warn out cop who hasn't had a break his entire life. Then when a beautiful suspect, played by Lori Heuring, needs a shoulder to cry on, he, against better judgement, takes her in. And quite frankly, you don't blame him.Tom Berenger gives an excellent performance. The story is entertaining and filled with multiple twists. So, if you're looking for one of those movies that didn't get a whole lot of publicity, and deserved it. This is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a neat album, and for a German band, they don't sing with thick accents like others do.

Are fans crazy? Have they discovered the true essence of fellowship? Is that ref crazy?! Why not have another? St. John's book is the perfect combination of travel book, social observation, philosophical tract, slice of Americana, sports column, historical perspective and humor. I have only a passing knowledge of sports, and I NEVER read the sports pages, yet I found this book immensely entertaining. St. John treats his fellow fans as comrades-in-arms - real people rather than easy caricatures - and the reader gains a true insight into the mind of the fan in the process of meeting them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for all sports fans","review":"I'm not a Crimson Tide fan (go Irish!), but I don't think an Auburn fan could read Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer without nodding along. St. John's picture of intense fandom is gorgeous and accurate -- not least because he succumbs to it, going so far as to buy his own RV -- but he doesn't use the novel preach about Bama being the best there is. Or, more accurately, this book wasn't written specifically for Bama fans. It was written for sports fans, and Bama was the lens St. John chose. So there might be some preaching, but it's forgivable... and besides, it's really easy to substitute your own team name into his sentences.Really, though, this book should be required reading for all souls unlucky enough to have latched on to a sports team. It's funny, and touching, and validating. And reading it made me hungry for football."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable for the college football fan","review":"As a college football fan, I enjoyed this book very much. I am not nearly as fanatical as the RVer's described in this book, but I can appreciate their zeal. St. John gave a good glimpse of what this slice of American culture is like. Some parts were a little less interesting, like his shopping for an RV for himself, but overall I would recommend this book for any college football fan. May not be as much of interest to non-fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bama Fans Suck, but This is a Fun Book","review":"As a grad of another SEC school who over the years has sufferred through many defeats at the hands of Alabama, I certainly don't have any abiding love for the Crimson Tide and their fans. In fact, I enjoyed recently learning that Alabama had more \\"Walmart Fans\\" than any other school. A Wal Mart Fan is a fan who rather than being someone who attends the school is connected only by their wearing of the school paraphanalia purchased from Wal Mart.All of the above aside, St. John's book is a fun read for football fans , and even those who don't get it about crazy fans. I'm sure that the book will be especially enjoyable for the Roll Tide crew. So, I defintiely recommend it.In closing, Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer, Go to Hell Alabamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice read, but probably only for college football junkies (like me)","review":"St. John's book is fun to read if you're a college football fan and been involved with tailgating and RV'ing to a game. He isn't a very accomplished writer with a lot of poorly phrased ideas, strangly structured chapters and several out of place remarks. That's really criticizing his style more than substance, so others may not be as annoyed by it as I was, but on almost every page something showed me his writing could have used a good edit (or rewrite).I love the topic he picked and thoroghly enjoyed reading about the Alabama football culture. It's a lot of fun to read about, but I'd be surprised if anyone outside of the college football universe would care much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rammed and Jammed","review":"Gee, there are loyal fans who follow football games and hold tailgate parties on the parking lots of football stadiums. Who knew? Let's send an investigative reporter to rip the lid off this social phenom. This is the tired core of this overexposed tome. Be forewarned there are some dreary racial views expressed in this book, and the author's attitude has been excoriated in the new-South publication Nashville Scene. I picked up this book to find out what the racial controversy was about. Putting it down was no problem for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll Tide!","review":"I am not a fan of Alabama, I do however understand the fervent fan world. Living in Columbus, Ohio, you can almost not avoid the intense Ohio State Buckeye support.I found Rammer Jammer a fun book to read. The fans depicted by St. John were both endearing and understandable in their manis to support 'Bama. I like that St. John did not come into their world as an absolute outside, he was already an ardent Alabama fan. To have done this otherwise would have come off as condesending and mocking at the expense of his subjects. I would recommend this as a good read for family members of those crazed fans of any sports team. It may help to shine a light on the mania of your loved one who devotes so much time and energy to their team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better than George MacDonald","review":"If you're a CS Lewis fan, you need to read this book. I had this book in paperback form some years ago, and lent it to somebody and never got it back. It's just that good. :)Although the writing's a bit archaic, in a style more akin to Tolkien's LOTR books, it's not an exceptionally hard nor long book to read. MacDonald was a much more solid writer in general than Tolkien (in his early days), and the style lends itself well to the story. Like Lewis, MacDonald used allegory in most, if not all, of his fantasy stories, and this is a great example of that. There's a lot of very complex imagery and symbolism-- most of which I'm sure I can't even comprehend.Despite deeper meanings, there's still an intriguing story going on, one that's not hard to follow, and exciting to read. It feels like a folktale in some ways, but like deep myth in others. If you're a fan of older myth and folk tales, then you'll really enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"It can be a bit sluggish or hard to follow from time to time, which may prove to much for many readers, but if given a chance this story is an absolutely fantastic read. I highly recommend picking this up if you are a fan of any type of fictional story that hold a deeper purpose than to simply entertain. Stories that are real and meaningful as well as enjoyable fiction are rare today. Similar reads include those written by authors such as Tolkien and Lewis.I began reading George MacDonald's works soon after I finished everything I could find of C.S Lewis's, and was a bit skeptical at first, even with Lewis's high amount of praise. McDonald's works however, far surpass the expectations I had and this book is the crown jewel(imo). Once again, If your a fan of Lewis or Tolkien in particular, George MacDonald is a lesser known author that you will definitely enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun mythical romp.","review":"Lillith is a beautiful story that, as a good fairy tale should, draws the tragic and exultant in a heightening crescendo. The story is an enjoyable journey through an imaginative and enchanting allegory of love, forgiveness and redemption. The imagery is heavy enough that it is often hard to figure out just what everything represents or if someone or something represents anything at all. The narrator, Mr. Vane (one wonders if MacDonald was playing off the homophone with vain or not), can be hard to accept at times but, as MacDonald no doubt intended, we see enough of our foolish selves in him to understand the tragedy and triumph of his part in the tale. My one complaint might be the ambiguity of the ending. It is too much at odds with all that is accomplished through the narrative to that point. Additionally, MacDonald's fairy tales help one to understand the sources for much of CS Lewis's work, both in the themes and styles employed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Works of Literature!","review":"Lilith is the story of a man who begins noticing strange things happening in his library, which eventually lead him into another world. In this world, there are beautifully good beings, but also great and dangerous evil beings. Lilith is the Queen of the latter, a vampire-like being who sucks life from all that she can get her hands on, including the entire city which she rules over and at one point our unsuspecting traveler. When our traveler encounters the daughter of Lilith, a sweet girl with whom he falls in love, plans are made and steps taken to overtake Lilith in her city and end the reign of terror. But who will survive this grand plan? Will our hero ever make it back to his own world? And, would he want to?One of my favorite reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"George MacDonald is my favorite author, and Lilith is my favorite book. It has so many subtle levels of depth and thought that every time I read it I glean new understanding and insight. It is a book that you just can't read in one sitting. You need time to mull it over and to savor the journey. Fantastic fantasy! Timeless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Crazy and Unrealistic","review":"This book is insane. He follows a Raven through a mirror into another world. There is also a lot of reference to the Bible and if you don't know about the Bible you will get lost. The end is also very confusing. The end makes little sense and there is a sense of being unfinished to it. Some parts were ok but the overall book was weird and confusing.My overall feeling towards the book was that it was weird. Broken up though, parts were ok. The begining was weird and confusing. The middle was pretty good. Escpecially when he is with the Little Ones. The end, however, is horrible. There actually is no end. No one is really sure how it ends because of the abrupt and mysterious ending.If fairy tales are your thing you might like this book, but if you want to read about something that has any chance of happening this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty","review":"Lilith arrived quickly and I started reading immanently, then college reading got in the way, then I read other books... did not seem as good as Phantastes, but I'd still recommend it to any MacDonald fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I would like it, but...","review":"Since I like MacDonald's novels in general, I thought I would like Lilith, but I didn't. Maybe it's too difficult for me. I fought through it and enjoyed certain portions, but I was tempted not to finish it. I think it might be \\"over my head.\\" I'm not talking about the \\"universalist\\" theology of it, because I understand what he is saying there, although I think the Bible clearly does not support it (I sense a temptation within myself to wish universalism were true), but I could have found much value in the story anyway if I could have understood it more thoroughly. I'm writing this review as a warning to readers like me who enjoy MacDonald's non-fantasy novels (and I prefer his originals there to the modernized versions) but will find Lilith to be a far different reading experience, one that they may not enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"wake at last","review":"Lilith is typical MacDonald. It is often tedious. It can leave you guessing as to what exactly is going on. It can leave you downright frustrated with the man. Yet it has moments of brilliance that make the whole endeavor more than worth the struggle. Lilith is one of MacDonald's most mature books. It is much darker than works such as The Princess and the Goblin or At the Back of the North Wind. It has some affinity with the works of MacDonald's friend, Lewis Carroll. At its core, it is an allegory for MacDonald's anti-Calvinist notions of Universalism. For all its obtuseness and periodical preachiness, it is a fine story in the end (I liken it to Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, which, for me, was a pain to read--but when it was over I loved the story). Just an aside--you should really read this book and then go on to C.S. Lewis' The Great Divorce. The two books go very well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOOOHHHHHH yes!","review":"Dont be deceved by the sell out to Levis, flat beat is nothing in comparison to the HUGE bass available on this CD.

Mikloajczyk takes no responsibility for the ascention of the Communists after World War II in Poland, instead blaming the Nazis, the Poles who remained during the war, the Soviets and even the Allies themselves.

In my opinion all of their movies are just as good today as when they first came out. This movie as well as the story its self were far ahead of there time and any parent with a young child would be hard pressed to find movies that tell such great stories without having to worry about what their child is being exposed too.

Historian Jesse Ballenger follows its impact from the 19th to the late 20th century, when Alzheimer's became associated with the loss of self. What makes his survey intriguing is his focus on changing American society and culture which fostered the idea of selfhood as a status, and later on as a willful construction. Both science and history blend in a survey of aging and dementia, making for a broad discussion not just of changing American attitudes and culture, but changing health system responses.Diane C.

Anyone who was willing to strap themselves into one of those early capsules that was then attached to one of those early rockets does not deserve such rancor. There were bound to be mistakes. Minimizing mistakes as well as learning from mistakes was top priority. Everyone involved seemed to recognize this.

Diamond Head can sink no lower.","review":"Diamond Head's first two albums were excellent melodic metal albums that proved to be an excellent cross of Iron Maiden and Def Leppard styles. The follow-up album, Canterbury, was a disgraceful attempt and becoming extremely melodic, and it forced the band's break-up. Ten years later they tried again with Death And Progress, which was even worse than Canterbury. This is a live album with very poor sound quality in which Diamond Head plays, you guessed it, the worst songs of their career (Canterbury and Death And Progress material for the most part.) A bonus CD includes some cover songs, but like Death And Progress, they totally fail to please. Get Diamond Head's first two albums, BUT BUY NOTHING ELSE BY THEM. This downfall is ironic in that changing styles is what killed the band they influenced most (Metallica.) And like them, Diamond Head just kept on putting out pathetic releases, not even caring about their quality.

There has not been enough written or on screen regarding the Hellenic expulsion from the Asia Minor coast, and this book does it some justice. Very colorful at points and makes you want upset knowing that this Eden in Asia Minor has been destroyed. I wished the love story with Philothei would have been more developed and less Gallipoli and technicalities regarding Gallipoli.

Or at least what I saw of it which was nearly 2500 miles with many stops along the way. The book is amazing, a little long in the tooth with the history, as I like the personal look at things.

If you try to attach the feeder to the window with the glass attached it doesn't work.I purchased this for my mother and she loves it. You can really see them very close up with this feeder. They are amazing. Note if you have lights on during dusk it may scare the hummingbirds away. Also if you have other bird feeders in the area it also seems to scare the little fellows away.We have also found that you need to put this out in the early spring so they know it there.

You need to take off the suction cup section to mount to the window, then attach the feeder part to that. I couldn't get them apart.

Look at other reviews about how to dremmel part of the suction cup section away to get around this. Eventually this works well, just not as shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Flaw in Design","review":"While it seems intuitively obvious, I nonetheless read the instructions on how to mount this. Then I did what it said: cleaned the window, attached the suction cups to the feeder, wet the cups and pressed it against the window. Only problem is this: the plastic rim on the back of the unit around the suction cups prevents you from firmly pressing the cups against the window. Result: the unit stayed put for less than 30 minutes before falling off and breaking into sticky mess.Something in the design or installation of this unit needs to change."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"Only buy this if you dont want to stick it onto a window with the suction cups. the plastic piece that holds the cups in place prevent the cups from gaining full contact with the glass, so I was unable to stick it to my window!!

An atractive price until you find you're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped, not to mention the poor quality design. Couldn't give me another one of these ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best priced window feeder","review":"This feeder isn't perfect, but it's the least expensive window feeder with a decent capacity. I have three of these feeders and have no complaints about them. The fill hole is a bit small, but still big enough to get a bottle brush in. The feeder base is easy to clean. The suction cups probably don't work for people because they are not affixing it properly. You're supposed to moisten the suction cups, stick them onto the glass, then slide the feeder downward into the suction cup holder and it clicks into place. I've never had a feeder fall off the glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly badly designed","review":"All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy for suction cups","review":"I've got several different kinds of hummingbird feeders. I bought this one because I like to see the hummingbirds rest. I very carefully followed the *extensive* installation instructions on the suction cups (boiling, finger oils, washing the window), and then hung it up. About 10 seconds later it fell down, smashing the red plastic feeder unit completely. I replaced it with a lighter, all-plastic feeder whose suction cups held it solidly to the window all summer: Woodstream 217 Window Mount Hummingbird Feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice idea","review":"The window attachment did not work with this hummingbird feeder. Had to improvise putting it on a pole with some wire."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID: BAD DESIGN","review":"The suction cups on this are WAY TOO SMALL for the HEAVY GLASS. I just bought this and HATE IT because of this. I can't mount it to the glass without it sliding. it's totally ridiculous. NOT WORTH IT.

Big design flaw, do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"window mount glass hummingbird feeder","review":"This is a very poor product. The glass bottle with liquid is much too heavy for the small suction cups provided. There was no way that I could keep them on the window. They slide down as soon as I put them up[. When I finally got one up, by the time I got back in the house it had fallen to the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass Hummingbird Feeder","review":"I really did not realize how heavy this feeder was until it arrived. No matter what I do to clean the glass surface and the suction cups, the feeder falls off of the window. It is just too heavy or the cups do not provide enough suction to hold it. Every time it falls, the glass chips off the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw prevents strong attachment to window","review":"Please beware. The two suction cups are attached to a plastic housing that has a major design flaw. There is a plastic lip that prevents the suction cups from getting close enough to the window glass for full suction. I had to take my dremel tool and cut off the plastic lip (about 75% around each suction cup) before this would attach to the window. Be prepared to do the same to get this to stick to the glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to refill","review":"I have owned multiple window hummingbird feeders and this one is by far the worst.

As there is always a possibility of a large bird hitting a feeder, I would not recommend the glass feeder. I've had a plastic window feeder for years.

The feeder is very sturdy & the humming birds come right to it. The big problem is the suction cups. There is a plastic piece that surrounds the suction cups, so it is impossible for the suction cups to be flat against the window. This causes the feeder to constantly slide off the window, especially when it rains.

Mine also didn't look like Amazon.com's pictures.Numerous design and quality problems include defective suction cups, the filler hole in the glass is about 3/8\\" (difficult to fill; impossible to clean), the red base has white stress/stretch marks. The bracket design is such that you can't press the suction cups onto the glass well without breaking the plastic.In summary, it is real .... Don't expect it to last, so buy two (one for spare parts).On the positive side, however, it doesn't leak (yet), and the quality of the Perky Pet feeders that I have bought locally is just as bad.

This was thought to be good, or at least good enough for other deals? As I said, I understand that garage band rock was a big focus, with other bands too as The Vines and even Jet a bit, but this leads to success?Sometimes I have to sit back and remind myself that good comes out of bad, because the band's improved and that's for sure; however, unless you're a Hives fan, or just a music connoisseur like me, then you'll never pick up this album.

The handle at the other end of the light is made to screw on as part of the easy assembly, but the threads of the one piece were too small. I had to buy a threaded rod and cut it to size to make it work. It was prett easy for me, but shouldn't have been necessary obviously. Also, the clamping device that holds the light in whatever verticle position you put it in needed some work.

Based on reviews that I had read I was eagerly awaiting a surrealistic nightmare peppered with poigniant social commentary in a style that I had yet to be exposed to.The book reads like a moderately talented high schooler's short story. This proves that being able to string sentences together in a cognizant way does not a great author make.I found the dialogue very simplistic and assuming, and the narrative was boring in contrast to the psychotic events taking place. I wish there had been a more enticing use of language and maybe a little depth to the characters.The story ends in a fantasy, but none of the questions ever get answered. Why is the mall menstruating? What does it all mean? Why couldn't anybody leave?I feel like the author had a clear message in his mind that just didn't come across to me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise","review":"Oh Carlton, I feel like you could have taken what began as a very interesting premise and done so much more with it. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. The ending was almost the equivalent of an insanity plea in the absurd way that it tried to wrap up all that had come before. And those 'illustrations'? At first I found them mildly entertaining because they were so rude and disgusting, but after the third or fourth it was like being an hour into the routine of a stand up comic who only knows fart jokes.I thought you really had it going on in 'Satan Burger'.

At first, things appear specific, yet with closer inspection become vague. You seem to grasp it and then it slips away. Seemingly familiar people suddenly change into strangers. This book definitely belongs in the Bizarro genre and it is quite a ride, accomplished in classic Mellick style.The social commentary is very amusing, but the author dives into a lot more areas and, by the end, somehow manages to pull it off with impressive fashion. Mellick describes the book as his homage to Luis Bunuel's \\"The Exterminating Angel\\", Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" (aka Ten Little Indians), and \\"The Breakfast Club\\". While this isn't my favorite by Carlton Mellick, it is certainly worth reading and a nice addition to his eclectic body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than sex!

The language is simple and easy to read, but I think the point is to tell a story as simply as possible, without all the literary fluff. With this genre, the format works. Get in, paint a picture, and get out. The imagery will not soon leave your mind. As far as bizarro fiction goes, Carlton is one of the best at creating outrageous stories, in strange worlds, with underlying exaggerated pokes at how real life is or may become.

The tool arrived in an undamaged package. It really looked like it was very well engineered and manufactured until... Until I made the first 1/4\\" angle steel cut. The cut was perfect but the next morning I found oil all over the base of the saw. Well, it's my own fault, I trusted P-C name and not the reviewer above that documented the issue with the seal. So I decided to fix it by bringing the saw to the authorized P-C service center. It took them 4 weeks just to look at it and now they are telling me that it will take another 15-30 days for the parts to arrive. So I don't have my saw for a month already and I don't know when I get it back and how long the seal will last again.

There isn't a lot of \\"movement\\" in the illustrations. Mostly turning of the head or craning of the neck this way and that to show how the muscle and bones move with it. Same for the shoulders. There are only a few pages that compare youthful figures to older ones and the same for child and adult, but don't let this discourage you from trying it.

It is quieter, however they put the bearing for the fan that cools the motor outside the housing where it is subject to every particle of dust that passes through the machine and into the dust bag. We have a life of only 2 or 3 weeks of reasonable use before we have to have it serviced for a bearing replacement. If there were other issues I might consider abuse of some sort, but that one bearing is costing me a fortune.

Initially they recommended my taking it to a service center......but I refused and instead asked for a replacement idler, which they agreed to. The first box sent contained a drive belt???? Not sure how that was arrived at. Another series of calls eventually produced the correct part. I changed out the idler and the unit now works fine.

For a product made in France for centuries it seems very odd the there is a label on the bottom of the bottle itself in Arabic script. A bottle Creed Green Irish Tweed would normally retail at $270.00(us),even with an amazing discount, it seems difficult to believe that AMAZON could be selling new,fresh stock for $139.67, and possibly make a profit.

I purchased two other books on Finnish prior to this particular book and they were both structured for people who are new to learning languages. If you're new to learning languages, start with Spanish, certainly not Finnish. Finnish has an insanely difficult case system and since it's a member of the Finno-Ugric branch of languages, it has very few words derived from Indo-European. Thus you'll never find an English cognate unless the word was borrowed into Finnish. This book does an outstanding job of explaining how each case works, how it's inflected and goes into detail about consonant gradation. If you know linguistics and you want to learn Finnish grammer, this is the book for you!Note: Finland is NOT part of Scandinavia.

It is this character that provides the solidity to the series by towering over all the other actors and providing a focal point.The stories are well-written and interesting and do not disappoint. Anyone who enjoys a good dramatic series will rapidly become engaged with the series.

Being queen definitely had its payoffs. One of my favorite biographies by Erickson. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was excellent","review":"This the first book about Elizabeth I that I have read, but I found it fascinating. It is very detailed and absorbing. It is told like a story but is based on fact. Anyone interested in learning about Elizabeth Tudor and how she got to be the queen and the type of ruler she was, should read this. I would have enjoyed learning more about other events going on during her reign (to further understand Elizabethan England), but there is only so much you can get into one book. Ms. Erickson gives an in depth look at Elizabeth and the forces that shaped the woman and queen that she was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"Erickson gets one star for a lively and readable writing style. She's great at engaging the reader.I'd give her zero for accurate substance.If you examine her body of work, you find that she's a Mary Tudor apologist and that bias informs every line of this \\"biography\\" of Elizabeth as she revels in gossip and ignores accomplishments.Erickson should stick to novels, because that's what she's writing here. She misrepresents facts and her editorial slant colours every line. Nearly any other biography would give you a better idea of what really went on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slanted POV","review":"A biographer can approve or dissaprove of your subject, but this is a very unsympathetic and often inaccurate portrait of one of the history's most influential leaders. This authors' \\"Great Harry\\" displays a great admiration for Henry VII's first wife. His \\"Bloody Mary\\" is full of rationalizations for the excesses (and sometimes psychotic behavior) of his eldest daughther, who sent more people to torturous deaths in almost every year of her reign than Elizabeth did throughout her lengthy monarchy. While most of what is documented here is accurate, the analysis, in light of much evidence that is ignored, is a portrait that is more often mispreresentational than not. The writing is good and lively, which is unusual for a genre that tends to be stuffy, but for a truer understanding of one of history's most powerful rulers (and survivors), you'll want to also read other books for a more accurate portrayal of a complex character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Readable First Elizabeth","review":"What sets this book apart from others about Elizabeth I is Carolly Erickson's very engaging writing style. Unlike other writers who have not understood that one can be academic and interesting at the same time, Erickson has written a book full of fascinating information and insight, and she has done so in a style very amenable to enjoyment. Other drier writers should take a lesson from Erickson, who has not only the accuracy of her history in mind, but also the conveyance of that history to a rapt audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book.

An excellent book for learning about the Tutor world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Difficult Read","review":"I have read a couple of her books, Mistress Anne and Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I enjoyed them. So when I got The First Elizabeth was extremely disappointed. Having read dozens of books on Elizabeth and knowing something about the subject, this book does not really paint an accurate picture in my opinion. She writes more on gossip and rumours without giving acutal facts. There are accurate statements but they are not in evidence on the whole. She also tended(IMO) to side more with Mary Tudor, who was not as intelligent or politically astute as Elizabeth. She gave the feeling that Mary was just misunderstood. The author seemed to relish in court gossip especially from Elizabeth's maids of honour. I would recommend Mary M. Luke's, Gloriana: The Years Of Elizabeth I, and Alison Weir's, The Life of Elizabeth I before I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Films!!!!","review":"These films are great examples of stop motion art.

It also gives a refreshing insight into the ethos of those earlier times, when the mainstream media was more focused on delighting the audience, rather than trying to make some political statement.

Her character is Tina, a girl who goes looking for her brother, whose been kidnapped by drug dealers. She's not the shoot-em-up type, of course, but she is the most dangerous girl you'll ever meet, because she can karate chop you death like that.

What sets these guys apart from other instrumental bands (especially on this release) , is their talent for melody and songwriting. The songs never sound like the band is just meandering or (worse) 'jamming'.

It was built because the railway had come to Alford, and went out of use because the railway came to Sutton. It served a number of villages in between, but not enough traffic let to its early demise. The author, on holiday in Sutton between the Wars noticed that the signal box at Sutton carried the name \`Tramway Crossing', and on enquiring as to why, discovered the former existence of the tramway, which had crossed the main-line, on the level, at that point. The booklet is illustrated with photographs and some line drawings, along with a map of the route.This is an enlarged and revised second edition of this booklet, originally published in 1947 by the Oakwood Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if you hate live music!!!","review":"I wish I had been warned that tracks 8,9 and 10 were recorded live in concert.

The arrangements are fantastic, I can't say enough good things about them--especially for the \\"Strike Up the Band\\" portion, and the group has a really fat, brassy sound highly becomming to any big band. The music is on the commercial side, so don't expect long jazz solos, and the performances of each tune are on the short side of things--3 min. or less usually. This is about the English equivalent to the state-side Les Brown band, also back in the mid 1950's (however, the arrangements for the first portion of this CD are more interesting and less predictable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a shame therese isn't as popular as she deserves","review":"This is really a superb piece, she really sings like an angel and the music is so relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looked for one for years","review":"As a Viet Nam veteran, I have always loved this workhorse of a helicopter. I looked for years for a model of it in 1/72 scale to go along with some other models I had previously collected. I had looked in several stores but never thought of checking with Amazon until recently. I am not familiar with the exact machine gun mounting on this model, but otherwise it is exactly what I have wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived damaged","review":"I'm not sure if I should blame Samsonite or the shipper, but the case arrived in bad condition. The handle had a series of scrapes on one side that cut through the leather. The top was also not aligned properly with the bottom. This meant that when you closed the case, you had to slightly pull the top to one side in order to correctly line up the latches. I returned this product and purchased a different case. I was very disappointed as Samsonite usually has great cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away - Owned for less then a year","review":"I bought one Feb 2011 and have to send it in for warranty service less then a year later. To be fair, the unit looks great when you first get it. Once I started to use it the problems came up.1) From day one the unit opened on any combination code. It just opens easier on the code you set. Why have a combination. I should have sent it back for this reason alone when I first got it but I already disposed of my old one and decided to live with the lax security.2) The leather around the handle has completely worn away.3) As of the writing of this review, one of the latches snapped in half.I'll be sure to update this review after I experience the warranty procedure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this briefcase mainly due to the Samsonite brand name expecting the quality that this brand stood for in the past. Unfortunately, I was very unimpressed with this briefcase. It has no metal piano-type hinge to hold the top and bottom portions together, having just a leather flap which was totally insufficient. Some of the interior covering also came completely off of the wood structure. My previous briefcase lasted over 15 years and this one did not last 15 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic western","review":"If you're expecting this is be a slam-bang, shoot-em-up like the new version, you will be disappointed. Sure, there is some gun play in the opening sequence and at the end, but this western concentrates on character studies (Van Heflin & Glenn Ford primarily) as well as humannature. The plot shares similarities with \\"High Noon\\" and \\"Last Train fromGun Hill.\\" Yep, pardner, it's worth a look. The desert scenery is great...even in B/W...and the acting is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"3:10 to Yuma","review":"Another excellent Columbia western with a stellar cast. Only flaw is the character portrayed by Felicia Farr which is unnecessary to the plot. Exquisite black and white camera work and almost noir direction by Delmar Daves. Glenn Ford and Van Heflin are perfect casting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Classic Western of the 1950s!","review":"Glenn Ford is excellent in his portrayal of Ben Wade, leader of a western outfit who is being forced out of a small town for robbery & murder. Superb acting by Ford who is excellent as the bad guy with integrity. Great cast also makes this film one of the best westerns of all time. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seduction 101 courtesy of Glenn Ford","review":"Well, this is how you handle women guys. (spoiler alert) First he has Felicia Farr drooling all over herself, and then while in handcuffs takes a run at Van Heflins wife. That is machismo at its best. Oh yeah, the rest of story. Well, Ford is quite simply the most charming, ruthless, manipulative, and mercurial bad guy in the history of the Western. Required viewing for Psych majors and fledgling seduction artists.The DVD transfer is excellent in widescreen and the sound is terrific...if you fast forward past one of Hollywood's worst theme songs \\"...I hear a ruma, when you take the 3:10 to Yuma, you can see the ghosts of outlaws riding by, way up high, in the skyyyyyyyyyy...\\" Have a pie, in your eye! Jeez, pretty funny though. Great movie, I don't want to talk about the ending...I mean I really don't want to talk about it. Didn't they have a jail in that town? Otis Campbell must have already checked in or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"3:10 to Hombre","review":"The film \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" is not considered to be one of the \\"great\\" westerns because its ending is wrong. Van Heflin's character must die, like the Paul Newman character in Elmore Leonard's other western film, \\"Hombre\\". Otherwise it is neat seeing Glenn Ford play against his screen good guy persona. Another reasonably good western is \\"Jubal\\" with Ford and Borgnine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people think this one is better???","review":"After seeing the recent remake first, I find the original is a pale version of what the concept could have been, as realized in the more current version. Here,we get the usual maudlin '50s Hollywood treatment, where good triumphs over bad amid syrupy strings and men of indeterminate age who kind of all look the same: clean-shaven wearing the costume department version of \\"Western\\" wear. This looks like a TV Western to me. Useful, if only for comparsion purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not very realistic","review":"Again, I am forced to serve as the lone reviewer who believes this film to be over-rated. I am definitely a Glenn Ford fan, but the idea that Ford simply waits for the train to come and take him away, while he and Van Heflin sidle down the street definitely didn't move me. I'm sorry but the rest of the film didn't ring true either. Richard Jaeckel gets killed in a weird, unrealistic way, and Henry Jones gets lynched somehow. The scenes with Heflin's wife are stagey and uncomfortably hard to believe.I would rate both Jubal and Cowboy much higher, more realistic, especially Cowboy. Check out Cowboy first and then Jubal. Either of these are better than 3:10. Sorry, Delmer Daves/Glenn Ford fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not watch this movie","review":"This movie I had to return cus I didn't know that dvd's came in \\"REGION\\" form.

The psychological build-up is gradual, with smaller peaks along the way (the man hanging by the stairs is a particularly memorable one) until the viewer is as tense as the characters.

Salman Khan does his normal standout performance. I am touched by the symbolism shown in many Hindi movies of duality. You will see many touching scenes that are laterrepeated by the opposite party, and to great effect.

A generic guitar stands shouldn't be expensive and this one is priced correctly.The strap tie at the neck is easy to place and remove but I would not trust it on stage, it's just not snug enough to secure a guitar if the stand or guitar is knocked.The base holder or fork is a little weird and takes some getting used to. It angles up toward the tips, which slides the guitar body back into the stand and that's good for balance. It works ok, I'll probably bend the tip ends straight up to make sure the guitar body doesn't slide outwards since I'm using mostly electrics.Overall I'll be using this stand at the home studio and have several others when I need to be more comfortable about leaving a guitar out for a prolonged period of time. This one is nice and will be used between recording and producing."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand with Velveteen Padding and Security Strap","review":"Cheap($)and great for getting your guitars off the floor and from leaning against stuff such as walls, guitar cabinets, amps ect.... I use them in my music room where there away from kids and safe from people traffic. Wouldn't recommend using them for instruments such as a heavy bass or back break'n Les Paul, a busy room, dark or open place, and especially on a stage or crowded area. There are a little unstable due to the fact that they are very light in weight, but for the price and for as many as I bought they were just what I needed.

(I've taken pictures, but there is no way to attach them here.) Unfortunately I threw the box away, as I couldn't imagine any way something as simple as this wouldn't work. That's my fault.

When the guitar wasn't on it, it was fine. But once I added the guitar, it wouldn't stay standing up. It would either lean back or to the left or right. I would not recommend buying this item.

To add to your woes, the loosely help bottom cradle is too short to accomodate most acoustic guitar and the guitars weight ends up being applied to the rubber band near the neck of the guitar. This was designed by the worst kind of swine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for bagpipes too!","review":"I'll dare to give it a five. Performs as advertised, inexpensive, and doesn't smell bad! Got one for my *deployed* guitar and one for my bagpipes. Now both are \\"upright and outta sight.\\" Much better than laying my pipes down on the table in my room, plus they're ready for rapid response (because one just never knows when the next bagpiping emergency will arise). Granted, I've only had 'em for a coupla weeks, but they won't get moved much (God willin' and the Taliban don't rise). If they fall apart, I'll be sure to let you know. I don't expect that to happen though, they seem to be pretty well put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustment screw is the wrong size","review":"The screw that is used to adjust the part of the stand that supports the neck of the guitar is the wrong size.

I am very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Got this for my Taylor 914ce Grand Auditorium. Noticed it is very misaligned and wobbly upon assembly. No way will I prop my Taylor up on it, but will chance my Yamaha APX500 on it, as long as it's suported by a wall.

I have a solid body electric that came falling to the floor after 2 months of use because the metal on the bottom cradle buckled and snapped. The metal at the joint looks to be of horrible quality. Will never buy one of these again.Conversely, I have another that has been holding an acoustic for a much longer time, and have had no issues whatsoever. Cheap construction doesn't matter as much when the guitar only weighs a few pounds.If you're in the market for a stand specifically to hold something like a Les Paul or other solid body electric with heavier woods, look elsewhere.

Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money.

I watched this appalling film, hoping to see some John Carpenter magic & all I got was formula, predictable trash. Too many people liked \\"Escape from New York\\" in my view. All the actors are in it because it's J.C. directing, but everyone is miscast & trying to make something out of a bad script. I'm sorry ,but I just can't believe \\"Ice Cube\\" is Mars' most notorious criminal no matter how tough he trys to look. Kurt Russell as Snake Pliskin is more believeable.On a positive note, the audio commentary with John & Natasha is hilarious & beats the movie hands down for entertainment value.

I'll admit my main reasons for seeing this were Jason Statham, Pam Grier, and Joanna Cassidy whom I like very much. Yes, it was typical sci-fi horror fare. The zombie aliens reminded me of living dead vampires, and were things I'd seen before. Many times. But it was still fun to watch. Until the ending which was just plain stupid. *Spoiler* Why did Ice Cube's character live? Just so he could say a final cheesy line? Is there going to be a sequel? Oh dear. With my favorite 3 people dead, I can guarantee I won't go see the next one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of resources","review":"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Complete formula based flop. I am a fan of Carpenter's work but Vampires indicated a new, campier direction for him, and this film takes this probelmatic formula to it's painful extreme. Don't waste your time or money. Where are the likes of In the Mouth of Madness and The Thing? I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing But Not Unwatchable","review":"This movie has everything going for it. It has a likable cast that's headed by the super hot Natasha Henstridge (of Species fame) and Ice Cube. It has great special effects. Above all of that, it's a John Carpenter flick, which usually means it's going to be something memorable. This is why I was extremely surprised at how disappointing it turned out to be. It's not a horrible movie but it wasn't as good as it should've been.I guess that this could be attributed to the fact that it was missing that something special. It didn't have that zesty aura that great movies of this genre generated. It was blah at best. If you like science fiction, you might like this movie but it probably won't drive you wild or anything.

Who keeps funding these shoddy attempts? Kinda makes me want to give this movie making biz a try. Anyone can make a better movie than this. The villian in this movie is never fleshed out, all he does is look at the camera and scream out... bad. There is no context for why they feel so theatened nor is there anyway to believe this race existed at all, they are just too hostile to ever exist. The (heros) main characters aren't any better. There is a point in the movie where they actually get away from the threat of an onslaught of demonic ghosts and there are about 6 heros left to hundreds of ghost beings. So, do they proceed and then come back with reenforcements? No. They comeback with the same paultry few that got whipped to begin with. Ridiculous.

Don't fool yourselves into thinking that anything Carpenter-esque is in this film. Did he really direct this? Were all the actors in this movie that hard-up for cash? I love THE THING, I even enjoyed VAMPIRES, which was an average film at best. This film is so bad, it's not even cult-bad. It's not even the type of bad where you'll watch it every time it's on TBS like 70's Burt Reynold films. Ed Wood couldn't make a film worse than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would someone please get John Carpenter a BRAIN???","review":"This is probably the dumbest, most idiotic attempt at a Sci-fi movie in the last 10 years. To start, the script is stupid: every major decision that could cause the characters trouble is usually made as a device to keep the plot (as little as there is!!!) going. How little?

But it has been a long time since we had a half decent film out of him...I had read the reviews but I liked the idea of a Mars take on Assault on Precinct 13 so I was happy to give this a chance.Somewhere in this is a good idea and a good movie but in the delivery it fails and there really is very little on the positive side.

One might add \\"Ghosts of Mars\\" to this group, but it's simply uninteresting. This is a movie that did not have to be made. The plot lacks internal logic and the only interesting characters, Ice Cube's posse, have precious little time onscreen. Carpenter, like Walter Hill, has lost touch with what makes a film worth viewing and target a demographic of 14-year-olds with low expectations (I watched this with my 15-year-old who was similarly stunned by the unwatchability of this train wreck -- and he'll sit through anything)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Change Channels","review":"Slow paced zombie slasher flic set on Mars with an atmosphere with much less tension, fear, and action than you'd get watching Sound of Music.

The True HD works well for the shooting and music-heavy scenes.This one is littered with bad special effects and poor fight sequences (they look like the are are dancing in some parts, and just don't have enough force, to make them realistic). The music supports the chaos that occurs throughout the movie, well, and is about the only saving grace for me.

It features great direction, almost 3 dimensional characters, an orignal futuristic plot, and great music. In sum, it's pure Carpenter.Good DVD extras.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"More ho-hum Carpenter.","review":"I've been a fan of JC's work for a long time. But he's gotten into a rut for a long time now, churning out forgettable movies that offer nothing but recycled plots. Generally his movies are worth a rental and a watch, and Ghosts of Mars follows this new tradition.John hasn't done anything truly creepy since Prince of Darkness. At least he's gotten off his soapbox and knocked-off the politically motivated \\"They Live\\". But I guess I'll continue to watch his efforts even if he's apparently never going to do anything to equal \\"Dark Star\\" or \\"The Thing\\".Rent it, watch it, take it back and forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpenter returns to his hard action roots.","review":"Unfairly dismissed by both critics and fans at the time of its release, John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars is the cult director at his most b-movie retro. What Ghosts does it take the narrative of Assault on Precinct 13 (cops and criminals in an isolated police station find themselves teaming up to fight a hostile army) and sprinkles it with elements from Prince of Darkness and Escape from New York. The results might fall short of Carpenter at his best, but there is no denying the movie has enough energy (in the good, old fashioned rough and tumble sense - no wire-fu or bullet time digital hijinks found here, thank goodness) and humor to hold a forgiving fans interest. The only major flaw is a ludicrous about face attack at the 1:17 mark, other than that it delivers a fun little b-movie thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better than expected","review":"Despite a terrible collection of reviews this is a damn entertaining film and well worth watching. A good \\"people under siege\\" film with lots of action and a tongue in cheek style it's great fun. VERY unfairly dismissed it's one of Carpenter's better films and deserves a fresh look. Better than Escape From LA this DVD is a good presentation with a great commentary track and some informative behind the scenes features. Don't listen to the critics, it's a very entertaining movie with comic book characters that are never dull. I think Carpenter was spot on with this film and a lot of people missed the point. It's not meant to be serious, it's a fun-fair ride and works well when viewed on that level. Give it a go. Worth buying for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghosts or Garbage?","review":"If you have missed all of John Carpenter's sci-fi horror films so far, here is your opportunity to miss another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"I rented this movie thinking \\"It can't be all that bad, Ebert & Roeper gave it two thumbs up.\\" I will never make that mistake again. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen - the kind of movie I would expect an adolescent boy to write, even worse than Starship Troopers (although if you liked that, you'd probably love this one). The dialog stunk, the acting was horrible, there wasn't one redeeming quality. It will definitely gain a spot on my all-time worst movie list."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is B movie material.","review":"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is horrible; Natasha Henstridge is monotonous and her face doesn't change at all while she acts, and none of the other characters are convincing at all. The movie is very annoying with the countless flashbacks. The set looks fake. The plot is confusing and scattered. I guess I'd say get it if you are a hardcore John Carpenter fan; I'm not, and if the rest of his movies are anything like this, I never will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"It's hard to believe watching this movie that this is the man who brought us The Thing and The Fog. What we have here is a weakly scripted movie that seems to offer no moral, no characters you can care about and no plot to intrigue you. Indeed the one element of mystery (why has everyone gone nuts?) is offhandedly revealed without ever tantalising the audience.Our 'heroes' are all one-dimensional creations that you hope will fall victim to the savages, so much so that you no longer care that you know from the start who will survive you just wish they would get on with it. Mercifully it is at least short.I'd love to have something positive to say about this film but I was sorely disappointed. It would seem Mr Carpenter's best work is behind him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpenter needs to retire...","review":"There is a big difference between a true horror film that knows restraint (i.e. The Shining) and a horror film with nothing more than Marilyn Manson groupie look-a-likes parading around an artificial set of Mars with facial piercings and killer hub-caps.John Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars decided to choose the latter and ultimately fails to generate any scares while taking itself way too seriously to even generate campy entertainment value.It could have been a very cool movie had the budget been raised from the expendature of a Wendy's Kids Meal, because there are a few cool gore and decapitation scenes, not to mention a near ingenious concept (Angry spirits of long-dead martians possess nearby humans etc.) and a killer soundtrack by Anthrax and Buckethead, but those alone can't improve the quality of Carpenter's latest fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable...Weird...Just Plain DUMB","review":"I saw this movie over at a friend's house and I thought I was actually going to like it. I like John Carpenter, I think he's a genius when it comes to horror movies, but this one was a doozy!! Ghosts of Mars is weird and very very predictable. You pretty much know exactly how it's going to end as soon as the movie begins. It was not scary at all, it was just plain boring. I was just praying for it to be over! Natasha Hendrige needs to stay away from Sci-Fi, she was only good in Species. Ice Cube got on my nerves! Pam Grier wasn't even needed, I have no clue why she decided to be in this movie. Don't waste your time with this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a ride!","review":"I saw this in theaters 3 times and now I own the dvd. Its one of coolest movies I have seen in a long time.The dvd is only missing one thing(theatrical trailers),and I hate to say it,but the film seems alot like \\"assault/13\\".Other than that its the best money Ive ever spent on a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-movie fun","review":"It's John Carpenter, so what does everyone expect? I know what I expected, and \\"Ghosts of Mars\\" pretty much delivered. Thudding sound track, B-movie dialogue, heads on stakes, \\"Road Warrior\\" like zanies with metal sticking out of their faces stalking the \\"good\\" guys. Bring on the popcorn. Then there's a humorous twist. The \\"guys\\" in this future world live in a Matriarchy. Guys make the coffee, defer to the women, but also are told to deal with mechanical problems when they arise. (Well, at least the \\"breeder\\" - Jason Statham as Jericho - does.) Carpenter works all kinds of little jokes into the script on this wrinkle alone. Natasha Henstridge as the tough cop hero, and Ice Cube, as the con hero, are serviceable - and they know when to shoot, kick, and punch. And that's all that's needed here. I don't know who the main Martian is (he looks like Marilyn Manson in Kabuki), but he's perfect! Four stars for operating well within genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun B Sci-fi Movie","review":"There is a reason Ghost of Mars keeps popping up on TV, in video, in DVD, now in Blu-Ray ... it is just plain fun. Not to mention that Natasha Henstridge it is ALWAYS enjoyable to look at. Sadly, she isn't even mentioned in the Amazon display of this DVD as the star of the film. As with all Carpenter films, Escape from New York, Escape From LA and so forth, you are expected to suspend all \\"reason\\". It is about entertainment. Frankly, I found the special effects very good and FAR superior to the last 50 Sci-fi channel movies that appeared in DVD. If you like Zombies, sci-fi, grade-A actors and actresses, semi-reasonalble plots and have a sense of humor, you'll enjoy Ghost of Mars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh come on this movie rocks","review":"This movie is great, loaded with alot of sci-fi action and great thrills. Ice Cube even does a damn good job as well as Nastasha Henstridge. John Carpenter may be an old man but he still knows how to direct and in my opinion this is his best film since the thing. It has splendid acting and excellent special effects. Also I think it has an excellent story, and Jason Stratham was in it, who is an awesome actor except I think he should've been involved in the movie more then he was. And what is the deal the music was outstanding and it fit the film perfectly,I mean im not a huge fan of Anthrax but they are an ok metal band. The movie has loads of great action, science fiction and even humor. Its just a great ol entertaining joyride and is the best sci-fi action flick of 2001 and one of the best ever, a true fun classic enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply evidence that Ebert no longer watches the movies he reviews.","review":"That Ebert gave this horrible movie a thumbs-up is court-presentable evidence that he didn't even watch it. This is a horrible movie. Cheap sets, poor lighting, unrealistic costumes, and I just named its \\"good\\" points. The acting in this movie was as bad as the dialogue. None of these actors or actresses really should work again ... or at least until they've gone through acting school again. As for the plot, it isn't even laughable. It is just a groan fest. This is Carpenter's first movie after ten years and it just proves that making a good movie isn't like riding a bicycle. You do forget how to do it. John Carpenter definitely did. Do not buy this DVD. Do not rent it. Do not even borrow it from your public library for free. If the rating system could allow negative numbers, I'd give this movie -5. It isn't as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it isn't that far behind either."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars because it made me laugh","review":"The absurdity of this movie made me laugh quite a bit. The sets were cheap, the plot (if you can call it that) was clunky, and the direction stank. A lot of people who have reviewed this already are railing on the actors, and the only reason I don't is because I have seen most of the main cast (the ones on the front cover) do very well in other roles. It is evident that they really weren't given much to work with.If you're looking for a horror flick to laugh at and make fun of in Mystery Science Theater 3000 fashion, this would be a good one to pick up. If you're looking for good sci-fi/horror, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghosts of Mars","review":"This movie is stupid.The plot could work and the actors might work.

I understand the issues with the needing of the tool, and the design of the clamp is pretty foreign to me, but it is something I've gotten used to. Also, the pad is wider than the 1/4 sheets, so there is a minimal hangover, but no biggie. I was kinda worried about purchasing this, but now I'm glad I did.

I'm sure Hillary is just as interesting a subject as McGovern but Harpaz is not as interesting a person as Crouse. Crouse was tough, and the other reporters tougher, a strange group of misanthropic (...). Harpaz and her compatriots sing songs and whittle away the days complaining about their inability to get access to their candidate.

Somebody bought this item, demolished it, and sent it back in for a refund. Obviously nobody checked it when it came back in...2 seconds would have told them it was probably broken. And it was. I was using it for anodising, and it totally ruined the parts I was working on because it only put out 10 amps instead of 30 (on both settings), and stopped working completely after 40 minutes.One thing I will say about Amazon is that they did give me a full refund, which I appreciated...but there should have been someone checking the returns!

This item is shown to wrap over the top of the rear bed rail, but the actual product only covers the front and top (an \\"L\\" shape instead of a \\"U\\" shape). Look at installation instructions provided with the item description. It is to be held in place by double-stick tape that is provided. WARNING, the edges were extremely sharp! Bottom line, this is for looks only and serves no real purpose other than to add a little bling to your truck.

There are numerous sequences with the capering, grimacing, grinning, over-the-top villain Quilp or with the rather intense narrative of the flight of Little Nell that have much imaginative power, but some of the passages about Kit or Dick are a bit tedious. For me the book was certainly worth one complete reading at least.Postscript: I read this novel again -- and have changed my rating from three to four stars. Seems I liked it even more the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This was one of the good books I read in a long time.

Dickens can be so good. I think this was a series written early in his career. It is trite, boring, rambling and the story goes nowhere. The characters will annoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Nell a big pain in the neck","review":"This is, apparently, one of Dickens' most loved books. For the life of me, I can't see why. It takes saccharin sentimentality and total irrationality to bizarre new levels. Little Nell is supposed to be a brave heroine. She is a mindless twit. Her grandfather is a despicable, self-centred old fool, yet she still submits to his every lunacy as her 'duty'. A bit of tough love wouldn't have gone astray. Quilp seems to exist purely to create hurdles for Nell and the old man. What was he supposed to gain from it all? He had already taken their every possession - where was the sense in going on and on? The other characters only seem to exist to fill up space. A very disappointing book. If you want to see why Dickens' is such an acclaimed author, read David Copperfield or Great Expectations or The Tale of Two Cities and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stumbled to get through any of it","review":"Yes, I stumbled to get through any of it. To be honest, I didn't even finish the book. I loved A Tale of Two Cities, but this one put me to sleep. Yes, the characters were intriguing, but that was it. I saw hardly any plot. I had to plow through meaningless little scenes till I got to about 100 or so and the plow blade got stuck in a drift of snow. The language was nice, but the plot was not. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he wrote so many other good novels. Every author is bound to have a flop, and to me, this one flopped, big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED this story","review":"This is the first Dickens' story I've read. If the other reviewer says he liked this one LESS than Dickens' other works, then I guess I am in for a treat in reading more of Dickens. I absolutely LOVED The Old Curiosity Shop.

Overall, it was such a fantastic book that - for someone who doesn't read books twice - I will certainly read this book again someday (after I read some other Dickens' books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book (of course, its Dickens!)","review":"This is such a good book, I don't know where to begin. I know a lot of people put it down for sentimentalizing Nells death, but you know, I almost cried during it! The victorians just weren't as cynical as we are. Now a book has to show the horror of the human spirit to be considered a good book but that does get kind of oh, same same after a while. This was the first Dickens book I read, I remember reading it in high school and thinking \\"damn, this is good\\" I was expecting something dry and humorless and was pleasantly surprised by Dickens wit and humor and great story telling ability.

Then the same with the cape. By the end of the evening, the costume was ragged, and unusable. The blue and red sheen on the skirt and cape had worn off in big patches.I emailed the company at their website [...] not once but 3 times now. No response.

The primary installation location as specified in the instructions ends up being over top of the plastic conduit at the top of the inside of the tailgate - of course that doesn't work. The alternate location is over the vents at the bottom of the inside of the tailgate - also wouldn't work. Vertically adjusting the installation location to compensate still produces a less-than-ideal installation, as the JK's tailgate placement relative to the body is different than earlier body types. When extended, the stopper does not contact the body an inch or so to the right of the edge of the body, as shown in the photos. Instead, on a JK, it contacts the body at the very edge, where the rubber gasket is. I would expect this problem to present itself on other model year JKs as well. Before you buy this, go look at your tailgate - if it doesn't look like the one in the photos, the stopper won't install well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dremel?","review":"I got this tool from my dad, who never used it, and while I don't ever need to cut drywall, I did find a great use for it as a dremel.

A few of these selections just blew my mind away. In general, the music if higher and more delicate-sounding than Chinese, with more extensive use of light percussion, bells, and (my personal favorite traditional Vietnamese instrument) the \\"dan bau\\". Some selections are mournful and lamenting, bringing to mind the countless wars wages in Vietnam over the last 1500 years. Others, like \\"Bird Bringing Good News\\", simply are bursting with joy - in fact, the instrument used in this piece sounded so much like a real bird that I thought they had actually recorded bird calls and layered it over a traditional orchestra!

So the gloves got wet too. The plastic sleeve they were in was open on one end so it was no protection. The gloves must have been wet for days because they had a strong mildew smell when they arrived. I emailed the seller; asking how they recommend to get the smell out and THEY NEVER RESPONDED. The gloves still smell of mildew too. I guess that will never come out. So much for spending $90. I would never buy from this seller again.Had they not been wet and smelly, they'd only be marginally better.

David Arnold can pull it off because he combines traditional orchestration with subtle electronic enhancements to create a contemporary sound for his scores. On the other hand, Moby's take on the 'James Bond Theme' from 1997 was lame and uninspired. I didn't even need to buy this album to determine how bad it is (the five 30 second audio samples are plenty to judge by). I only posted a one star rating because zero wasn't an option.

I still listen to this record regularly and enjoy it as much as I did when it was spinning at 33 1/3. The tunes are infectious, the production is punchy (but not overproduced, like many 80s dated-sounding record productions), and the quirky and sometimes-frenetic rythms make ya wanna move! The song \\"Good Thing\\" has to be one of my favorite feel-good ballads from that era, or any other era for that matter. 'Giant' is just a great pop album that still holds up today. It's ashame that none of the Woodentops' subsequent releases would resonate like the brilliance found on 'Giant'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thing","review":"Another great find by the boys at Rough Trade, the Woodentops were a band that projected uniqueness while epitomizing the sound of acoustic pop England so effortlessly churned out in the mid-eighties.

Well I know why. This replacement pad (made by Porter Cable) has a thinner backing plate. The screws therefore are too long to properly secure the pad to the sander. Although the user may not realize it, the pad then shifts around the screws as it is being used. That constant shifting slowly erodes the backing plate at the screw holes - Eventually the pad just falls off.So to make this pad last as long as the original pad, you need to either cut the screws down in length, purchase shorter screws, or find a washer that will fit.

After no more than 30 minutes worth of use the new pad fell off the sander. Sure enough, like some reviewers have posted, the 3 screws that are used to mount the pad to the sander rounded out their mounting holes and the pad simply fell off the sander. I'm not sure why they don't use the same original material to mount the pad, like I said it looks like Bakelite but I don't think that stuff is legal/available anymore, but that plastic mounting pad is in perfect shape, it just doesn't have the foam pad on it anymore.

It appears that the phenolic material that the 3 screws pass through to attach to the sander is thinner than that of the original pad. The screws were tight (even after the pad went flying off the sander) but there must have been some play that allowed the screw threads to eat away at the phenolic plate until the holes became large enough to slip over the screw heads. Rather than order another pad, I guess I'll just get another brand of sander.

Judy Hand is wonderful in all the selections but particularly so in the Sonatina Gates composed for her. What inspriation of interpertation and beauty of sound.

Where some performances give the impression of tinkling music boxes or technical expertise that is somehow boring, this one is riveting and evocative. Some purists may find it insufficiently traditional, but I found it beautifully imaginative. Unlike reviewers who preferred this musician's earlier albums, to me this is the most interesting and moving of them all. \\"Fiona\\" came out in 1993; I am hoping that Mr. Ball is near to producing another album.

Peter Boyle's performance (especially in comparison to Bencio DelToro's) as HST's Samoian attorney, Oscar DeAcosta, is awful!! Overall, the movie is worth at least one viewing, for Murray's A-calibre performance, but other than that the flick is an unfortunate celluloid waste.

If nothing else this will prove that mid-20th century classical is not all Schoenberg and Babbit (and show that Cage actually wrote some music before becoming a conceptual artist)The marketing is a little weird - it's a New Age label and the title, notes and ad copy all stress romanticism (which in the context of classical music really means something fairly specific that does not, I believe, apply here). It's not your typical New Age fare (though it could conceivably work in that context) nor even your typical \\"easy classics\\" compilation.A personal favorite is the movement from a chamber piece by Peter Schickele (who is also known by a another name).

This album tried to go heavier and darker, and frankly is a mess, really killing any new momentum Strange Highways may have created for Dio Few memorable riffs, few memorable memories, simply dark, muffled, ploddy, and confused. Vinny's drums are more complex, but really struggle to fit Tracy G's guitar lines, leaving an off-tempo feel on a lot of songs. In addition, the production does the songs no favors either.

The lyrical arrangements completely lack any imagination whatsoever, and Ronnie sounds as if he just recovered from a bout with mumps. The thumping bass is very odd-sounding, belonging more on a tribute album to Studio 54 than a Dio album. The only aspect that allows this album to earn even one star is Vinnie's drums; he doesn't fool around with rhythm all that often (of course, neither did Bill Ward), but he knows exactly what the songs need.

No, not really Pantera, but definitely something. Angry Machines ultimately succeeds at sending mixed and confusing signals. Gone are the band's trademark choruses and catchy melodies. They are replaced by clunky song structures, sometimes interwoven with industrual (via-Nine Inch Nails) interludes such as on \\"Stay Out of My Mind.\\" Hey, I'm all for change, and understand it's foolish for a band to stay with the same sound forever, but really, Dio are out of their element trying for material such as this.

The actors, who sync the lyrics, make it all interesting and watchable. The journey takes on a surreal quality in fairly short time. Statements about corruption in the White House, corporate greed and our responsibility to the environment are even stronger in the film than they are on the cd.

I appreciate him (a) calling me a liar and (b) destroying my daughter's belief in something so innocent as the Tooth Fairy.I hope that Timothy has kids and someone takes something away from them just like he took the Tooth Fairy away from my daughter!PS - I'd give this zero stars if Amazon would let me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My granddaughter was really happy for the engravings and the older story versions.","review":"Our granddaughter specifically requested the original versions of Grimm's stories because they would tell the frightening parts.

This is actually a CD by a punk band called \\"The Fight\\". The names are too close to one another, yet the styles of music are completely different. This group should not come up on searches of \\"Fight\\", only \\"The Fight\\". If you look at how it's listed on Amazon.com, the band's name appears only as \\"Fight\\". If I didn't believe that this was just a stupid oversight, I'd think it was a pretty dirty trick for someone expecting a metal album, to get punk instead. Other reviewers who are punk fans highly praise this work. The folks doing cataloguing at Amazon need to play closer attention to detail on things like this in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this ep is terrible and weak, the lyrics are amoung some of the worst i have heard and they are just too late with this punk thing, its been done now over n over again. i am a big punk fan rancid, new found glory, green day, pistols, but not this please not the fight, they are just acting like there idols.,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Album","review":"Now I keep hearing how people dont want to hear a live album and how its just a waste to go out a buy a live album and true, Its better to go actually see the band live then to hear them from cd, but still, what true rock fan DOESNT want to hear a solid live album? The only dissapointment on this album was the lack of vocals on \\"Nothing Better to Do\\" which is one of my favorite songs, and of course, the sound production wasnt all that great but then again no live album has great sound production, other then that this was A great live album, and Phil is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco Nasty","review":"Reminding me a bit of Metro Area's awesome eponymous album, Luke Vibert comes correct with this sick ep of disco-electro-house.

These have no sugar or aspartame and have 0-5 calories each, their flavors are quite scrumptious, they aren't too bubbly, and the colors in a glass are truly gorgeous. I'm always dieting and love to pour them into a Riedel wine glass, and more than console myself that I'm not having wine with everyone else. They also mix well with hard liquor if you're into that--the nutrisoda website has a whole spiel on mixology that's quite amusing. Try the variety pack if you're curious about them all.

This CD contains much in the way of regional pieces steeped in spirituality and folklore from the composers native Turkey, as well as influences from the surrounding region. There are songs that are meditative, as well as those that make you want to dance around a fire in the desert, 'Shashkin\\" being the best of these. The compser's been around for quite a while. the other instrument players are highly regarded, and all can open doors for you into the staggeringly diverse world of music from the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely, danceable, and kind of New Age?","review":"I really enjoy Omar Tekbilek's various musical endeavors, and this one is no exception. For dancing, it's set up a little differently, as in mostly very slow, dreamlike pieces which would be good for slow floor work. The three faster pieces seem sort of out of place on this particular album, but can be used for dance, although the 'Laz' (a 7/8 rhythm) is very tricky to dance to, the other two being easier; a malfuf and a saiidi rhythm. Very usable, but for two very different moods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Devotional, Divine!","review":"Omar Faruk is brimming with talent in composing unusually pleasing traditional Arabic recitations intertwined in modern vibrations.This record is one of his masterpieces with the Kalema as its best part--though rather short.

This album rocks!","review":"Dimitri's album is full of jazzy, eclectic and interesting sounds that please even the most pop-hungry boy-band lovers. It's great to throw on at parties or to melt on the couch with after work. One thing, they changed the voices on Une Very Stylish Fille from Audrey, George and Patricia to some others that sound very, very similar. But other than that, I can deal. Great album, go get it, you'll be instantly cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy song ...classy car... The Volvo S-80 commercial is HOT!","review":"I thought to myself, \\"Volvo will think I'm crazy if I ask who this song is by.\\" After reading the reviews I see I was not alone in my quest for this CD. Actually I didn't have to contact them; this song was used at a meeting I went to shortly after I first saw the commercial. From there I got the title and I've been listening to it non-stop. It's a hot CD. I don't care who's around when this CD is playing, they always want to know who it is. If you love music, if you like to dance, this should be in your library. If I didn't already own a Volvo I believe this song would have sold me. Excellent choice!!If you're having a party you must invite Dimitri.

It covers a lot of medical issues, both urgent and not-so-urgent. It helps you calm down in a crisis and it is not so overly wordy that you have to keep scanning to find what you're specifically looking for for advice. Not everything can be taken care of at home and they do not hesitate to tell you to seek emergency action. There's humor (ie. Colds, the Flu and the Great American Runny Nose - Your Basic Everyday Head Bonk), a suggested list of items for your medicine cabinet. There is a large range of ages involved, but most advice can be used by adults, too.This is a GREAT baby shower or newborn gift. I've given several.P. S.

It was one of her all time favorites. As I often watch her shows with her I have to give it 3 stars due to the poor quality of the scan. I'm thinking it was done years ago for VHS release. They just grabbed these scans and ran them through software for DVD and shoved them out the door. If you pause the show you can see signs of compression. If you're watching on a 19\\" tube, probably not a problem, on a 37\\" LCD it appears like its out of focus. For a new release this is unacceptable. I/m going to pretend to watch and read my paper.UPDATED 4/12/11 I have noticed other older shows that were \\"taped in front of a live audience\\" having the same problem in sharpness. The tapes were most likely recorded analog at a resolution that is in conflict with a DVD's resolution.

I liked them so much I got them for my friend. I watched this series when it was on originally and have totally enjoyed these DVDs. The characters are wonderfully done and the cast members were each perfect in their own way. I liked being able to see the development of each character while watching episodes back-to-back. The humor is definitely southern in the best sense of the word. Their co-stars, Meshach Taylor, Alice Ghostly, Richard Gilliland, and Hal Holbrook give added depth and humor.

After 2 weeks of e-mail and phone interaction, they had not sent us the items we needed, nor had they told us when they would. We have since then boxed up the bed and returned it.

In fact, I'm still not sure who all killed whom. The character's better-than-thou attitudes was a bit much. The one answered her phone everytime \\"Talk!\\".

Perfect for people who don't think clearly and can't get out of their own way, or that person in your life you want to freak out entirely. They will really think you need to beam back to the Mothership if you fall for this tripe.

He died in his early forties, and left this book largely unfinished. His widow winnowed down the material and created this novel. Here we follow Meir through Tel Aviv and Amsterdam, and are privy to all his desires, and his largely repressed and unhappy life. The subject matter and Shabtai's tone and technique make this novel difficult reading, probably only suited to a fan of his work (I am one).But if you can get past the boredom of reliving someone's daily frustrations, there is so much to Past Perfect that speaks very deeply to what it means to be human. We all walk around with a satchel full of disappointments, but hide them from ourselves and others. Shabtai puts them all on display.

But Fink is capable enough to deliver soul with nothing more than a few strums and his voice. \\"Pills in My Pockets\\" takes on reliably modern Glastonbury Festival with a strangely folksy tune. When Tina Grace takes the vocals for \\"Hush Now,\\" it goes straight into Delta blues.

This music is an alternative to Wagner Tristan story. Here all is soft and more human, the different characters are very close to us.

I'm verry happy to find again this emotion in the present recording. As the original version by Martin himself is anavailable, I thank Mark Shapiro for his work. I think its today the only version available. I regret only the frecnh of some singers is not perfect. Sometimes it is not understable due to a too much pronounced american accent. Nevermind I enjoy this recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this all about","review":"This must be the worst film in my collection poor acting no story line what so ever, I thought it would be good because of the line up, you had Cuban Link who is the only one who can act but he was hardly in the film and Angie & Fat Joe I'm not even going to start on there acting skill's or lack of, and the other actors just as bad, Don't wasted your money on this film if you don't belive me rent it first you will see, the only good thing was the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a rap movie","review":"(...) This film has a awful plot, and it also has some karate in which I thought was dumb for this type of film. There was a guy who looked like billy blanks wannabe. I also thought that it would have been more focused on the rappers in the film but instead it was about some stupid kids who somehow know karate, and the girls mom is 60 years old and she tries to be a major drug dealer, and her daughter is a crackhead who can't act or sing. It isn't worth to even get on bootleg or to rent dont let the cover fool you it is not worth your time.

I first read it in 6th grade. This young girl creates a fairyland in her meadow. She lives very close to nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I suppose these bars are nutritionally sound, but I found the taste lacking, the satisfaction wanting, the crispness crispy. The chocolate coating tasted artificial, almost bitter. There wasn't much of a peanut butter taste in there either. Don't think I'd want these again. To each his/her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes a useless one","review":"1. Most of it are just taken from online docs2. It does not deal with any of the advanced stuff like dependency management etc. ( part of it could be due to the old version of ant used )3. The worst part is that, it is not very friendly for a user. 80% os the book is dedicated to showing the java APIs used to implement ant ( that too like a cut paste manner ), rather than showing the xml syntax that a user will use.Yes its a waste. Buy the Erik Hatcher, Steve Loughran book which is the only good one available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Avoid such Duds","review":"I don't have much experience with O'reilly books. All I reffered was Prog C# which I found good. I have a friend who has this book. And fortunately, I got a good advice to not to buy this book. A better approach, I was told and have used, would be to download Ant and read the Documentation. Another would be to go for some other publisher( I heard Wrox has a good title on this, but I dont know the name)(I got this feedback from at least 3 People).Please spare us such duds in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Definitive 'Waste of Money'","review":"Considering all the Ant build possibilities, this book barely scratches the service. Half the book is nothing more than the API in alphabetical order. I would have liked to see examples that incorporated the optional Ant jar (JUnit), complex EJB builds, deployment on 3rd party application servers like Weblogic, and strategies dealing with multiple wars but these were no where to be found. It would have been nice if there was more discussion on best practices. In addition, the book is poorly written and reads like it was written overnight.This book should be titled \\"An introduction to Ant and nothing more.\\" I only wished that I saved my receipt. Go read 'Java Development With Ant'. It is far more comprehensive and 'Definitive'. At first I gave this book 2 stars but after reviewing 'Java Development With Ant' I realized this book was more lacking than I thought. Don't make the same mistake I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the Hatcher/Loughran book instead","review":"I love most of the O'Reilly books I have, but occasionally there's a dud, and this is one of them. It didn't tell me anything I didn't know from reading the Ant documentation. And it's already out of date, since it covers 1.4.1 rather than 1.5.Try the Manning book, \\"Java Development with Ant\\", by Steve Loughran and Erik Hatcher. It's better in every respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Its a shame, but this book is a real piece of junk. I don't know how long it took the authors to write, but it reads like it was thrown together in a frantic hurry. It also covers an older (1.4.x) version of Ant. Even worse a lot of this information is available from the Ant docs. To be fair this book does give you the basic information about how to use Ant, but it is far from a \\"definitive guide.\\" Hatcher's book is much better even though its published by Manning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Vampire, Excellent book.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - actually 3 books in one - as I do all of P.N. Elrod's work. If you like a smart sexy vampire who is not a \\"sloppy eater\\" and doesn't suffer from vampire angst either, this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but Dated","review":"Went back and tried rereading some of these stories. Wish I had kept my memories. This isn't terrible or anything like that. It is okay. The writing is very formula and certain to appeal to the formula driven magazines and readers. Once upon a time, it was original. Now, the genre has moved on. I'm hoping she has improved in her new books. Her books are in all the libraries so it would probably be a good idea to check those out before starting to build a library. For somebody who is living in the world she created, these flaws are probably not that important. Save your cash to spend on one of the many good new writers with fresh material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field Guide to the Global Economy","review":"This is an easy to read book that cuts through the use of economic jargon, and speaks to the reader in clear, concise, simple English. It examines both the positive and negative sides to globalization and avoids being biased. For visual learners, there are many charts, graphs, diagrams, and cartoons used to stress points and illustrate the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a grip on the globe (alization)","review":"There are two things that I really like about this book, in addtion to it being accessible to nearly everybody: 1) it is well cited. It is important for me to trust the statistics that I am reading, so that I can then feel empowered. And 2) the chapter 'Globalization Claims'. This chapter assesses 10 claims that supporters of globalization regularly pull out of their back pocket, holding up those claims to the light of day (the claims are often as thin and flimsy as cheese cloth)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for statistics, horrible for explaining.","review":"I had to read this book for my sociology class and googling the topics helped explain them better than the book did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good seat.","review":"I'm happy with the quality of this seat. It's very comfortable for a baby. The only thing that I don't like is how the yellow piece locks in the seat. It's not easy to unlock it and pull it up. So, it's not an easy thing to get your baby out of the seat. But on the other hand it means that the baby is safe there. I would recommend buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"Warning - this product is only the seat and ropes - it DOES NOT include the frame, even though it doesnt clearly state this.This is very, VERY expensive compared to other seats out there - although, when I looked at it, it seemed very sturdy and quality-made.Just take note about the lack of frame - this is the same as the other cheaper swing seats that is just a seat and rope.Sending it back and getting the Little Tikes castle swing set and slide for only $20 more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money!!!!","review":"I agree with the member above.I thought that the item was the full set as shown in the picture and not just the seat.The quality is no better than a seat for a third of the price.Get the Little Tikes Swing that is on here for $25!I feel mislead and ripped off! Returning this immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"I was very dissapointed when the swing arrived. It is just the seat and rope itself. It is 3 times the price for the same thing. It should have specified that the frams was not included. Returning it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a set! It is just a swing.","review":"I ended up returning this item because I was expected set, not just a swing. So I have no any opinion of that except content doesn't reflect claimed headline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always knew Nurses were smarter than doctors!","review":"This might be okay for some, but the fact is it's way too basic and limited. If you rely on it too much you're going to find yourself being escorted out your program. Too many former nursing classmates of mine used this book and they ended up failing the class, just be careful and stick with the textbook. (What the heck is farmacology??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly edited mistitled video","review":"This is one of the worst videos I have purchased. The video itself is poor quality with some of the scenes appearing to have been shot with a camcorder. The voice over is appalling and sounds like it has been put together in someones bedroom with second hand equipment. Some of the scenes have nothing to do with fights at all and are totally irrelevant to the title of the video itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, 3.5 stars","review":"\\"Krippendorf's Tribe\\" isn't Richard Dreyfuss's best movie to date, especially having released the stunning \\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" two years previous. Some of his lines were overreacted. Besides this, there are good elements in the movie. Some funny scenes will catch the audience's eyes. However, the borderline between fantasy and reality needed to be recognized by the producers. Despite, faking eyecatching \\"Shelmikedmu\\" rituals to gain national recognition is clever. Such scenes lead the audience to a surprising conclusion. Lily Tomlin plays the funny role that viewers either love or hate. Some of Jenna Elfman's lines were underreacted, but when she shines, she shines bright. Notice rising star Gregory Smith, the middle child. He's performed better, but his role was still underrated.Fans of certain actors in this movie should rent \\"Krippendorf's Tribe\\" once. Some mixed opinions about the outcome will arise, but everyone will be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun movie -- worthless DVD","review":"I've been looking forward to getting this movie on DVD for some time. But where are the specal features that make DVD almost worth the high prices they charge? How about complete English and French support (both audio and subtitles), audio commentaries, making of, deleted scenes / outtakes, cast info, etc.? I enjoy the humor of the script, the performances of the actors(/actresses), and the beauty of Jenna Elfman (amazing legs and other natural attributes...), but the lack of features will prevent me from buying this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a terrible movie","review":"Not funny and not believeable. It should be called Krippendorf's date rape...he gets her wasted so he can tape himself having sex with her...this is funny? And who believes she would fall for someone who could be her grandpa?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the 10 worst movies ever made.","review":"The premise of this movie, involving a hairbrained anthropology professor, a lusty grad student, some misappropriated grant funds and a completely invented tribe of New Guineans, is clever. Unfortunately, this movie (pardon what I'm about to say) chews up a good idea and regurgitates it onto the screen. The plot and directing is completely implausible from start to finish. The depiction of native New Guinean tribes is utterly fake, silly and Hollywoodized and, frankly, treats native peoples in an offensively stupid manner. The contrived comedic situations are almost never funny. I chuckled once or twice, but most of the time stared in disbelief at the poor taste and childishness of it all. This in spite of the fact that it has two very skilled actors. Which proves a timeless truth -- actors and their agents are almost always terrible judges of both scripts and directing. Unless you suffer from the same flaw, you will not enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"People just don't know humor when they hear it...","review":"As much as I don't care for Dreyfuss or Elfman, I really enjoyed this movie, and thats a shocker to everyone who knows me because I walked into the theater with my once normal \\"everything [is bad]\\" attitude; If I can think something's funny, anyone can. Do yourself a favor, ignore the cynical reviews everyone else says, THIS IS FUNNY STUFF!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found this book after years of searching!","review":"I read this book more than once when I was in elementary school. Over the years, I lost the title and have been searching everywhere for it. I'm so excited to see it's reprinted and still out there for kids to read. I'm also surprised to find out it's by one of my favorite childhood authors. I loved \\"The Indian in the Cupboard\\" as well. I would recommend this to any child, or adult, who loves fantasy. There are some parts that are a little scary if I remember correctly though. I still have to reread it : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"My fifth grade teacher read aloud to our class. It was a very fun book that she read, not boring.

Now, I am a sophomore in college and when I think of this book, I smile. I still name it as one of my favorite books.I definitely would recommend this to any child.The reading makes you use your imagination and wish you were in the story. I always loved the gifts given to the girl. This book is extremely entertaining and well worth the time, plus one you will always remember"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Story","review":"The reviews I read for this book must have caused me to expect something great. In actuality, the storyline was weak the characters were flat, and the overall effect was unsatisfying. There are some truly fantastic young people fiction stories out there, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Frankowski book I've read","review":"I've read all but one Of Leo Frankowski's books, and I've liked them enough that I buy anything new that he writes without thinking twice. But the last two that I have read (The War With Earth and The Fata Morgana) have been far less enjoyable than than the rest.A Boy and His Tank (now renamed: Kren of the Mitchegai) was a much better book (apart from teh ending, which no one likes). So don't just go out and buy this book because you liked that one.My main complaint with this book is that (as other reviewers have pointed out) everything goes so unbelievably in the main character's favor that you read the entire book thinking that the whole thing is just a \\"dream\\". Everything just comes too easy.This book just wasn't worth the time to read it. Go buy a different Frankowski book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The publishing dog of Franktowski","review":"First off, I love Frankowski's works- I adored his \\"Lord Conrad\\" series and I literally stumbled over the \\"Boy and his tank\\" series by accident. \\"Boy and his Tank\\" was wonderful. The second one in the series was disjoined, poor in rhythm. \\"The War with Earth\\" massivly sucked- had to literally force myself to finish the book as I had my own internal war to deal with. (Curosity vs lameness of Franks writing). I had been told 40 years ago in high school that sequels usually sucked- after seeing many sequels, most of which I enjoyed, this one was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Military SF Light Entertainment","review":"The previous reviewers tend to either love or hate this book. I fall into the love it category. I have read most of the better known military SF by authors such as David Weber, Elizabeth Moon, John Ringo, S.M. Stirling, etc., and I think that if you like those authors, you will probably like this book.It is definitely is a little juvenile at times, but take it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful.","review":"I am a fan of military sci-fi (particularly David Weber and John Ringo). I have never reviewed a book for Amazon before but this book was so bad that I felt compelled to share my opinion with other readers of the genre. How bad is it? It hurts to read it! The characters are caricatures and the story is full of so many stereotypes that it is silly. There is no suspense to the story and no sense of danger in the plot. If I could give it \\"no stars\\", I would. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fim with Bud Cort.","review":"Was not sure wht to expect when I ordered this film. Harold and Maude was a classic.

As you listen to it more and more, however, this CD jumps right to the top of your library as a fundmentally strong, adrenaline pumping album. I highly recommend it, and I also recommend seeing this band live. The other reviews are excellent samples of just how important this band is. They are one of the best indie bands out there, and they come from the same area that Hum is from (which is cool in itself). There are a couple of tracks that are less than spectacular, but every cd has songs that you need to listen a little more to for more perspective on what the Poster Children were trying to accomplish with this CD. I also think everyone should own the Just Like You EP as well.

But there is a lot of self-serving prose and a general attack on two centuries of Christian scholars who have found the capturing of the \\"historical Jesus\\" a difficult if not impossible task.

This cd is the worst in a long line of sorry, wannabe neo-soul \\"singers\\" that think reciting lame-ass poetry over ripped off funk riffs and hip-hop classics is grounds for music. Don't get me wrong - some of the tracks are tight but they are all ultimately ruined by the overbearing montone voice of the lead \\"singer\\". Get a grip buddy.

This is a page turner and I guarantee you won't be able to put it down once you pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This so called fiction book starts by saying that the chronology has been altered and that some characters are composites? Is it a true story or is a work of fiction based on actual events. I started reading the book but gave up due to the wishy-washy waffle. Margie Danielsen needs to go back to whatever she was doing before she started writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story in need of Good Writer","review":"It is a shame that such an interesting story was so poorly written. Ms. Danielsen would have been better served to have gotten the assistance of Anne Rice or another experienced author of true crime books. This is one of the worst pieces of writing I have ever come across. In addition, it is very melodramatic and inexplicably written in the third person. The fact that it is such an interesting story makes it more of a shame that Ms. Danielsen is such a poor writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Thought this was a poorly written book. I'm all about drama but this was just sappy. Talk about denial! That woman put not only herself but her children in an HORRIBLE situation because she just couldnt get it together! Would have been gone!!! I've read almost 100 true crime books and this is on the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"This collection of short fiction, on the whole, shows little of the wit and scholarship which characterize Willis' most popular works. The title story, about a time traveller exploring London during the Blitz, would have seemed original if the novel \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" didn't cover that same material more winningly. (Get \\"...Dog\\" for sure; it's great.) The other stories see Willis trying her hand at the supernatural, at sci-fi updates of historic figures, coming-of-age vignettes, and nuclear apocalypse, etc. None of it was terrible, but none of it gave me the feeling of her novels \\"Bellwether\\" or \\"Doomsday Book\\" that I couldn't wait to share her with my reading friends. This collection is primarily of historical interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Light to Dark","review":"I'm not a big short story fan, but I started on Fire Watch, the first story in the book, because I had just read Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog and had heard this was in the same universe. I think the three most memorable ones aside from the title story, are Blued Moon, Service for the Dead and All My Daughters. The first is almost light and fun. The second is horror with a good twist and the third is far future boarding school. All three deal with relationships where at least one male character is a cad.Her intoduction to Mail-Order Clone gave us the fascinating information that she used to write stories for True Confessions magazines.Rather good collection to go with her longer works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Kindle edition","review":"Willis' work is fabulous. However, the Kindle edition does her a great disservice. It is replete with missing words, erroneous punctuation, and typos.For shame, Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"If I could give this zero stars I would.

However, constant errors have made my reading experience quite distracting; tons of missed punctuation & multiple misspellings. I'm not sure I'm going to invest my time to finish the book. I'm disappointed at having paid $6+ for this product. In the future I will check reviews more carefully to avoid similiar reading disasters. This is definitely a \\"buyer beware\\" circumstance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories, but Kindle transfer rife with typos","review":"I was delighted to buy some great stories by my favorite author -- other reviewers have described them wonderfully, so I won't repeat that. My only gripe is that it seems no one proofed the transfer of the text to Kindle format. I counted an average of one mistake every two Kindle pages. For example the word \\"burn\\" was often ported with the \\"rn\\" interpreted as an \\"m\\" -- rendering the otherwise scary prospect of incendiaries burning the Cathedral into the more amusing \\"buming\\" of the Cathedral. Although I was mostly able to read around these errors, given the purchase price, I would have appreciated cursory edit by someone empowered to fix these frequent and distracting typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I recently read Willis' Blackout (which was phenomenal!) and was eager to read some of her older works. I picked up Fire Watch for Kindle and got to reading. The title story is mediocre at best. It was hard to follow and I wasn't loving it, but in the end, it's been one of the better stories. I believe I'm still deeply disturbed by \\"All My Darling Daughters,\\" and wish I had never read it.The Kindle version is riddled with typos. I is CCI in several spots, rn's are m's and so forth and so on, that it's extremely distracting and difficult to follow.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Fast shipping and the book came in perfect condition.

He calls it \\"telescopic vision.\\" The book offers good insights into why we do it, the damage it does in organizations, and that we should avoid it. But that's the book. A lot of words are spent giving examples and waxing on this point. There is so much more to conflict resolution than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Tight, Honest, and did I say POWERFUL!?","review":"From the first notes of my first hearing of this this disc, I became hooked on Rollins Band. The first three songs just pull you in and build. There's some great playing on this record, and the whole effect is so visceral and genuine, it makes you want to scream along with it. If you like heavy, soulful, powerful music, listen to this disc. It's not for everyone, but this is one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the heavest out of 4 rollins cd i got #1","review":"low self opinion great the only problem with my cd is that #10 skips like hell, and it always starts when i get into it"},{"rating":"2","title":"100% raw & uninhibited emotion with a brain attached...","review":"The songs \\"You Didn't Need\\" and \\"Almost Real\\" are my two favorite love songs of all time. Rollins is most known for his expressions of rage, but I see him as a profound romantic. On these two songs he expresses the true essence of the horrible damage \\"love\\" can do. It somehow helps to know that a guy as cool as Henry is capable of having his heart crushed. Although the album lacks the solid warmth and groove of Melvin Gibbs on bass (he joined the band on their following 2 CDs), it is in my opinion one of the Top 20 rock albums in music history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial breakthrough, artistic lowpoint","review":"Here, for his first major label release, Rollins bottoms out. \\"The End Of Silence\\" explores all the worst aspects of \\"Hard Volume\\", meaning that long, slow, dirge like songs that plod along with no excitement whatsoever dominate the record.Only \\"Low Self Opinion\\" and \\"Tearing\\" show any signs of life and vitality at all. Rollins tries valiantly to carry the rest with his intensity, but falls short of his goal.If you're a fan of his sludgefests, then this CD is definitely for you, if not, then \\"The End Of Silence\\" isn't the place to start for novices..it's more like the place to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end of talent","review":"Holy cow does this cd suck. A recent article in a national newspaper indicated that Rollins had visited Australia 25 times. Makes you wonder who the hells forking out money over and over again. I can understand the speaking gigs getting an audience but his music is a dull wall of sound with as much melody as a 20 year old washing machine. Ten cd's or so of screaming angst with a few distorted echoes and a slight rap style every so often to appeal to god knows who else. Before making your next cd Rollins have a good stiff drink, and place a self imposed ban on yourself from posing in front of the mirror. Give me a smiths cd anyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gigantic, massive, rock power!!!","review":"damn, what a brute force this album is. the testosterome just oozes from the speakers when listening to this album. this is an album to listen to if you are a severely depressed body builder. ha,ha! just kidding... but seriously, this album does put the concept of productive mental pain into action. I would hate it if Henry was a happy, cheerful guy who loved everyone. but what's great about this album is not only Rollins' no-b.s. reality lyrics, but the music is also a pretty massive entity on it's own. Chris' guitar playing is truly original and unique, yet it is blistering and rocking at the same time. Andrew's bass is like f*cking Godzilla! a crushing monstrosity that sounds like a cross between Lemmy and Geezer Butler on speed. and Sim's drumming is truly a work of art. he is the master of the balance of graceful subtlety, and massive bombast. all in all, a very angry, emotionally painful, slab of brutal rock power."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Energy power music","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this is like harder King Crimson (who rule themselves). Chris Haskett on guitar is a METALLIC VIRTUOSO, pure and simple. Cain and Weiss on drums and bass are excellent, the power trio just RIPS it up on this, the best of Rollins' solo efforts. This is power music, why does it make my hands turn into fists?? I always thought the band should have done some more of the faster paced numbers, as opposed to the bone crushing stuff, but its all good. This is a good one to put on before (or after) you have to listen to a bunch of your co-workers whine about this or that, too bad Mr. Rollins couldn't come in and give them a piece of his mind!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All gimic, no show","review":"This umbrella looks great but given a good gust - folds like a little paper in front of a freight train.

A great sander for most work, but still not the only sander I need and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hop, Skip and Jump","review":"I was disappointed with the performance of the sander. It was difficult to control -- it usually hopped, skipped and jumped across the piece I was trying to sand unless I only used the edge of the disk. The sanding action was not as aggressive as I had hoped. I have pretty much reverted back to using my belt sander for rough sanding and my Dewalt ROS for the finish work. I also found the unit uncomfortable to hold. The vacuum hose seemed to be in the way. I actually wind up holding the vacuum hose and the screw-on handle while operating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well for me.","review":"I am very disappointed with this sander. I thought it would work great for sanding large table tops. Instead I have found that a large belt sander (4x24) followed by a finishing sander does a much better and quicker job. I have the Porter Cable 4x24 sander and the Porter Cable 330 finishing sander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sander; useless dust collection","review":"Though I haven't used this sander very much yet, it seems to do a nice job sanding. One thing I'm convinced of is that the dust collection is essentially useless. I've examined the dust path for blockage and found it clear.

This is just a blow by blow repeat: same number of guys, 3, (instead of a doctor they made one of them a nurse), it also involved a road trip, also on a river, also in the woods, also trying to get a fire started, also needed fish for dinner, also about getting/finding money, also involved 2 tree huggers who also happened to be women and yes, there was also a hermit. And hooray, excrement was also involved! That, and 2 guys with guns trying to kill them. Deja vu, what are the odds? (I don't want to suggest plagiarism but if I wrote the script for the first movie and not the second, I'd sue.)

He's hot and a good actor, thats the only way I made it through the whole movie. Although his use of an American accent was well done, I prefer his cockney-english accent (His natural accent). The movie left so many questions unanswered the scenes seemed scattered and unfinished. Most of the acting was awful (Except Oliver James, he was good)and the lines were poorly delivered. It sounded like they were reading lines directly from the script in a monotone voice. I can see why it went directly to DVD.

Although he pays extensive tribute to the Sufi musical tradition, he covers a wide range of Middle Eastern music, from \\"Gawazi\\" (which perfectly captures the sound of the Egyptian gypsy entertainers), to the more Central Asian-feeling \\"Caspian Winds.\\" \\"Old Man's Dance\\" is spunky and dignified at the same time. And if you're a belly dancer, \\"Fly Away\\" is a great veils piece. I found the final track rather vague and airy (especially compared to some of his later work in the same vein, e.g., the conclusion of \\"Mystical Garden\\"), but it's pleasant to listen to. Tekbilek is a wonderful musician, as are all his collaborators, and they deliver masterful performances. Keane generally keeps his electronics in a tasteful supporting role rather than getting in the way of the traditional instruments. This is an album I'll definitely play often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"relaxing and harmonic oriental music.would touch your soul and would take you far a way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is UGH!","review":"This book is simply filled with historical mistakes (might I suggest the author spend some time on The Georgian Index or join The Beau Monde?). I'm beginning to wonder if there's any room in the romance industry for real history, of if \\"history salad\\" is now considered good enough. It's really no wonder most people don't take the genre seriously. I really want to read romances (I'm addicted to the happy ending) but the poor attention to historical detail is driving me away.

The tracks did not announce what lesson/page they were referring to so it made it confusing if you picked track 15 and needed to know what page it referred to. Also, it would be helpful if there were more tracks with more conversations. I agree with a couple other users who mentioned the lack coverage on declensions (cuz I had no idea what they were till now).The best part is that the exercises in the book have the answers!

There is no evidence that Elliot Waves have any predictive ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precisely What I Expected","review":"I saw the other reviews for this product. People seemed truly outraged and disgusted by this book and had terrible things to say about the authors. To them, I ask \\"What did you expect?\\" This book is exactly what I thought it would be - a great deal of fluff and speculation about Brad, Jennifer and their lives together. What struck me about this book was how I could read over 200 pages and end up knowing so little. It seems to me that this is VERY typical of a certain kind of reportage (and I use the word advisedly). I find the whole celebrity fascination fascinating and this seemed to me an excellent specimen and case study. With all that said, the content of the book seemed remarkably superficial and vacuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Book","review":"I came across this book in Barnes and Noble the other day and I must say I was horrified. The title alone is enough to make we want to write a letter to US Weekly and ask why in the world they hired those writers. Anyone who thinks about buying this book should ask themselves two very important questions \\"Do I care?\\", \\"Should I care?\\" If you're somewhat intelligent your answers to both of those questions will be NO and you'll put the book back on the shelf and feel bad the rest of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable","review":"I wonder what kind of person revels enough in another's private anguish to buy this rubbish.The authors and publishers should be ashamed of themselves.(To comment on this item one must check at least 1 star, unfortunately.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA OHHHH MY.....","review":"I piked up this book after seeing John Stewart \\"Review\\" it on the Daily Show. It's funny only because the author takes it so seriously, when it is clearly so ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but ...","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this book very helpful, especially considering the price I paid. The book is essentially a PowerPoint course presentation published with the notes pages as text. Unfortunately, the book is laid out so that the reader must make the connection between the text and the slide itself (they're stacked side-by-side with no separation). Often, the text discusses the material as though the instructor had a pointer in hand to make the connection -- without those visual clues the argument is hard to follow. On the other hand, if you know nothing about survival analysis and only want to run computer programs (specifically SPIDA) and read the output, I guess this book isn't bad. I'll keep looking for a good textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a self-learning survival analysis text","review":"An outstanding book from the same authors that wrote the Logistic Regression self-learning text. Provides excellent descriptions of the methods with examples and details the theory in an understandable way. You really could learn basic survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Log-Rank, Cox Regression, etc) with this book alone. It also included instructions for using SAS and Stata which is very helpful. I prefer this text over Hosmer and Lemeshow for 'usability'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written, Poorly Conceived","review":"This book struck almost every single one of my biggest peeves about texts. Numbers written out as words: this is, essentially, a mathematics book. We don't like letters, we like numbers, and writing out \\"thirteen point five\\" is only outdone by the obnoxiousness of writing out whole equations in the text. Readers who need to be told that \\"X-3/ln(X+5)\\" means \\"x plus three divided by the natural log of x plus five\\" should probably not be using this text.Second, the details of examples are sparsely filled, and examples don't go all the way through. Many of them are great for theoretical concepts, like how a statistic works, but give no hint as to how one might actually employ it. Page after page of SAS, STATA, and SPIDA output are useless without the accompanying code to create them.The index is astoundingly cursory. It's really hard to find anything.Frankly a worthless text, I'm glad I bought it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Aloha From Hawaii","review":"I ordered this as a gift and had it delivered to the recipient.

After blasting a home, we hand sand the entire exterior using random orbit sanders. I've used the Porter Cable primarily for the last year. I've gone through 6 sanders during this time and each one has had the exact same failure.....the on/off switch. I've torn them apart and cleaned them, but if you look at the switch design, it is incredibly flimsy and poorly designed. The motor is great and the machine is great if they would FIX THE *&^*&%@ SWITCH! I'm currently looking hard for another brand to replace these faulty sanders."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 6 sanders I own!!","review":"I will now be able to put the other 5 sanders away.I have 2 belt sanders that will go though stock a bit faster but are much more difficult to control and with just one false move severe damage is the result. While the 7336 is just a bit slower it is a breeze to control. A big feature for me was the veritable speed as different wood requires different settings to maximize stock removal. I have not only been impressed with its ability to remove stock but also to put a glass finish on a surface. The hard maple dresser that I recently completed was the first test for a smooth finish and the 7336 scored a perfect 5 in my book. I would recommend this sander to everyone looking to purchase only one sander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter-Cable 7336","review":"This is a very nice unit. Works great. Would have given it 5 stars but I am afraid that the bearings may burn out relatively quickly. I've had problems with them in the past so I tried a more expensive Bosch unit. What a piece of junk. It burnt out in 2 months of light use (wet-sanding). Repaired under warranty and burnt out again 9 months later with MAYBE once a week use. I'll stick with the Porter-Cable from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sander!","review":"I have had the 7336 for 10-13 years and I too have stopped using my belt sander. It removes stock rapidly, yet is easy to control which is great when being used by unskilled employees. I have had problems with the switch. I think it gets fouled with the dust as I \\"fixed\\" it one time just by blowing the switch with compressed air for 30 seconds. I think I'll buy a couple of switches. They appear easy to replace. Last note: a 5\\" disk is only 70% of the size of a 6\\" disk, so you have a lot less abrasive on the work surface. btw, I have large hands and don't grip the tool too tightly - no problem with my wrists...This is a follow up. The problem was caused by worn out brushes-blush-not the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch for wrist injury with this tool!","review":"I have had one of these for quite some time, having acquired it during my apprenticeship in custom furniture shop. I love its power and speed of finishing, finding it quite capable of putting a flawless surface on glued panels.However, I used this tool to the point of acquiring tendon damage in my wrists. Following multiple cortisone injections in both wrists (boy, that hurts!), I had to have surgery on my right wrist to repair the damage. I took my tools to my physical therapist, and she declared it the culprit. My mentor borrowed it for 6 months, and had to return it because of the wrist pain.The barrel design of the body causes an unnatural strain on the wrists. Its a powerful tool, but minimize the operating time.Take if from someone who knows wood, tools, and pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after very little use","review":"I had this thing for awhile before I really started to use it. I bought it based on the reviews I read here. I used it to sand spackling off plaster walls, about 5 rooms worth.

Following suit with its predessors -- Irish Gold, Irish Whiskey, etc., -- Irish Love involves the solving of two mysteries -- one from the present and one from the past. The reader, therefore, can enjoy two stories for the price of one. There is not a dull paragraph in the book -- loyal Nuala/Dermot fans won't even have to pore through a recap of previous adventures and history of their relationship. However, this information is incorporated subtly into the next, allowing new readers to become acquainted with -- and new fans of -- the duo quickly.

Stylistically as well, Werth's journalism is excellent; his prose is perfectly lucid, readily understandable, extremely readable and a model of exposition. This book's one of the best on the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author saw the war","review":"I read both volums of this book, in a tranlation to the portuguese, here in Brazil.Hundreds of pages, all writen for a man who live and saw the facts.Alexander Werth saw the war.He was there.This book wasn't writen, by a scholar living today, using only old papers,old videos and his imagination.Alexarder Werth was a russophile?Yes, but we must realize that Russia was the nation that defeat both Hitler and Napoleon.Hitler lost about 7 millions militaries, form Soviet Union, against less than 2 millions from all more than 20 allies armies together.The World War II in Europe was decided by Soviet Union.Not that I'm not a communist.In fact I'm a deeply anti-comunist, unemployed agronomist and brazilian.There are problems with this book?Yes, it has no new discoveries from former Soviet Union files.And it's very long,but remains authorizative.I still have both volums of this book, in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much Danger!","review":"I watched two episodes and a pattern emerged. Dr. Danger visits places as any tourist would, emphasizing the largely missing \\"danger\\" aspect. The Yemen episode was sort of entertaining but I am not sure whether this was intentional. After visiting a restaurant and guys who jump over camels, Dr. Danger decided to climb a mountain. The mountain seemed pretty small and unchallenging, but Dr. Danger managed to lose grip and slide down a couple of meters, dislocating his shoulder. The cameraman had climbed the same path seconds before with his presumably bulky camera, and Dr. Danger did not carry anything, so I think Dr. Danger is a bit clumsier than his cameraman. The last ten minutes of the episode depicted the pain and suffering of Dr. Danger and his arrival in the local hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...this is bad","review":"this has to be one of the worst tv shows i have seen in a long time - this guy is a journalist? he comes off as a pompous foreigner wearing khakis and a blue blazer who inserts the word 'dangerous' into every other sentence. he is trying to make the audience believe that he is some sort of thrill seeker journalist when in fact his insincerity and melodramatics make it seem all about him, not the story. i am sure that the situation on the ground in Somalia is dangerous but i felt like he was making too much of an effort to follow 'danger' instead of the real story. it was difficult to watch such horribly inept reporting and even as entertainment, this just does not hold up. to sum it up in one word: horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and different","review":"I am not a fan of most television.

This album represents a great moment in time when her music moved from old time country recreation (The Virginian, although a great album on its own) to a true development of her own influences from country's darker side along with her own talent for spinning tales from the Northwest. The songs are all steeped in longing and heartache in a way that echoes her influences without merely copying them. Standouts are 'Twist the Knife' and the soulful title track 'Furnace Room Lullaby' along with a heartbreaking song about the loss of her own on 'South Tacoma Way'. Definitely a must have album from her overall catalog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Don't even waste ur time buying or even 4 that matter","review":"listening to this album!

In general country music is one of my least favourite genres, but this CD keeps inviting me back for repeated spins. Neko Case's voice is full of spirit and strength, and her rotating backing band is consistently excellent. However, the most attractive thing to me about this disc is the diversity of moods that the songwriting effortlessly traverses over the course of just a few tracks. There's the downright rockin' \\"Set Out Running\\", the lovely mood of \\"Porchlight\\" (the song lives up to the hazy mystique of its title), and the wildly varying rhythms of \\"Mood to Burn Bridges\\". I'm a big fan of challenging song structures (eg. Shannon Wright's Maps of Tacit), and this album delivers, offering hidden delights that keep unfolding."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sophomore release","review":"What I liked the most: wonderful songs, unique singing voice, variation in tempo, the presence of Kelly Hogan on several cuts.What I didn't like: The cover material was sooo good on the last CD, it makes me wish Neko covered a chestnut or two here.

She trusts all the wrong creatures, even though she suspected them at one point. The hero, Eduard D'Arcy, doesn't see through a transparent revenge plot until the last chapter of the book.If there is one thing that I hate more than a story written by an author who pounds the reader over the head with an obvious plot, it is an author who creates characters so thick headed that THEY have to have the plot spoon fed to them.

Ever since then I have collected every Aztec Camera album, single, extended version, b-side and collectible available. However I am completely disappointed with his last two efforts, \\"Surf\\" and especially, \\"Western Skies.\\" It doesn't sound like he has anything to shout about anymore.
